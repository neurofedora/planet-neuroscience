<p>Rosy bitterling brain at 165 hours postfertilization. Tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT in this very early stage. Three-dimensional visualization with microCT scanning protocols is extremely useful for the study of the rosy bitterling and provides an updating of imaging modalities for morphological and anatomical analyses in this nonmodel organism.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bitterlings are carp-like teleost fish (Cypriniformes: Acheilanathidae) known for their specialized brood parasitic lifestyle. Bitterling embryos, in fact, develop inside the gill chamber of their freshwater mussel hosts. However, little is known about how their parasitic lifestyle affects brain development in comparison to nonparasitic species. Here, we document the development of the brain of the rosy bitterling, <i>Rhodeus ocellatus</i>, at four embryonic stages of 165, 185, 210, 235 hours postfertilization (hpf) using micro-computed tomography (microCT). Focusing on developmental regionalization and brain ventricular organization, we relate the development of the brain divisions to those described for zebrafish using the prosomeric model as a reference paradigm. Segmentation and three-dimensional visualization of the ventricular system allowed us to identify changes in the longitudinal brain axis as a result of cephalic flexure during development. The results show that during early embryonic and larval development, histological differentiation, tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT. The results of this study visualized with differential CT profiles are broadly consistent with comparable histological studies, and with the genoarchitecture of teleosts like the zebrafish. Compared to the zebrafish, our study identifies distinct developmental heterochronies in the rosy bitterling, such as a precocious development of the inferior lobe.</p>

	<p>The current study was conducted to examine the percentages of cognitive skills deficits among Chinese children with developmental dyslexia. Via a systematic review, we collated twenty-two available studies on the proportion of cognitive skills deficits, including phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, morphological awareness, orthographic knowledge, short-term memory and working memory, and visual and motor skills deficits, among Chinese children with developmental dyslexia. The results of a meta-analysis showed that the rapid automatized naming deficits are the core deficit of developmental dyslexia among Chinese children, with a pooled percentage of 44%. This is followed by orthographic knowledge deficits (43%), phonological awareness deficits (41%), morphological awareness deficits (40%), visual and motor skills deficits (33%), and short-term memory and working memory deficits (25%). At the same time, we compared the proportions of different locations, ages, standards and control groups.</p>

	<p>Working memory (WM) plays an important role in cognitive activity. The WM system is used to temporarily store information in learning and decision-making. WM always functions in many aspects of daily life, such as the short-term memory of words, cell phone verification codes, and cell phone numbers. In young adults, studies have shown that a central memory store is limited to three to five meaningful items. Little is known about how WM functions at the microscopic neural level, but appropriate neural network computational models can help us gain a better understanding of it. In this study, we attempt to design a microscopic neural network model to explain the internal mechanism of WM. The performance of existing positive feedback models depends on the parameters of a synapse. We use a negative-derivative feedback mechanism to counteract the drift in persistent activity, making the hybrid positive and negative-derivative feedback (HPNF) model more robust to common disturbances. To fulfill the mechanism of WM at the neural circuit level, we construct two main neural networks based on the HPNF model: a memory-storage sub-network (the memory-storage sub-network is composed of several sets of neurons, so we call it &amp;amp;ldquo;SET network&amp;amp;rdquo;, or &amp;amp;ldquo;SET&amp;amp;rdquo; for short) with positive feedback and negative-derivative feedback and a storage distribution network (SDN) designed by combining SET for memory item storage and memory updating. The SET network is a neural information self-sustaining mechanism, which is robust to common disturbances; the SDN constructs a storage distribution network at the neural circuit level; the experimental results show that our network can fulfill the storage, association, updating, and forgetting of information at the level of neural circuits, and it can work in different individuals with little change in parameters.</p>

	<p>Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a novel non-invasive treatment option for different diseases and symptoms, such as epilepsy or depression. Its mechanism of action, however, is still not fully understood. We investigated short-term taVNS-induced changes of local and global properties of EEG-derived, evolving functional brain networks from eighteen subjects who underwent two 1 h stimulation phases (morning and afternoon) during continuous EEG-recording. In the majority of subjects, taVNS induced measurable modifications of network properties. Network alterations induced by stimulation in the afternoon were clearly more pronounced than those induced by stimulation in the morning. Alterations mostly affected the networks&amp;amp;rsquo; topology and stability properties. On the local network scale, no clear-cut spatial stimulation-related patterns could be discerned. Our findings indicate that the possible impact of diurnal influences on taVNS-induced network modifications would need to be considered for future research and clinical studies of this non-pharmaceutical intervention approach.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcriptomically-Guided Pharmacological Experiments in Neocortical and Hippocampal NPY-Positive GABAergic Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cortical GABAergic interneurons have been shown to fulfil important roles by inhibiting excitatory principal neurons. Recent transcriptomic studies have confirmed seminal discoveries that used anatomic and electrophysiological methods highlighting the existence of multiple different classes of GABAergic interneurons. Although some of these studies have emphasized that inter-regional differences may exist for a given class, the extent of such differences remains unknown. To address this problem, we used single-cell Patch-RNAseq to characterize neuropeptide Y (NPY)-positive GABAergic interneurons in superficial layers of the primary auditory cortex (AC) and in distal layers of area CA3 in mice. We found that more than 300 genes are differentially expressed in NPY-positive neurons between these two brain regions. For example, the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) auxiliary subunit Shisa9/CKAMP44 and the 5HT2a receptor (5HT2aR) are significantly higher expressed in auditory NPY-positive neurons. These findings guided us to perform pharmacological experiments that revealed a role for 5HT2aRs in auditory NPY-positive neurons. Specifically, although the application of 5HT led to a depolarization of both auditory and CA3 NPY-positive neurons, the 5HT2aR antagonist ketanserin only reversed membrane potential changes in auditory NPY-positive neurons. Our study demonstrates the potential of single-cell transcriptomic studies in guiding directed pharmacological experiments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Validating a Computational Framework for Ionic Electrodiffusion with Cortical Spreading Depression as a Case Study</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of pronounced depolarization of brain tissue accompanied by substantial shifts in ionic concentrations and cellular swelling. Here, we validate a computational framework for modeling electrical potentials, ionic movement, and cellular swelling in brain tissue during CSD. We consider different model variations representing wild-type (WT) or knock-out/knock-down mice and systematically compare the numerical results with reports from a selection of experimental studies. We find that the data for several CSD hallmarks obtained computationally, including wave propagation speed, direct current shift duration, peak in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration as well as a pronounced shrinkage of extracellular space (ECS) are well in line with what has previously been observed experimentally. Further, we assess how key model parameters including cellular diffusivity, structural ratios, membrane water and/or K<sup>+</sup> permeabilities affect the set of CSD characteristics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Calcium modeling of spine apparatus-containing human dendritic spines demonstrates an “all-or-nothing” communication switch between the spine head and dendrite</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James Rosado, Viet Duc Bui, Carola A. Haas, Jürgen Beck, Gillian Queisser, Andreas Vlachos</p>

Dendritic spines are highly dynamic neuronal compartments that control the synaptic transmission between neurons. Spines form ultrastructural units, coupling synaptic contact sites to the dendritic shaft and often harbor a spine apparatus organelle, composed of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which is responsible for calcium sequestration and release into the spine head and neck. The spine apparatus has recently been linked to synaptic plasticity in adult human cortical neurons. While the morphological heterogeneity of spines and their intracellular organization has been extensively demonstrated in animal models, the influence of spine apparatus organelles on critical signaling pathways, such as calcium-mediated dynamics, is less well known in human dendritic spines. In this study we used serial transmission electron microscopy to anatomically reconstruct nine human cortical spines in detail as a basis for modeling and simulation of the calcium dynamics between spine and dendrite. The anatomical study of reconstructed human dendritic spines revealed that the size of the postsynaptic density correlates with spine head volume and that the spine apparatus volume is proportional to the spine volume. Using a newly developed simulation pipeline, we have linked these findings to spine-to-dendrite calcium communication. While the absence of a spine apparatus, or the presence of a purely passive spine apparatus did not enable any of the reconstructed spines to relay a calcium signal to the dendritic shaft, the calcium-induced calcium release from this intracellular organelle allowed for finely tuned “all-or-nothing” spine-to-dendrite calcium coupling; controlled by spine morphology, neck plasticity, and ryanodine receptors. Our results suggest that spine apparatus organelles are strategically positioned in the neck of human dendritic spines and demonstrate their potential relevance to the maintenance and regulation of spine-to-dendrite calcium communication.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiple nutrient transporters enable cells to mitigate a rate-affinity tradeoff</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luis Fernando Montaño-Gutierrez, Kevin Correia, Peter S. Swain</p>

Eukaryotic genomes often encode multiple transporters for the same nutrient. For example, budding yeast has 17 hexose transporters (HXTs), all of which potentially transport glucose. Using mathematical modelling, we show that transporters that use either facilitated diffusion or symport can have a rate-affinity tradeoff, where an increase in the maximal rate of transport decreases the transporter’s apparent affinity. These changes affect the import flux non-monotonically, and for a given concentration of extracellular nutrient there is one transporter, characterised by its affinity, that has a higher import flux than any other. Through encoding multiple transporters, cells can therefore mitigate the tradeoff by expressing those transporters with higher affinities in lower concentrations of nutrients. We verify our predictions using fluorescent tagging of seven HXT genes in budding yeast and follow their expression over time in batch culture. Using the known affinities of the corresponding transporters, we show that their regulation in glucose is broadly consistent with a rate-affinity tradeoff: as glucose falls, the levels of the different transporters peak in an order that mostly follows their affinity for glucose. More generally, evolution is constrained by tradeoffs. Our findings indicate that one such tradeoff often occurs in the cellular transport of nutrients.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Antithetic effect of interferon-α on cell-free and cell-to-cell HIV-1 infection</a></h4>

In HIV-1-infected individuals, transmitted/founder (TF) virus contributes to establish new infection and expands during the acute phase of infection, while chronic control (CC) virus emerges during the chronic phase of infection. TF viruses are more resistant to interferon-alpha (IFN-α)-mediated antiviral effects than CC virus, however, its virological relevance in infected individuals remains unclear. Here we perform an experimental-mathematical investigation and reveal that IFN-α strongly inhibits cell-to-cell infection by CC virus but only weakly affects that by TF virus. Surprisingly, IFN-α enhances cell-free infection of HIV-1, particularly that of CC virus, in a virus-cell density-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that LY6E, an IFN-stimulated gene, can contribute to the density-dependent enhancement of cell-free HIV-1 infection. Altogether, our findings suggest that the major difference between TF and CC viruses can be explained by their resistance to IFN-α-mediated inhibition of cell-to-cell infection and their sensitivity to IFN-α-mediated enhancement of cell-free infection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Distinguishing excess mutations and increased cell death based on variant allele frequencies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gergely Tibély, Dominik Schrempf, Imre Derényi, Gergely J. Szöllősi</p>

Tumors often harbor orders of magnitude more mutations than healthy tissues. The increased number of mutations may be due to an elevated mutation rate or frequent cell death and correspondingly rapid cell turnover, or a combination of the two. It is difficult to disentangle these two mechanisms based on widely available bulk sequencing data, where sequences from individual cells are intermixed and, thus, the cell lineage tree of the tumor cannot be resolved. Here we present a method that can simultaneously estimate the cell turnover rate and the rate of mutations from bulk sequencing data. Our method works by simulating tumor growth and finding the parameters with which the observed data can be reproduced with maximum likelihood. Applying this method to a real tumor sample, we find that both the mutation rate and the frequency of death may be high.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Micro-dissection and integration of long and short reads to create a robust catalog of kidney compartment-specific isoforms</a></h4>

Studying isoform expression at the microscopic level has always been a challenging task. A classical example is kidney, where glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments carry out drastically different physiological functions and thus presumably their isoform expression also differs. We aim at developing an experimental and computational pipeline for identifying isoforms at microscopic structure-level. We microdissected glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments from healthy human kidney tissues from two cohorts. The two compartments were separately sequenced with the PacBio RS II platform. These transcripts were then validated using transcripts of the same samples by the traditional Illumina RNA-Seq protocol, distinct Illumina RNA-Seq short reads from European Renal cDNA Bank (ERCB) samples, and annotated GENCODE transcript list, thus identifying novel transcripts. We identified 14,739 and 14,259 annotated transcripts, and 17,268 and 13,118 potentially novel transcripts in the glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments, respectively. Of note, relying solely on either short or long reads would have resulted in many erroneous identifications. We identified distinct pathways involved in glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments at the isoform level, creating an important experimental and computational resource for the kidney research community.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bioactivity assessment of natural compounds using machine learning models trained on target similarity between drugs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vinita Periwal, Stefan Bassler, Sergej Andrejev, Natalia Gabrielli, Kaustubh Raosaheb Patil, Athanasios Typas, Kiran Raosaheb Patil</p>

Natural compounds constitute a rich resource of potential small molecule therapeutics. While experimental access to this resource is limited due to its vast diversity and difficulties in systematic purification, computational assessment of structural similarity with known therapeutic molecules offers a scalable approach. Here, we assessed functional similarity between natural compounds and approved drugs by combining multiple chemical similarity metrics and physicochemical properties using a machine-learning approach. We computed pairwise similarities between 1410 drugs for training classification models and used the drugs shared protein targets as class labels. The best performing models were random forest which gave an average area under the ROC of 0.9, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.35, and F1 score of 0.33, suggesting that it captured the structure-activity relation well. The models were then used to predict protein targets of circa 11k natural compounds by comparing them with the drugs. This revealed therapeutic potential of several natural compounds, including those with support from previously published sources as well as those hitherto unexplored. We experimentally validated one of the predicted pair’s activities, viz., Cox-1 inhibition by 5-methoxysalicylic acid, a molecule commonly found in tea, herbs and spices. In contrast, another natural compound, 4-isopropylbenzoic acid, with the highest similarity score when considering most weighted similarity metric but not picked by our models, did not inhibit Cox-1. Our results demonstrate the utility of a machine-learning approach combining multiple chemical features for uncovering protein binding potential of natural compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Phylogenetic analysis of migration, differentiation, and class switching in B cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kenneth B. Hoehn, Oliver G. Pybus, Steven H. Kleinstein</p>

B cells undergo rapid mutation and selection for antibody binding affinity when producing antibodies capable of neutralizing pathogens. This evolutionary process can be intermixed with migration between tissues, differentiation between cellular subsets, and switching between functional isotypes. B cell receptor (BCR) sequence data has the potential to elucidate important information about these processes. However, there is currently no robust, generalizable framework for making such inferences from BCR sequence data. To address this, we develop three parsimony-based summary statistics to characterize migration, differentiation, and isotype switching along B cell phylogenetic trees. We use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. We then use this framework to infer patterns of cellular differentiation and isotype switching from high throughput BCR sequence datasets obtained from patients in a study of HIV infection and a study of food allergy. These methods are implemented in the R package <i>dowser</i>, available at https://dowser.readthedocs.io.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Erebosis, a new cell death mechanism during homeostatic turnover of gut enterocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hanna M. Ciesielski, Hiroshi Nishida, Tomomi Takano, Aya Fukuhara, Tetsuhisa Otani, Yuko Ikegawa, Morihiro Okada, Takashi Nishimura, Mikio Furuse, Sa Kan Yoo</p>

Many adult tissues are composed of differentiated cells and stem cells, each working in a coordinated manner to maintain tissue homeostasis during physiological cell turnover. Old differentiated cells are believed to typically die by apoptosis. Here, we discovered a previously uncharacterized, new phenomenon, which we name erebosis based on the ancient Greek word erebos (“complete darkness”), in the gut enterocytes of adult <i>Drosophila</i>. Cells that undergo erebosis lose cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, organelles and fluorescent proteins, but accumulate Angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ance). Their nuclei become flat and occasionally difficult to detect. Erebotic cells do not have characteristic features of apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagic cell death. Inhibition of apoptosis prevents neither the gut cell turnover nor erebosis. We hypothesize that erebosis is a cell death mechanism for the enterocyte flux to mediate tissue homeostasis in the gut.

                Dendritic spines are the central postsynaptic machinery that determines synaptic function. The F-actin within dendritic spines regulates their dynamic formation and elimination. Rai14 is an F‑actin-regulating protein with a membrane‑shaping function. Here, we identified the roles of Rai14 for the regulation of dendritic spine dynamics associated with stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. Rai14-deficient neurons exhibit reduced dendritic spine density in the <i>Rai14</i><sup>+/-</sup> mouse brain, resulting in impaired functional synaptic activity. Rai14 was protected from degradation by complex formation with Tara, and accumulated in the dendritic spine neck, thereby enhancing spine maintenance. Concurrently, Rai14 deficiency in mice altered gene expression profile relevant to depressive conditions and increased depressive-like behaviors. Moreover, Rai14 expression was reduced in the prefrontal cortex of the mouse stress model, which was blocked by antidepressant treatment. Thus, we propose that Rai14-dependent regulation of dendritic spines may underlie the plastic changes of neuronal connections relevant to depressive-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct representations of body and head motion are dynamically encoded by Purkinje cell populations in the macaque cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                The ability to accurately control our posture and perceive spatial orientation during self-motion requires knowledge of the motion of both the head and body. However, whereas the vestibular sensors and nuclei directly encode head motion, no sensors directly encode body motion. Instead, the integration of vestibular and neck proprioceptive inputs is necessary to transform vestibular information into the body-centric reference frame required for postural control. The anterior vermis of the cerebellum is thought to play a key role in this transformation, yet how its Purkinje cells integrate these inputs or what information they dynamically encode during self-motion remains unknown. Here we recorded the activity of individual anterior vermis Purkinje cells in alert monkeys during passively applied whole-body, body-under-head, and head-on-body rotations. Most neurons dynamically encoded an intermediate representation of self-motion between head and body motion. Notably, these neurons responded to both vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation and showed considerable heterogeneity in their response dynamics. Furthermore, their vestibular responses demonstrated tuning in response to changes in head-on-body position. In contrast, a small remaining percentage of neurons sensitive only to vestibular stimulation unambiguously encoded head-in-space motion across conditions. Using a simple population model, we establish that combining responses from ~40-50 Purkinje cells can explain the responses of their target neurons in deep cerebellar nuclei across all self-motion conditions. We propose that the observed heterogeneity in Purkinje cells underlies the cerebellum's capacity to compute the dynamic representation of body motion required to ensure accurate postural control and perceptual stability in our daily lives.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Zebrafish airinemes optimize their shape between ballistic and diffusive search</a></h4>

              
                In addition to diffusive signals, cells in tissue also communicate via long, thin cellular protrusions, such as airinemes in zebrafish. Before establishing communication, cellular protrusions must find their target cell. Here we demonstrate that the shapes of airinemes in zebrafish are consistent with a finite persistent random walk model. The probability of contacting the target cell is maximized for a balance between ballistic search (straight) and diffusive search (highly curved, random). We find that the curvature of airinemes in zebrafish, extracted from live cell microscopy, is approximately the same value as the optimum in the simple persistent random walk model. We also explore the ability of the target cell to infer direction of the airineme's source, finding that there is a theoretical trade-off between search optimality and directional information. This provides a framework to characterize the shape, and performance objectives, of non-canonical cellular protrusions in general.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">OXPHOS deficiencies affect peroxisome proliferation by downregulating genes controlled by the SNF1 signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                How environmental cues influence peroxisome proliferation, particularly through organelles, remains largely unknown. Yeast peroxisomes metabolize fatty acids (FA), and methylotrophic yeasts also metabolize methanol. NADH and acetyl-CoA, produced by these pathways enter mitochondria for ATP production and for anabolic reactions. During the metabolism of FA and/or methanol, the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway accepts NADH for ATP production and maintains cellular redox balance. Remarkably, peroxisome proliferation in <i>Pichia pastoris</i> was abolished in NADH shuttling- and OXPHOS mutants affecting complex I or III, or by the mitochondrial uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), indicating ATP depletion causes the phenotype. We show that mitochondrial OXPHOS deficiency inhibits expression of several peroxisomal proteins implicated in FA and methanol metabolism, as well as in peroxisome division and proliferation. These genes are regulated by the Snf1 complex (SNF1), a pathway generally activated by a high AMP/ATP ratio. In OXPHOS mutants, Snf1 is activated by phosphorylation, but Gal83, its interacting subunit, fails to translocate to the nucleus. Phenotypic defects in peroxisome proliferation observed in the OXPHOS mutants, and phenocopied by the D<i>gal83</i> mutant, were rescued by deletion of three transcriptional repressor genes (<i>MIG1</i>, <i>MIG2</i> and <i>NRG1</i>) controlled by SNF1 signaling. Our results are interpreted in terms of a mechanism by which peroxisomal and mitochondrial proteins and/or metabolites influence redox and energy metabolism, while also influencing peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation, thereby exemplifying interorganellar communication and interplay involving peroxisomes, mitochondria, cytosol and the nucleus. We discuss the physiological relevance of this work in the context of human OXPHOS deficiencies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Natural-gradient learning for spiking neurons</a></h4>

              
                In many normative theories of synaptic plasticity, weight updates implicitly depend on the chosen parametrization of the weights. This problem relates, for example, to neuronal morphology: synapses which are functionally equivalent in terms of their impact on somatic firing can differ substantially in spine size due to their different positions along the dendritic tree. Classical theories based on Euclidean-gradient descent can easily lead to inconsistencies due to such parametrization dependence. The issues are solved in the framework of Riemannian geometry, in which we propose that plasticity instead follows natural-gradient descent. Under this hypothesis, we derive a synaptic learning rule for spiking neurons that couples functional efficiency with the explanation of several well-documented biological phenomena such as dendritic democracy, multiplicative scaling, and heterosynaptic plasticity. We therefore suggest that in its search for functional synaptic plasticity, evolution might have come up with its own version of natural-gradient descent.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cross-species analysis of LZTR1 loss-of-function mutants demonstrates dependency to RIT1 orthologs</a></h4>

              
                RAS GTPases are highly conserved proteins involved in the regulation of mitogenic signaling. We have previously described a novel Cullin 3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex formed by the substrate adaptor protein LZTR1 that binds, ubiquitinates, and promotes proteasomal degradation of the RAS GTPase RIT1. In addition, others have described that this complex is also responsible for the ubiquitination of classical RAS GTPases. Here, we have analyzed the phenotypes of <i>Lztr1</i> loss-of-function mutants in both fruit flies and mice and have demonstrated a biochemical preference for their RIT1 orthologs. Moreover, we show that <i>Lztr1</i> is haplosufficient in mice and that embryonic lethality of the homozygous null allele can be rescued by deletion of <i>Rit1</i>. Overall, our results indicate that, in model organisms, RIT1 orthologs are the preferred substrates of LZTR1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activation of the EGFR/MAPK pathway drives transdifferentiation of quiescent niche cells to stem cells in the Drosophila testis niche</a></h4>

              
                Adult stem cells are maintained in niches, specialized microenvironments that regulate their self-renewal and differentiation. In the adult <i>Drosophila</i> testis stem cell niche, somatic hub cells produce signals that regulate adjacent germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). Hub cells are normally quiescent, but after complete genetic ablation of CySCs, they can proliferate and transdifferentiate into new CySCs. Here we find that Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is upregulated in hub cells after CySC ablation and that the ability of testes to recover from ablation is inhibited by reduced EGFR signaling. In addition, activation of the EGFR pathway in hub cells is sufficient to induce their proliferation and transdifferentiation into CySCs. We propose that EGFR signaling, which is normally required in adult cyst cells, is actively inhibited in adult hub cells to maintain their fate but is repurposed to drive stem cell regeneration after CySC ablation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Flexible use of memory by food-caching birds</a></h4>

              
                Animals use memory-guided and memory-independent strategies to make navigational decisions. Disentangling the contribution of these strategies to navigation is critical for understanding how memory influences behavioral output. To address this issue, we studied spatial behaviors of the chickadee, a food-caching bird. Chickadees hide food in concealed, scattered locations and retrieve their caches later in time. We designed an apparatus that allows birds to cache and retrieve food at many sites while navigating in a laboratory arena. This apparatus enabled automated tracking of behavioral variables – including caches, retrievals, and investigations of different sites. We built probabilistic models to fit these behavioral data using a combination of mnemonic and non-mnemonic factors. We found that chickadees use some navigational strategies that are independent of cache memories, including opportunistic foraging and spatial biases. They combine these strategies with spatially precise memories of which sites contain caches and which sites they have previously checked. A single memory of site contents is used in a context-dependent manner: during caching chickadees avoid sites that contain food, while during retrieval they instead preferentially access occupied sites. Our approach is a powerful way to investigate navigational decisions in a natural behavior, including flexible contributions of memory to these decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The organic cation Transporter 2 regulates dopamine D1 receptor signaling at the Golgi apparatus</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is a key catecholamine in the brain and the kidney, where it is involved in a number of physiological functions such as locomotion, cognition, emotion, endocrine regulation and renal function. As a membrane impermeant hormone and neurotransmitter, dopamine is thought to signal by binding and activating dopamine receptors, members of the G protein couple receptor (GPCR) family, only on the plasma membrane. Here, using novel nanobody-based biosensors, we demonstrate for the first time that the dopamine D1 receptor (D1DR), the primary mediator of dopaminergic signaling in the brain and kidney, not only functions on the plasma membrane but becomes activated at the Golgi apparatus in the presence of its ligand. We present evidence that activation of the Golgi pool of D1DR is dependent on Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT2), a dopamine transporter, providing an explanation for how the membrane impermeant dopamine accesses subcellular pools of D1DR. We further demonstrate that dopamine activates Golgi-D1DR in murine striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) and this activity depends on OCT2 function.  We also introduce a new approach to selectively interrogate compartmentalized D1DR signaling by inhibiting Gas coupling, using a nanobody-based chemical recruitment system.  Using this strategy, we show that Golgi-localized D1DRs regulate cAMP production and mediate local protein kinase A activation. Together, our data suggest that spatially compartmentalized signaling hubs are previously unappreciated regulatory aspects of D1DR signaling. Our data provide further evidence for the role of transporters in regulating subcellular GPCR activity.

                Rett syndrome is characterized by an early period of typical development and then, regression of learned motor and speech skills in girls. The underlying mechanisms from normalcy to regression are unclear. Due to random X-chromosome inactivation, female patients of Rett syndrome, and female mouse models of Rett syndrome (Mecp2Heterozygous, Het) express a functional copy of wild-type MECP2 protein in half of all mature cells in brain and body. By analyzing wild-type MECP2 expression in the context of whisker tactile sensory perception, here we report compensatory increase in MECP2 protein expression in 6-week-old adolescent Het mice, which display normal levels of perineuronal net expression, mild tactile sensory perception deficit and efficient pup retrieval behavior. Comparatively, 12-week-old adult Het mice display decreased MECP2 expression and significant tactile sensory perception deficits. Thus, we have identified a period of normalcy and regression in this female mouse model, which coincide with variable wild-type expression of MECP2. We speculate that compensatory increases in MECP2 expression in Het brains allows for normal functioning, while the inability to maintain these expression level changes leads to behavioral deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Memory loss at sleep onset</a></h4>

              
                Every night, we pass through a transitory zone at the borderland between wakefulness and sleep, named the first stage of non-rapid eye movement sleep (N1). N1 sleep is associated with an increased hippocampal activity and dreamlike experiences that incorporate recent wake materials, suggesting that it may be associated with memory processing. Here, we investigated the specific contribution of N1 sleep in the processing of memory traces. Participants were asked to learn the precise locations of 48 objects on a grid and were then tested on their memory for these items before and after a 30-minute rest during which participants either stayed fully awake, transitioned toward N1 or deeper (N2) sleep. We showed that memory recall was lower (10% forgetting) after a resting period including only N1 sleep compared to N2 sleep. Furthermore, the ratio of alpha/theta power (an EEG marker of the transition towards sleep) correlated negatively with the forgetting rate when taking into account all sleepers (N1 and N2 groups combined), suggesting a physiological index for memory loss that transcends sleep stages. Our findings suggest that interrupting sleep onset at N1 may alter sleep-dependent memory consolidation and promote forgetting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The association between working memory precision and the nonlinear dynamics of frontal and parieto-occipital EEG activity.</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological working memory (WM) research has shown that distinct brain areas communicate through macroscopic oscillatory activities across multiple frequency bands. Such cross-frequency interactions generate nonlinear amplitude modulations (AM) in the observed signal. Traditionally, the AM of a signal is expressed as coupling strength between the signal and a pre-specified modulator at a lower frequency. Therefore, the idea of AM and coupling cannot be separately studied. This EEG study shows that the AM of parieto-occipital alpha/beta power and the coupling between frontal theta phase and parieto-occipital alpha/beta AM provide different information on WM processing. Thirty-three participants completed a color recall task with simultaneous EEG recording. The results showed that individual differences in WM precision are associated with frontal theta power enhancement and parieto-occipital alpha/beta power suppression. Furthermore, the AM of parieto-occipital alpha/beta power predicted WM precision after presenting a target-defining probe array. The phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between frontal theta phase and parieto-occipital alpha/beta AM increased with WM load during the processing of incoming stimuli, but they did not predict the subsequent recall performance. These results indicate that the frontoparietal PAC reflects the executive control for selecting relevant WM representations, but whether the memorized information can be retrieved depends on the subsequent amplitude variation of parieto-occipital alpha/beta power. In conclusion, individuals with higher working memory precision are associated with enhanced frontal theta power and parieto-occipital alpha/beta power suppression.

                Humans and animals are not always rational. They not only rationally exploit rewards but also explore an environment, even if reward is unexpected, owing to their curiosity. However, the mechanism of such curiosity-driven irrational behavior is unknown. Here, we developed a novel decision-making model for a two-choice task based on the free energy principle, which is a theory integrating recognition and action selection. The proposed model successfully described irrational behaviors depending on the curiosity level. We then proposed a machine learning method to decode temporal curiosity from behavioral data, which enables us to quantitatively compare estimated curiosity and neural activities. By applying it to rat behavioral data, we found that the irrational choices sticking to one option was reflected to the negative curiosity level. Our data-driven decoding approach can be a tool for identifying the neural basis for controlling reward-curiosity conflicts. Specifically, it could be effective in diagnosing mental disorders.

                Computer models of the individual components of the peripheral auditory system -- the outer, middle, and inner ears and the auditory nerve -- have been developed in the past, with varying level of detail, breadth, and faithfulness of the underlying parameters. Here, we move modeling of the ear to the next level by presenting a complete, physiologically justified, bottom-up computer model based on up-to-date experimental data that integrates all these parts together in a seamless way. Such a model is instrumental for advancing quantitative understanding of the mechanism of hearing, as well as for devising next generation hearing aids and cochlear implants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Toward Interpretable Digital Biomarkers of Walking and Reaching in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Multimodal digital data registered with wearable biosensors has emerged as highly complementary of clinical pencil-and-paper criteria, offering new insights in ways to detect and diagnose various aspects of Parkinson's disease. A pressing question is how to combine both the clinical knowledge of PD and the new technology to create interpretable digital biomarkers easily obtainable with off-the-shelf technology. Several challenges concerning disparity in biophysical units, anatomical differences across participants, sensor positioning, and sampling resolution are addressed in this work, along with identification of optimal parameters to automatically differentiate patients with PD from controls. We combine data from a multitude of biosensors registering signals from the central (EEG) and peripheral (magnetometry, kinematics) nervous systems, inclusive of the autonomic nervous system (EKG), as the participants perform natural tasks requiring different levels of intentional planning and automatic control. We find that magnetometer data during walking, across a variety of amplitude and timing signals provide optimal separation of PD from neurotypical controls. We conclude that considering multimodal signals, while differentiating across levels of intent in natural actions can be revealing of important features of PD that otherwise escape the naked eye. Further we add that clinical criteria combined with such optimal digital parameter spaces offer a far more complete picture of PD than using either one of these pieces of data alone.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The language network reliably 'tracks' naturalistic meaningful non-verbal stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The language network, comprised of brain regions in the left frontal and temporal cortex, responds robustly and reliably during language comprehension but shows little or no response during many non-linguistic cognitive tasks (e.g., Fedorenko & Blank, 2020). However, one domain whose relationship with language remains debated is semantics--our conceptual knowledge of the world. Given that the language network responds strongly to meaningful linguistic stimuli, could some of this response be driven by the presence of rich conceptual representations encoded in linguistic inputs? In this study, we used a naturalistic cognition paradigm to test whether the cognitive and neural resources that are responsible for language processing are also recruited for processing semantically rich non-verbal stimuli. To do so, we measured BOLD responses to a set of ~5-minute-long video and audio clips that consisted of meaningful event sequences but did not contain any linguistic content. We then used the inter-subject correlation (ISC) approach (Hasson et al., 2004) to examine the extent to which the language network 'tracks' these stimuli. Across all the regions of the language network, non-verbal meaningful stimuli elicited reliable ISCs. These ISCs were higher than the ISCs elicited by non-verbal stimuli without semantic content (e.g., a music clip), but substantially lower than the ISCs elicited by linguistic stimuli. Our results complement earlier findings from controlled experiments (e.g., Ivanova et al., 2021) in providing further evidence that the language network responds to meaningful content in non-verbal stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precise temporal control of GEVI conformations enables the visualization of charge migration in a fluorescent protein resulting in an improved optical response</a></h4>

              
                Electrodynamic pathways through the fluorescent protein domain enable the genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) ArcLight and its derivatives to optically report conformational changes induced by membrane potential transients. These electrical pathways through the fluorescent protein domain of Super Ecliptic pHluorin exhibit remarkable precision as demonstrated by the divergent optical behavior of Gln versus Asn mutations. At position D147 on the external surface of the fluorescent protein domain, Gln exhibits a voltage-dependent behavior like other negatively charged acidic amino acids at that location while the Asn mutant exhibits a response similar to the charged positive amino acids at that position. Replacement of Thr with Gln at the 203 position with the amino acid side chain in close proximity to the internal chromophore does not affect the speed of the voltage-dependent optical signal, but replacement with Asn slows the voltage-dependent optical signal implicating a twisting of the chromophore in response to transient charge interactions on the exterior of the {beta}-can being altered during the voltage-induced conformational change. In addition to polar amino acids affecting these electrodynamic pathways, hydrophobic residues play a noticeable role in the migration of charge from the exterior of the fluorescent protein to the chromophore potentially by shielding/creating inducible dipoles on the surface of the fluorescent protein. Using these novel insights, a new GEVI that gets significantly brighter upon depolarization of the plasma membrane was developed enabling voltage imaging of population signals with low light levels at a frame rate of 5 kHz in acute brain slice as well as the reporting of neuronal activity in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The structural basis of long-term potentiation in hippocampal synapses, revealed by EM-imaging of lanthanum-induced synaptic vesicle recycling</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal neurons in tissue-culture were exposed to the trivalent cation lanthanum for short periods (15 to 30 minutes) and prepared for electron microscopy (EM), to evaluate the stimulatory effects of this cation on synaptic ultrastructure. Not only were characteristic ultrastructural changes of exaggerated synaptic vesicle turnover seen within the presynapses of these cultures - - including synaptic vesicle depletion and proliferation of vesicle-recycling structures - - but the overall architecture of a large proportion of the synapses in the cultures was dramatically altered, due to large postsynaptic 'bulges' or herniations into the presynapses. Moreover, in most cases these postsynaptic herniations or protrusions produced by lanthanum were seen by EM to distort or break or 'perforate' the so-called postsynaptic densities (PSD's) that harbor receptors and recognition-molecules essential for synaptic function. These dramatic EM-observations lead us to postulate that such PSD-breakages or 'perforations' could very possibly create essential substrates or 'tags' for synaptic growth, simply by creating fragmented free-edges around the PSD's, into which new receptors and recognition-molecules could be recruited more easily, and thus they could represent the physical substrate for the important synaptic-growth process known as "long-term potentiation" (LTP). All of this was created simply in hippocampal tissue-cultures, and simply by pushing synaptic vesicle recycling way beyond its normal limits with the trivalent cation lanthanum; but we argue in this report that such fundamental changes in synaptic architecture - - given that they can occur at all - - could also occur at the extremes of normal neuronal activity, which are presumed to lead to learning and memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Computational Theory of Learning Flexible Reward-Seeking Behavior with Place Cells</a></h4>

              
                An important open question in computational neuroscience is how various spatially tuned neurons, such as place cells, are used to support the learning of reward-seeking behavior of an animal. Existing computational models either lack biological plausibility or fall short of behavioral flexibility when environments change. In this paper, we propose a computational theory that achieves behavioral flexibility with better biological plausibility. We first train a mixture of Gaussian distributions to model the ensemble of firing fields of place cells. Then we propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the synaptic strength matrix among place cells. This matrix is interpreted as the transition rate matrix of a continuous time Markov chain to generate the sequential replay of place cells. During replay, the synaptic strengths from place cells to medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned by a temporal-difference like rule to store place-reward associations. After replay, the activation of MSN will ramp up when an animal approaches the rewarding place, so the animal can move along the direction where the MSN activation is increasing to find the rewarding place. We implement our theory into a high-fidelity virtual rat in the MuJoCo physics simulator. In a complex maze, the rat shows significantly better learning efficiency and behavioral flexibility than a rat that implements a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning algorithm, deep Q-network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered basal ganglia output during self-restraint</a></h4>

              
                Suppressing actions is essential for flexible behavior. Multiple neural circuits involved in behavioral inhibition converge upon a key basal ganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). To examine how changes in basal ganglia output contribute to self restraint, we recorded SNr neurons during a proactive behavioral inhibition task. Rats responded to Go! cues with rapid leftward or rightward movements, but also prepared to cancel one of these movement directions as a Stop! cue might occur. This action restraint-visible as direction-selective slowing of reaction times-altered both rates and patterns of SNr spiking. Overall firing rate was elevated before the Go! cue, and this effect was driven by a subpopulation of direction-selective SNr neurons. In neural state space, this corresponded to a shift away from the restrained movement. Furthermore, SNr activity showed an increase in spike variability during proactive inhibition, similar to that reported with movement slowing in Parkinson's Disease. Increased spike variability corresponded to variable state-space trajectories, slowing reaction times via reduced preparation to move. These findings open new perspectives on basal ganglia mechanisms for movement preparation and cognitive control, in both healthy states and brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Small-amplitude head oscillations result from a multimodal head stabilization reflex in hawkmoths</a></h4>

              
                In flying insects, head stabilization is an important reflex which helps to reduce motion blur during fast aerial maneuvers. This reflex is multimodal and requires the integration of visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback, each operating as a negative-feedback control loop. As in any negative-feedback system, the head stabilization system possesses inherent oscillatory dynamics that depends on the rates and latencies of the sensorimotor components constituting the reflex. Consistent with this expectation, we observed small amplitude oscillations in the head motion (or head wobble) of the Oleander hawkmoth Daphnis nerii. We show here that these oscillations emerge from the inherent dynamics of the multimodal reflex that underlies gaze stabilization, and the amplitude of the head wobble is a function of both the visual feedback and antennal mechanosensory feedback from the Johnston's organs. The head wobble is thus an outcome of a multimodal, dynamically-stabilized head positioning reflex.

	<p>The standard of care for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) is maximal resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Studies investigating the resection of GBM have primarily focused on the contrast enhancing portion of the tumor on magnetic resonance imaging. Histopathological studies, however, have demonstrated tumor infiltration within peri-tumoral fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) abnormalities, which is often not resected. The histopathology of FLAIR and local recurrence patterns of GBM have prompted interest in the resection of peri-tumoral FLAIR, or FLAIRectomy. To this point, recent studies have suggested a significant survival benefit associated with safe peri-tumoral FLAIR resection. In this review, we discuss the evidence surrounding the composition of peri-tumoral FLAIR, outcomes associated with FLAIRectomy, future directions of the field, and potential implications for patients.</p>

	<p>Suicide, a deliberate act of self-harm with the intention to die, is an emerging health concern but, unfortunately, the most under-researched subject in Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KPK). In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors that can be associated with suicidal behavior (SB) and to evaluate the prevailing treatment practices for therapeutic efficacy and drug-related problems (DRPs) in psychotic patients among the local population of KPK. A prospective, multicenter study was conducted for suicidal cases admitted to the study centers by randomized sampling. Socio-demographics and data on suicidal behavior were assessed using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), socioeconomic condition by Kuppuswamy socioeconomic scale (KSES) and treatment adherence by Morisky Medication-Taking Adherence Scale (MMAS-4). Drug-related problems and the therapeutic efficacy of prevailing treatment practices were assessed at baseline and follow-up after 3 months of treatment provided. Regarding suicidality (N = 128), females reported more ideations (63.1%), while males witnessed more suicidal behavior (66.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Suicide attempters were mostly married (55.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002); highly educated (53.9%, p = 0.004); dissatisfied with their life and had a previous history (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.5) of suicide attempt (SA) (20.6%), self-injurious behavior (SIB) (39.7%) and interrupted (IA) or aborted attempts (AA) (22.2%). A greater improvement was observed in patients receiving combination therapy (p = 0.001) than pharmacotherapy (p = 0.006) or psychotherapy (p = 0.183), alone. DRPs were also detected, including drug-selection problems (17.88%), dose-related problems (20.64%), potential drug&amp;amp;ndash;drug interactions (24.31%), adverse drug reactions (11.46%) and other problems like inadequate education and counseling (21.55%). Furthermore, it was also found that psychotic patients with suicidal ideations (SI) were significantly (p = 0.01) more adherent to the treatment as compared to those with suicidal attempts. We concluded that suicide attempters differed significantly from patients with suicidal ideations in psychotic patients and presented with peculiar characteristics regarding socio-demographic factors. A combination of therapies and adherence to the treatment provided better outcomes, and targeted interventions are warranted to address drug-related problems.</p>

	<p>Objective: The treatment efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for negative symptoms amongst patients with schizophrenia remains unclear. In this study, we aim to examine the effects of ECT on negative symptoms in schizophrenia and their association with other clinical outcomes, including cognition and function. Methods: This is a retrospective data analysis of patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder treated with ECT at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Singapore, between January 2016 and December 2019. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Global Assessment of Function (GAF). Changes in scores were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance. Sequential structural modelling was utilized to examine the pathway relationships between changes in negative symptoms, global functioning, and cognition functioning after ECT. Results: A total of 340 patients were analysed. Hence, 196 (57.6%), 53 (15.5%), and 91 (26.7%) showed improvements, no change, and deterioration in negative symptoms, respectively. ECT-induced improvement of negative symptoms was significantly associated with improvement of global functioning (direct effect correlation coefficient (r): &amp;amp;minus;0.496; se: 0.152; p = 0.001) and cognition function (indirect effect r: &amp;amp;minus;0.077; se: 0.037; p = 0.035). Moreover, having capacity to consent, more severe baseline negative symptoms, lithium prescription, and an indirect effect of voluntary admission status via consent capacity predicted ECT associated negative symptoms improvement. Conclusion: ECT is generally associated with improvements of negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia, which correlate with improvements of overall function. Possible novel clinical predictors of negative symptom improvement have been identified and will require further research and validation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Homogeneous inhibition is optimal for the phase precession of place cells in the CA1 field</a></h4>

              
                Place cells are hippocampal neurons encoding the position of an animal in space. Studies of place cells are essential to understanding the processing and transmission of information by neural networks of the brain. An important characteristic of place cell spike trains is phase precession. When an animal is running through the place field, the discharges of the place cells shift from the ascending phase of the theta rhythm through the minimum to the descending phase. The role of excitatory inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons along the Schaffer collaterals and the perforant pathway in phase precession is described, but the role of inputs from local interneurons to CA1 pyramidal cell is poorly understood. We have set the goal the contribution of field CA1 interneurons to the phase precession of place cells using mathematical methods. The CA1 field was chosen because it provides the largest set of experimental data required to build and verify the model. We have solved the optimization problem and found the parameters of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the pyramidal neuron of the CA1 field so that the neuron generates a spike train with the effect of phase precession. We have discovered that the uniform inhibition of field CA1 pyramidal neurons best explains the effect of phase precession. Among interneurons, axo-axonal neurons make the greatest contribution to the inhibition of pyramidal cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms and functions of respiration-driven gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations are believed to underlie cognitive processes by shaping the formation of transient neuronal partnerships on a millisecond scale. These oscillations are coupled to the phase of breathing cycles in several brain areas, possibly reflecting local computations driven by sensory inputs sampled at each breath. Here, we investigated the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations in the piriform (olfactory) cortex of awake mice to understand their dependence on breathing and how they relate to local spiking activity. Mechanistically, we find that respiration drives gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, which are inhibitory and result from recurrent connections between local excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. Moreover, respiration-driven inhibitory gamma oscillations are triggered by the activation of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb and are abolished during anesthesia. Functionally, we demonstrate that they locally segregate neuronal assemblies through a winner-take-all computation leading to sparse odor coding during each breathing cycle. Our results shed new light on the mechanisms of gamma oscillations, bridging computation, cognition and physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Immune activation state modulates retrieval of infant engrams</a></h4>

              
                Infantile amnesia is possibly the most ubiquitous form of memory loss in mammals. Despite its widespread relevance, little is known about the biological conditions for infantile amnesia to occur and its effect on the engram cells that encode a memory. We investigated how memories are stored in the brain throughout development by integrating engram labeling technology with mouse models of infantile amnesia. We discovered a sex-specific phenomenon in which male offspring in maternal immune activation models of autism spectrum disorder do not experience infantile amnesia. We rescued the same apparently forgotten infantile memories in mice by optogenetically reactivating dentate gyrus engram cells that were labeled during complex experiences in infant development. Further, we were able to permanently reinstate lost infantile memories by artificially updating the memory engram, demonstrating that infantile amnesia is a reversible process. Our findings suggest that immune activation during development modulates innate, and reversible, forgetting switches that determine whether infantile amnesia will occur.

	<p>Motor recovery is related to the corticospinal tract (CST) lesion in post-stroke patients. The CST originating from the supplementary motor area (SMA) affects the recovery of impaired motor function. We confirmed the effects of transcranial direct current electrical stimulation (tDCS) over the SMA combined with walk training on CST excitability. This study involved a stroke patient with severe sensorimotor deficits and a retrospective AB design. Walk training was conducted only in phase A. Phase B consisted of anodal tDCS (1.5 mA) combined with walk training. Walking speed, stride time variability (STV; reflecting gait stability), and beta-band intramuscular coherence&amp;amp;mdash;derived from the paired tibialis anterior on the paretic side (reflecting CST excitability)&amp;amp;mdash;were measured. STV quantified the coefficient of variation in stride time using accelerometers. Intramuscular coherence during the early stance phase noticeably increased in phase B compared with phase A. Intramuscular coherence in both the stance and swing phases was reduced at follow-up. Walking speed showed no change, while STV was noticeably decreased in phase B compared with phase A. These results suggest that tDCS over the SMA during walking improves gait stability by enhancing CST excitability in the early stance phase.</p>

	<p>The study is focused on applying ex-Gaussian parameters of eye-tracking and cognitive measures in the classification process of cognitive workload level. A computerised version of the digit symbol substitution test has been developed in order to perform the case study. The dataset applied in the study is a collection of variables related to eye-tracking: saccades, fixations and blinks, as well as test-related variables including response time and correct response number. The application of ex-Gaussian modelling to all collected data was beneficial in the context of detection of dissimilarity in groups. An independent classification approach has been applied in the study. Several classical classification methods have been invoked in the process. The overall classification accuracy reached almost 96%. Furthermore, the interpretable machine learning model based on logistic regression was adapted in order to calculate the ranking of the most valuable features, which allowed us to examine their importance.</p>

	<p>Endurance, which is dependent at least partly upon the activation of the brain cortex, is important for performance in rowing. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown benefits for endurance, but its effects on the endurance performance of elite rowing athletes are unknown, and are examined in this study. Eight elite female rowers completed 5 km of rowing on an ergometer following stimulation of the tDCS and sham over motor cortices. Each session lasted 20 min and the current was set at 2.2 mA. Time, 500 m/split, power, time corresponding to 500 m (TC500) and power corresponding to 500 m (PC500) were recorded continuously throughout the tests. No significant differences in time, 500 m/split and power were observed between baseline, tDCS and sham. Compared to the sham, tDCS induced a percentage reduction in TC500 from baseline to 2500 m and 4000 m, and a percentage increase in PC500 from baseline to 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 2000 m, 2500 m, 4000 m, 4500 m and 5000 m. One-session tDCS did not have significant benefits for rowing endurance performance in elite professional rowers, and had only marginally greater efficacy compared to sham. These findings offer knowledge helpful to the design of future studies exploring the effects of tDCS on the endurance performance of elite rowers.</p>

	<p>Cerebral palsy describes a group of permanent disorders of movement, motor function and posture that occur due to non-progressive insults to the developing brain. Most of the information concerning the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy originates from studies conducted in high-income countries. In this scoping review, we aimed to explore the tools used in low- and middle-income countries for the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy. A systematic search was conducted using OVID Medline and PubMed databases. &amp;amp;ldquo;Early diagnosis&amp;amp;rdquo; was defined as diagnosis prior to 12 months of age, and low- and middle-income countries were classified according to the World Bank classification system. We identified nine studies on the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy from low- and middle-income countries. The tools featured (n = number of studies) were: General Movement Assessment (6), neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (3), Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (2), Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (1) and cranial ultrasound (1). We found a paucity of published literature on the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy from low- and middle-income countries. Further research is needed to determine the tools that are accurate and feasible for use in low-resource settings, particularly since cerebral palsy is more prevalent in these areas.</p>

	<p>There is joint agreement among professionals internationally on the importance of diagnosing autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the early stages of the emergence of symptoms. Criteria changes for the diagnosis of ASD need updated versions of the scale to make the diagnosis feasible. This study aimed to evaluate the level of overlap between two different versions of the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS-2 and GARS-3), which have been updated based on changes in DSM-IV and DSM-5 on a Kurdish sample of individuals at risk of having ASD and Intellectual Disability, referred to the Bahoz center in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. A group of 148 cases with ASD and developmental disabilities (DD) was evaluated using the 2nd and 3rd versions of the GARS scale to understand the level of cases that confirm an ASD diagnosis in both scales. Ninety-six individuals (65%) scored about the cut-off score for being diagnosed with ASD based on the GARS-2, and 137 individuals (93%) scored above the cut-off score based on the GARS-3. Moreover, keeping updated and meeting the changing demand of standardization and cultural suitability of the updating scales is a challenge. This challenge is due to the shortage of infrastructure sources and lack of established professionals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Findings indicated that GARS-3, updated based on the DSM-5, tends to diagnose children with accompanying diagnoses and different levels of symptoms severity of ASD at different age levels. Further studies are needed to help professionals and policymakers in low- and middle-income countries understand the updated versions of the available scales and depend on the older version, which must be considered cautiously.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cell type-specific mechanisms of information transfer in data-driven biophysical models of hippocampal CA3 principal neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniele Linaro, Matthew J. Levy, David L. Hunt</p>

The transformation of synaptic input into action potential output is a fundamental single-cell computation resulting from the complex interaction of distinct cellular morphology and the unique expression profile of ion channels that define the cellular phenotype. Experimental studies aimed at uncovering the mechanisms of the transfer function have led to important insights, yet are limited in scope by technical feasibility, making biophysical simulations an attractive complementary approach to push the boundaries in our understanding of cellular computation. Here we take a data-driven approach by utilizing high-resolution morphological reconstructions and patch-clamp electrophysiology data together with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to build two populations of biophysically detailed models of murine hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons based on the two principal cell types that comprise this region. We evaluated the performance of these models and find that our approach quantitatively matches the cell type-specific firing phenotypes and recapitulate the intrinsic population-level variability in the data. Moreover, we confirm that the conductance values found by the optimization algorithm are consistent with differentially expressed ion channel genes in single-cell transcriptomic data for the two cell types. We then use these models to investigate the cell type-specific biophysical properties involved in the generation of complex-spiking output driven by synaptic input through an information-theoretic treatment of their respective transfer functions. Our simulations identify a host of cell type-specific biophysical mechanisms that define the morpho-functional phenotype to shape the cellular transfer function and place these findings in the context of a role for bursting in CA3 recurrent network synchronization dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Updating age-specific contact structures to match evolving demography in a dynamic mathematical model of tuberculosis vaccination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chathika Krishan Weerasuriya, Rebecca Claire Harris, Christopher Finn McQuaid, Gabriela B. Gomez, Richard G. White</p>

We investigated the effects of updating age-specific social contact matrices to match evolving demography on vaccine impact estimates. We used a dynamic transmission model of tuberculosis in India as a case study. We modelled four incremental methods to update contact matrices over time, where each method incorporated its predecessor: fixed contact matrix (M0), preserved contact reciprocity (M1), preserved contact assortativity (M2), and preserved average contacts per individual (M3). We updated the contact matrices of a deterministic compartmental model of tuberculosis transmission, calibrated to epidemiologic data between 2000 and 2019 derived from India. We additionally calibrated the M0, M2, and M3 models to the 2050 TB incidence rate projected by the calibrated M1 model. We stratified age into three groups, children (<15y), adults (≥15y, <65y), and the elderly (≥65y), using World Population Prospects demographic data, between which we applied POLYMOD-derived social contact matrices. We simulated an M72-AS01<sub>E</sub>-like tuberculosis vaccine delivered from 2027 and estimated the per cent TB incidence rate reduction (IRR) in 2050 under each update method. We found that vaccine impact estimates in all age groups remained relatively stable between the M0–M3 models, irrespective of vaccine-targeting by age group. The maximum difference in impact, observed following adult-targeted vaccination, was 7% in the elderly, in whom we observed IRRs of 19% (uncertainty range 13–32), 20% (UR 13–31), 22% (UR 14–37), and 26% (UR 18–38) following M0, M1, M2 and M3 updates, respectively. We found that model-based TB vaccine impact estimates were relatively insensitive to demography-matched contact matrix updates in an India-like demographic and epidemiologic scenario. Current model-based TB vaccine impact estimates may be reasonably robust to the lack of contact matrix updates, but further research is needed to confirm and generalise this finding.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Allostery in the dynamic coactivator domain KIX occurs through minor conformational micro-states</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Amanda L. Peiffer, Julie M. Garlick, Stephen T. Joy, Anna K. Mapp, Charles L. Brooks III</p>

The coactivator KIX of CBP uses two binding surfaces to recognize multiple activators and exhibits allostery in ternary complex formation. Activator•coactivator interactions are central to transcriptional regulation, yet the microscopic origins of allostery in dynamic proteins like KIX are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the molecular recognition and allosteric manifestations involved in two KIX ternary systems c-Myb•KIX•MLL and pKID•KIX•MLL. Exploring the hypothesis that binary complex formation prepays an entropic cost for positive cooperativity, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations, side chain methyl order parameters, and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to explore conformational entropy changes in KIX. The protein’s configurational micro-states from structural clustering highlight the utility of protein plasticity in molecular recognition and allostery. We find that apo KIX occupies a wide distribution of lowly-populated configurational states. Each binding partner has its own suite of KIX states that it selects, building a model of molecular recognition fingerprints. Allostery is maximized with MLL pre-binding, which corresponds to the observation of a significant reduction in KIX micro-states observed when MLL binds. With all binding partners, the changes in KIX conformational entropy arise predominantly from changes in the most flexible loop. Likewise, we find that a small molecule and mutations allosterically inhibit/enhance activator binding by tuning loop dynamics, suggesting that loop-targeting chemical probes could be developed to alter KIX•activator interactions. Experimentally capturing KIX stabilization is challenging, particularly because of the disordered nature of particular activators. However, DSF melting curves allow for inference of relative entropic changes that occur across complexes, which we compare to our computed entropy changes using simulation methyl order parameters.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Bridging the big (data) gap: levels of control in small- and large-scale cognitive neuroscience research</a></h4>

              
                Recently, cognitive neuroscience has experienced unprecedented growth in the availability of large-scale datasets. These developments hold great methodological and theoretical promise: they allow increased statistical power, the use of nonparametric and generative models, the examination of individual differences, and more. Nevertheless, unlike most ‘traditional’ cognitive neuroscience research, which uses controlled experimental designs, large-scale projects often collect neuroimaging data not directly related to a particular task (e.g., resting state).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A tRNA processing enzyme is a key regulator of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response</a></h4>

              
                The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) has emerged as a predominant mechanism that preserves mitochondrial function. Consequently, multiple pathways likely exist to modulate UPR<sup>mt</sup>. We discovered that the tRNA processing enzyme, homolog of ELAC2 (HOE-1), is key to UPR<sup>mt</sup> regulation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We find that nuclear HOE-1 is necessary and sufficient to robustly activate UPR<sup>mt</sup>. We show that HOE-1 acts via transcription factors ATFS-1 and DVE-1 that are crucial for UPR<sup>mt</sup>. Mechanistically, we show that HOE-1 likely mediates its effects via tRNAs, as blocking tRNA export prevents HOE-1-induced UPR<sup>mt</sup>. Interestingly, we find that HOE-1 does not act via the integrated stress response, which can be activated by uncharged tRNAs, pointing towards its reliance on a new mechanism. Finally, we show that the subcellular localization of HOE-1 is responsive to mitochondrial stress and is subject to negative regulation via ATFS-1. Together, we have discovered a novel RNA-based cellular pathway that modulates UPR<sup>mt</sup>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oligogenic heterozygous inheritance of sperm abnormalities in mouse</a></h4>

              
                Male infertility is an important health concern that is expected to have a major genetic etiology. Although high-throughput sequencing has linked gene defects to more than 50% of rare and severe sperm anomalies, less than 20% of common and moderate forms are explained. We hypothesized that this low success rate could at least be partly due to oligogenic defects - the accumulation of several rare heterozygous variants in distinct, but functionally connected, genes. Here, we compared fertility and sperm parameters in male mice harboring one to four heterozygous truncating mutations of genes linked to multiple morphological anomalies of the flagellum (MMAF) syndrome. Results indicated progressively deteriorating sperm morphology and motility with increasing numbers of heterozygous mutations. This first evidence of oligogenic inheritance in failed spermatogenesis strongly suggests that oligogenic heterozygosity could explain a significant proportion of asthenoteratozoospermia cases. The findings presented pave the way to further studies in mice and man.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cerebellum encodes and influences the initiation, performance, and termination of discontinuous movements in mice</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum is hypothesized to represent timing information important for organizing salient motor events during periodically performed discontinuous movements. To provide functional evidence validating this idea, we measured and manipulated Purkinje cell (PC) activity in the lateral cerebellum of mice trained to volitionally perform periodic bouts of licking for regularly allocated water rewards. Overall, PC simple spiking modulated during task performance, mapping phasic tongue protrusions and retractions, as well as ramping prior to both lick-bout initiation and termination, two important motor events delimiting movement cycles. The ramping onset occurred earlier for the initiation of un-cued exploratory licking that anticipated water availability relative to licking that was reactive to water allocation, suggesting that the cerebellum is engaged differently depending on the movement context. In a subpopulation of PCs, climbing-fiber-evoked responses also increased during lick-bout initiation, but not termination, highlighting differences in how cerebellar input pathways represent task-related information. Optogenetic perturbation of PC activity disrupted the behavior by degrading lick-bout rhythmicity in addition to initiating and terminating licking bouts confirming a causative role in movement organization. Together, these results substantiate that the cerebellum contributes to the initiation and timing of repeated motor actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Role of YAP in early ectodermal specification and a Huntington's Disease model of human neurulation</a></h4>

              
                The Hippo pathway, a highly conserved signaling cascade that functions as an integrator of molecular signals and biophysical states, ultimately impinges upon the transcription coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP). Hippo-YAP signaling has been shown to play key roles both at the early embryonic stages of implantation and gastrulation, and later during neurogenesis. To explore YAP’s potential role in neurulation, we used self-organizing neuruloids grown from human embryonic stem cells on micropatterned substrates. We identified YAP activation as a key lineage determinant, first between neuronal ectoderm and nonneuronal ectoderm, and later between epidermis and neural crest, indicating that YAP activity can enhance the effect of BMP4 stimulation and therefore affect ectodermal specification at this developmental stage. Because aberrant Hippo-YAP signaling has been implicated in the pathology of Huntington’s Disease (HD), we used isogenic mutant neuruloids to explore the relationship between signaling and the disease. We found that HD neuruloids demonstrate ectopic activation of gene targets of YAP and that pharmacological reduction of YAP’s transcriptional activity can partially rescue the HD phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enhanced C/EBPβ function promotes hypertrophic versus hyperplastic fat tissue growth and prevents steatosis in response to high-fat diet feeding</a></h4>

              
                Chronic obesity is correlated with severe metabolic and cardiovascular diseases as well as with an increased risk for developing cancers. Obesity is usually characterized by fat accumulation in enlarged - hypertrophic – adipocytes that are a source of inflammatory mediators, which promote the development and progression of metabolic disorders. Yet, in certain healthy obese individuals, fat is stored in metabolically more favorable hyperplastic fat tissue that contains an increased number of smaller adipocytes that are less inflamed. In a previous study we demonstrated that loss of the inhibitory protein-isoform C/EBPβ-LIP and the resulting augmented function of the transactivating isoform C/EBPβ-LAP promotes fat metabolism under normal feeding conditions and expands health- and lifespan in mice. Here we show that in mice on a high-fat diet, LIP-deficiency results in adipocyte hyperplasia associated with reduced inflammation and metabolic improvements. Furthermore, fat storage in subcutaneous depots is significantly enhanced specifically in LIP-deficient male mice. Our data identify C/EBPβ as a regulator of adipocyte fate in response to increased fat intake, which has major implications for metabolic health and aging.

                Topographic cortical maps are essential for spatial localisation of sensory stimulation and generation of appropriate task-related motor responses. Somatosensation and nociception are finely mapped and aligned in the adult somatosensory (S1) cortex, but in infancy, when pain behaviour is disorganised and poorly directed, nociceptive maps may be less refined. We compared the topographic pattern of S1 activation following noxious (clinically required heel lance) and innocuous (touch) mechanical stimulation of the same skin region in newborn infants (n=32) using multi-optode functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Within S1 cortex, touch and lance of the heel elicit localised, partially overlapping increases in oxygenated haemoglobin concentration (D[HbO]), but while touch activation was restricted to the heel area, lance activation extended into cortical hand regions. The data reveals a widespread cortical nociceptive map in infant S1, consistent with their poorly directed pain behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A cryptic K48 ubiquitin chain binding site on UCH37 is required for its role in proteasomal degradation</a></h4>

              
                Degradation by the 26 S proteasome is an intricately regulated process fine tuned by the precise nature of ubiquitin modifications attached to a protein substrate. By debranching ubiquitin chains composed of K48 linkages, the proteasome-associated ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCHL5/UCH37 serves as a positive regulator of protein degradation. How UCH37 achieves specificity for K48 chains is unclear. Here, we use a combination of hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry, chemical crosslinking, small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular docking, and targeted mutagenesis to uncover a cryptic K48 ubiquitin (Ub) chain-specific binding site on the opposite face of UCH37 relative to the canonical S1 (cS1) ubiquitin-binding site. Biochemical assays demonstrate the K48 chain-specific binding site is required for chain debranching and proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins modified with branched chains. Using quantitative proteomics, translation shutoff experiments, and linkage-specific affinity tools, we then identify specific proteins whose degradation depends on the debranching activity of UCH37. Our findings suggest that UCH37 and potentially other DUBs could use more than one S1 site to perform different biochemical functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oxytocin neurons mediate the effect of social isolation via the VTA circuits</a></h4>

              
                Social interaction during adolescence strongly influences brain function and behavior, and the recent pandemic has emphasized the devastating effect of social distancing on mental health. While accumulating evidence has shown the importance of the reward system in encoding specific aspects of social interaction, the consequences of social isolation on the reward system and the development of social skills later in adulthood are still largely unknown. Here, we found that one week of social isolation during adolescence in male mice increased social interaction at the expense of social habituation and social novelty preference. Behavioral changes were accompanied by the acute hyperexcitability of putative dopamine (pDA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and long-lasting expression of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at excitatory inputs onto pDA neurons that project to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Social isolation-dependent behavioral deficits and changes in neural activity and synaptic plasticity were reversed by chemogenetic inhibition of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These results demonstrate that social isolation in male mice has acute and long-lasting effects on social interaction and suggest that homeostatic adaptations mediate these effects within the reward circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural connectivity molecules best identify the heterogeneous clock and dopaminergic cell types in the Drosophila adult brain</a></h4>

              
                Our recent single cell sequencing of most adult Drosophila circadian neurons indicated striking gene expression heterogeneity, about 2-3 cells per clock neuron group. To extend this characterization to other adult fly brain neurons, we used the identical plate-based methods to generate single cell data from a similar subset of dopaminergic neurons. To minimize batch effects and to apply an additional sequencing strategy, we also assayed these two populations together with 10X Chromium. An unsupervised clustering algorithm indicates that dopaminergic neurons are comparably heterogeneous, suggesting that the transcriptomic diversity of adult fly brain neurons parallels its EM connectome. The results here further indicate that connectivity molecules like cell surface molecules best characterize all neuron groups. We suggest that these surprising features are general and make major contributions to neuronal identity and connectivity of the adult central brain as well as underlie the complex behavioral repertoire of Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual prediction tendencies facilitate cortical speech tracking</a></h4>

              
                Listening can be conceptualized as a process of active inference, in which the brain forms internal models to predict and integrate auditory information in a complex interaction of bottom-up and top-down processes. Whether inter-individual "prediction tendencies" shape listening experiences of real-world stimuli such as speech is, however, unknown. In the current study, we used a passive paradigm presenting tone sequences of varying entropy level, to independently quantify auditory prediction tendency (as the tendency to anticipate low-level acoustic features according to their contextual probability) for each individual. This measure was then used to predict the magnitude of cortical speech (envelope) tracking in a multi speaker listening task, where participants listened to audiobooks narrated by a target speaker in isolation or interfered by 1 or 2 distractors. Furthermore, rare semantic violations were introduced into the story, enabling us to also examine effects of word surprisal during continuous speech processing. Our results show that individual prediction tendency facilitates cortical speech tracking. Furthermore, we find interactions between individual prediction tendency and background noise as well as word surprisal in disparate brain regions. In sum, our findings suggest that individual prediction tendencies are generalizable across different listening situations and may serve as a valuable element to explain interindividual differences in natural listening experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cocaine regulation of Nr4a1 chromatin bivalency and mRNA in male and female mice.</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUNDCocaine epigenetically regulates gene expression via changes in histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs). We previously found that the immediate early gene Nr4a1 is epigenetically activated by cocaine in mouse brain reward regions. HPTMs act combinatorically, yet few studies examine multiple HPTMs at a single gene. Bivalent gene promoters are simultaneously enriched in both activating (H3K4me3 (K4)) and repressive (H3K27me3 (K27)) HPTMs. As such, bivalent genes are lowly expressed but poised for activity-dependent gene regulation. In the current study, we defined regulation of K4&K27 bivalency at Nr4a1 following cocaine treatment in male and female mice. The inclusion of female mice can shed light on the epidemiological relevance of sex to cocaine use disorder.

METHODSMale and female mice were injected with saline or cocaine (i.p. 20mg/kg). We applied sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR to define Nr4a1 bivalency and expression in striatum (STR), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus (HPC). Pearsons correlation matrices quantified relationships within each brain region across treatment conditions for each sex.

RESULTSWe defined K4&K27 bivalency at the Nr4a1 promoter in all three brain regions, in both sexes. In female STR, cocaine increased Nr4a1 mRNA, coupled to maintenance of Nr4a1 K4&K27 bivalency. In male STR, cocaine enriched repressive H3K27me3 and K4&K27 bivalency at Nr4a1 and failed to increase Nr4a1 mRNA. Furthermore, cocaine epigenetically regulated a putative NR4A1 target, Cartpt, in male PFC.

CONCLUSIONThis study defined the epigenetic regulation of Nr4a1 in reward brain regions in male and female mice. Cocaine treatment in female mice increased Nr4a1 mRNA in STR, but there was no change in Nr4a1 H3K27me3 or K4&K27 promoter bivalency. Following cocaine treatment in male mice, Nr4a1 mRNA did not change in STR, HPC, or PFC, and Nr4a1 H3K27me3 and K4&K27 promoter bivalency increased in the STR.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral Hippocampal Infusions of C20:0 Ceramide Stimulate Microglia and Induce Anhedonia-like Behavior in Female and Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                Increased long-chain C20:0 ceramides have been found in the serum of patients with depression. Moreover, ceramides are linked with increased microglia reactivity and inflammatory cytokine production, which are associated with depression. Since ceramides can readily cross the blood brain barrier, peripheral C20:0 ceramides could enter the brain, activate microglia, and induce depressive-like behavior. In this study, we determined whether localized infusion of C20:0 ceramides into the ventral hippocampus (VH) of rats is sufficient to activate microglia and induce depressive-like behaviors. Adult male and female rats received infusions of C20:0 ceramides or vehicle solution every other day for 2 weeks. After the third infusion, C20:0-infused animals showed reduced sucrose preference suggesting anhedonia-like behavior. However, 4-6 days after the last infusion, animals infused with C20:0 ceramides did not show anhedonia-like or despair-like behavior suggesting the behavioral effect was reversible. After the final behavioral test, C20:0-infused animals had more Iba-1+ microglia in the VH. Despite the increased number of VH microglia, the expression of inflammatory genes was not increased. In conclusion, our data suggest that localized increases in C20:0 ceramides in the VH are sufficient to induce microglia activation and reversible anhedonia-like behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of sleep continuity disruption on multimodal emotion processing and regulation: a laboratory-based, randomized, controlled experiment in good sleepers</a></h4>

              
                Previous research shows that experimental sleep deprivation alters emotion processing, suggesting a potential mechanism linking sleep disruption to mental ill-health. Extending previous work, we experimentally disrupted sleep continuity in good sleepers and assessed next-day emotion processing and regulation using tasks with established sensitivity to depression. In a laboratory-based study, 51 good sleepers (37 female; mean age = 24 years, SD= 3.63) were randomized to one night (23:00-07:00) of uninterrupted sleep (n=24) or sleep continuity disruption (n=27). We assessed emotion perception, attention, and memory the following day. Participants also completed an emotion regulation task and measures of self-reported affect, anxiety, sleepiness, overnight declarative memory consolidation, and psychomotor vigilance. Confirming the effects of the manipulation, sleep continuity disruption led to a marked decrease in polysomnography-defined total sleep time (229.98 mins vs 434.57 mins), increased wake-time after sleep onset (260.66 mins vs 23.84 mins) and increased sleepiness (d=0.81). Sleep continuity disruption led to increased anxiety (d=0.68), decreased positive affect (d=-0.62), reduced overnight declarative memory consolidation (d=-1.08) and reduced psychomotor vigilance [longer reaction times (d=0.64) and more lapses (d=0.74)], relative to control. However, contrary to our hypotheses, experimental sleep disruption had no effect on perception of, or bias for, emotional facial expressions, emotional memory for words, or emotion regulation following worry induction. In conclusion, one night of sleep continuity disruption had no appreciable effect on objective measures of emotion processing or emotion regulation in response to worry induction, despite clear effects on memory consolidation, vigilance, and self-reported affect and anxiety.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Protein preference and elevated plasma FGF21 induced by dietary protein restriction is similar in both male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals that are moderately protein restricted respond to this dietary stress by increasing consumption of protein-containing foods. This is true in many species, including rodents. Rodent models of protein restriction have typically relied on only male subjects, and there are plausible reasons why female rodents may respond differently to dietary protein restriction. To address this gap in knowledge, the current experiments examined protein preference after two weeks on a 5% protein diet or 20% protein control diet, in male and female mice. We found that female mice, like male mice, increase consumption of 4% casein (protein) relative to 4% maltodextrin (carbohydrate) when presented with both simultaneously. Interestingly, this increased consumption was due to more bursts in females and more licks per burst in males, indicating possible differences in mechanism by which increased intake is achieved. Stage of the estrous cycle did not affect female responses. Moreover, we measured plasma FGF21 - a hormone induced by protein restriction and necessary for protein preference - in male and female mice. Here, we found no statistical differences between protein-restricted males, females in diestrus, or females in proestrus. In non-restricted mice FGF21 levels were low, but significantly higher in females in proestrus than females in diestrus or males. Overall, these experiments highlight the importance of including female subjects in studies of food choice and macronutrient restriction.

Highlights- Protein-restricted male and female mice exhibit protein preference
- Estrous cycle stage does not influence protein preference
- Estrous cycle stage does not affect plasma FGF21 during protein restriction
- Non-restricted females in proestrus have higher FGF21 than those in diestrus or males

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synapses learn to utilize pre-synaptic noise for the prediction of postsynaptic dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use their noise to represent uncertainties about the activity of the post-synaptic neuron. To show this we utilize the free-energy principle (FEP), a well-established theoretical framework to describe the ability of organisms to self-organize and survive in uncertain environments. This principle provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral functions such as attention or foraging, to the dynamics of single microcircuits in the brain, suggesting that the FEP can be used to describe all levels of brain function. The synapse-centric account of the FEP that is pursued here, suggests that synapses form an internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics, being updated by a synaptic learning rule that resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. This approach entails that a synapse utilizes noisy processes like stochastic synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate their noise processes to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.

                Despite significant advances in identifying genetic drivers of neurodegenerative disorders, the majority of affected individuals lack molecular genetic diagnosis, with somatic mutations proposed as one potential contributor to increased risk. Here, we report the first cell-type-specific map of somatic mosaicism in Alzheimers Dementia (AlzD), using 4,014 cells from prefrontal cortex samples of 19 AlzD and 17 non-AlzD individuals. We integrate full-transcript single-nucleus RNA-seq (SMART-Seq) with matched individual-level whole-genome sequencing to jointly infer mutational events and the cell-type in which they occurred. AlzD individuals show increased mutational burden, localized in excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and disease-associated "senescent" cells. High-mutational-burden cells showed mutational enrichment and similar single-cell expression profiles in AlzD cases versus non-AlzD individuals, indicating cellular-level genotype-to-phenotype correlation. Somatic mutations are specifically enriched for known AlzD genes, and implicate biologically meaningful cell-type specific processes, including: neuronal energy regulation, endocytic trafficking (NEFM), lipid metabolism (CNP, CRYAB), proteostasis (USP34), cytoskeleton, and microtubule dynamics (MACF1).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Organization of the corticotropin-releasing hormone and corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein systems in the central nervous system of the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus</a></h4>

              
                The expression of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (PmCRH) and the CRH-binding protein (PmCRHBP) mRNAs was studied by in situ hybridization in the brain of prolarvae, larvae and adults of the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus. We also generated an antibody against the PmCRH mature peptide to study the distribution of PmCRH-immunoreactive cells and fibers. PmCRH immunohistochemistry was combined with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry, PmCRHBP in situ hybridization or neurobiotin transport from the spinal cord. The most numerous PmCRH-expressing cells were observed in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus-paraventricular nucleus and in the superior and medial rhombencephalic reticular formation. PmCRH expression was more extended in adults than in larvae, and some cell populations were mainly (olfactory bulb) or only (striatum, ventral hypothalamus, prethalamus) observed in adults. The preopto-paraventricular fibers form conspicuous tracts coursing towards the neurohypophysis, but many immunoreactive fibers were also observed coursing in many other brain regions. Brain descending fibers in the spinal cord come from cells located in the isthmus and in the medial rhombencephalic reticular nucleus. The distribution of PmCRHBP-expressing neurons was different from that of PmCRH cells, with cells mainly present in the septum, striatum, preoptic region, tuberal hypothalamus, pretectum, pineal complex, isthmus, reticular formation, and spinal cord. Again, expression in adults was more extended than in larvae. PmCRH- and PmCRHBP-expressing cells are different, excluding colocalization of these substances in the same neuron. Present findings reveal a complex CRH/CRHBP system in the brain of the oldest extant vertebrate group, the agnathans, which shows similarities but important divergences with that of mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chemogenetic disconnection between the orbitofrontal cortex and the rostromedial caudate nucleus disrupts motivational control of goal-directed action</a></h4>

              
                The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and its major downstream target within the basal ganglia--the rostromedial caudate nucleus (rmCD)--are involved in reward-value processing and goal-directed behavior. However, a causal contribution of the pathway linking these two structures to goal-directed behavior has not been established. Using the chemogenetic technology of Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs with a crossed inactivation design, we functionally and reversibly disrupted interactions between the OFC and rmCD in two male macaque monkeys. We injected an adeno-associated virus vector expressing an inhibitory designer receptor (hM4Di) into the OFC and contralateral rmCD, the expression of which was visualized in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) and confirmed by post-mortem immunohistochemistry. Functional disconnection of the OFC and rmCD resulted in a significant and reproducible loss of sensitivity to the cued reward value for goal-directed action. This decreased sensitivity was most prominent when monkeys had accumulated a certain amount of reward. These results provide causal evidence that the interaction between the OFC and the rmCD is needed for motivational control of action on the basis of the relative reward value and internal drive. This finding extends current understanding of the physiological basis of psychiatric disorders in which goal-directed behavior is affected, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Significance StatementIn daily life, we routinely adjust the speed and accuracy of our actions on the basis of the value of expected reward. Abnormalities in these kinds of motivational adjustments might be related to behaviors seen in psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the current study, we show that the connection from the orbitofrontal cortex to the rostromedial caudate nucleus is essential formotivational control of action in monkeys. This finding expands our knowledge about how the primate brain controls motivation and behavior and provides a particular insight into disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder, in which altered connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the striatum has been implicated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced Mirror Neuron Network Activity and Effective Connectivity during Live Interaction</a></h4>

              
                Facial expressions are indispensable for daily communication. Previous neuroimaging studies investigating facial expression processing presented pre-recorded stimuli and lacked live face-to-face interactions. Our paradigm alternated between presentations of models real-time performance and pre-recorded videos of dynamic facial expressions to participants. Simultaneous fMRI and facial electromyography activity recordings, as well as post-scan valence and arousal ratings were acquired. Live facial expressions enhanced the subjective valence and arousal ratings as well as facial muscular responses. Live performances showed greater engagement of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) more, and modulated the effective connectivity between them. A support vector machine reliably classified multivoxel activation patterns in brain regions involved in dynamic facial expression processing in mentalizing and salience networks. The results suggest that live social interaction modulates the activity and connectivity of the right mirror neuron system and enhances spontaneous mimicry, further facilitating emotional contagion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circulating U13 small nucleolar RNA as a candidate biomarker for Huntington's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background and ObjectivesFluid biomarkers are a recent field of interest in Huntington disease (HD). We focused on small circulating RNAs from plasma of subjects with prodromal (pre-HD) and overt disease by a two-stage approach: an unbiased investigation by an array method and a validation study to quantify a significant small nucleolar RNA.

MethodsThrough Affymetrix Gene-Chip-miRNA-Array we performed an exploratory study on 9 HD patients, 8 healthy subjects (HS) and 5 psychiatric patients (PP; who share drugs with HD patients, to control for iatrogenic effects). Through real time PCR we validated the results in an independent population of 24 HD patients, 15 pre-HD, 24 PP, 28 Alzheimers disease (AD) patients (added to control the disease-specificity of our finding) and 23 HS. A bioinformatic analysis was also performed to interpret our finding.

ResultsThe microarray results showed a significant signal for U13 small nucleolar RNA (SNORD13) that was increased in plasma of HD patients compared to controls (fold change, 1.54, p =0.003 HD vs. HS, and fold change 1.44 p = 0.0026 HD vs. PP). In the validation population the significant increase in HD patients was evident compared to both pre-HD and the three control groups (p<0.00001). The plasma levels of SNORD13 correlated with the status of mutant huntingtin carrier and the disease duration (respectively R=0.69; p<0.000001; R=0.49; p=0.015). Through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we showed high accuracy of plasmatic SNORD13 in discriminating HD patients from pre-HD and control groups (AUC=0.963), outperforming values reported in another study for intrathecal or plasmatic mutant huntingtin and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers of overt HD. The bioinformatic analysis on SNORD13 interactome and pathway analysis showed enrichments for factors involved in nuclear functions beyond the ribosome biogenesis.

DiscussionWe report the unprecedented finding of a potential role of small nucleolar RNAs in HD. Circulating SNORD13 seems a good biomarker for clinical purposes. It seems to be specific for HD and to peripherally report a plausible  tipping point in the pathogenic cascade at neuronal level, possibly paving the way for new therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting diverse operational regimes in recurrent spiking networks</a></h4>

              
                Neural computations emerge from recurrent neural circuits that comprise hundreds to a few thousand neurons. Continuous progress in connectomics, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging require tractable spiking network models that can consistently incorporate new information about the network structure and reproduce the recorded neural activity features. However, it is challenging to predict which spiking network connectivity configurations and neural properties can generate fundamental operational states and specific experimentally reported nonlinear cortical computations. Theoretical descriptions for the computational state of cortical spiking circuits are diverse, including the balanced state where excitatory and inhibitory inputs balance almost perfectly or the inhibition stabilized state (ISN) where the excitatory part of the circuit is unstable. It remains an open question whether these states can co-exist with experimentally reported nonlinear computations and whether they can be recovered in biologically realistic implementations of spiking networks. Here, we show how to identify spiking network connectivity patterns underlying diverse nonlinear computations such as XOR, bistability, inhibitory stabilization, supersaturation, and persistent activity. We established a mapping between the stabilized supralinear network (SSN) and spiking activity which allowed us to pinpoint the location in parameter space where these activity regimes occur. Notably, we found that biologically-sized spiking networks can have irregular asynchronous activity that does not require strong excitation-inhibition balance or large feedforward input and we showed that the dynamic firing rate trajectories in spiking networks can be precisely targeted without error-driven training algorithms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisite imaging of neural activity using a genetically encoded calcium sensor in the honey bee Apis mellifera</a></h4>

              
                Sociality is classified as one of the major transitions in evolution, and the most advanced level of sociality is found in eusocial insects such as the honey bees. This sophisticated social behavior seems to be associated with higher cognitive abilities in these insects, however the study of their neural bases has been limited by the lack of tools that allow measuring neuronal activity simultaneously in different brain regions of the honey bee brain. Here, we developed the first pan-neuronal genetic driver in a Hymenopteran model organism, the honey bee, and expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f under the control of the honey bee synapsin promoter. We show that GCaMP6f is widely expressed in the honey bee brain, allowing to record neural activity from multiple brain regions simultaneously, including from poorly investigated brain regions such as the mushroom body calyces or the lateral horn. Our recordings show that while odorant quality (chemical structure) and quantity are faithfully encoded in the honeybee antennal lobe, odor coding in the lateral horn departs from this simple physico-chemical coding, in line with the role of this structure in coding the biological value of odorants. These brain recordings represent the first use of a neurogenetic tool for recording neural activity in a eusocial insect.

                Synaptic proteins are immobilized at synapses via interactions with scaffolding proteins. Scaffolding proteins for glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses have been extensively studied; however, far less is known about how scaffolds shape the function of cholinergic synapses. Here we analyze the role of two C. elegans post-synaptic scaffolding proteins (LIN-2/CASK and FRM-3/FARP) at cholinergic neuromuscular junctions. Constitutive knockouts or muscle specific inactivation of lin-2 and frm-3 dramatically reduced spontaneous and evoked post-synaptic currents. These synaptic defects resulted from decreased abundance of post-synaptic ionotropic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and decreased presynaptic ACh release. Thus, our findings show that post-synaptic LIN-2/FRM-3 complexes coordinately control pre- and post-synaptic function, thereby promoting cholinergic synaptic transmission.

                Despite limited evidence for competent infection and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system (CNS), neurologic dysfunction is a common post-acute medical condition reported in "recovered" COVID-19 patients. To identify a potential noninfectious route for SARS-CoV-2-mediated neurological damage, we constructed colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots linked to micelles decorated with spike protein (COVID-QDs) as a biomimetic to interrogate how blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysregulation may subsequently induce neuroinflammation in the absence of infection. In transwell co-culture of endothelial bEnd.3 monolayers and primary neuroglia, we exposed only the bEnd.3 monolayers to COVID-QDs and examined by fluorescence microscopy whether such treatment led to (i) increased inflammation and leakage across the bEnd.3 monolayers, (ii) permeability of the COVID-QDs across the monolayers, and (iii) induction of neuroinflammation in neuroglial cultures. The results of our study provide evidence of neuroinflammatory hallmarks in cultured neurons and astrocytes without direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2-like nanoparticles. Additionally, we found that pre-treatment of our co-cultures with a small-molecule, broad-spectrum inhibitor of mixed lineage and leucine rich repeat kinases led to reversal of the observed dysregulation in endothelial monolayers and resulted in neuroglial protection. The results reported here may serve to guide future studies into the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 mediates neurologic dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cluster-Based Inference for Memory-Based Cognition</a></h4>

              
                This paper proposes a model of hippocampal-based category learning using a cluster-based inference framework which produces two systems (i) an extendable cluster-based memory module (CMM) that provides representations of learning episodes with strong pattern separation, and supports online decision making during that learning, (ii) cluster-based task modules (CTMs) which consolidate clusters learnt by CMM to support higher-accuracy decision making in the mid-term. Learning in CMMs optimises the joint probability of stimuli and category labels, whereas learning in CTMs optimises the probability of categories given stimuli. The latter system learns from the former via a process of "cluster consolidation". We apply the model to data from a behavioral learning task and find that, as well as improving categorisation performance, cluster consolidation decreases recognition scores for old cues but increases them for novel cues. This model-based perspective explains forgetting and false memory effects as serving future categorisation performance. The paper also expresses a view that models of memorybased cognition should provide human-level performance on complex categorisation tasks, and do so with minimal labelled data. In working toward this goal we therefore compared the accuracy of CMM- and CTM-based decision making to standard Softmax Regression approaches on benchmark machine learning datasets. This produced mixed results. We found some significant improvements of CMM over Softmax Regression and of CTM over CMM. Overall, our framework reconciles complementary learning systems theory with more recent findings from cognitive neuroscience of generative replay and hippocampal-based generalisation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissection of a sensorimotor circuit that regulates aversion to odors and pathogenic bacteria in C. elegans by whole-brain simulation</a></h4>

              
                Altering behavior to reduce pathogen exposure is a key line of defense against pathogen attack for nearly all animals. The use of Caenorhabditis elegans bacterial infection models have allowed for many insights into the molecular mechanisms of behavioral immunity. However, the neural circuitry between chemosensory neurons that sense pathogenic bacterial cues and the motor neurons responsible for avoidance-associated locomotion remains unknown. We found that backward locomotion was a component of learned pathogen avoidance, as animals pre-exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Enterococcus faecalis showed reflexive aversion to drops of the bacteria, requiring ASI, AWB, and AWC neurons and ASE, AWB, and AWC neurons, respectively. This response also involved intestinal distention and, for E. faecalis, required expression of TRPM channels in the intestine and excretory system. Using whole-brain simulation and functional assays, we uncovered a sensorimotor circuit governing learned reflexive aversion. This behavior is controlled by a four-layer neural circuit composed of olfactory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons that control backward locomotion crucial for learned reflexive aversion to pathogenic bacteria, learned avoidance, and a repulsive odor. The discovery of a complete sensorimotor circuit for reflexive aversion demonstrates the utility of using the C. elegans connectome and computational modeling in uncovering new neuronal regulators of behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABAergic regulation of cell proliferation within the adult mouse spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Manipulation of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation in the postnatal CNS is receiving significant attention due to therapeutic potential. In the spinal cord, such manipulations may promote repair in conditions such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, but may also limit excessive cell proliferation contributing to tumours such as ependymomas. Here we show that when ambient GABA is increased in vigabatrin-treated or decreased in glutamic acid decarboxylase67-green fluorescent protein (GAD67-GFP) mice, the numbers of proliferating cells respectively decreased or increased. Thus, intrinsic spinal cord GABA levels are correlated with the extent of cell proliferation, providing important evidence for the possibility of manipulating these levels. Diazepam binding inhibitor, an endogenous protein that interacts with GABA receptors and its breakdown product, octadecaneuropeptide, which preferentially activates central benzodiazepine (CBR) sites, were highly expressed in the spinal cord, especially in ependymal cells surrounding the central canal. Furthermore, animals with reduced CBR activation via treatment with flumazenil or Ro15-4513, or with a G2F77I mutation in the CBR binding site had greater numbers of Ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine positive cells compared to control, which maintained their stem cell status since the proportion of newly proliferated cells becoming oligodendrocytes or astrocytes was significantly lower. Altering endogenous GABA levels or modulating GABAergic signaling through specific sites on the GABA receptors therefore influences NSC proliferation in the adult spinal cord. These findings provide a basis for further study into how GABAergic signaling could be manipulated to enable spinal cord self-regeneration and recovery or limit pathological proliferative activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential regulation of gene expression pathways with dexamethasone and ACTH after early life seizures</a></h4>

              
                Early-life seizures (ELS) are associated with persistent cognitive deficits such as ADHD and memory impairment. These co-morbidities have a dramatic negative impact on the quality of life of patients. Therapies that improve cognitive outcomes have enormous potential to improve patients quality of life. Our previous work in a rat flurothyl-induction model showed that administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) at time of seizure induction led to improved learning and memory in the animals despite no effect on seizure latency or duration. Administration of dexamethasone (Dex), a corticosteroid, did not have the same positive effect on learning and memory and has even been shown to exacerbate injury in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. We hypothesized that ACTH exerted positive effects on cognitive outcomes through beneficial changes to gene expression and proposed that administration of ACTH at seizure induction would return gene-expression in the brain towards the normal pattern of expression in the Control animals whereas Dex would not. Twenty-six Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into vehicle- Control, and ACTH-, Dex-, and vehicle-ELS. Rat pups were subjected to 60 flurothyl seizures from P5 to P15. After seizure induction, brains were removed and the hippocampus and PFC were dissected, RNA was extracted and sequenced, and differential expression analysis was performed using generalized estimating equations. Differential expression analysis showed that ACTH pushes gene expression in the brain back to a more normal state of expression through enrichment of pathways involved in supporting homeostatic balance and down-regulating pathways that might contribute to excitotoxic cell-damage post-ELS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tbx3 is required for mammalian retinal angiogenesis.</a></h4>

              
                Neural tissue formation requires coordinated, interwoven development of both neural and vascular cells. Spatially distinct regions of the central nervous system (CNS) express factors that are predicted to affect vasculature in one area but not another, yet an example of this idea has not been found. Due to its accessibility, the eye is an excellent tissue to study this question. The factor TBX3 is required for frog eye development, yet its role in mammalian eye formation was not known. To determine how Tbx3 loss-of-function affected eye formation, we crossed the validated Tbx3-floxed mice with the optic cup-Cre recombinase driver, BAC-Dkk3-CRE. We confirmed earlier expression studies of Tbx3 RNA and protein in the embryonic dorsal optic vesicle and, postnatally, in sporadic clusters of cells of the inner nuclear layer. Surprisingly, we also found TBX3 in astrocyte precursors at P0. With Tbx3 loss, blood vessels were malformed throughout the retina, but with more severe effects seen in the dorsal retina. Astrocyte precursors were reduced in number and failed to form a lattice at the dorsal edge. We next examined retinal ganglion cells, as they have been shown to play a critical role in retinal angiogenesis. We found that a subset of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) were missing melanopsin in the dorsal half of the retina. In previous studies, loss of melanopsin has been linked to hyaloid artery persistence, which we also observed in the Tbx3 cKO retina. Together, these results show that TBX3 is required for retinal angiogenesis.

Summary StatementTBX3 is a multifunctional protein important for frog eye development. This is the first study showing that TBX3 is critical for mammalian eye formation, controlling the function of key cells required for angiogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor pattern generation is robust to neural network anatomical imbalance favoring inhibition but not excitation</a></h4>

              
                Animals display rich and coordinated motor patterns during walking and running. Previous modelling as well as experimental results suggest that the balance between excitation and inhibition in neural networks may be critical for generating such structured motor patterns. However, biological neural networks have an anatomical imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neural populations. We explore the influence of such an anatomical imbalance on the ability of a reservoir computing artificial neural network to learn human locomotor patterns for slow walking, fast walking and running. We varied the numbers of neurons, connections percentages and connection strengths of excitatory and inhibitory populations. We showed that performance depended on the network anatomy. First, it deteriorated when the total number of neurons was too small or the total connection strength was too large. Second, performance was critically dependent on the balance between excitation and inhibition. Imbalance towards excitation caused a reduction in the richness of internal network dynamics, leading to a stereotypical motor output and poor overall performance. In contrast, rich internal dynamics and good overall performance were found when the network anatomy was either balanced or imbalanced towards inhibition. This suggests that motor pattern generation may be robust to increased inhibition but not increased excitation in neural networks.

1 Author summaryHow does the anatomy of the nervous system allow the generation of the complex motor patterns observed during the movements of humans and other animals? We explore this question in a model of the spinal cord in which we vary the neural anatomy. We find that movement generation requires the neural network to have rich internal dynamics. Such rich internal dynamics emerge from the interaction between the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the network. Strong inhibition causes fluctuations in the neural activity which allow rich motor patterns to be produced. However, strong excitation quenches these fluctuations and causes a reduction in the variability of motor patterns. When both excitation and inhibition are strong, the neural activity becomes chaotic, and dysfunctional, highly variable motor patterns are produced. We therefore predict that diseases of the nervous system which affect inhibitory and excitatory neurons differently will have a different signature in terms of motor patterns. Diseases causing increased excitation in neural circuits should lead to stereotypical motor behaviors, whereas diseases causing increased excitation and inhibition should lead to unstable motor patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mind the gap: decoding decreases in tonic firing in populations of spiking neurons</a></h4>

              
                A stimulus can be encoded in a population of spiking neurons through any change in the statistics of their spike patterns. Thus, the baseline spike statistics in the absence of a stimulus can impact the populations encoding capacity. Some neurons maintain a baseline firing pattern and can decrease their spike rate in response to a stimulus. Not only do baseline firing rates vary widely among different types of neurons, but so do their higher-order statistics, like the degree to which they tend to group their spikes together into bursts and how those bursts are grouped across the population. We investigated how higher-order statistics of baseline spike patterns impact how much information a neural population can transmit about a stimulus that drives a gap in firing using a novel information-theoretic decoding mechanism which we call an "information train." We discover that there is an optimal level of burstiness for gap detection that is robust to other parameters of the neural population like its size, mean firing rate, and level of correlation. We consider this theoretical result in the context of experimental data from different types of retinal ganglion cells with different baseline spike statistics and determine that the spike statistics of bursty suppressed-by-contrast (bSbC) retinal ganglion cells support nearly optimal detection of both the onset and strength of a contrast step.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Upregulated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum leads to impaired presynaptic function in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals is primarily regulated by rapid Ca2+ influx through membrane-resident voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). Also, accumulating evidence indicates that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is extensively present in axonal terminals of neurons and plays a modulatory role in synaptic transmission by regulating Ca2+ levels. Alzheimers disease (AD) is marked by enhanced Ca2+ release from the ER and downregulation of Ca2+ buffering proteins. However, the precise consequence of impaired Ca2+ signalling within the vicinity of VGCCs (active zone (AZ)) on exocytosis is poorly understood. Here, we perform in-silico experiments of intracellular Ca2+ signalling and exocytosis in a detailed biophysical model of hippocampal synapses to investigate the effect of aberrant Ca2+ signalling on neurotransmitter release in AD. Our model predicts that enhanced Ca2+ release from the ER increases the probability of neurotransmitter release in AD. Moreover, over very short timescales (30-60 msec), the model exhibits activity-dependent and enhanced short-term plasticity in AD, indicating neuronal hyperactivity--a hallmark of the disease. Similar to previous observations in AD animal models, our model reveals that during prolonged stimulation (~450 msec), pathological Ca2+ signalling increases depression and desynchronization with stimulus, causing affected synapses to operate unreliably. Overall, our work provides direct evidence in support of a crucial role played by altered Ca2+ homeostasis mediated by intracellular stores in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural resources shift under Methylphenidate: a computational approach to examine anxiety-cognition interplay</a></h4>

              
                The reciprocal interplay between anxiety and cognition is well documented. Anxiety negatively impacts cognition, while cognitive engagement can down-regulate anxiety. The brain mechanisms and dynamics underlying such interplay are not fully understood. To study this question, we experimentally and orthogonally manipulated anxiety (using a threat of shock paradigm) and cognition (using methylphenidate; MPH). The effects of these manipulations on the brain and behavior were evaluated in 50 healthy participants (25 MPH, 25 placebo), using an n-back working memory fMRI task (with low and high load conditions). Behaviorally, improved response accuracy was observed as a main effect of the drug across all conditions. We employed two approaches to understand the neural mechanisms underlying MPH-based cognitive enhancement in safe and threat conditions. First, we performed a hypothesis-driven computational analysis using a mathematical framework to examine how MPH putatively affects cognitive enhancement in the face of induced anxiety across two levels of cognitive load. Second, we performed an exploratory data analysis using Topological Data Analysis (TDA)-based Mapper to examine changes in spatiotemporal brain activity across the entire cortex. Both approaches provided converging evidence that MPH facilitated greater differential engagement of neural resources (brain activity) across low and high working memory load conditions. Furthermore, load-based differential management of neural resources reflects enhanced efficiency that is most powerful during higher load and induced anxiety conditions. Overall, our results provide novel insights regarding brain mechanisms that facilitate cognitive enhancement under MPH and, in future research, may be used to help mitigate anxiety-related cognitive underperformance.

                Recent advances in head-mounted microscopes have enabled imaging of neuronal activity using genetic-tools in freely moving mice but these microscopes are restricted to recording in minimally lit arenas and imaging upper cortical layers. Here we built a 2 gram, three-photon excitation-based microscope, containing a z-drive that enabled access to all cortical layers while mice freely behaved in a fully lit environment. We show that neuronal population activity in cortical layer-4 and layer-6 was differentially modulated by lit and dark conditions during free exploration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bridging scales from spiking activity to the local field potential through latent dynamics</a></h4>

              
                During wakefulness, cortical networks exhibit diverse states of activity arising from fluctuations in modulatory inputs, any of which may shape the recorded neural activity across a range of scales, from local field potential (LFP) to the spiking of individual neurons. Multiple studies have uncovered state-dependent changes in single neuron activity specific to cell type. These changes are heterogeneous across cell types, suggesting that there is a link between changes in states of wakefulness and the dynamic patterns of spiking activity across the population, yet this is currently not well understood. Here, we use an unsupervised statistical modeling framework to link fluctuations in the state of the LFP to the dynamics of spiking activity of populations of neurons in the whisker area of primary somatosensory cortex of awake male mice. By identifying latent states from population spiking activity, we show that these spiking states are more informative of states of the LFP than a direct readout of the spiking activity of single neurons or of the population. Further, we find that the latent spiking states predict trial-by-trial variability in sensory responses as well as one aspect of behavior, whisking activity. Taken together, our approach captures the latent variables that underlie the dynamics of the spiking activity of cortical neuronal populations, providing a framework to relate cortical activity across different scales.

Significance statementDuring wakefulness, variability in cortical activity can arise from shifts in arousal or behavior. We analyze the dynamics of two measures of cortical activity, the spiking activity of local populations of neurons and the local field potential (LFP), typically used to track overall levels of arousal. We show that the latent states that capture variability in population spiking activity are highly predictive of LFP state changes, even more so than spiking activity directly. By linking latent states of spiking activity to changes in the LFP, our novel approach bridges fine-scale microcircuits ensemble activity and the meso-scale LFP. Our latent-state framework opens new avenues for extracting information from the LFP as well as identification of subject-level sources of variability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pallidal neuromodulation of the explore/exploit trade-off in decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Every decision that we make involves a conflict between exploiting our current knowledge of an actions value or exploring alternative courses of action that might lead to a better, or worse outcome. The sub-cortical nuclei that make up the basal ganglia have been proposed as a neural circuit that may contribute to resolving this explore-exploit  dilemma. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of neuromodulating the basal ganglias output nucleus, the globus pallidus interna, in patients who had undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) for isolated dystonia. Neuromodulation enhanced the number of exploratory choices to the lower value option in a 2-armed bandit probabilistic reversal-learning task. Enhanced exploration was explained by a reduction in both rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate) and by the amount of evidence needed to decide (boundary separation) in a reinforcement learning drift diffusion model. We estimated the functional connectivity profile between the stimulating DBS electrode and the rest of the brain using a normative functional connectome derived from heathy controls. Variation in the extent of neuromodulation induced exploration between patients was predicted by the degree of functional connectivity between the stimulating electrode and prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. We conclude that the basal ganglias output nucleus, the globus pallidus interna, can adaptively modify decision choice when faced with the dilemma to explore or exploit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular-enriched functional connectivity in the human brain using multiband multi-echo simultaneous ASL/BOLD fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) is a novel analytical strategy that enriches functional connectivity (FC) information from functional MRI (fMRI) with molecular information on the neurotransmitter distribution density in the human brain, providing a biological basis to the FC analysis. So far, this integrative approach has been used in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI studies only, providing new insights into the brain mechanisms underlying specific disorders and its response to pharmacological challenges. In this study, we demonstrate that the application of REACT can be further extended to arterial spin labelling (ASL) fMRI. Some of the advantages of this extension include the combination of neurotransmitter specific information provided by molecular imaging with a quantitative marker of neuronal activity, the suitability of ASL for pharmacological MRI (phMRI) studies assessing drug effects on baseline brain function, and the possibility to acquire images that are not affected by susceptibility artifacts in the regions linked to major neurotransmitter systems.

In this work, we tested the feasibility of applying REACT to resting state ASL fMRI and compared the molecular-enriched FC maps derived from ASL data with those derived from BOLD data. We applied REACT to high-resolution, whole-brain simultaneous ASL/BOLD resting-state fMRI data of 29 healthy subjects and estimated the ASL- and BOLD-based FC maps related to six molecular systems, including the transporters of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and vesicular acetylcholine, and the GABA-A and mGlu5 receptors. We then compared the ASL and BOLD FC maps in terms of spatial similarity, using the Dice Similarity Index and the voxel-wise spatial correlation. On a data subsample (N=19) we also evaluated the test-retest reproducibility of each modality using the regional intraclass correlation coefficient, and compared the two modalities.

Our results showed robust spatial patterns of molecular-enriched functional connectivity for both modalities, moderate to high similarity between BOLD- and ASL-derived FC maps and mixed results in terms of reproducibility (i.e., none of the modalities outperformed the other). Overall, our findings show that the ASL signal is as informative as BOLD in detecting functional circuits associated with specific molecular pathways, and that the two modalities may provide complementary information related to these circuits.

Considering the more direct link of ASL imaging with neuronal acrivity compared to BOLD and its suitability for phMRI studies, this new integrative approach could become a valuable asset in clinical studies investigating functional alterations in patients with brain disorders, or in pharmacological studies investigating the effects of new or existing compounds on the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebral activity in monkeys Papio anubis during the perception of conspecific and heterospecific agonistic vocalizations: A functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy study</a></h4>

              
                Are conspecific emotional vocalizations special? Although often investigated in non-human primates using functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography, it remains unclear whether the listening of conspecific vocal emotions leads to similar or different cerebral activations when compared to heterospecific calls (i.e. expressed by another primate species). Using a neuroimaging technique rarely employed in monkeys so far, functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), the present study investigated cortical temporal activities during exposure to both conspecific and heterospecific calls in three female adult baboons (Papio anubis). The three subjects were lightly anesthetized and passively exposed to agonistic baboon and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) vocalizations, as well as energy matched white noises in order to control for this low-level acoustic feature. Despite inter-individual variabilities, permutation test analyses on the extracted OxyHemoglobin signal revealed for two subjects out of three significant differences between the passive listening of baboon versus chimpanzee stimuli. Additionally, in one subject, a modulation of the left temporal cortex activity was found for the perception of baboon calls contrasted to chimpanzee vocalizations as well as for the passive listening of baboon white noises compared to chimpanzee ones. Although the lack of generalization of those findings in all three subjects prevents us to drawn any conclusion and that more subjects would be needed, the hypothesis that baboons cortical temporal regions may be more sensitive to the processing of conspecific sounds compared to heterospecific stimuli is not excluded. Our study highlights that fNIRS may be a promising alternative to further investigate the auditory mechanisms at play in the right and left baboons temporal cortices for the processing of emotional vocalizations.

	<p>Attention focus changes performance, and external focus (EF) improves performance compared to internal focus (IF). However, recently, the dominance of attention focus, rather than the effectiveness of unilateral EF, has been examined. Although the positive effects of EF on standing postural control have been reported, the dominance of attention focus has not yet been examined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the dominance of attention focus and its neural mechanism in standing postural control using electroencephalography (EEG). A standing postural control task under IF and EF conditions was performed on healthy young men. Gravity center sway and cortical activity simultaneously using a stabilometer and an EEG were measured. Participants were classified into IF-dominant and EF-dominant groups according to their index of postural stability. The EEG was analyzed, and cortical activity in the theta-wave band was compared between the IF-dominant and EF-dominant groups. Significant neural activity was observed in the left parietal lobe of the IF-dominant group in the IF condition, and in the left frontal lobe of the EF-dominant group in the EF condition (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Differences in EEG activity between IF-dominant and EF-dominant groups, in standing postural control, were detected. This contributes to the development of training methods that consider attentional focus dominance in postural control.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to impact global health regarding both morbidity and mortality. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the virus interacts with and influences other organs and tissues, including blood vessel endothelium, heart, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. We are learning much about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, we are just beginning to study and understand the long-term and chronic health consequences. Since the pandemic&amp;amp;rsquo;s beginning in late 2019, older adults, those with pre-existing illnesses, or both, have an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe COVID-19. Furthermore, older adults are also more likely to develop the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), with advanced age as the most significant risk factor. Thus, does SARS-CoV-2 potentially influence, promote, or accelerate the development of PD in older adults? Our initial focus was aimed at understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and the connection to neurodegenerative disorders. We then completed a literature review to assess the relationship between PD and COVID-19. We described potential molecular and cellular pathways that indicate dopaminergic neurons are susceptible, both directly and indirectly, to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We concluded that under certain pathological circumstances, in vulnerable persons-with-Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PwP), SARS-CoV-2 acts as a neurodegenerative enhancer to potentially support the development or progression of PD and its related motor and non-motor symptoms.</p>

	<p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a visual obstacle caused by diabetic disease, which forms because of long-standing diabetes mellitus, which damages the retinal blood vessels. This disease is considered one of the principal causes of sightlessness and accounts for more than 158 million cases all over the world. Since early detection and classification could diminish the visual impairment, it is significant to develop an automated DR diagnosis method. Although deep learning models provide automatic feature extraction and classification, training such models from scratch requires a larger annotated dataset. The availability of annotated training datasets is considered a core issue for implementing deep learning in the classification of medical images. The models based on transfer learning are widely adopted by the researchers to overcome annotated data insufficiency problems and computational overhead. In the proposed study, features are extracted from fundus images using the pre-trained network VGGNet and combined with the concept of transfer learning to improve classification performance. To deal with data insufficiency and unbalancing problems, we employed various data augmentation operations differently on each grade of DR. The results of the experiment indicate that the proposed framework (which is evaluated on the benchmark dataset) outperformed advanced methods in terms of accurateness. Our technique, in combination with handcrafted features, could be used to improve classification accuracy.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous studies have investigated the relationship between schizotypal traits and odor identification ability as well as the relationship between schizotypal traits and odor hedonic capacity in adults. However, very little is known about the relationship among these three factors, especially in children and adolescents. The current study aimed to explore the relationship among these three factors in children and adolescents as well as the potential role of odor identification ability. Method: A total of 355 non-clinical children and adolescents (aged 9&amp;amp;ndash;16 years) were recruited in the study. They were asked to complete the Universal Sniff Test (U-Sniff), the Chemosensory Pleasure Scale for Children (CPS-C), and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire&amp;amp;mdash;Child (SPQ-C). Results: The SPQ-C scores were negatively correlated with both the odor identification scores and the odor hedonic scores (p = 0.022 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Only the interpersonal&amp;amp;ndash;affective factor of the SPQ-C was negatively correlated with the odor identification scores (p = 0.031). The odor identification scores were significantly positively associated with the odor hedonic scores (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, the relationship between odor hedonic capacity and schizotypal traits, especially the interpersonal&amp;amp;ndash;affective factor, was mediated by odor identification ability. Conclusions: Schizotypal traits were negatively correlated with both odor identification ability and odor hedonic capacity in children and adolescents, while odor identification ability was found to mediate the relationship between odor hedonic capacity and schizotypal traits, especially the interpersonal&amp;amp;ndash;affective factor. Our study indicated that improving odor identification ability through olfactory training may have a positive influence on odor hedonic capacity in individuals with schizotypal traits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Identifying Inputs to Visual Projection Neurons in Drosophila Lobula by Analyzing Connectomic Data</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electron microscopy (EM)-based connectomes provide important insights into how visual circuitry of fruit fly <I>Drosophila</I> computes various visual features, guiding and complementing behavioral and physiological studies. However, connectomic analyses of the lobula, a neuropil putatively dedicated to detecting object-like features, remains underdeveloped, largely because of incomplete data on the inputs to the brain region. Here, we attempted to map the columnar inputs into the <I>Drosophila</I> lobula neuropil by performing connectivity-based and morphology-based clustering on a densely reconstructed connectome dataset. While the dataset mostly lacked visual neuropils other than lobula, which would normally help identify inputs to lobula, our clustering analysis successfully extracted clusters of cells with homogeneous connectivity and morphology, likely representing genuine cell types. We were able to draw a correspondence between the resulting clusters and previously identified cell types, revealing previously undocumented connectivity between lobula input and output neurons. While future, more complete connectomic reconstructions are necessary to verify the results presented here, they can serve as a useful basis for formulating hypotheses on mechanisms of visual feature detection in lobula.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Impaired Subcortical Processing of Amplitude-Modulated Tones in Mice Deficient for Cacna2d3, a Risk Gene for Autism Spectrum Disorders in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temporal processing of complex sounds is a fundamental and complex task in hearing and a prerequisite for processing and understanding vocalization, speech, and prosody. Here, we studied response properties of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) in mice lacking <I>Cacna2d3</I>, a risk gene for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3 auxiliary Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subunit encoded by <I>Cacna2d3</I> is essential for proper function of glutamatergic synapses in the auditory brainstem. Recent evidence has shown that much of auditory feature extraction is performed in the auditory brainstem and IC, including processing of amplitude modulation (AM). We determined both spectral and temporal properties of single- and multi-unit responses in the IC of anesthetized mice. IC units of &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed normal tuning properties yet increased spontaneous rates compared with &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>+/+</sup>. When stimulated with AM tones, &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> units exhibited less precise temporal coding and reduced evoked rates to higher modulation frequencies (f<SUB>m</SUB>). Whereas first spike latencies (FSLs) were increased for only few modulation frequencies, population peak latencies were increased for f<SUB>m</SUB> ranging from 20 to 100 Hz in &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> IC units. The loss of precision of temporal coding with increasing f<SUB>m</SUB> from 70 to 160 Hz was characterized using a normalized offset-corrected (Pearson-like) correlation coefficient, which appeared more appropriate than the metrics of vector strength. The processing deficits of AM sounds analyzed at the level of the IC indicate that &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit a subcortical auditory processing disorder (APD). Similar deficits may be present in other mouse models for ASDs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic {theta} Frequency Coordination within and between the Prefrontal Cortex-Hippocampus Circuit during Learning of a Spatial Avoidance Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>-Scale coordination of prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) local field potentials (LFPs) and its influence via direct or indirect projections to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and dorsal hippocampus (dHC) during spatial learning remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that  frequency coordination dynamics within and between the mPFC, dHC, and vHC would be predetermined by the level of connectivity rather than reflecting differing circuit throughput relationships depending on cognitive demands. Moreover, we hypothesized that coherence levels would not change during learning of a complex spatial avoidance task. Adult male rats were bilaterally implanted with EEG electrodes and LFPs recorded in each structure. Contrary to predictions,  coherence averaged across "Early" or "Late" training sessions in the mPFC-HC, mPFC-mPFC, and HC-HC increased as a function of task learning. Coherence levels were also highest between the indirectly connected mPFC-dHC circuit, particularly during early training. Although mPFC postacquisition coherence remained higher with dHC than vHC, dynamic mPFC coherence patterns with both hippocampal poles across avoidance epochs were similar. In the 3 s before avoidance, a regional temporal sequence of transitory coherence peaks emerged between the mPFC-mPFC, the mPFC-HC, and then dHC-dHC. During this sequence, coherence within  bandwidth fluctuated between epochs at distinct subfrequencies, suggesting frequency-specific roles for the propagation of task-relevant processing. On a second timescale, coherence frequency within and between the mPFC and hippocampal septotemporal axis change as a function of avoidance learning and cognitive demand. The results support a role for  coherence subbandwidths, and specifically an 8- to 9-Hz mPFC  signal, for generating and processing qualitatively different types of information in the organization of spatial avoidance behavior in the mPFC-HC circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Listening Zone of Human Electrocorticographic Field Potential Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) recordings provide invaluable insights into neural dynamics in humans because of their unmatched spatiotemporal resolution. Yet, such recordings reflect the combined activity of multiple underlying generators, confounding the ability to resolve spatially distinct neural sources. To empirically quantify the listening zone of icEEG recordings, we computed correlations between signals as a function of distance (full width at half maximum; FWHM) between 8752 recording sites in 71 patients (33 female) implanted with either subdural electrodes (SDEs), stereo-encephalography electrodes (sEEG), or high-density sEEG electrodes. As expected, for both SDEs and sEEGs, higher frequency signals exhibited a sharper fall off relative to lower frequency signals. For broadband high  (BHG) activity, the mean FWHM of SDEs (6.6 &plusmn; 2.5 mm) and sEEGs in gray matter (7.14 &plusmn; 1.7 mm) was not significantly different; however, FWHM for low frequencies recorded by sEEGs was 2.45 mm smaller than SDEs. White matter sEEGs showed much lower power for frequencies 17&ndash;200 Hz (q &lt; 0.01) and a much broader decay (11.3 &plusmn; 3.2 mm) than gray matter electrodes (7.14 &plusmn; 1.7 mm). The use of a bipolar referencing scheme significantly lowered FWHM for sEEGs, relative to a white matter reference or a common average reference (CAR). These results outline the influence of array design, spectral bands, and referencing schema on local field potential recordings and source localization in icEEG recordings in humans. The metrics we derive have immediate relevance to the analysis and interpretation of both cognitive and epileptic data.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Host phenotype classification from human microbiome data is mainly driven by the presence of microbial taxa</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Renato Giliberti, Sara Cavaliere, Italia Elisa Mauriello, Danilo Ercolini, Edoardo Pasolli</p>

Machine learning-based classification approaches are widely used to predict host phenotypes from microbiome data. Classifiers are typically employed by considering operational taxonomic units or relative abundance profiles as input features. Such types of data are intrinsically sparse, which opens the opportunity to make predictions from the presence/absence rather than the relative abundance of microbial taxa. This also poses the question whether it is the presence rather than the abundance of particular taxa to be relevant for discrimination purposes, an aspect that has been so far overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by performing a meta-analysis on 4,128 publicly available metagenomes associated with multiple case-control studies. At species-level taxonomic resolution, we show that it is the presence rather than the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa to be important when building classification models. Such findings are robust to the choice of the classifier and confirmed by statistical tests applied to identifying differentially abundant/present taxa. Results are further confirmed at coarser taxonomic resolutions and validated on 4,026 additional 16S rRNA samples coming from 30 public case-control studies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to estimate the time to recovery of command-following and associations between hypoxemia with time to recovery of command-following.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study during the initial surge of the United Statesʼ pandemic (March–July 2020) we estimate the time from intubation to recovery of command-following, using Kaplan Meier cumulative-incidence curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Patients were included if they were admitted to 1 of 3 hospitals because of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), required endotracheal intubation for at least 7 days, and experienced impairment of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale motor score &lt;6).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five hundred seventy-one patients of the 795 patients recovered command-following. The median time to recovery of command-following was 30 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27–32 days). Median time to recovery of command-following increased by 16 days for patients with at least one episode of an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) value ≤55 mmHg (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and 25% recovered ≥10 days after cessation of mechanical ventilation. The time to recovery of command-following  was associated with hypoxemia (PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤55 mmHg hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46–0.68; PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤70 HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85–0.91), and each additional day of hypoxemia decreased the likelihood of recovery, accounting for confounders including sedation. These findings were confirmed among patients without any imagining evidence of structural brain injury (n = 199), and in a non-overlapping second surge cohort (N = 427, October 2020 to April 2021).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Survivors of severe COVID-19 commonly recover consciousness weeks after cessation of mechanical ventilation. Long recovery periods are associated with more severe hypoxemia. This relationship is not explained by sedation or brain injury identified on clinical imaging and should inform decisions about life-sustaining therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>
