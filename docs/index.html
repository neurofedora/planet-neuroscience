     alt="Oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation is disinhibited following traumatic brain injury in leukemia inhibitory factor heterozygous mice"/>
<p>Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) haplodeficiency alters forebrain development and proliferative responses to closed head injury. Injury increases overall proliferation and increases the number of multipotential progenitors in the subventricular zone at 48 hr post-injury that is more dramatic in LIF Het mice. Oligodendrocyte lineage cells are most sensitive to decreased levels in LIF, and more specifically, early oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) proliferation increases in LIF Het injured mice. The addition of LIF decreases overall proliferation and decreases the number of proliferating late OPCs, suggesting that LIF pushes the cells into a more mature state.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant problem that affects over 800,000 children each year. As cell proliferation is disturbed by injury and required for normal brain development, we investigated how a pediatric closed head injury (CHI) would affect the progenitors of the subventricular zone (SVZ). Additionally, we evaluated the contribution of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) using germline LIF heterozygous mice (LIF Het), as LIF is an injury-induced cytokine, known to influence neurogenesis and gliogenesis. CHIs were performed on P20 LIF Het and wild-type (WT) mice. Ki-67 immunostaining and stereology revealed that cell proliferation increased ~250% in injured LIF Het mice compared to the 30% increase observed in injured WT mice at 48-hr post-CHI. OLIG2+ cell proliferation increased in the SVZ and white matter of LIF Het injured mice at 48-hr recovery. Using an 8-color flow cytometry panel, the proliferation of three distinct multipotential progenitors and early oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation was significantly increased in LIF Het injured mice compared to WT injured mice. Supporting its cytostatic function, LIF decreased neurosphere progenitor and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation compared to controls. In highly enriched mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cell cultures, LIF increased phospho-protein kinase B after 20 min and increased phospho-S6 ribosomal protein at 20 and 40 min of exposure, which are downstream targets of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Altogether, our data provide new insights into the regulatory role of LIF in suppressing neural progenitor cell proliferation and, in particular, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation after a mild TBI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Microcontroller-Based System for the Wheel-Running Activity in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Voluntary wheel-running activity is a way to assess rodents&rsquo; circadian rhythm and motivation for exercise. Deficits in these behaviors are implicated in the pathophysiology of sleep and psychiatric disorders. Limited space in animal facilities can hamper long-term monitoring of running wheel activity outside of the home cage. To address this issue, we provide a stand-alone solution to monitor the wheel-running activity of mice in their home cage. This system, named the wheel-running activity acquisition (WRAQ) system, is based on a microcontroller driven by a lithium polymer battery. With the WRAQ, we can record the wheel-running activity and illumination data for at least 30 d. Applying the WRAQ to an endotoxemia mouse model robustly detected the altered wheel-running activity and its recovery. With wireless data transfer capability extension, the system also allows for online monitoring and reporting of the circadian time (CT). We used the online monitoring of wheel-running activity with this extended WRAQ system and observed a significant shift of the active period in the circadian rhythm following a temporal chemogenetic activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)-subparaventricular zone (SPZ). Together, these findings indicate that the WRAQ system is a novel and cost-effective solution for the analysis of wheel-running activity in mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Dynamics Convey Differential Sensitivity to Input Pattern Changes in Two Muscles Innervated by the Same Motor Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Postsynaptic responses depend on input patterns as well as short-term synaptic plasticity, summation, and postsynaptic membrane properties, but the interactions of those dynamics with realistic input patterns are not well understood. We recorded the responses of the two pyloric dilator (PD) muscles, <I>cpv2a</I> and <I>cpv2b</I>, that are innervated by and receive identical periodic bursting input from the same two motor neurons in the lobster <I>Homarus americanus</I>. <I>Cpv2a</I> and <I>cpv2b</I> showed quantitative differences in membrane nonlinearities and synaptic summation. At a short timescale, responses in both muscles were dominated by facilitation, albeit with different frequency and time dependence. Realistic burst stimulations revealed more substantial differences. Across bursts, <I>cpv2a</I> showed transient depression, whereas <I>cpv2b</I> showed transient facilitation. Steady-state responses to bursting input also differed substantially. Neither muscle had a monotonic dependence on frequency, but <I>cpv2b</I> showed particularly pronounced bandpass filtering. <I>Cpv2a</I> was sensitive to changes in both burst frequency and intra-burst spike frequency, whereas, despite its much slower responses, <I>cpv2b</I> was largely insensitive to changes in burst frequency. <I>Cpv2a</I> was sensitive to both burst duration and number of spikes per burst, whereas <I>cpv2b</I> was sensitive only to the former parameter. Neither muscle showed consistent sensitivity to changes in the overall spike interval structure, but <I>cpv2b</I> was surprisingly sensitive to changes in the first intervals in each burst, a parameter known to be regulated by dopamine (DA) modulation of spike propagation of the presynaptic axon. These findings highlight how seemingly minor circuit output changes mediated by neuromodulation could be read out differentially at the two synapses.</p>

                Official COVID-19 case counts and mortality rates across Africa are lower than had been anticipated. Research reports, however, indicate far higher exposure rates than the official counts in some countries. Particularly in Western and Central Africa, where mortality rates are disproportionately lower than the rest of the continent, this occurrence may be due to immune response adaptations resulting from (1) frequent exposure to certain pro-inflammatory pathogens, and (2) a prevalence of low-grade inflammation coupled with peculiar modifications to the immune response based on one’s immunobiography. We suggest that the two factors lead to a situation where post infection, there is a rapid ramp-up of innate immune responses, enough to induce effective defense and protection against plethora pathogens. Alongside current efforts at procuring and distributing vaccines, we draw attention to the need for work towards appreciating the impact of the apparently widespread, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections on Africa’s populations vis a vis systemic inflammation status and long-term consequences for public health.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">De novo protein fold families expand the designable ligand binding site space</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xingjie Pan, Tanja Kortemme</p>

A major challenge in designing proteins <i>de novo</i> to bind user-defined ligands with high affinity is finding backbones structures into which a new binding site geometry can be engineered with high precision. Recent advances in methods to generate protein fold families <i>de novo</i> have expanded the space of accessible protein structures, but it is not clear to what extend <i>de novo</i> proteins with diverse geometries also expand the space of designable ligand binding functions. We constructed a library of 25,806 high-quality ligand binding sites and developed a fast protocol to place (“match”) these binding sites into both naturally occurring and <i>de novo</i> protein families with two fold topologies: Rossman and NTF2. Each matching step involves engineering new binding site residues into each protein “scaffold”, which is distinct from the problem of comparing already existing binding pockets. 5,896 and 7,475 binding sites could be matched to the Rossmann and NTF2 fold families, respectively. <i>De novo</i> designed Rossman and NTF2 protein families can support 1,791 and 678 binding sites that cannot be matched to naturally existing structures with the same topologies, respectively. While the number of protein residues in ligand binding sites is the major determinant of matching success, ligand size and primary sequence separation of binding site residues also play important roles. The number of matched binding sites are power law functions of the number of members in a fold family. Our results suggest that <i>de novo</i> sampling of geometric variations on diverse fold topologies can significantly expand the space of designable ligand binding sites for a wealth of possible new protein functions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hybrid dedicated and distributed coding in PMd/M1 provides separation and interaction of bilateral arm signals</a></h4>

Pronounced activity is observed in both hemispheres of the motor cortex during preparation and execution of unimanual movements. The organizational principles of bi-hemispheric signals and the functions they serve throughout motor planning remain unclear. Using an instructed-delay reaching task in monkeys, we identified two components in population responses spanning PMd and M1. A “dedicated” component, which segregated activity at the level of individual units, emerged in PMd during preparation. It was most prominent following movement when M1 became strongly engaged, and principally involved the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast to recent reports, these dedicated signals solely accounted for divergence of arm-specific neural subspaces. The other “distributed” component mixed signals for each arm within units, and the subspace containing it did not discriminate between arms at any stage. The statistics of the population response suggest two functional aspects of the cortical network: one that spans both hemispheres for supporting preparatory and ongoing processes, and another that is predominantly housed in the contralateral hemisphere and specifies unilateral output.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling the effects of Aedes aegypti’s larval environment on adult body mass at emergence</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Melody Walker, Karthikeyan Chandrasegaran, Clément Vinauger, Michael A. Robert, Lauren M. Childs</p>

Mosquitoes vector harmful pathogens that infect millions of people every year, and developing approaches to effectively control mosquitoes is a topic of great interest. However, the success of many control measures is highly dependent upon ecological, physiological, and life history traits of mosquito species. The behavior of mosquitoes and their potential to vector pathogens can also be impacted by these traits. One trait of interest is mosquito body mass, which depends upon many factors associated with the environment in which juvenile mosquitoes develop. Our experiments examined the impact of larval density on the body mass of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes, which are important vectors of dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and other pathogens. To investigate the interactions between the larval environment and mosquito body mass, we built a discrete time mathematical model that incorporates body mass, larval density, and food availability and fit the model to our experimental data. We considered three categories of model complexity informed by data, and selected the best model within each category using Akaike’s Information Criterion. We found that the larval environment is an important determinant of the body mass of mosquitoes upon emergence. Furthermore, we found that larval density has greater impact on body mass of adults at emergence than on development time, and that inclusion of density dependence in the survival of female aquatic stages in models is important. We discuss the implications of our results for the control of <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes and on their potential to spread disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Decaffeinated coffee and green tea extract inhibit foam cell atherosclerosis by lowering inflammation and improving cholesterol influx/efflux balance through upregulation of PPARγ and miR-155 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Foam cells are markers of atherosclerosis and characterise advanced atherosclerotic plaque, stimulated by inflammation caused by high lipid levels in macrophages. The combination of decaffeinated coffee and green tea extract (DCGTE) has been suggested to have a role in foam cell inhibition. Objective: we investigated the inhibiting role of DCGTE against foam cell formation, through modulation of the inflammation process and cholesterol metabolism in macrophage colony stimulating factor- (M-CSF) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-exposed macrophages. Methods: Coffee and green tea were extracted by filtration and infusion respectively, and underwent decaffeination using active carbon and blanching methods, respectively. Cells were administered 160/160 and 320/320μg/ml of DCGTE. Foam cell formation was observed using a light microscope after staining with Oil Red O (ORO), and the accumulation of lipids in macrophages with ELISA. Observations of lipid influx and efflux were determined through semiquantitative cluster differentiation 36 (CD36) and ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression through immunofluorescence. The inflammation process was quantified using inflammatory/anti-inflammatory markers, e.g., tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 10 (IL10) with ELISA. Peroxisome proliferator activated response γ (PPARγ) expression and activity were assessed with PCR and ELISA, respectively. The expression of microRNA 155 (miR-155) was examined using qPCR. Results: DCGTE at the above concentrations tended to reduce foam cell numbers, significantly inhibited lipid accumulation (p=0.000), reduced CD36 expression (p=0.000) and TNFα secretion (p=0.000) in Raw264.7 exposed to M-CSF 50ng/ml and oxLDL 50μg/ml.  PPARγ expression (p=0.00) and activity (p=0.001), miR-155 relative expression (p=0.000), and IL10 production (p=0.000) also increased. Conclusion: DCGTE lowered foam cell numbers, possibly through attenuation of the inflammatory process and improvement of lipid/efflux mechanisms in M-CSF and oxLDL-stimulated Raw264.7 cells, via upregulation of PPARγ and miR-155.  Our results suggest DCGTE may help prevent atherosclerosis-based diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Convergent validity and reliability of a novel repeated agility protocol in junior rugby league players [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: : Rugby league involves repeated, complex, and high intensity change-of-direction (COD) movements with no existing test protocols that specifically assesses these multiple physical fitness components simultaneously. Thus, the current study examined the convergent validity of a repeated Illinois Agility (RIA) protocol with the repeated T-agility protocol, and the repeatability of the RIA protocol in adolescent Rugby League players. Furthermore, aerobic capacity and anaerobic and COD performance were assessed to determine whether these physical qualities were important contributors to the RIA protocol. Methods: Twenty-two junior Rugby League players completed 4 sessions with each separated by 7 days. Initially, physical fitness characteristics at baseline (i.e., Multi-stage Shuttle test, countermovement jump, 30-m sprint, single-effort COD and repeated sprint ability [RSA]) were assessed. The second session involved a familiarisation of RIA and repeated T-agility test (RTT) protocols. During the third and fourth sessions, participants completed the RIA and RTT protocols in a randomised, counterbalanced design to examine the validity and test-retest reliability of these protocols. Results: For convergent validity, significant correlations were identified between RIA and RTT performances (r= >0.80; p<0.05). For contributors to RIA performance, significant correlations were identified between all baseline fitness characteristics and RIA (r = >0.71; p < 0.05). Reliability of the RIA protocol was near perfect with excellent intra-class correlation coefficient (0.87-0.97), good ratio limits of agreement (×/÷ 1.05-1.06) and low coefficient of variations (1.8-2.0%). Conclusions: The current study has demonstrated the RIA to be a simple, valid and reliable field test for RL athletes that can provide coaches with information about their team’s ability to sustain high intensity, multi-directional running efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Correlations between components of the immune system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: No evidence of the possibility to alter a constituent of the immune system without directly affecting one of its associated components has been shown yet. Methods: A schematic model was developed in which two triggers, fasting and splenectomy, were studied for their ability to affect the expression of cell membrane epitopes and the cytokine secretion of out-of-body autogeneic and syngeneic lymphocytes. Results: Fasting decreased expression of CD8 and CD25 and increased TNFα levels. The effect of splenectomy as a trigger was investigated in non-fasting mice by comparing splenectomized and non-splenectomized mice. An increase in the CD8 expression and in TNFα, IFNg, and IL10 secretion was noted. The effect of splenectomy as a trigger was investigated in fasting mice by comparing splenectomized and non-splenectomized mice. Splenectomy had a significant effect on expression of CD25 and CD4 CD25 and on secretion of TNFα, IFNg, and IL10. To determine the effect of keeping the cells in an out-of-body location on the expression of lymphocyte epitopes, tubes kept on top of the cages of the fasting mice were compared with tubes kept on top of empty cages. A significant change in the CD8 expression was noted. To determine the effect of keeping cells in an out-of-body location on cytokine secretion, tubes kept on top of cages were tested for cytokine levels. A significant decrease was noted for the secretion of TNFα and IFNg. Conclusions: The data obtained from this study characterized a system for induction of correlations between two components of the immune system without a transfer of mediators. The study showed that a mouse could affect cells at a distance and alter the expression of surface markers and cytokine secretion following two types of triggers: fasting and/or splenectomy. Thus, an out-of-body correlation can be induced between two components of the immune system.

                <p>This study was undertaken to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 causes a persistent central nervous system infection. SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody index and SARS-CoV-2 RNA were studied in cerebrospinal fluid following COVID-19. Cerebrospinal fluid was assessed between days 1 and 30 (n = 12), between days 31 and 90 (n = 8), or later than 90 days (post–COVID-19, n = 20) after COVID-19 diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in all patients, and in none of the 20 patients with post–COVID-19 syndrome were intrathecally produced anti–SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected. The absence of evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid argues against a persistent central nervous system infection as a cause of neurological or neuropsychiatric post–COVID-19 syndrome.

                Zebrafish have made significant contributions to our understanding of the vertebrate brain and the neural basis of behavior, earning a place as one of the most widely used model organisms in neuroscience. Their appeal arises from the marriage of low cost, early life transparency, and ease of genetic manipulation with a behavioral repertoire that becomes more sophisticated as animals transition from larvae to adults. To further enhance the use of adult zebrafish, we created the first fully segmented three-dimensional digital adult zebrafish brain atlas (AZBA). AZBA was built by combining tissue clearing, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, and three-dimensional image registration of nuclear and antibody stains. These images were used to guide segmentation of the atlas into over 200 neuroanatomical regions comprising the entirety of the adult zebrafish brain. As an open source, online (azba.wayne.edu), updatable digital resource, AZBA will significantly enhance the use of adult zebrafish in furthering our understanding of vertebrate brain function in both health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mutation saturation for fitness effects at human CpG sites</a></h4>

              
                Whole exome sequences have now been collected for millions of humans, with the related goals of identifying pathogenic mutations in patients and establishing reference repositories of data from unaffected individuals. As a result, we are approaching an important limit, in which datasets are large enough that, in the absence of natural selection, every highly mutable site will have experienced at least one mutation in the genealogical history of the sample. Here, we focus on CpG sites that are methylated in the germline and experience mutations to T at an elevated rate of ~10<sup>-7</sup> per site per generation; considering synonymous mutations in a sample of 390,000 individuals, ~99% of such CpG sites harbor a C/T polymorphism. Methylated CpG sites provide a natural mutation saturation experiment for fitness effects: as we show, at current sample sizes, not seeing a non-synonymous polymorphism is indicative of strong selection against that mutation. We rely on this idea in order to directly identify a subset of CpG transitions that are likely to be highly deleterious, including ~27% of possible loss-of-function mutations, and up to 20% of possible missense mutations, depending on the type of functional site in which they occur. Unlike methylated CpGs, most mutation types, with rates on the order of 10<sup>-8</sup> or 10<sup>-9</sup>, remain very far from saturation. We discuss what these findings imply for interpreting the potential clinical relevance of mutations from their presence or absence in reference databases and for inferences about the fitness effects of new mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A coarse-grained NADH redox model enables inference of subcellular metabolic fluxes from fluorescence lifetime imaging</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial metabolism is of central importance to diverse aspects of cell and developmental biology. Defects in mitochondria are associated with many diseases, including cancer, neuropathology, and infertility. Our understanding of mitochondrial metabolism <i>in situ</i> and dysfunction in diseases are limited by the lack of techniques to measure mitochondrial metabolic fluxes with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we developed a new method to infer mitochondrial metabolic fluxes in living cells with subcellular resolution from fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH. This result is based on the use of a generic coarse-grained NADH redox model. We tested the model in mouse oocytes and human tissue culture cells subject to a wide variety of perturbations by comparing predicted fluxes through the electron transport chain (ETC) to direct measurements of oxygen consumption rate. Interpreting the FLIM measurements of NADH using this model, we discovered a homeostasis of ETC flux in mouse oocytes: perturbations of nutrient supply and energy demand of the cell do not change ETC flux despite significantly impacting NADH metabolic state. Furthermore, we observed a subcellular spatial gradient of ETC flux in mouse oocytes and found that this gradient is primarily a result of a spatially heterogeneous mitochondrial proton leak. We concluded from these observations that ETC flux in mouse oocytes is not controlled by energy demand or supply, but by the intrinsic rates of mitochondrial respiration.

                Microorganisms swimming through viscous fluids imprint their propulsion mechanisms in the flow fields they generate. Extreme confinement of these swimmers between rigid boundaries often arises in natural and technological contexts, yet measurements of their mechanics in this regime are absent. Here, we show that strongly confining the microalga Chlamydomonas between two parallel plates not only inhibits its motility through contact friction with the walls but also leads, for purely mechanical reasons, to inversion of the surrounding vortex flows. Insights from the experiment lead to a simplified theoretical description of flow fields based on a quasi-2D Brinkman approximation to the Stokes equation rather than the usual method of images. We argue that this vortex flow inversion provides the advantage of enhanced fluid mixing despite higher friction. Overall, our results offer a comprehensive framework for analyzing the collective flows of strongly confined swimmers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Causal contributions of neural noise to left frontal networks subtending the modulation of conscious visual perception in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                For several decades, the field of human neurophysiology has focused on the role played by cortical oscillations in enabling brain function underpinning behaviors. In parallel, a less visible but robust body of work on the stochastic resonance phenomenon has also theorized contributions of neural noise - hence more heterogeneous, complex and less predictable activity - in brain coding. The latter notion has received indirect causal support via improvements of visual function during non-regular or random brain stimulation patterns. Nonetheless, direct evidence demonstrating an impact of brain stimulation on direct measures of neural noise is still lacking. Here we evaluated the impact of three non frequency-specific TMS bursts, compared to a control pure high-beta TMS rhythm, delivered to the left FEF during a visual detection task, on the heterogeneity, predictability and complexity of ongoing brain activity recorded with scalp EEG. Our data showed surprisingly that the three non frequency-specific TMS patterns did not prevent a build-up of local high-beta activity. Nonetheless, they increased power across broader or in multiple frequency bands compared to control purely rhythmic high-beta bursts tested along. Importantly, non frequency-specific patterns enhanced signal entropy over multiple time-scales, suggesting higher complexity and an overall induction of higher levels of cortical noise than rhythmic TMS bursts. Our outcomes provide indirect evidence on a potential modulatory role played by sources of stochastic noise on brain oscillations and synchronization. Additionally, they pave the way towards the development of novel neurostimulation approaches to manipulate cortical sources of noise and further investigate their causal role in neural coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Unique Cytoarchitecture and Wiring of the Human Default Mode Network</a></h4>

              
                It is challenging to specify the role of the default mode network (DMN) in human behaviour. Contemporary theories, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggest that the DMN is insulated from the external world, which allows it to support perceptually-decoupled states and to integrate external and internal information in the construction of abstract meanings. To date, the neuronal architecture of the DMN has received relatively little attention. Understanding the cytoarchitectural composition and connectional layout of the DMN will provide novel insights into its role in brain function. We mapped cytoarchitectural variation within the DMN using a cortical type atlas and a histological model of the entire human brain. Next, we used MRI acquired in healthy young adults to explicate structural wiring and effective connectivity. We discovered profound diversity of DMN cytoarchitecture. Connectivity is organised along the most dominant cytoarchitectural axis. One side of the axis is the prominent receiver, whereas the other side remains more insulated, especially from sensory areas. The structural heterogeneity of the DMN engenders a network-level balance in communication with external and internal sources, which is distinctive, relative to other functional communities. The neuronal architecture of the DMN suggests it is a protuberance from the core cortical processing hierarchy and holds a unique role in information integration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive coding of stimulus information in human fronto-parietal cortex during visual classification</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to flexibly adapt to changing demands is supported by flexible coding of task-relevant information in frontal and parietal brain regions. Converging evidence suggest that coding of stimuli and task rules in these regions become stronger as task difficulty increases. Here, we tested whether there is a corresponding change in the representational format as well, an issue that has rarely been addressed directly in past research. Participants performed a visual classification task under varying levels of perceptual difficulty, while we acquired fMRI. Using a model-based representational similarity approach, we tested whether stimulus representations retain exemplar-level information. We expected representations to drop such exemplar-level information as perceptual difficulty increases, which would indicate a focus on representing behaviorally relevant category information. Counter to these expectations, and in contrast to previous research, we found frontal and parietal brain regions contained exemplar-level stimulus information. Interestingly, the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) retained exemplar-level stimulus information even in perceptually difficult trials, and these representations were directly related to performance. Overall, these findings call for a reassessment of the neural mechanisms underlying human adaptive behavior during visual classification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human visual gamma for color stimuli: When LGN drive is equalized, red is not special</a></h4>

              
                Strong gamma-band oscillations in primate early visual cortex can be induced by spatially homogeneous, high-contrast stimuli, such as color surfaces. Compared to other hues, particularly strong gamma oscillations have been reported for red stimuli. However, precortical color processing and the resultant strength of input to V1 has often not been fully controlled for. This leaves the possibility that stronger responses to some hues were due to differences in V1 input strength. We presented stimuli that had equal luminance and color contrast levels in a color coordinate system based on color responses of the lateral geniculate nucleus, the main input source for area V1. With these stimuli, we recorded magnetoencephalography in 30 human subjects. We found narrowband color-induced gamma oscillations in early visual cortex, which, contrary to previous reports, did not differ between red and green stimuli of equal L-M cone contrast. Notably, blue stimuli with contrast exclusively on the S cone axis induced very weak gamma responses, as well as smaller event-related fields and poorer change detection performance. The strength of human color gamma responses could be well explained by the strength of thalamic input induced by each hue and does not show a clear red bias when this input strength is properly equalized.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The gendered self: Evidence for differences in whole-brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                How the brain constructs gender identity is largely unknown, but some neural differences have recently been discovered. Here, we used an intrinsic-ignition framework to investigate if gender identity changes the propagation of the neural activity across the whole-brain network and within resting-state networks. Studying 29 transmen and 17 transwomen with gender incongruence, 22 ciswomen, and 19 cismen, we computed the capability of a given brain area in space to propagate activity to other areas (mean-ignition) and its variability across time (node-metastability). We found that both measures differentiated all four groups across the whole-brain network. Furthermore, at the network level, we found that compared to the other groups, cismen showed higher mean-ignition of the dorsal attention network and node-metastability of the dorsal and ventral attention, executive control, and temporal parietal networks. We also found mean-ignition differences between cismen and ciswomen within the executive control network, but higher in ciswomen than cismen and transmen for the default-mode network. For the node-metastability, this was higher in cismen compared to ciswomen in the somatomotor network, while both mean-ignition and node-metastability were higher for cismen than transmen in the limbic network. Finally, we computed correlations between both measures and their body image scores. Transmen dissatisfaction, cismen, and ciswomen satisfaction towards their own body image were distinctively associated with specific networks per group. Overall, the study of the whole-brain network dynamical complexity discriminates binary gender identity groups, and functional connectivity dynamics approaches are needed to disentangle the complex understanding of the gendered self.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological correlates of confidence differ across correct and erroneous perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Every decision we make is accompanied by an estimate of the likelihood that our decision is accurate or appropriate. This likelihood estimate is termed our degree of decision confidence. Recent work has uncovered event-related potential (ERP) correlates of confidence both during decision formation and after a decision has been made. However, the interpretation of these findings is complicated by methodological issues related to ERP amplitude measurement that are prevalent across existing studies. To more accurately characterise the neural correlates of confidence, we presented participants with a difficult perceptual decision task that elicited a broad range of confidence ratings. We identified a frontal ERP component within an onset prior to the behavioural response, which exhibited more positive-going amplitudes in trials with higher confidence ratings. This frontal effect also biased measures of the centro-parietal positivity (CPP) component at parietal electrodes via volume conduction. Amplitudes of the error positivity (Pe) component that followed each decision were negatively associated with confidence for trials with decision errors, but not for trials with correct decisions. We provide evidence for both pre- and post- decisional neural correlates of decision confidence that are observed in trials with correct and erroneous decisions, respectively. Our findings suggest that certainty in having made a correct response is associated with frontal activity during decision formation, whereas certainty in having committed an error is instead associated with the post-decisional Pe component. We additionally show that some previously reported associations between decision confidence and CPP/Pe component amplitudes are (at least partly) a consequence of ERP amplitude measurement-related confounds.

                Chronic stress can increase the risk of developing a substance use disorder in vulnerable individuals. Numerous models have been developed to probe the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, however most prior work has been restricted to male rodents, conducted only in rats, or introduces physical injury that can complicate opioid studies. Here we sought to establish how chronic psychosocial stress influences fentanyl consumption in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We used chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), or the modified vicarious chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS), and used social interaction to stratify mice as stress-susceptible or resilient. We then subjected mice to a 15 day fentanyl drinking paradigm in the home cage that consisted of alternating forced and choice periods with increasing fentanyl concentrations. Male mice susceptible to either CWDS or CSDS consumed more fentanyl relative to unstressed mice, and exhibited increased preference for fentanyl. CWDS-susceptible female mice did not differ from unstressed mice during the forced periods, but showed increased preference for fentanyl. We also found decreased expression of nucleus accumbens Rho GTPases in male, but not female mice following stress and fentanyl drinking. We also compare fentanyl drinking behavior in mice that had free access to plain water throughout. Our results indicate that stress-sensitized fentanyl consumption is dependent on both sex and behavioral outcomes to stress.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">All-optical electrophysiology with improved genetically encoded voltage indicators reveals interneuron network dynamics in vivo</a></h4>

              
                All-optical electrophysiology can be a powerful tool for studying neural dynamics in vivo, as it offers the ability to image and perturb membrane voltage in multiple cells simultaneously. The "Optopatch" constructs combine a red-shifted archaerhodopsin (Arch)-derived genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) with a blue-shifted channelrhodopsin actuator (ChR). We used a video-based pooled screen to evolve Arch-derived GEVIs with improved signal-to-noise ratio (QuasAr6a) and kinetics (QuasAr6b). By combining optogenetic stimulation of individual cells with high-precision voltage imaging in neighboring cells, we mapped inhibitory and gap junction-mediated connections, in vivo. Optogenetic activation of a single NDNF-expressing neuron in visual cortex Layer 1 significantly suppressed the spike rate in some neighboring NDNF interneurons. Hippocampal PV cells showed near-synchronous spikes across multiple cells at a frequency significantly above what one would expect from independent spiking, suggesting that collective inhibitory spikes may play an important signaling role in vivo. By stimulating individual cells and recording from neighbors, we quantified gap junction coupling strengths. Together, these results demonstrate powerful new tools for all-optical microcircuit dissection in live mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term decreased cannabinoid type-1 receptor activity restores specific neurological phenotypes in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Intellectual disability is the most prevalent and limiting hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), without any pharmacological treatment available. Neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are relevant neurological features of DS reaching to early development of Alzheimer s disease. Preclinical evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid system, an important neuromodulator on cognition and neuroinflammation, could act as beneficial target in DS. Indeed, cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) activity was enhanced in the hippocampus of young-adult trisomic Ts65Dn mice, a well-characterized surrogate model of DS. In previous studies, inhibition of CB1R, was able to restore key neurological deficits in this mouse model. To determine the possible clinical relevance of this target, it is mandatory to evaluate the long-term consequences of attenuated CB1R activity and to minimize the possible side-effects associated to this mechanism. We found that CB1R expression was significantly enhanced in the hippocampus brains of aged DS subjects. Similarly, middle-aged trisomic mice showed enhanced CB1R expression. Long-term oral administration of a low dose of the CB1R specific antagonist rimonabant was administered to male and female Ts65Dn trisomic and wild-type mice from the time of weaning to 10 months, an age when signs of neurodegeneration have been described in the model. CB1R inhibition resulted in significant cognitive improvement in novel object-recognition memory in trisomic male and female mice, reaching a similar performance to that of wild-type littermates. Interestingly, this long-term rimonabant treatment modify locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, body weight or survival rates. Brain analysis at 10 months of age revealed noradrenergic and cholinergic neurodegeneration signs in trisomic mice that were not modified by the treatment, although the alterations in hippocampal microglia morphology shown by vehicle-treated trisomic mice was normalized in trisomic mice exposed to rimonabant. Altogether, our results demonstrate a sustained pro-cognitive effect of CB1R inhibition at doses that do not produce major side effects that could be associated to an anti-inflammatory action, suggesting a potential interest in this target of to preserve cognitive functionality in DS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparative transcriptional analysis of the satellite glial cell injury response</a></h4>

              
                Satellite glial cells (SGCs) tightly surround and support primary sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system and are increasingly recognized for their involvement in the development of neuropathic pain following nerve injury. The SGCs are difficult to investigate due to their flattened shape and tight physical connection to neurons in vivo and their rapid changes in phenotype and protein expression when cultured in vitro. Consequently, several aspects of SGC function under normal conditions as well as after a nerve injury remain to be explored. The recent advance in single cell RNAseq technologies has enabled a new approach to investigate SGCs. Here we publish a dataset from mice subjected to sciatic nerve injury as well as a dataset from dorsal root ganglia cells after 3 days in culture. We use a meta-analysis approach to compare the injury response with that in other published datasets and conclude that SGCs share a common signature following sciatic nerve crush and sciatic ligation, involving transcriptional regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. We also observed a considerable transcriptional change when culturing SGCs, suggesting that some differentiate into a specialised in vitro state, while others start resembling Schwann cell-like precursors. The datasets are available via the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multimodal Gradient Mapping of Rodent Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a central role in supporting our coherent and enduring sense of self and our place in the world. Understanding its functional organisation is central to understanding this complex role. Previous studies suggest function varies along a long hippocampal axis, but there is disagreement about the presence of sharp discontinuities or gradual change along that axis. Other open questions relate to the underlying drivers of this variation and the conservation of organisational principles across species. Here, we delineate the primary organisational principles underlying patterns of hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) in the mouse using gradient analysis on resting state fMRI data. We further applied gradient analysis to mouse gene co-expression data to examine the relationship between variation in genomic anatomy and functional organisation. Two principal FC gradients along a hippocampal axis were revealed. The principal gradient exhibited a sharp discontinuity that divided the hippocampus into dorsal and ventral compartments. The second, more continuous, gradient followed the long axis of the ventral compartment. Dorsal regions were more strongly connected to areas involved in spatial navigation while ventral regions were more strongly connected to areas involved in emotion, recapitulating patterns seen in humans. In contrast, gene co-expression gradients showed a more segregated and discrete organisation. Our findings suggest that hippocampal functional organisation exhibits both sharp and gradual transitions and that hippocampal genomic anatomy exerts a subtle influence on this organisation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Do naps benefit novel word learning? Developmental differences and white matter correlates</a></h4>

              
                Behavioural and neuroimaging data suggest that memory representations of newly learned words undergo changes during nocturnal sleep, including improvements in explicit recall and lexical integration (i.e., after sleep, novel words compete with existing words during online word recognition). Some studies have revealed larger sleep-benefits in children relative to adults. However, whether daytime naps play a similar facilitatory role is unclear. We investigated the effect of a daytime nap (relative to wake) on explicit memory (recall/recognition) and lexical integration (lexical competition) of newly learned novel words in young adults and children aged 10-12 years, also exploring white matter correlates of the pre- and post-nap effects of word learning in the child group with diffusion weighted MRI. In both age groups, a nap maintained explicit memory of novel words and wake led to forgetting. However, there was an age group interaction when comparing change in recall over the nap: children showed a slight improvement whereas adults showed a slight decline. There was no evidence of lexical integration at any point. Although children spent proportionally more time in slow-wave sleep (SWS) than adults, neither SWS nor spindle parameters correlated with over-nap changes in word learning. For children, increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the uncinate fasciculus and arcuate fasciculus were associated with the recognition of novel words immediately after learning, and FA in the right arcuate fasciculus was further associated with changes in recall of novel words over a nap, supporting the importance of these tracts in the word learning and consolidation process. These findings point to a protective role of naps in word learning, and emphasize the need to advance theories of word learning by better understanding both the active and passive roles that sleep plays in supporting vocabulary consolidation over development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estradiol and oxytocin modulate sex differences in hippocampal reactivity and episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                Considerable evidence supports sex differences in autobiographical and episodic memory which may translate to heightened vulnerability to stress- and trauma-related disorders in women. The hormones estradiol and oxytocin both affect episodic memory, but possible sex-specific effects and hormonal interactions have not been systemically tested in humans. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving healthy women (n = 111) and men (n = 115). Participants were scanned under four experimental conditions: 1. estradiol gel (2 mg) and intranasal oxytocin (24 IU), 2. placebo gel and intranasal oxytocin, 3. estradiol gel and placebo spray, 4. placebo gel and placebo spray. During fMRI, participants viewed positive, neutral and negative scenes. A surprise recognition task three days later was used to classify encoding trials as remembered or forgotten. Under placebo, women showed a significantly better recognition memory and increased hippocampal responses to subsequently remembered items independent of the emotional valence compared to men. Separate treatments with either estradiol or oxytocin significantly diminished this mnemonic and hippocampal sex difference, whereas the combined treatment produced no significant effect. Collectively, our results suggest that estradiol and oxytocin play a crucial role in modulating sex differences in episodic memory. Furthermore, possible antagonistic interactions between estradiol and oxytocin could explain previously observed opposing hormonal effects in women and men.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Miniscope-LFOV: A large field of view, single cell resolution, miniature microscope for wired and wire-free imaging of neural dynamics in freely behaving animals</a></h4>

              
                We present a large field of view (FOV) open-source miniature microscope (MiniLFOV) designed to extend the capabilities of the UCLA Miniscope platform to large-scale, single cell resolution neural imaging in freely behaving large rodents and head-fixed mice. This system is capable of multiple imaging configurations, including deep brain imaging using implanted optical probes and cortical imaging through cranial windows. The MiniLFOV interfaces with existing open-source UCLA Miniscope DAQ hardware and software, can achieve single cell resolution imaging across a 3.6 x 2.7 mm field of view at 23 frames per second, has an electrically adjustable working distance of up to 3.5 mm{+/-}150 {micro}m using an onboard electrowetting lens, incorporates an absolute head-orientation sensor, and weighs under 14 grams. The MiniLFOV provides a 30-fold larger FOV and yields 20-fold better sensitivity than Miniscope V3, and a 12-fold larger FOV with 2-fold better sensitivity than Miniscope V4. Power and data transmission are handled through a single, flexible coaxial cable down to 0.3 mm in diameter facilitating naturalistic behavior. We validated the MiniLFOV in freely behaving rats by simultaneously imaging >1000 GCaMP7s expressing neurons in the CA1 layer of the hippocampus and in head-fixed mice by simultaneously imaging ~2000 neurons in the mouse dorsal cortex through a 4 x 4 mm cranial window. For freely behaving experiments, the MiniLFOV supports optional wire-free operation using a 3.5 g wire-free data acquisition expansion board which enables close to 1-hour of wire-free recording with a 400 mAh (7.5 g) on-board single-cell lithium-polymer battery and expands wire-free imaging techniques to larger animal models. We expect this new open-source implementation of the UCLA Miniscope platform will enable researchers to address novel hypotheses concerning brain function in freely behaving animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anxiety attenuates learning advantages conferred by statistical stability and induces loss of volatility-attuning in brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety can alter an individual's perception of their external sensory environment. Previous studies suggest that anxiety can increase the magnitude of neural responses to unexpected (or surprising) stimuli. Additionally, surprise responses are reported to be boosted during stable compared to volatile environments. Few studies, however, have examined how learning is impacted by both threat and volatility. To investigate these effects, we used threat-of-shock to transiently increase subjective anxiety in healthy adults during an auditory oddball task, in which the regularity could be stable or volatile, while undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scanning. We then used Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) mapping to pinpoint the brain areas where different models of anxiety displayed the highest evidence. Behaviourally, we found that threat-of-shock eliminated the accuracy advantage conferred by environmental stability over volatility in the task at hand. Neurally, we found that threat-of-shock led to both attenuation and loss of volatility-attuning of neural activity evoked by surprising sounds across most subcortical and limbic brain regions including the thalamus, basal ganglia, claustrum, insula, anterior cingulate, hippocampal gyrus and also the superior temporal gyrus. Conversely, within two small clusters in the left medial frontal gyrus and extrastriate area, threat-of-shock boosted the neural activity (relative to the safe and volatile condition) to the levels observed during the safe and stable condition, while also inducing a loss of volatility-attuning. Taken together, our findings suggest that threat eliminates the learning advantage conferred by statistical stability compared to volatility. Thus, we propose that anxiety disrupts behavioural adaptation to environmental statistics, and that multiple subcortical and limbic regions are implicated in this process.

                General factors capturing the shared genetics in psychiatric (genomic p-factor) and cognitive traits (genomic g-factor), and more recently in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging-derived brain networks, have contributed to our increased understanding of the etiologies in their respective domains. Yet it remains unclear whether general factors can capture the three-way genetic overlap of psychopathology, cognition and brain function. Here we tested for the presence of this genetic overlap via genetic correlation analyses using summary statistics of genome-wide association studies of the p-factor (N = 162,151 cases and 276,846 controls), the g-factor (N = 269,867), and the two genomic factors estimated from the amplitude in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging-derived brain networks (N = 31,688). Unlike hypothesized, only the genetic correlation between the p-factor and the g-factor was significant. We conclude that specific functional brain network constructs may have more potential than their derived general dimensions to capture relevant genetic variation for cognition and psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humans can track but fail to predict accelerating objects</a></h4>

              
                Objects in our visual environment often move unpredictably and can suddenly speed up or slow down. The ability to account for acceleration when interacting with moving objects can be critical for survival. Here, we investigate how human observers track an accelerating target with their eyes and predict its time of reappearance after a temporal occlusion by making an interceptive hand movement. Before occlusion, the target was initially visible and accelerated for a brief period. We tested how observers integrated target motion information by comparing three alternative models that predicted time-to-contact (TTC) based on the (1) final target velocity sample before occlusion, (2) average target velocity before occlusion, or (3) target acceleration. We show that visually-guided smooth pursuit eye movements reliably reflect target acceleration prior to occlusion. However, systematic saccade and manual interception timing errors reveal an inability to consider acceleration when predicting TTC. Interception timing is best described by the final velocity model that relies on extrapolating the last available velocity sample before occlusion. These findings provide compelling evidence for differential acceleration integration mechanisms in vision-guided eye movements and prediction-guided interception and a mechanistic explanation for the function and failure of interactions with accelerating objects.

                Place cells are believed to organize memory across space and time, inspiring the idea of the cognitive map. Yet unlike the structured activity in the associated grid and head-direction cells, they remain an enigma: their responses have been difficult to predict and are complex enough to be statistically well-described by a random process. Here we report one step toward the ultimate goal of understanding place cells well enough to predict their fields. Within a theoretical framework in which place fields are derived as a conjunction of external cues with internal grid cell inputs, we predict that even apparently random place cell responses should reflect the structure of their grid inputs and that this structure can be unmasked if probed in sufficiently large neural populations and large environments. To test the theory, we design experiments in long, locally featureless spaces to demonstrate that structured scaffolds undergird place cell responses. Our findings, together with other theoretical and experimental results, suggest that place cells build memories of external inputs by attaching them to a largely prespecified grid scaffold.

                Human linguistic units are hierarchical, and our brain responds differently when processing linguistic units during sentence comprehension, especially when the modality of the received signal is different (auditory, visual, or audio-visual). However, it is unclear how the brain processes and integrates language information at different linguistic units (words, phrases, and sentences) provided simultaneously in audio and visual modalities. To address the issue, we presented participants with sequences of short Chinese sentences through auditory or visual or combined audio-visual modalities, while electroencephalographic responses were recorded. With a frequency tagging approach, we analyzed the neural representations of basic linguistic units (i.e., characters/monosyllabic words) and higher-level linguistic structures (i.e., phrases and sentences) across the three modalities separately. We found that audio-visual integration occurs at all linguistic units, and the brain areas involved in the integration varied across different linguistic levels. In particular, the integration of sentences activated the local left prefrontal area. Therefore, we used continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to verify that the left prefrontal cortex plays a vital role in the audio-visual integration of sentence information. Our findings suggest the advantage of bimodal language comprehension at hierarchical stages in language-related information processing and provide evidence for the causal role of the left prefrontal regions in processing information of audio-visual sentences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-dependent circuitry plasticity via the regulation of the histamine receptor level in the Drosophila visual system</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is crucial for responses to the environment. Although the plasticity mechanisms of presynaptic photoreceptor neurons in the Drosophila visual system have been well studied, postsynaptic modifications remain elusive. In addition, further studies on the adaption of the visual system to different light experiences at a circuitry scale are required. Using the modified transcriptional reporter of intracellular Ca2+ method, we describe a way to visualize circuitry changes according to different light experiences. We found enhanced postsynaptic neuronal activity responses in lamina monopolar neuron L2 after prolonged light treatment. Although L1 also has connections with photoreceptors, there were no enhanced activity responses in L1. We also report in this study that activity-dependent transcriptional downregulation of inhibitory histamine receptors (HRs) occurs in postsynaptic neuron L2, but not in L1, during continuous light conditions. We expressed exogenous HR proteins in L2 neurons and found that it attenuated the enhanced activity response caused by constant light exposure. These findings, together with the fact that histamine is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter released by photoreceptors in the Drosophila visual system, confirmed our hypothesis that the activity-dependent transcriptional downregulation of HRs is responsible for the constant light exposure-induced circuitry response changes in L2. The results successfully demonstrated the selective circuit change after synaptic remodeling evoked by long-term activation and provided in vivo evidence of circuitry plasticity upon long-term environmental stimulation.

                Low-calorie sweetener (LCS) consumption in children has increased due to widespread LCS presence in the food environment and efforts to mitigate obesity through sugar replacement. However, mechanistic studies on the impact of early-life LCS consumption are lacking. Therefore, we developed a rodent model to evaluate the effects of daily LCS consumption (acesulfame potassium, saccharin, or stevia) during adolescence on adult metabolic, gut microbiome, neural, and behavioral outcomes. Results reveal that habitual early-life LCS consumption disrupts post-oral glucose tolerance and impairs hippocampal-dependent memory in the absence of weight gain. Furthermore, LCS consumption reduces lingual sweet taste receptor expression and alters sugar-motivated appetitive and consummatory responses. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that LCS also impacts collagen- and synaptic signaling-related gene pathways in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, respectively, in a sex-dependent manner. Collectively, these results suggest that regular early-life LCS consumption yields long-lasting impairments in metabolism, sugar-motivated behavior, and hippocampal-dependent memory.

                Decisions to act while pursuing goals in the presence of danger must be made quickly but safely. Premature decisions risk injury or death whereas postponing decisions risk goal loss. Here we show how mice resolve these competing demands. Using microstructural behavioral analyses, we identified the spatiotemporal dynamics of approach-avoidance decisions under motivational conflict. Then we used cognitive modelling to show that these dynamics reflect the speeded decision-making mechanisms used by humans and non-human primates, with mice trading off decision speed for safety of choice when danger loomed. Using calcium imaging and functional circuit analyses, we show that this speed-safety trade off occurs because increases in paraventricular thalamus (PVT) activity increase decision caution, thereby increasing approach-avoid decision times in the presence of danger. Our findings demonstrate that a discrete brain circuit involving the PVT and its prefrontal cortical input dynamically adjusts decision caution during motivational conflict, trading off decision speed for decision safety when danger is close. They identify the corticothalamic pathway as central to cognitive control during decision-making under conflict.

                Adolescence is a sensitive period in motor development but little is known about how long-term learning dependent processes shape hand function in tasks of different complexity. We mapped two fundamental aspects of hand function: simple repetitive and complex sequential finger movements, as a function of the length of musical instrumental training. We controlled maturational factors such as chronological and biological age of adolescent female participants (11 to 15 years of age, n=114). We demonstrated that experience improves performance as a function of task complexity, the more complex task being more susceptible for experience driven performance changes. Overall, these results suggest that fine motor skills involving cognitive control and relying on long-range functional brain networks are substantially shaped by experience. On the other hand, performance in a simple repetitive task that explains fine motor speed is primarily shaped by white matter development driven by maturational factors.

                Astrocytes express surface channels involved in purinergic signaling, and among these channels, pannexin-1 (Px1) and connexin-43 (Cx43) hemichannels (HCs) mediate ATP release that acts directly, or through its derivatives, on neurons and glia via purinergic receptors. Although HCs are functional, i.e., open and close, under physiological and pathological conditions, single channel conductance of Px1 HCs is not well defined. Here, we developed a dual voltage clamp technique in HeLa cells overexpressing human Px1-YFP, and then applied this system to rodent spinal astrocytes. Single channels were recorded in cell attached patches and evoked with ramp cycles of 2 s duration and -/+ 80-100 mV amplitude or rectangular pulses through another pipette in whole cell clamp. Conductance of Px1 HC openings recorded during ramp stimuli ranged 25-110 pS. Based on their single channel conductances, Px1 HCs could be distinguished from Cx43 HCs and P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs) in spinal astrocytes during dual voltage clamp experiments. Furthermore, we found that single channel activity of Cx43 HCs and P2X7Rs was increased, and that of Px1 HCs was decreased, in spinal astrocytes treated for 7h with FGF-1, a growth factor implicated in neurodevelopment, repair and inflammation.

                Visual processing differences in the magnocellular pathway have been reported across the autistic spectrum. On the basis that the firing of primate Type IV magnocellular cells is suppressed by diffuse red backgrounds, several groups have used red backgrounds as a means to investigate magnocellular contributions to visual processing in humans. Here, we measured emotional identification accuracy, and compared the P100 and N170 responses from groups with low (n=21; AQ<11) and high (n=22; AQ>22) Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores, in response to low (LSF) and high (HSF) spatially filtered fearful and neutral face stimuli presented on red and green backgrounds. For the LSF stimuli, the low AQ group correctly identified fearful expressions more often when presented on a red compared to a green background. The low AQ group also showed red backgrounds reduced the effect of LSF fearful expressions on P100 amplitudes. In contrast, the high AQ group showed that background colour did not significantly alter P100 responses to LSF stimuli. Interestingly, red background reduced the effects of HSF stimuli for the high AQ group. The effects of background color on LSF and HSF facial emotion responses were not evident for the N170 component. Our findings suggest that presenting face stimuli on a red background alters both magnocellular and parvocellular contributions to the P100 waveform, and that these effects differ for groups with low and high autistic tendencies. In addition, a theoretical model for explaining the temporal differences in facial emotion processing for low and high AQ groups is proposed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cryo-EM structures of the channelrhodopsin ChRmine in lipid nanodiscs</a></h4>

              
                Microbial channelrhodopsins are light-gated ion channels widely used for optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity. ChRmine is a bacteriorhodopsin-like cation channelrhodopsin (BCCR) more closely related to ion pump rhodopsins than other channelrhodopsins. ChRmine displays unique properties favorable for optogenetics including high light sensitivity, a red-shifted activation spectrum, cation selectivity, and large photocurrents while its slow closing kinetics impede some applications. The structural basis for ChRmine function, or that of any other BCCR, is unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of ChRmine in lipid nanodiscs in apo (opsin) and retinal-bound (rhodopsin) forms. The structures reveal an unprecedented trimeric architecture with a lipid filled central pore. Large electronegative cavities on either side of the membrane facilitate high conductance and selectivity for cations over protons. The retinal binding pocket structure suggests spectral and kinetic properties could be tuned with mutations and we identify ChRmine variants with two-fold increased and ten-fold decreased closing rates. These results provide insight into structural features that generate an ultra-potent microbial opsin and provide a platform for rational engineering of channelrhodopsins with improved properties that could expand the scale, depth, and precision of optogenetic manipulations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Population Imaging of Central Sensitization</a></h4>

              
                Capsaicin applied locally to the skin causes central sensitization that results in allodynia, a state in which pain is elicited by innocuous stimuli. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging of neurons in the dorsal spinal cord to visualize central sensitization across excitatory interneurons and spinal projection neurons. To distinguish among excitatory neuron subtypes, we developed CICADA, a cell profiling approach that leverages the expression of distinct Gq-coupled receptors. We then identified capsaicin-responsive and capsaicin-sensitized neuronal populations. Capsaicin-sensitized neurons showed emergent responses to low threshold input and increased receptive field sizes consistent with the psychophysical phenomenon that allodynia is observed across an extended secondary zone. Finally, we identified spinal projection neurons that showed a shift in tuning toward low threshold input. These experiments provide a population-level view of central sensitization and a framework with which to model somatosensory integration in the dorsal horn.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reconstructing essential active zone functions within a synapse</a></h4>

              
                Active zones are molecular machines that control neurotransmitter release through synaptic vesicle docking and priming, and through coupling of these vesicles to Ca2+ entry. The complexity of active zone machinery has made it challenging to determine which mechanisms drive these roles in release. Here, we induce RIM+ELKS knockout to eliminate active zone scaffolding networks, and then reconstruct each active zone function. Re-expression of RIM1-Zn fingers positioned Munc13 on undocked vesicles and rendered them release-competent. Reconstitution of release-triggering required docking of these vesicles to Ca2+ channels. Fusing RIM1-Zn to CaVbeta4-subunits sufficed to restore docking, priming and release-triggering without reinstating active zone scaffolds. Hence, exocytotic activities of the 80 kDa CaVbeta4-Zn fusion protein bypassed the need for megadalton-sized secretory machines. These data define key mechanisms of active zone function, establish that fusion competence and docking are mechanistically separable, and reveal that active zone scaffolding networks are not required for release.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Atlas of Inhibitory Neurons in the Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                The mouse brain contains a rich diversity of inhibitory interneuron types that have been characterized by their patterns of gene expression. However, the distribution of these cell types across the mouse brain is still incomplete. We developed a computational method to establish a consensus on the estimate of the densities of different interneuron types across the mouse brain. This method allows the unbiased integration of diverse and disparate datasets into a framework to predict interneuron densities for uncharted brain regions. We constrained our estimates based on previously computed brain-wide neuron density data, gene expression from in situ hybridization image stacks together with a wide range of values reported in the literature. Using optimization, we derived coherent estimates of cell densities for the different interneuron types. We estimated that 20.3% of all neurons in the mouse brain are inhibitory. Among all inhibitory neurons, 18% predominantly express parvalbumin (PV), 16% express somatostatin (SST), 3% express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the remainder 63% belong to the residual GABAergic population. Our pipeline is extensible, allowing new cell types or data to be integrated as they become available. The data, algorithms, software, and results of this pipeline are publicly available and update the Blue Brain Cell Atlas. We find that our density estimations improve as more literature values are integrated. This work therefore leverages the research community to collectively converge on the numbers of each cell type in each brain region.

	<p>(1) Background: pediatric hydrocephalus is a challenging condition. Programmable shunt valves (PSV) have been increasingly used. This study is undertaken to firstly, to objectively evaluate the efficacy of PSV as a treatment modality for pediatric hydrocephalus; and next, review its associated patient outcomes at our institution. Secondary objectives include the assessment of our indications for PSV, and corroboration of our results with published literature. (2) Methods: this is an ethics-approved, retrospective study. Variables of interest include age, gender, hydrocephalus etiology, shunt failure rates and incidence of adjustments made per PSV. Data including shunt failure, implant survival, and utility comparisons between PSV types are subjected to statistical analyses. (3) Results: in this case, 51 patients with PSV are identified for this study, with 32 index and 19 revision shunts. There are 3 cases of shunt failure (6%). The mean number of adjustments per PSV is 1.82 times and the mean number of adjustments made per PSV is significantly lower for MEDTRONIC&amp;amp;trade; Strata PSVs compared with others (p = 0.031). Next, PSV patients that are adjusted more frequently include cases of shunt revisions, PSVs inserted due to CSF over-drainage and tumor-related hydrocephalus. (4) Conclusion: we describe our institutional experience of PSV use in pediatric hydrocephalus and its advantages in a subset of patients whose opening pressures are uncertain and evolving.</p>

	<p>Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody, was approved in June of 2021 as the first disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease by the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA). A substantial proportion of patients with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and the debilitating effects of this disease exerts burdens on patients and caregivers in addition to the significant economic strains many nations bear. While the advantages of a disease-modifying therapy are clear in delaying the progression of disease to improve patient outcomes, aducanumab&amp;amp;rsquo;s approval by the U.S. FDA was met with controversy for a plethora of reasons. This paper will provide precursory insights into aducanumab&amp;amp;rsquo;s role, appropriateness, and cost-effectiveness in low- and middle-income countries. We extend some of the controversies associated with aducanumab, including the contradicting evidence from the two trials (EMERGE and ENGAGE) and the resources required to deliver the treatment safely and effectively to patients, among other key considerations.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>SMI-32 is widely used to identify entire populations of alpha retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and several SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGC subsets have been studied thoroughly in rodents. However, due to the thick cover of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> neurofilaments, the morphology of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs in the central retinal region is obscured and rarely described. Moreover, SMI-32 labels more than one morphological RGC type and the full morphological characteristics and distribution of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs have yet to be discovered. Here, using intracellular neurobiotin injections combined with SMI-32 antibody staining, we investigated morphological and distributional properties of the entire SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs population in the rat retina. We found that SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs were evenly distributed throughout the rat retina. We compared the morphological features of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> ON and OFF cells in the central, middle, and peripheral retinal regions. We found that SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs in different regions have distinct characteristics, such as the soma area, the dendritic field area and <i>Sholl</i> analysis of ON cells and OFF cells revealed significant differences between each region. We classified SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs into five clusters based on morphological features and found that a majority of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs belong to alpha-like cells; however, a small proportion of SMI-32<sup>+</sup> RGCs had small soma and small dendritic fields. Together, we present a full description of the morphology and distribution of SMI-32 immunoreactive RGCs in the rat retina.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">The Pigment‐Dispersing Factor neuronal network systematically grows in developing honey bees</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuropeptide Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF) plays a prominent role in the circadian clock of many insects including honey bees. In the honey bee brain, PDF is expressed in about 15 clock neurons per hemisphere that lie between the central brain and the optic lobes. As in other insects, the bee PDF neurons form wide arborizations in the brain; but certain differences are evident. For example, they arborize only sparsely in the accessory medulla (AME), which serves as important communication center of the circadian clock in cockroaches and flies. Furthermore, all bee PDF neurons cluster together, which makes it impossible to distinguish individual projections. Here, we investigated the developing bee PDF network and found that the first three PDF neurons arise in the 3<sup>rd</sup> larval instar and form a dense network of varicose fibers at the base of the developing medulla that strongly resembles the AME of hemimetabolous insects. In addition, they send faint fibers toward the lateral superior protocerebrum. In last larval instar, PDF cells with larger somata appear and send fibers toward the distal medulla and the medial protocerebrum. In the dorsal part of the medulla serpentine layer, a small PDF knot evolves from which PDF fibers extend ventrally. This knot disappears during metamorphosis and the varicose arborizations in the putative AME become fainter. Instead a new strongly stained PDF fiber hub appears in front of the lobula. Simultaneously, the number of PDF neurons increases and the PDF neuronal network in the brain gets continuously more complex.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A deep learning framework for inference of single-trial neural population activity from calcium imaging with sub-frame temporal resolution</a></h4>

              
                In many brain areas, neural populations act as a coordinated network whose state is tied to behavior on a moment-by-moment basis and millisecond timescale. Two-photon (2p) calcium imaging is a powerful tool to probe network-scale computation, as it can measure the activity of many individual neurons, monitor multiple layers simultaneously, and sample from identified cell types. However, estimating network states and dynamics from 2p measurements has proven challenging because of noise, inherent nonlinearities, and limitations on temporal resolution. Here we describe RADICaL, a deep learning method to overcome these limitations at the population level. RADICaL extends methods that exploit dynamics in spiking activity for application to deconvolved calcium signals, whose statistics and temporal dynamics are quite distinct from electrophysiologically-recorded spikes. It incorporates a novel network training strategy that exploits the timing of 2p sampling to recover network dynamics with high temporal precision. In synthetic tests, RADICaL infers network states more accurately than previous methods, particularly for high-frequency components. In real 2p recordings from sensorimotor areas in mice performing a "water grab" task, RADICaL infers network states with close correspondence to single-trial variations in behavior, and maintains high-quality inference even when neuronal populations are substantially reduced.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimizing transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) electrode position, size, and distance doubles the on-target cortical electric field: Evidence from 3000 Human Connectome Project models</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a widely used noninvasive brain stimulation technique with mixed results and no FDA-approved therapeutic indication to date. So far, thousands of published tDCS studies have placed large scalp electrodes directly over the intended brain target and delivered the same stimulation intensity to each person. Inconsistent therapeutic results may be due to insufficient cortical activation in some individuals and the inability to determine an optimal dose. Here, we computed 3000 MRI-based electric field models in 200 Human Connectome Project (HCP) participants, finding that the largely unexamined variables of electrode position, size, and between-electrode distance significantly impact the delivered cortical electric field magnitude. At the same scalp stimulation intensity, smaller electrodes surrounding the neural target deliver more than double the on-target cortical electric field while stimulating only a fraction of the off-target brain regions. This new optimized tDCS method can ensure sufficient cortical activation in each person and could produce larger and more consistent behavioral effects in every prospective research and transdiagnostic clinical application of tDCS.

                When faced with multiple potential movement options, individuals either reach directly to one of the options, or initiate a reach intermediate between the options. It remains unclear why people generate these two types of behaviors. Using the go-before-you-know task (commonly used to study behavior under choice uncertainty), we examined two key questions. First, do these two types of responses reflect distinct movement strategies, or are they simply examples of a more general response to choice uncertainty? If the former, the relative desirability (i.e., weighing the likelihood of successfully hitting the target versus the attainable reward) of the two target options might be computed differently for direct versus intermediate reaches. We showed that indeed, when exogenous reward and success likelihood (i.e., endogenous reward) differ between the two options, direct reaches were more strongly biased by likelihood whereas intermediate movements were more strongly biased by reward. Second, what drives individual differences in how people respond under uncertainty? We found that risk/reward-seeking individuals generated a larger proportion of intermediate reaches and were more sensitive to trial-to-trial changes in reward, suggesting these movements reflect a strategy to maximize reward. In contrast, risk-adverse individuals tended to generate more direct reaches in an attempt to maximize success. Together, these findings suggest that when faced with choice uncertainty, individuals adopt movement strategies consistent with their risk/reward-seeking tendency, preferentially biasing behavior toward exogenous rewards or endogenous success and consequently modulating the relative desirability of the available options.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stress deceleration theory: chronic adolescent stress exposure results in decelerated neurobehavioral maturation</a></h4>

              
                Normative development in adolescence indicates that the prefrontal cortex is still under development thereby unable to exert efficient top-down inhibitory control on subcortical regions such as the basolateral amygdala and the nucleus accumbens. This imbalance in the developmental trajectory between cortical and subcortical regions is implicated in expression of the prototypical impulsive, compulsive, reward seeking and risk-taking adolescent behavior. Here we demonstrate that a chronic mild unpredictable stress procedure during adolescence in male Wistar rats arrests the normal behavioral maturation such that they continue to express adolescent-like impulsive, hyperactive, and compulsive behaviors into late adulthood. This arrest in behavioral maturation is associated with the hypoexcitability of prelimbic cortex (PLC) pyramidal neurons and reduced PLC-mediated synaptic glutamatergic control of BLA and nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) neurons that lasts late into adulthood. At the same time stress exposure in adolescence results in the hyperexcitability of the BLA pyramidal neurons sending stronger glutamatergic projections to the NAcC. Chemogenetic reversal of the PLC hypoexcitability decreased compulsivity and improved the expression of goal-directed behavior in rats exposed to stress during adolescence, suggesting a causal role for PLC hypoexcitability in this stress-induced arrested behavioral development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transient inhibition to light explains stronger V1 responses to dark stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) receive excitation and inhibition from two different pathways processing lightness (ON) and darkness (OFF). V1 neurons overall respond more strongly to dark than light stimuli (Yeh, Xing and Shapley, 2010; Kremkow et al., 2014), consistent with a preponderance of darker regions in natural images (Ratliff et al., 2010), as well as human psychophysics (Buchner & Baumgartner, 2007). However, it has been unclear whether this "dark-dominance" is due to more excitation from the OFF pathway (Jin et al., 2008) or more inhibition from the ON pathway (Taylor et al., 2018). To understand the mechanisms behind dark-dominance, we record electrophysiological responses of individual simple-type V1 neurons to natural image stimuli and then train biologically inspired convolutional neural networks to predict the neuronal responses. Analyzing a sample of 74 neurons (in anesthetized, paralyzed cats) has revealed their responses to be more driven by dark than light stimuli, consistent with previous investigations (Yeh et al., 2010; Kremkow et al., 2013). We show this asymmetry to be predominantly due to slower inhibition to dark stimuli rather than by stronger excitation from the thalamocortical OFF pathway. Consistent with dark-dominant neurons having faster responses than light-dominant neurons (Komban et al., 2014), we find dark-dominance to solely occur in the early latencies of neuronal responses. Neurons that are strongly dark-dominated also tend to be less orientation selective. This novel approach gives us new insight into the dark-dominance phenomenon and provides an avenue to address new questions about excitatory and inhibitory integration in cortical neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Re-evaluating the actin-dependence of spectraplakin functions during axon growth and maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Axons are the long and slender processes of neurons constituting the biological cables that wire the nervous system. The growth and maintenance of axons require bundles of microtubules that extend through their entire length. Understanding microtubule regulation is therefore an essential aspect of axon biology. Key regulators of neuronal microtubules are the spectraplakins, a well-conserved family of cytoskeletal cross-linkers that underlie neuropathies in mouse and humans. Spectraplakin deficiency in mouse or Drosophila causes severe decay of microtubule bundles and axon growth inhibition. The underlying mechanisms are best understood for Drosophila Short stop (Shot) and believed to involve cytoskeletal cross-linkage: the N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domains bind to F-actin, and the C-terminus to microtubules and Eb1. Here we have gained new understanding by showing that the F-actin interaction must be finely balanced: altering the properties of F-actin networks or deleting/exchanging Shot's CH domains induces changes in Shot function - with a Lifeact-containing Shot variant causing remarkable remodelling of neuronal microtubules. In addition to actin-MT cross-linkage, we find strong indications that Shot executes redundant MT bundle-promoting roles that are F-actin-independent. We argue that these likely involve the neuronal Shot-PH isoform, which is characterised by a large, unexplored central plakin repeat region (PRR). Work on PRRs might therefore pave the way towards important new mechanisms of axon biology and architecture that might similarly apply to central PRRs in mammalian spectraplakins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual Stability of Pain- and Touch-Related Neuronal Gamma Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Background: The processing of brief pain and touch stimuli has been associated with an increase of neuronal oscillations in the gamma range (40-90 Hz). However, some studies report divergent gamma effects across single participants. Methods: In two repeated sessions we recorded gamma responses to pain and touch stimuli using EEG. Individual gamma responses were extracted from EEG channels and from ICA components that contain a strong gamma amplitude. Results: We observed gamma responses in the majority of the participants. If present, gamma synchronisation was always bound to a component that contained a laser-evoked response. We found a broad variety of individual cortical processing: some participants showed a clear gamma effect, others did not exhibit any gamma. For both modalities, the effect was reproducible between sessions. In addition, participants with a strong gamma response showed a similar time-frequency pattern across sessions. Conclusions: Our results indicate that current measures of reproducibility of research results do not reflect the complex reality of the diverse individual processing pattern of applied pain and touch. The present findings raise the question of whether we would find similar quantitatively different processing patterns in other domains in neuroscience: group results would be replicable but the overall effect is driven by a subgroup of the participants.

                A novel mutation (E83Q), the first in the NAC domain of alpha-synuclein (aSyn), was recently identified in a patient with dementia with Lewy bodies. We investigated the effects of this mutation on the aggregation of aSyn monomers and the structure, morphology, dynamic, and seeding activity of the aSyn fibrils in neurons. We found that it dramatically accelerates aSyn fibrillization and results in the formation of fibrils with distinct structural and dynamic properties. In cells, this mutation is associated with higher levels of aSyn, accumulation of pS129, and increased toxicity. In a neuronal seeding model of Lewy bodies (LB) formation, the E83Q mutation significantly enhances the internalization of fibrils into neurons, induce higher seeding activity and results in the formation of diverse aSyn pathologies, including the formation of LB-like inclusions that recapitulate the immunohistochemical and morphological features of brainstem LBs observed in PD patient brains.

	<p>Oxytocin (OT) circuitry plays a major role in the mediation of prosocial behavior. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication and have been suggested to display deficiencies in central OT mechanisms. The current preregistered meta-analysis evaluated potential group differences in endogenous OT levels between individuals with ASD and neurotypical (NT) controls. We included 18 studies comprising a total of 1422 participants. We found that endogenous OT levels are lower in children with ASD as compared to NT controls (n = 1123; g = −0.60; p = 0.006), but this effect seems to disappear in adolescent (n = 152; g = −0.20; p = 0.53) and adult populations (n = 147; g = 0.27; p = 0.45). Secondly, while no significant subgroup differences were found in regard to sex, the group difference in OT levels of individuals with versus without ASD seems to be only present in the studies with male participants (n = 814; g = −0.44; p = 0.08) and not female participants (n = 192; g = 0.11; p = 0.47). More research that employs more homogeneous methods is necessary to investigate potential developmental changes in endogenous OT levels, both in typical and atypical development, and to explore the possible use of OT level measurement as a diagnostic marker of ASD.</p>

	<p>Previous evidence has shown that early auditory processing impacts later linguistic development, and targeted training implemented at early ages can enhance auditory processing skills, with better expected language development outcomes. This study focuses on typically developing infants and aims to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of music training based on active synchronization with complex musical rhythms on the linguistic outcomes and electrophysiological functioning underlying auditory processing. Fifteen infants participated in the training (RTr+) and were compared with two groups of infants not attending any structured activities during the same time frame (RTr&amp;amp;minus;, N = 14). At pre- and post-training, expressive and receptive language skills were assessed using standardized tests, and auditory processing skills were characterized through an electrophysiological non-speech multi-feature paradigm. Results reveal that RTr+ infants showed significantly broader improvement in both expressive and receptive pre-language skills. Moreover, at post-training, they presented an electrophysiological pattern characterized by shorter latency of two peaks (N2* and P2), reflecting a neural change detection process: these shifts in latency go beyond those seen due to maturation alone. These results provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of our training in improving early linguistic competences, and in modifying the neural underpinnings of auditory processing in infants.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postoperative memory decline is an important consequence of anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), and the extent of resection may be a modifiable factor. This study aimed to define optimal resection margins for cognitive outcome while maintaining a high rate of postoperative seizure freedom.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study evaluated the resection extent on postoperative structural MRI using automated voxel-based methods and manual measurements in 142 consecutive patients with unilateral drug refractory TLE (74 left, 68 right TLE) who underwent standard ATLR.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Voxel-wise analyses revealed that postsurgical verbal memory decline correlated with resections of the posterior hippocampus and inferior temporal gyrus, whereas larger resections of the fusiform gyrus were associated with worsening of visual memory in left TLE. Limiting the posterior extent of left hippocampal resection to 55% reduced the odds of significant postoperative verbal memory decline by a factor of 8.1 (95% CI 1.5–44.4, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Seizure freedom was not related to posterior resection extent, but to the piriform cortex removal after left ATLR. In right TLE, variability of the posterior extent of resection was not associated with verbal and visual memory decline or seizures after surgery.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The extent of surgical resection is an independent and modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and seizures after left ATLR. Adapting the posterior extent of left ATLR might optimize postoperative outcome, with reduced risk of memory impairment while maintaining comparable seizure-freedom rates. The current, more lenient, approach might be appropriate for right ATLR. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <p>Nucleic acid therapeutics have been attracting attention as novel drug discovery modalities for intractable diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review provides an overview of the current status and prospects of antisense oligonucleotide treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recently, the results of a phase I/II study using the antisense oligonucleotides Tofersen to treat familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 mutation have been reported. Intrathecal Tofersen administration resulted in a 36% reduction in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the cerebrospinal fluid. Another report described 2 patients with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 treated with an adeno-associated virus encoding a microRNA targeting superoxide dismutase 1. The first patient, who possessed the fast progressive mutant A5V, received a single intrathecal infusion. Although the patient died of respiratory arrest 16 months after treatment, autopsy findings showed a reduction of &gt;90% in superoxide dismutase 1 level in the spinal cord. Clinical trials on antisense oligonucleotide therapies targeting other major amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-causative genes, fused in sarcoma and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72, are ongoing. To attenuate the pathology of TDP-43, strategies targeting regulators of TDP-43 (ataxin 2) and proteins downstream of TDP-43 (stathmin 2) by antisense oligonucleotides are being developed. The advent of nucleic acid therapeutics has enabled to specifically attack the molecules in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathological cascade, expanding the options for therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Quantifying neuronal structural changes over time using dynamic morphometrics</a></h4>

              
                Brain circuit development involves tremendous structural formation and rearrangement of dendrites, axons, and the synaptic connections between them. Direct studies of neuronal morphogenesis are now possible through recent developments in multiple technologies, including single-neuron labeling, time-lapse imaging in intact tissues, and 4D rendering software capable of tracking neural growth over periods spanning minutes to days. These methods allow detailed quantification of structural changes of neurons over time, called dynamic morphometrics, providing new insights into fundamental growth patterns, underlying molecular mechanisms, and the intertwined influences of external factors, including neural activity, and intrinsic genetic programs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-timescale biological learning algorithms train spiking neuronal network motor control</a></h4>

              
                Biological learning operates at multiple interlocking timescales, from long evolutionary stretches down to the relatively short time span of an individual's life. While each process has been simulated individually as a basic learning algorithm in the context of spiking neuronal networks (SNNs), the integration of the two has remained limited. In this study, we first train SNNs separately using individual model learning using spike-timing dependent reinforcement learning (STDP-RL) and evolutionary (EVOL) learning algorithms to solve the CartPole reinforcement learning (RL) control problem. We then develop an interleaved algorithm inspired by biological evolution that combines the EVOL and STDP-RL learning in sequence. We use the NEURON simulator with NetPyNE to create an SNN interfaced with the CartPole environment from OpenAI's Gym. In CartPole, the goal is to balance a vertical pole by moving left/right on a 1-D plane. Our SNN contains multiple populations of neurons organized in three layers: sensory layer, association/hidden layer, and motor layer, where neurons are connected by excitatory (AMPA/NMDA) and inhibitory (GABA) synapses. Association and motor layers contain one excitatory (E) population and two inhibitory (I) populations with different synaptic time constants. Each neuron is an event-based integrate-and-fire model with plastic connections between excitatory neurons. In our SNN, the environment activates sensory neurons tuned to specific features of the game state. We split the motor population into subsets representing each movement choice. The subset with more spiking over an interval determines the action. During STDP-RL, we supply intermediary evaluations (reward/punishment) of each action by judging the effectiveness of a move (e.g., moving the CartPole to a balanced position). During EVOL, updates consist of adding together many random perturbations of the connection weights. Each set of random perturbations is weighted by the total episodic reward it achieves when applied independently. We evaluate the performance of each algorithm after training and through the creation of sensory/motor action maps that delineate the network's transformation of sensory inputs into higher-order representations and eventual motor decisions. Both EVOL and STDP-RL training produce SNNs capable of moving the cart left and right and keeping the pole vertical. Compared to the STDP-RL and EVOL algorithms operating on their own, our interleaved training paradigm produced enhanced robustness in performance, with different strategies revealed through analysis of the sensory/motor mappings. Analysis of synaptic weight matrices also shows distributed vs clustered representations after the EVOL and STDP-RL algorithms, respectively. These weight differences also manifest as diffuse vs synchronized firing patterns. Our modeling opens up new capabilities for SNNs in RL and could serve as a testbed for neurobiologists aiming to understand multi-timescale learning mechanisms and dynamics in neuronal circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Contributions of Eye Gaze Fixations and Target-Lure Similarity to Behavioral and fMRI Indices of Pattern Separation and Pattern Completion</a></h4>

              
                Pattern separation and pattern completion are generally studied in humans using mnemonic discrimination tasks such as the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) where participants identify similar lures and repeated items from a series of images. Failures to correctly discriminate lures are thought to reflect a failure of pattern separation and a propensity toward pattern completion. Recent research has challenged this perspective, suggesting that poor encoding rather than pattern completion accounts for the occurrence of false alarm responses to similar lures. In two experiments, participants completed a continuous recognition task version of the MST while eye movement (Experiment 1 and 2) and fMRI data (Experiment 2) were collected. While we replicated the result that fixation counts at study predicted accuracy on lure trials, we found that target-lure similarity was a much stronger predictor of accuracy on lure trials across both experiments. Lastly, we found that fMRI activation changes in the hippocampus were significantly correlated with the number of fixations at study for correct but not incorrect mnemonic discrimination judgments when controlling for target-lure similarity. Our findings indicate that while eye movements during encoding predict subsequent hippocampal activation changes, mnemonic discrimination performance is better described by pattern separation and pattern completion processes that are influenced by target-lure similarity than simply poor encoding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct neurocognitive bases for social trait judgments of faces in autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by difficulties in social processes, interactions, and communication. Yet, the neurocognitive bases underlying these difficulties are unclear. Here, we triangulated the trans-diagnostic approach to personality, social trait judgments of faces, and neurophysiology to investigate (1) the relative position of autistic traits in a comprehensive social-affective personality space and (2) the distinct associations between the social-affective personality dimensions and social trait judgment from faces in individuals with ASD and neurotypical individuals. We collected personality and facial judgment data from a large sample of online participants (N = 89 self-identified ASD; N = 308 neurotypical controls). Factor analysis with 33 sub-scales of 10 social-affective personality questionnaires identified a 4-dimensional personality space. This analysis revealed that ASD and control participants did not differ significantly along the personality dimensions of empathy and prosociality, antisociality, or social agreeableness. However, the associations between these dimensions and judgments of facial trustworthiness and warmth differed across groups. Neurophysiological data also indicated that ASD and control participants might rely on distinct neuronal representations for judging trustworthiness and warmth from faces. These results suggest that the atypical association between social-affective personality and social trait judgment from faces may contribute to the social and affective difficulties associated with ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Constructing threat probability, fear behaviour, and aversive prediction error in the brainstem.</a></h4>

              
                When faced with potential threat we must estimate its probability, respond advantageously, and leverage experience to update future estimates. Threat estimates are the proposed domain of the forebrain, while behaviour is elicited by the brainstem. Yet, the brainstem is also a source of prediction error, a learning signal to acquire and update threat estimates. Neuropixels probes allowed us to record single-unit activity across a 21-region brainstem axis during probabilistic fear discrimination. Against a backdrop of widespread threat probability and behaviour signaling, a dorsally-based brainstem network rapidly signaled threat probability. Remapping of neuronal function following shock outcome gave rise to brainstem networks signaling prediction error on multiple timescales. The results reveal construction of threat probability, behaviour, and prediction error along a single brainstem axis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oscillatory population-level activity of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons sculpts sleep structure</a></h4>

              
                Dorsal raphe (DR) 5HT neurons are involved in regulating sleep/wake transitions. Previous studies demonstrated that single unit activity of DR 5HT neurons is high during wakefulness, decreases during non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and ceases during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. However, characteristics of the population level activity of DR 5HT neurons, which can influence the entire brain, are largely unknown. Here we measured population activities of 5 HT neurons in male and female mouse DR across the sleep/wake cycle by a ratiometric fiber photometry system. We found a slow oscillatory activity of compound intracellular Ca2+ signals during NREM sleep. The trough of concave 5HT activity increased along with sleep progression, but the 5HT activity level always returned to that seen in wake periods. When the trough reached the minimum level and remained there, REM sleep initiated. We also found a unique coupling of the oscillatory 5HT activity and EEG power fluctuation, suggesting that EEG fluctuation is a proxy for 5HT activity. Optogenetic activation of 5HT neurons during NREM sleep triggered a high EMG power and induced wakefulness. Optogenetic inhibition induced REM sleep or sustained NREM with an EEG power increase and EEG fluctuation. These manipulations demonstrated a causal role of DR 5HT neurons in sculpting sleep/wake structure. We also observed EEG fluctuations in human males during NREM sleep, implicating the existence of 5HT oscillatory activity in humans. We propose that NREM sleep is not a monotonous state, but that it is dynamically regulated by the oscillatory population activity of DR 5HT neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Designing and comparing cleaning pipelines for TMS-EEG data: a theoretical overview and practical example</a></h4>

              
                Combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG) is growing in popularity as a method for probing the reactivity and connectivity of neural circuits in basic and clinical research. However, using EEG to measure the neural responses to TMS is challenging due to the unique artifacts introduced by combining the two techniques. In this paper, we overview the artifacts present in TMS-EEG data and the offline cleaning methods used to suppress these unwanted signals. We then describe how open science practices, including the development of open-source toolboxes designed for TMS-EEG analysis (e.g., TESA - the TMS-EEG signal analyser), have improved the availability and reproducibility of TMS-EEG cleaning methods. We provide theoretical and practical considerations for designing TMS-EEG cleaning pipelines and then give an example of how to compare different pipelines using TESA. We show that changing even a single step in a pipeline designed to suppress decay artifacts results in TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) with small differences in amplitude and spatial topography. The variability in TEPs resulting from the choice of cleaning pipeline has important implications for comparing TMS-EEG findings between research groups which use different online and offline approaches. Finally, we discuss the challenges of validating cleaning pipelines and recommend that researchers compare outcomes from TMS-EEG experiments using multiple pipelines to ensure findings are not related to the choice of cleaning methods. We conclude that the continued improvement, availability, and validation of cleaning pipelines is essential to ensure TMS-EEG reaches its full potential as a method for studying human neurophysiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The P600, but not N400, is modulated by sustained attention</a></h4>

              
                The functional significance of the two prominent language-related ERP components N400 and P600 is still under debate. It has recently been suggested that one important dimension along which the two vary, is in terms of automaticity versus attentional control, with N400 amplitudes reflecting more automatic and P600 amplitudes reflecting more controlled aspects of sentence comprehension. The availability of executive resources necessary for controlled processes depends on sustained attention, which fluctuates over time. Here, we thus tested whether P600 and N400 amplitudes depend on the level of sustained attention. We re-analyzed EEG and behavioral data from a sentence processing task by Sassenhagen & Bornkessel-Schlesewsky (2015, Cortex), which included sentences with morphosyntactic and semantic violations. Participants read sentences phrase by phrase and indicated whether a sentence contained any type of anomaly as soon as they had the relevant information. To quantify periods of high versus low sustained attention, we extracted a moving reaction time coefficient of variation over the entire course of the task. We found that the P600 amplitude was significantly larger during periods of low reaction time variability (high sustained attention) than in periods of high reaction time variability (low sustained attention). In contrast, the amplitude of the N400 was not affected by reaction time variability. These results thus suggest that the P600 component is sensitive to sustained attention while the N400 component is not, which provides independent evidence for accounts suggesting that P600 amplitudes reflect more controlled and N400 amplitudes more automatic aspects of sentence comprehension.

                Neurons in frontal and parietal cortex encode task variables during decision-making, but causal manipulations of the two regions produce strikingly different results. For example, silencing the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in rats and monkeys produces minimal effects in perceptual decisions requiring integration of sensory evidence, but silencing frontal cortex profoundly impairs the same decisions. Here, we tested, for the first time, the causal roles of the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) and PPC in economic choice under risk. On each trial, rats chose between a lottery and a small but guaranteed surebet. The magnitude of the lottery was independently varied across trials and was indicated to the rat by the pitch of an auditory cue. As in perceptual decisions, both unilateral and bilateral PPC muscimol inactivations produced weak effects. FOF inactivations produced substantial changes in behavior even though our task had no working memory component. We quantified control and bilateral inactivation behavior with a multi-agent model consisting of a mixture of a 'rational' utility-maximizing agent (U=V{rho}) with two `habitual' agents that either choose surebet or lottery. Silencing PPC produced no significant shifts in any parameters relative to controls. Effects of FOF silencing were best explained by a decrease in {rho}, the exponent of the utility function. This effect was parsimoniously explained by a dynamical model where the FOF is part of network that performs sensory-to-value transformations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glutamate-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (GluCEST) Detects Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to the Motor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used in several FDA-approved treatments and, increasingly, to treat neurological disorders in off-label uses. However, the mechanism by which TMS causes physiological change is unclear, as are the origins of response variability in the general population. Ideally, objective in vivo biomarkers could shed light on these unknowns and eventually inform personalized interventions. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) is a form of TMS which has been observed to reduce motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for 60 minutes or longer post-stimulation, although the consistency of this effect and its mechanism continue to be under debate. Here, we use glutamate-weighted chemical exchange saturation transfer (gluCEST) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra-high magnetic field (7T) to measure changes in glutamate concentration at the site of cTBS. We find that gluCEST signal in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the brain generally decreases in response to cTBS, whereas consistent changes were not detected in the contralateral or in subjects receiving a sham stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxygenated hemoglobin signal provides greater predictive performance of experimental condition than de-oxygenated</a></h4>

              
                Continuous-wave functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging provides an estimate of relative changes in oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin content, from which regional neural activity is inferred. The relation between both signals is governed by neurovascular coupling mechanisms. However, the magnitude of concentration changes and the contribution of noise sources to each chromophore is unique. Subsequently, it is not apparent if either chromophore signal practically provides greater information about the underlying neural state and relation to an experimental condition. To assess this question objectively, we applied a machine-learning approach to four datasets and evaluated which hemoglobin signal best differentiated between experimental conditions. To further ensure the objective nature of the analysis, the algorithm utilized all samples from the epoched data rather than pre-selected features. Regardless of experimental task, brain region, or stimulus, the oxygenated hemoglobin signal was better able to differentiate between conditions than the de-oxygenated signal. Incorporating both signals into the analysis provided no additional improvement over oxygenated hemoglobin alone. These results indicate that oxyhemoglobin is the most informative fNIRS signal in relation to experimental condition.

                One of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the abnormal cerebral accumulation of amyloid-beta. Non-invasive monitoring of amyloid-beta deposits enables monitoring of treatment effects and understanding of the disease mechanism in the brain of disease animal models. Previous fluorescence imaging of has been mainly based on 2D diffuse fluoresence imaging and two-photon imaging with small field-of-view. Here we utilized a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) pipeline assisted with curcumin derivative CRANAD-2 for detecting the amyloid-beta; accumulation in arcAb mouse model of Alzheimer amyloidosis in 3D. A homebuilt FMT system was used for data acquisition, and a customized software platform was employed to enable the integration of anatomical information from MRI for assisting the FMT image reconstruction. To validate the multi-modal FMT-MRI method, conventional fluorescence reflectance imaging was conducted in the same conditions. Concordance in the time course of fluoresence intensity after intravenous injection of CRANAD-2 in the brain was observed. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of visualizing amyloid-beta; deposition in 3D using a multi-modal MRI-FMT method. This multimodal imaging method can provide complementary information of anatomical and molecular information thus facilitating future mechanistic studies and monitoring of putative treatments targeting amyloid-beta; in disease animal models.

                Inspiratory breathing rhythms arise from synchronized neuronal activity in a bilaterally distributed brainstem structure known as the preBotzinger complex (preBotC). In in vitro slice preparations containing the preBotC, extracellular potassium must be elevated above physiological levels (to 7-9mM) to observe regular rhythmic respiratory motor output in the hypoglossal nerve to which the preBotC projects. Reexamination of how extracellular K+ affects preBotC neuronal activity has revealed that low amplitude oscillations persist at physiological levels. These oscillatory events are sub-threshold from the standpoint of transmission to motor output and are dubbed burstlets. Burstlets arise from synchronized neural activity in a rhythmogenic neuronal subpopulation within the preBotC that in some instances may fail to recruit the larger network events, or bursts, required to generate motor output. The fraction of subthreshold preBotC oscillatory events (burstlet fraction) decreases sigmoidally with increasing extracellular potassium. These observations underlie the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Experimental and computational studies have suggested that recruitment of the non-rhythmogenic component of the preBotC population requires intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and activation of a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current. In this computational study, we show how intracellular calcium dynamics driven by synaptically triggered Ca2+ influx as well as Ca2+ release/uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum in conjunction with a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current can explain all of the key observations underlying the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Thus, we provide a mechanistic basis to unify the experimental findings on rhythm generation and motor output recruitment in the preBotC.

                Two key problems that span biological and industrial neural network research are how networks can be trained to generalize well and to minimize destructive interference between tasks. Both hinge on credit assignment, the targeting of specific network weights for change. In artificial networks, credit assignment is typically governed by gradient descent. Biological learning is thus often analyzed as a means to approximate gradients. We take the complementary perspective that biological learning rules likely confer advantages when they aren't gradient approximations. Further, we hypothesized that noise correlations, often considered detrimental, could usefully shape this learning. Indeed, we show that noise and three-factor plasticity interact to compute directional derivatives of reward, which can improve generalization, robustness to interference, and multi-task learning. This interaction also provides a method for routing learning quasi-independently of activity and connectivity, and demonstrates how biologically inspired inductive biases can be fruitfully embedded in learning algorithms.

                Relatively little is known regarding the interaction between encoding-related neural activity and sleep-based memory consolidation. One suggestion is that a function of encoding-related theta power may be to 'tag' memories for subsequent processing during sleep. This study aimed to extend previous work on the relationships between sleep spindles, slow oscillation-spindle coupling and task-related theta activity with a combined Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) and nap paradigm. This allowed us to examine the influence of task- and sleep-related oscillatory activity on the recognition of both encoded list words and associative theme words. Thirty-three participants (29 females, mean age = 23.2 years) learned and recognised DRM lists separated by either a 2hr wake or sleep period. Mixed-effects modelling revealed the sleep condition endorsed more associative theme words and fewer list words in comparison to the wake group. Encoding related theta power was also found to influence sleep spindle density, and this interaction was predictive of memory outcomes. The influence of encoding-related theta was specific to sleep spindle density, and did not appear to influence the strength of slow oscillation-spindle coupling as it relates to memory outcomes. The finding of interactions between wakeful and sleep oscillatory-related activity in promoting memory and learning has important implications for theoretical models of sleep-based memory consolidation.

                Restoration of proprioception with neurotechnology is critical to improve effectiveness of robotic neuro-prostheses. Unfortunately, after initial enthusiasm clinical results showed that unlike touch, proprioception could not be reliably induced. Here we show that concurrent activation of multiple sensory modalities may trigger unwanted sensory regulation mechanisms that disrupt proprioception. We recorded intra-spinal neural activity induced by stimulation of proprioceptive afferents from the radial nerve in three monkeys. Then, we superimposed stimulation of the radial nerve cutaneous branch and quantified its impact on spinal neural activity via population analysis. Proprioceptive pulses produced robust neural trajectories in the neural manifold that were disrupted by concurrent stimulation of cutaneous afferents. This disruption correlated with a reduction of afferent volleys and multi-unit activity both in the spinal cord and somatosensory cortex. Our results suggest that limited specificity not only impacts localization of artificial percepts, but also their nature to an extent that was never considered.

                Understanding the brain changes occurring during aging can provide new insights for developing treatments that alleviate or reverse cognitive decline. Neurostimulation techniques have emerged as potential treatments for brain disorders and to improve cognitive functions. Nevertheless, given the ethical restrictions of neurostimulation approaches, in silico perturbation protocols based on causal whole-brain models are fundamental to gaining a mechanistic understanding of brain dynamics. Furthermore, this strategy could serve as a more specific biomarker relating local activity with global brain dynamics. Here, we used a large resting-state fMRI dataset divided into middle-aged (N=310, aged < 65 years) and older adults (N=310, aged >= 65) to characterize brain states in each group as a probabilistic metastable substate (PMS) space, each with a probabilistic occurrence and frequency. Then, we fitted the PMS to a whole-brain model and applied in silico stimulations with different intensities in each node to force transitions from the brain states of the older group to the middle-age group. We found that the precuneus, a brain area belonging to the default mode network and the rich club, was the best stimulation target. These findings might have important implications for designing neurostimulation interventions to revert the effects of aging on whole-brain dynamics.

                Activity-dependent self-organization plays an important role in the formation of specific and stereotyped connectivity patterns in neural circuits. By combining neuronal cultures, tools with approaches from network neuroscience and information theory, we can study how complex network topology emerges from local neuronal interactions. We constructed effective connectivity networks using a transfer entropy analysis of electrophysiological signals recorded from rat embryo dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures between 6 and 35 days in vitro to investigate how the neuronal network topology evolves during maturation. The methodology for constructing the networks considered the synapse delay and addressed the influence of firing rate and population bursts as well as spurious effects on the inference of connections. We found that the number of links in the networks grew over the course of development, shifting from a segregated to a more integrated architecture. As part of this progression, three significant aspects of complex network topology emerged. In agreement with previous in silico and in vitro studies, a small-world architecture was detected, largely due to strong clustering among neurons. Additionally, the networks developed in a modular community topology, with most modules comprising nearby neurons. Finally, highly active neurons acquired topological characteristics that made them important nodes to the network and integrators of communities. These findings leverage new insights into how neuronal effective network topology relates to neuronal assembly self-organization mechanisms.

                Vestibular hair cells transmit information about head position and motion across synapses to primary afferent neurons. At some of these synapses, the afferent neuron envelopes the hair cell, forming an enlarged synaptic terminal referred to as a calyx. The vestibular hair cell-calyx synapse supports nonquantal transmission (NQT), a neurotransmitter-independent mechanism that is exceptionally fast. The underlying biophysical mechanisms that give rise to NQT are not fully understood. Here we present a computational model of NQT that integrates morphological and electrophysiological data. The model predicts that NQT involves two processes: changes in cleft K+ concentration, as previously recognized, and very fast changes in cleft electrical potential. A significant finding is that changes in cleft electrical potential are faster than changes in [K+] or quantal transmission. The electrical potential mechanism thus provides a basis for the exceptional speed of neurotransmission between type I hair cells and primary neurons and explains experimental observations of fast postsynaptic currents. The [K+] mechanism increases the gain of NQT. Both processes are mediated by current flow through low-voltage-activated K+ (KLV) channels located in both pre-synaptic (hair cell) and post-synaptic (calyx inner face) membranes. The model further demonstrates that the calyx morphology is necessary for NQT; as calyx height is increased, NQT increases in size, speed and efficacy at depolarizing the afferent neuron. We propose that the calyx evolved to enhance NQT and speed up signals that drive vestibular reflexes essential for stabilizing the eyes and neck and maintaining balance during rapid and complex head motions.

                A notable feature of neural activity is sparseness - namely, that only a small fraction of neurons in a local circuit have high activity at any moment. Not only is sparse neural activity observed experimentally in most areas of the brain, but sparseness has been proposed as an optimization or design principle for neural circuits. Sparseness can increase the energy efficiency of the neu- ral code as well as allow for beneficial computations to be carried out. But how does the brain achieve sparse- ness? Here, we found that when neurons in the primary visual cortex were passively exposed to a set of images over several days, neural responses became more sparse. Sparsification was driven by a decrease in the response of neurons with low or moderate activity, while highly active neurons retained similar responses. We also observed a net decorrelation of neural activity. These changes sculpt neural activity for greater coding efficiency.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Algorithmic Parameter Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Models</a></h4>

              
                Experimental data-based parameter search for Hodgkin-Huxley-style (HH) neuron models is a major challenge for neuroscientists and neuroengineers. Current search strategies are often computationally expensive, are slow to converge, have difficulty handling nonlinearities or multimodalities in the objective function, or require good initial parameter guesses. Most important, many existing approaches lack quantification of uncertainties in parameter estimates even though such uncertainties are of immense biological significance. We propose a novel method for parameter inference and uncertainty quantification in a Bayesian framework using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. This approach incorporates prior knowledge about model parameters (as probability distributions) and aims to map the prior to a posterior distribution of parameters informed by both the model and the data. Furthermore, using the adaptive parallel tempering strategy for MCMC, we tackle the highly nonlinear, noisy, and multimodal loss function, which depends on the HH neuron model. We tested the robustness of our approach using the voltage trace data generated from a 9-parameter HH model using five levels of injected currents (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 nA). Each test consisted of running the ground truth with its respective currents to estimate the model parameters. To simulate the condition for fitting a frequency-current (F-I) curve, we also introduced an aggregate objective that runs MCMC against all five levels simultaneously. We found that MCMC was able to produce many solutions with acceptable loss values (e.g., for 0.0 nA, 889 solutions were within 0.5% of the best solution and 1,595 solutions within 1% of the best solution). Thus, an adaptive parallel tempering MCMC search provides a "landscape" of the possible parameter sets with acceptable loss values in a tractable manner. Our approach is able to obtain an intelligently sampled global view of the solution distributions within a search range in a single computation. Additionally, the advantage of uncertainty quantification allows for exploration of further solution spaces, which can serve to better inform future experiments.

	<p>(1) The consistency and magnitude of the prevalence of Clinical High-Risk for Psychosis (CHR-P) individuals are undetermined, limiting efficient detection of cases. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of CHR-P individuals systematically assessed in the general population or clinical samples. (2) PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant (PROSPERO: CRD42020168672) meta-analysis of multiple databases until 21/01/21: a random-effects model meta-analysis, heterogeneity analysis, publication bias and quality assessment, sensitivity analysis&amp;amp;mdash;according to the gold-standard CHR-P and pre-screening instruments&amp;amp;mdash;leave-one-study-out analyses, and meta-regressions were conducted. (3) 35 studies were included, with 37,135 individuals tested and 1554 CHR-P individuals identified (median age = 19.3 years, Interquartile range (IQR) = 15.8&amp;amp;ndash;22.1; 52.2% females, IQR = 38.7&amp;amp;ndash;64.4). In the general population (k = 13, n = 26,835 individuals evaluated), the prevalence of the CHR-P state was 1.7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.0&amp;amp;ndash;2.9%). In clinical samples (k = 22, n = 10,300 individuals evaluated), the prevalence of the CHR-P state was 19.2% (95% CI = 12.9&amp;amp;ndash;27.7%). Using a pre-screening instrument was associated with false negatives (5.6%, 95% CI = 2.2&amp;amp;ndash;13.3%) and a lower CHR-P prevalence (11.5%, 95% CI = 6.2&amp;amp;ndash;20.5%) compared to using CHR-P instruments only (28.5%, 95% CI = 23.0&amp;amp;ndash;34.7%, p = 0.003). (4) The prevalence of the CHR-P state is low in the general population and ten times higher in clinical samples. The prevalence of CHR-P may increase with a higher proportion of females in the general population and with a younger population in clinical samples. The CHR-P state may be unrecognized in routine clinical practice. These findings can refine detection and preventive strategies.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease with available treatments only marginally slowing progression or improving survival. A hexanucleotide repeat expansion mutation in the C9ORF72 gene is the most commonly known genetic cause of both sporadic and familial cases of ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The C9ORF72 expansion mutation produces five dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), and while the mechanistic determinants of DPR-mediated neurotoxicity remain incompletely understood, evidence suggests that disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport and increased DNA damage contributes to pathology. Therefore, characterizing these disturbances and determining the relative contribution of different DPRs is needed to facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for C9ALS/FTD. To this end, we generated a series of nucleocytoplasmic transport “biosensors”, composed of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), fused to different classes of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export signals (NESs). Using these biosensors in conjunction with automated microscopy, we investigated the role of the three most neurotoxic DPRs (PR, GR, and GA) on seven nuclear import and two export pathways. In addition to other DPRs, we found that PR had pronounced inhibitory effects on the classical nuclear export pathway and several nuclear import pathways. To identify compounds capable of counteracting the effects of PR on nucleocytoplasmic transport, we developed a nucleocytoplasmic transport assay and screened several commercially available compound libraries, totaling 2714 compounds. In addition to restoring nucleocytoplasmic transport efficiencies, hits from the screen also counteract the cytotoxic effects of PR. Selected hits were subsequently tested for their ability to rescue another C9ALS/FTD phenotype—persistent DNA double strand breakage. Overall, we found that DPRs disrupt multiple nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways and we identified small molecules that counteract these effects—resulting in increased viability of PR-expressing cells and decreased DNA damage markers in patient-derived motor neurons. Several HDAC inhibitors were validated as hits, supporting previous studies that show that HDAC inhibitors confer therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative models.</p>

	<p>In memory, representations of spatial features are stored in different reference frames; features relative to our position are stored egocentrically and features relative to each other are stored allocentrically. Accessing these representations engages many cognitive and neural resources, and so is susceptible to age-related breakdown. Yet, recent findings on the heterogeneity of cognitive function and spatial ability in healthy older adults suggest that aging may not uniformly impact the flexible use of spatial representations. These factors have yet to be explored in a precisely controlled task that explicitly manipulates spatial frames of reference across learning and retrieval. We used a lab-based virtual reality task to investigate the relationship between object–location memory across frames of reference, cognitive status, and self-reported spatial ability. Memory error was measured using Euclidean distance from studied object locations to participants’ responses at testing. Older adults recalled object locations less accurately when they switched between frames of reference from learning to testing, compared with when they remained in the same frame of reference. They also showed an allocentric learning advantage, producing less error when switching from an allocentric to an egocentric frame of reference, compared with the reverse direction of switching. Higher MoCA scores and better self-assessed spatial ability predicted less memory error, especially when learning occurred egocentrically. We suggest that egocentric learning deficits are driven by difficulty in binding multiple viewpoints into a coherent representation. Finally, we highlight the heterogeneity of spatial memory performance in healthy older adults as a potential cognitive marker for neurodegeneration, beyond normal aging.</p>

	<p>Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are experiencing severe mental distress. Thus, during the last year, drastic changes occurred in everyday life of every human being. Following social distancing and economic insecurity, significant increases in mental health concerns (loneliness, anxiety, depression, or insomnia) have developed. The objective of this study was to explore the anxiety, perceived stress, and resilience in a population presenting at the general practitioner, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected between February and April 2021 and 440 individuals who presented to the general practitioner were evaluated. Concerning anxiety level, almost half of the respondents (49,3%, N = 217) scored above the threshold value on the anxiety scale (mild intensity 38.6%, moderate intensity 9.9%, severe intensity 0.8%). Having a low level of resilience, as well as experiencing a high level of stress, are both predictive of the occurrence of high anxiety (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, r = −0.551 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, r = 0.622, respectively). Furthermore, resilience is negatively related to perceived stress (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, r = −0.676). It is critical in the current crisis to recognize those at risk of developing mental illnesses, taking into consideration the various socioeconomic classes, as well as to maintain and improve the general public’s mental health using appropriate psychological interventions.</p>

	<p>The Intelligibility in Context Scale (ICS) is a widely used, efficient tool for describing a child’s speech intelligibility. Few studies have explored the relationship between ICS scores and transcription intelligibility scores, which are the gold standard for clinical measurement. This study examined how well ICS composite scores predicted transcription intelligibility scores among children with cerebral palsy (CP), how well individual questions from the ICS differentially predicted transcription intelligibility scores, and how well the ICS composite scores differentiated between children with and without speech motor impairment. Parents of 48 children with CP, who were approximately 13 years of age, completed the ICS. Ninety-six adult naïve listeners provided orthographic transcriptions of children’s speech. Transcription intelligibility scores were regressed on ICS composite scores and individual item scores. Dysarthria status was regressed on ICS composite scores. Results indicated that ICS composite scores were moderately strong predictors of transcription intelligibility scores. One individual ICS item differentially predicted transcription intelligibility scores, and dysarthria severity influenced how well ICS composite scores differentiated between children with and without speech motor impairment. Findings suggest that the ICS has potential clinical utility for children with CP, especially when used with other objective measures of speech intelligibility.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Studies in animals have demonstrated a strong relationship between cortical and hippocampal activity, and autonomic tone. However, the extent, distribution, and nature of this relationship have not been investigated with intracranial recordings in humans during sleep. Cortical and hippocampal population neuronal firing was estimated from high  band activity (HG) from 70 to 110 Hz in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from 15 subjects (nine females) during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Autonomic tone was estimated from heart rate variability (HRV). HG and HRV were significantly correlated in the hippocampus and multiple cortical sites in NREM stages N1&ndash;N3. The average correlation between HG and HRV could be positive or negative across patients given anatomic location and sleep stage and was most profound in lateral temporal lobe in N3, suggestive of greater cortical activity associated with sympathetic tone. Patient-wide correlation was related to  band activity (1&ndash;4 Hz), which is known to be correlated with high  activity during sleep. The percentage of statistically correlated channels was weaker in N1 and N2 as compared with N3, and was strongest in regions that have previously been associated with autonomic processes, such as anterior hippocampus and insula. The anatomic distribution of HRV-HG correlations during sleep did not reproduce those usually observed with positron emission tomography (PET) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during waking. This study aims to characterize the relationship between autonomic tone and neuronal firing rate during sleep and further studies are needed to investigate finer temporal resolutions, denser coverages, and different frequency bands in both waking and sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sharing Happy Stories Increases Interpersonal Closeness: Interpersonal Brain Synchronization as a Neural Indicator</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Our lives revolve around sharing emotional stories (i.e., happy and sad stories) with other people. Such emotional communication enhances the similarity of story comprehension and neural across speaker-listener pairs. The theory of Emotions as Social Information Model (EASI) suggests that such emotional communication may influence interpersonal closeness. However, few studies have examined speaker-listener interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) during emotional communication and whether it is associated with meaningful aspects of the speaker-listener interpersonal relationship. Here, one speaker watched emotional videos and communicated the content of the videos to 32 people as listeners (happy/sad/neutral group). Both speaker and listeners&rsquo; neural activities were recorded using EEG. After listening, we assessed the interpersonal closeness between the speaker and listeners. Compared with the sad group, sharing happy stories showed a better recall quality and a higher rating of interpersonal closeness. The happy group showed higher IBS in the frontal cortex and left temporoparietal cortex than the sad group. The relationship between frontal IBS and interpersonal closeness was moderated by sharing happy/sad stories. Exploratory analysis using support vector regression (SVR) showed that the IBS could also predict the ratings of interpersonal closeness. These results suggest that frontal IBS could serve as an indicator of whether sharing emotional stories facilitate interpersonal closeness. These findings improve our understanding of emotional communication among individuals that guides behaviors during interpersonal interactions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Control of tissue homeostasis, tumorigenesis, and degeneration by coupled bidirectional bistable switches</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Diego Barra Avila, Juan R. Melendez-Alvarez, Xiao-Jun Tian</p>

The Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway plays a critical role in tissue homeostasis, tumorigenesis, and degeneration disorders. The regulation of YAP/TAZ levels is controlled by a complex regulatory network, where several feedback loops have been identified. However, it remains elusive how these feedback loops contain the YAP/TAZ levels and maintain the system in a healthy physiological state or trap the system in pathological conditions. Here, a mathematical model was developed to represent the YAP/TAZ regulatory network. Through theoretical analyses, three distinct states that designate the one physiological and two pathological outcomes were found. The transition from the physiological state to the two pathological states is mechanistically controlled by coupled bidirectional bistable switches, which are robust to parametric variation and stochastic fluctuations at the molecular level. This work provides a mechanistic understanding of the regulation and dysregulation of YAP/TAZ levels in tissue state transitions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Attractive internuclear force drives the collective behavior of nuclear arrays in Drosophila embryos</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiaoxuan Wu, Kakit Kong, Wenlei Xiao, Feng Liu</p>

The collective behavior of the nuclear array in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos during nuclear cycle (NC) 11 to NC14 is crucial in controlling cell size, establishing developmental patterns, and coordinating morphogenesis. After live imaging on <i>Drosophila</i> embryos with light sheet microscopy, we extract the nuclear trajectory, speed, and internuclear distance with an automatic nuclear tracing method. We find that the nuclear speed shows a period of standing waves along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis after each metaphase as the nuclei collectively migrate towards the embryo poles and partially move back. And the maximum nuclear speed dampens by 28%-45% in the second half of the standing wave. Moreover, the nuclear density is 22–42% lower in the pole region than the middle of the embryo during the interphase of NC12-NC14. To find mechanical rules controlling the collective motion and packing patterns of the nuclear array, we use a deep neural network (DNN) to learn the underlying force field from data. We apply the learned spatiotemporal attractive force field in the simulations with a particle-based model. And the simulations recapitulate nearly all the observed characteristic collective behaviors of nuclear arrays in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discriminative feature of cells characterizes cell populations of interest by a small subset of genes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takeru Fujii, Kazumitsu Maehara, Masatoshi Fujita, Yasuyuki Ohkawa</p>

Organisms are composed of various cell types with specific states. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the functions of organs and tissues, cell types have been classified and defined by identifying specific marker genes. Statistical tests are critical for identifying marker genes, which often involve evaluating differences in the mean expression levels of genes. Differentially expressed gene (DEG)-based analysis has been the most frequently used method of this kind. However, in association with increases in sample size such as in single-cell analysis, DEG-based analysis has faced difficulties associated with the inflation of P-values. Here, we propose the concept of discriminative feature of cells (DFC), an alternative to using DEG-based approaches. We implemented DFC using logistic regression with an adaptive LASSO penalty to perform binary classification for discriminating a population of interest and variable selection to obtain a small subset of defining genes. We demonstrated that DFC prioritized gene pairs with non-independent expression using artificial data and that DFC enabled characterization of the muscle satellite/progenitor cell population. The results revealed that DFC well captured cell-type-specific markers, specific gene expression patterns, and subcategories of this cell population. DFC may complement DEG-based methods for interpreting large data sets. DEG-based analysis uses lists of genes with differences in expression between groups, while DFC, which can be termed a discriminative approach, has potential applications in the task of cell characterization. Upon recent advances in the high-throughput analysis of single cells, methods of cell characterization such as scRNA-seq can be effectively subjected to the discriminative methods.

                <p>by Adrienne C. Kinney, Sean Current, Joceline Lega</p>

We present artificial neural networks as a feasible replacement for a mechanistic model of mosquito abundance. We develop a feed-forward neural network, a long short-term memory recurrent neural network, and a gated recurrent unit network. We evaluate the networks in their ability to replicate the spatiotemporal features of mosquito populations predicted by the mechanistic model, and discuss how augmenting the training data with time series that emphasize specific dynamical behaviors affects model performance. We conclude with an outlook on how such equation-free models may facilitate vector control or the estimation of disease risk at arbitrary spatial scales.

                The interactivity and ubiquity of digital technologies are exerting a significant impact on the knowledge creation in information technology (KC-IT) projects. According to the literature, the critical relevance of KC-IT is highly associated with digital innovation (DI) for organisational success. However, DI is not yet a fully-fledged research subject but is an evolving corpus of theory and practise that draws from a variety of social science fields. Given the preceding setting, this study explores the interaction of KC-IT with DI. This work provides a systemic literature review (SLR) to examine the literature in KC-IT and its connection to DI. A SLR of 527 papers from 2001 to 2021 was performed across six online databases. The review encompasses quantitative and qualitative studies on KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Three major gaps were found in the SLR. Firstly, only 57 (0.23%) papers were found to examine the association between KC and IT projects. These works were analysed for theories, type of papers, KC-IT factors, processes and methods. Secondly, the convergence reviews indicate that scarce research has examined TMS and trust in KC-IT as factors. Thirdly, only 0.02% (5) core papers appeared in the search relevant to KC in IT projects to accelerate DI. The majority of the papers examined were not linked to DI. A significant gap also exists in these areas. These findings warrant the attention of the research community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Improving the data access control using blockchain for healthcare domain [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Unauthorized access to data is one of the most significant privacy issues that hinder most industries from adopting big data technologies. Even though specific processes and structures have been put in place to deal with access authorization and identity management for large databases nonetheless, the scalability criteria are far beyond the capabilities of traditional databases. Hence, most researchers are looking into other solutions, such as big data management. Methods: In this paper, we firstly study the strengths and weaknesses of implementing cryptography and blockchain for identity management and authorization control in big data, focusing on the healthcare domain. Subsequently, we propose a decentralized data access and sharing system that preserves privacy to ensure adequate data access management under the blockchain. In addition, we designed a blockchain framework to resolve the decentralized data access and sharing system privacy issues, by implementing a public key infrastructure model, which utilizes a signature cryptography algorithm (elliptic curve and signcryption). Lastly, we compared the proposed blockchain model to previous techniques to see how well it performed. Results: We evaluated the blockchain on four performance metrics which include throughput, latency, scalability, and security. The proposed blockchain model was tested using a sample of 5000 patients and 500,000 observations. The performance evaluation results further showed that the proposed model achieves higher throughput and lower latency compared to existing approaches when the workload varies up to 10,000 transactions. Discussion: This research reviews the importance of blockchains as they provide infinite possibilities to individuals, companies, and governments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Synchronous online learning during movement control order in higher education institutions: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Higher education institutions (HEI) are not spared from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The closure of campuses because of the movement control order (MCO) to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 has forced HEIs to adopt online learning, especially synchronous online learning (SOL). Although teaching and learning can be continued via SOL, retaining students’ interest and sustaining their engagement have not been sufficiently explored. This study presents a systematic review of the research pertaining to SOL associated with students’ interest and engagement in HEIs during the MCO environment. Methods: Five major online databases, i.e., EBSCOhost, Science Direct, Emerald, Scopus and Springer were searched to collect relevant papers published between 1st January 2010 to 15th June 2021 including conference proceedings, peer-reviewed papers and dissertations. Papers written in the English language, based in full-fledged universities, and with these five keywords: (i) synchronous online learning, (ii) engagement, (iii) interest, (iv) MCO/Covid-19 and (v) HEI, were included. Papers focussing on synchronous and asynchronous online learning in schools and colleges were excluded. Each paper was reviewed by two reviewers in order to confirm the eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: We found 31 papers of which six papers were related to SOL, engagement and interest in HEIs in the MCO environment. Our review presents three major findings: (i) limited research has been conducted on SOL associated with students’ engagement and interest, (ii) studies related to the context of HEIs in the MCO environment are limited, and (iii) the understanding of the new phenomena through qualitative research is insufficient. We highlight the SOL alignment with students’ engagement, interest, style preference, learner interaction effectiveness, behavior and academic performance. Conclusions: We believe that the findings of this study are timely and require attention from the research community.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Theory of mind (ToM) seems to be affected in multiple sclerosis (MS). MRI studies suggested a role of the amygdala in social cognitive performances. Therefore, we explored the role of the amygdala network in ToM using a multimodal MRI approach. In MS, patients with impaired ToM showed contradictory dysexecutive neuropsychological profile. Therefore, we compared neural networks involved in ToM and executive functions (EFs). Twenty patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 15 matched healthy controls were selected. ToM (Faux Pas test and mind stories) and EFs were assessed within and outside the scanner. All subjects underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests. Multimodal MRI with structural (diffusion imaging) and functional (resting-state and task-based) sequences was used to analyze the role and connections of the amygdala in ToM functioning. Cognitive and ToM performances were similar between patients and controls. Resting-state data revealed decreased connectivity of the left amygdala with frontal areas in patients compared to controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). During the task-based functional MRI, patients demonstrated increased connectivity between the amygdala and several cerebellar and left temporal regions (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The microstructural alterations between the left amygdala and left temporal regions were associated with increased functional connectivity within the same pathway (<i>r</i> = 0.74; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). No overlap was observed between functional networks involved in ToM and EFs. Our study demonstrates more connectivity recruitment between the amygdala and cerebellar and temporal regions in MS patients to reach preserved ToM performance. Microstructural abnormalities have been related to this compensatory network. Finally, different networks were involved in EFs and ToM.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Neurobiology of the lateral septum: regulation of social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions are essential for mammalian life and are regulated by evolutionary conserved neuronal mechanisms. An individual’s internal state, experiences, and the nature of the social stimulus are critical for determining apt responses to social situations. The lateral septum (LS) – a structure of the basal forebrain – integrates abundant cortical and subcortical inputs, and projects to multiple downstream regions to generate appropriate behavioral responses. Although incoming cognitive information is indispensable for contextualizing a social stimulus, neuromodulatory information related to the internal state of the organism significantly influences the behavioral outcome as well.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Motor memories of object dynamics are categorically organized</a></h4>

              
                The ability to predict the dynamics of objects, linking applied force to motion, underlies our capacity to perform many of the tasks we carry out on a daily basis. Thus, a fundamental question is how the dynamics of the myriad objects we interact with are organized in memory. Using a custom-built three-dimensional robotic interface that allowed us to simulate objects of varying appearance and weight, we examined how participants learned the weights of sets of objects that they repeatedly lifted. We find strong support for the novel hypothesis that motor memories of object dynamics are organized categorically, in terms of families, based on covariation in their visual and mechanical properties. A striking prediction of this hypothesis, supported by our findings and not predicted by standard associative map models, is that outlier objects with weights that deviate from the family-predicted weight will never be learned despite causing repeated lifting errors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative spatial and temporal assessment of regulatory element activity in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Mutations or genetic variation in noncoding regions of the genome harbouring cis-regulatory elements (CREs), or enhancers, have been widely implicated in human disease and disease risk. However, our ability to assay the impact of these DNA sequence changes on enhancer activity is currently very limited because of the need to assay these elements in an appropriate biological context. Here, we describe a method for simultaneous quantitative assessment of the spatial and temporal activity of wild-type and disease-associated mutant human CRE alleles using live imaging in zebrafish embryonic development. We generated transgenic lines harbouring a dual-CRE dual-reporter cassette in a pre-defined neutral docking site in the zebrafish genome. The activity of each CRE allele is reported via expression of a specific fluorescent reporter, allowing simultaneous visualisation of where and when in development the wild-type allele is active and how this activity is altered by mutation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sex differences in learning from exploration</a></h4>

              
                Sex-based modulation of cognitive processes could set the stage for individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. While value-based decision making processes in particular have been proposed to be influenced by sex differences, the overall correct performance in decision making tasks often show variable or minimal differences across sexes. Computational tools allow us to uncover latent variables that define different decision making approaches, even in animals with similar correct performance. Here, we quantify sex differences in mice in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task: a restless 2-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, largely because they appeared to get 'stuck' in exploration once they had started. Female mice tended to explore less but learned more quickly during exploration. Together, these results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. Exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Capping protein regulates endosomal trafficking by controlling F-actin density around endocytic vesicles and recruiting RAB5 effectors</a></h4>

              
                Actin filaments (F-actin) have been implicated in various steps of endosomal trafficking, and the length of F-actin is controlled by actin capping proteins, such as CapZ, which is a stable heterodimeric protein complex consisting of a and β subunits. However, the role of these capping proteins in endosomal trafficking remains elusive. Here, we found that CapZ docks to endocytic vesicles via its C-terminal actin-binding motif. CapZ knockout significantly increases the F-actin density around immature early endosomes, and this impedes fusion between these vesicles, manifested by the accumulation of small endocytic vesicles in CapZ-knockout cells. CapZ also recruits several RAB5 effectors, such as Rabaptin-5, to RAB5-positive early endosomes via its N-terminal domain, and this further activates RAB5. Collectively, our results indicate that CapZ regulates endosomal trafficking by controlling actin density around early endosomes and recruiting RAB5 effectors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enrichment of SARM1 alleles encoding variants with constitutively hyperactive NADase in patients with ALS and other motor nerve disorders</a></h4>

              
                SARM1, a protein with critical NADase activity, is a central executioner in a conserved programme of axon degeneration. We report seven rare missense or in-frame microdeletion human <i>SARM1</i> variant alleles in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or other motor nerve disorders that alter the SARM1 auto-inhibitory ARM domain and constitutively hyperactivate SARM1 NADase activity. The constitutive NADase activity of these seven variants is similar to that of SARM1 lacking the entire ARM domain and greatly exceeds the activity of wild-type SARM1, even in the presence of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), its physiological activator. This rise in constitutive activity alone is enough to promote neuronal degeneration in response to otherwise non-harmful, mild stress. Importantly, these strong gain-of-function alleles are completely patient-specific in the cohorts studied and show a highly significant association with disease at the single gene level. These findings of disease-associated coding variants that alter SARM1 function build on previously reported genome-wide significant association with ALS for a neighbouring, more common <i>SARM1</i> intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to support a contributory role of SARM1 in these disorders. A broad phenotypic heterogeneity and variable age-of-onset of disease among patients with these alleles also raises intriguing questions about the pathogenic mechanism of hyperactive SARM1 variants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The critical role of the ventral temporal lobe in word retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in word retrieval are a hallmark of a variety of neurological illnesses spanning from dementia to traumatic injuries. The role of the dominant temporal lobe in fluent naming has been characterized by lesional analyses, functional imaging, and intracranial recordings, but limitations of each of these measures preclude a clear assessment of which specific constituent of the temporal lobe is critical for naming. We studied a large cohort of patients undergoing surgical resections or laser ablations of the dominant temporal lobe for medically intractable epilepsy (n=95). These techniques are exceedingly effective for seizure control but often result in language declines, particularly in confrontation naming, which can be socio-economically disabling. We used a multivariate voxel-based lesion symptom mapping analysis to localize brain regions significantly associated with visual object naming deficits. We observed that posterior inferior temporal regions, centered around the middle fusiform gyrus, were significantly associated with a decline in confrontation naming. Furthermore, we found that the posterior margin of anterior temporal lobectomies was linearly correlated to a decline in visual naming with a clinically significant decline occurring once the resection extended 6 cm from the anterior tip of the temporal lobe. We integrated these findings with electrocorticography during naming in a subset of this population and found that the majority of cortical regions whose resection was associated with a significant decline overlapped with regions that were functionally most active prior to articulation. Importantly, these loci coincide with the sites of susceptibility artifacts during echo-planar imaging, which explains why this region has not previously been implicated. Taken together, these data highlight the crucial contribution of the posterior ventral temporal cortex in lexical access and its important role in the pathophysiology of anomia following temporal lobe resections. Surgical strategies, including the use of laser ablation to target the medial temporal lobe as well as microsurgical approaches, should attempt to preserve this region to mitigate postoperative language deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spotlight of attention turns from rhythmic exploration-exploitation to a stable exploitation state</a></h4>

              
                While traditional studies claim that visuospatial attention stays fixed at one location at a time, recent research has rather shown that attention rhythmically fluctuates between different locations at rates of prominent brain rhythms. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of this fluctuation and, particularly, whether it changes over time. Thus, we addressed this question by investigating how visuospatial attention behaves over space and time. We recorded electroencephalographic activity of twenty-seven human participants while they performed a visuospatial cueing task, where attention was covertly oriented to the left or right visual field. In order to decode the spatial locus of attention from neural activity, we trained and tested a classifier on every timepoint of the orienting period, from the attentional cue to stimulus onset. This resulted in one temporal generalization matrix per participant, which was time-frequency decomposed to identify the sampling rhythm. Finally, a searchlight analysis was conducted to reveal the brain regions responsible for attention allocation. Our results show a dynamic evolution of the attentional spotlight, distinguishing between two states. In an early time window, attention explored both cued and uncued hemifield rhythmically at ~10 Hz. In a later time window attention focused on the cued hemifield. Classification was driven by occipital sources, while frontal regions exclusively became involved just before the spotlight settled onto the cued location. Together, our results define attentional sampling as a quasi-rhythmic dynamic process characterized by an initial rhythmic exploration-exploitation state, which is followed by a stable exploitation state.

                Background: Variation in the longitudinal course of childhood attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) coincides with neurodevelopmental maturation of brain structure and function. Prior work has attempted to determine how alterations in white matter (WM) relate to changes in symptom severity, but much of that work has been done in smaller cross-sectional samples using voxel-based analyses. Using standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods, we previously showed WM alterations were associated with ADHD symptom remission over time in a longitudinal sample of probands, siblings, and unaffected individuals. Here, we extend this work by further assessing the nature of these changes in WM microstructure by including an additional follow-up measurement (aged 18-34 years), and using the more physiologically informative fixel-based analysis (FBA). Methods: Data were obtained from 139 participants over 3 clinical and 2 follow-up DWI waves, and analyzed using FBA in regions-of-interest based on prior findings. We replicated previously reported significant models and extended them by adding another time-point, testing whether changes in combined and hyperactivity-impulsivity (HI) continuous symptom scores are associated with fixel metrics at follow-up. Results: Clinical improvement in HI symptoms over time was associated with more fiber density at follow-up in the left corticospinal tract (lCST) (tmax=1.092, standardized effect[SE]=0.044, pFWE=0.016), and improvement in combined symptoms over time was associated with more fiber cross-section at follow-up in the lCST (tmax=3.775, SE=0.051, pFWE=0.019). Conclusions: Aberrant white matter development involves both lCST micro- and macrostructural alterations and its path may be moderated by preceding symptom trajectory.

                Prominent theories of perception suggest that the brain builds probabilistic models of the world, assessing the statistics of the visual input to inform this construction. However, the evidence for this idea is often based on simple impoverished stimuli, and the results have often been discarded as an illusion reflecting simple "summary statistics" of visual inputs. Here we show that the visual system represents probabilistic distributions of complex heterogeneous stimuli. Importantly, we show how these statistical representations are integrated with representations of other features and bound to locations, and can therefore serve as building blocks for object and scene processing. We uncover the organization of these representations at different spatial scales by showing how expectations for incoming features are biased by neighboring locations. We also show that there is not only a bias, but also a skew in the representations, arguing against accounts positing that probabilistic representations are discarded in favor of simplified summary statistics (e.g., mean and variance). In sum, our results reveal detailed probabilistic encoding of stimulus distributions, representations that are bound with other features and to particular locations.

                Glycosylation plays a critical role during inflammation and glial scar formation upon spinal cord injury (SCI) disease progression. Astrocytes and microglia are involved in this cascade to modulate the inflammation and tissue remodelling from acute to chronic phases. Therefore, understating the glycan changes in these glial cells is paramount. Herein a lectin microarray was undertaken using a cytokine-driven inflammatory MGC model, revealing considerable differential glycosylation from the acute to the chronic phase in a cytokine-combination generated inflamed MGC model. It was found that several N- and O-linked glycans associated with glia during SCI were differentially regulated. Pearson's correlation hierarchical clustering showed that groups were separated into several clusters, illustrating the heterogenicity among the control, cytokine combination, and LPS treated groups and the day on which treatment was given. Control and LPS treatments were observed to be in dense clusters. This was further confirmed with lectin immunostaining in which GalNAc, GlcNAc, mannose, fucose and sialic acid-binding residues were detected in astrocytes and microglia. However, this modification (upregulation of sialic acid expression) was inhibited by the sialyltransferase inhibitor which indeed modulates the mitochondrial functions. The present study is the first functional investigation of glycosylation modulation in a MGC (MGC) model which elucidates the role of the glycome in neuroinflammation and identified potential therapeutic targets for future glycol- therapeutics in neuroinflammation

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Slow fluctuations in ongoing brain activity decrease in amplitude with ageing yet their impact on task-related evoked responses is dissociable from behaviour</a></h4>

              
                In humans, ageing is characterized by decreased brain signal variability and increased behavioural variability. To understand how reduced brain variability segregates with increased behavioural variability, we investigated the association between reaction time variability, evoked brain responses and ongoing brain signal dynamics, in young (N = 36) and older adults (N = 39). We studied the electroencephalogram (EEG) and pupil size fluctuations to characterize the cortical and arousal responses elicited by a cued go/no-go task. Evoked responses were strongly modulated by slow (< 2 Hz) fluctuations of the ongoing signals, which presented reduced power in the older participants. Although variability of the evoked responses was lower in the older participants, once we adjusted for the effect of the ongoing signal fluctuations, evoked responses were equally variable in both groups. Moreover, the modulation of the evoked responses caused by the ongoing signal fluctuations had no impact on reaction time, thereby explaining why although ongoing brain signal variability is decreased in older individuals, behavioural variability is not. Finally, we showed that adjusting for the effect of the ongoing signal was critical to unmask the link between neural responses and behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential replay for reward and punishment paths predicts approach and avoidance</a></h4>

              
                Planning is thought to involve neural replay, where states relevant to a task goal are rapidly reactivated in sequence. It remains unclear if, during planning, replay of a path relates to an actual prospective choice. Here, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we studied participants while they planned to either approach or avoid an uncertain environment that contained paths leading to reward and to punishment. We show significant planning-related forward sequential replay with state-to-state transitions in the range of 20 to 90 ms. Replay of rewarding paths was boosted prior to a decision to avoid, and attenuated prior to a decision to approach. Crucially, a trial-by-trial bias in replaying punishing paths predicted an irrational choice to approach when a prospective environment was more risky, an effect that was particularly marked in more anxious participants. The findings reveal a coupling between the content of forwards replay and rational choice behaviour, such that replay prioritises an online representation of potential reward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The influence of somatosensory and auditory evoked potentials on concurrent transcranial-magnetic stimulation electroencephalography recordings</a></h4>

              
                Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evoked potentials (TEPs) can be used to index cortical excitability. However, it remains unclear to what extent TEPs reflect somatosensory and auditory-evoked potentials which arise from the scalp sensation and click of the TMS coil, as opposed to transcranial stimulation of cortical circuits. Objectives: The present study had two aims; a) to determine the extent to which sensory potentials contaminate TEPs using a spatially matched sham condition, and b) to determine whether sensory potentials reflect auditory or somatosensory potentials alone, or a combination of the two. Methods: Twenty healthy participants received active or sham stimulation, with the latter consisting of the click of a sham coil combined with scalp electrical stimulation. Earplugs/headphones were used to suppress the TMS click noise. Two additional control conditions i) electrical stimulation alone and ii) auditory stimulation alone were included in a subset of 13 participants. Results: Signals from active and sham stimulation were correlated in spatial and temporal domains, especially >70ms post-stimulation. Relative to auditory or electrical stimulation alone, combined (sham) stimulation resulted in a) larger evoked responses b) stronger correlations with active stimulation and c) a signal that could not be explained by the linear sum of electrical and auditory stimulation alone. Conclusions: Sensory potentials can confound data interpretations of TEPs at timepoints >70ms post-TMS, while earlier timepoints appear reflective of cortical excitability. Furthermore, contamination of TEPs cannot be explained by auditory or somatosensory potentials alone, but instead reflects a non-linear interaction between both sources. Future studies may benefit from controlling for sensory contamination using sham conditions that are spatially matched to active TMS, and which consist of combined auditory and somatosensory stimulation.

                We report a novel subthreshold non-invasive brain stimulation approach that we refer to as kilohertz transcranial magnetic perturbation, or kTMP. kTMP is a magnetic induction method that delivers kHz-frequency cortical E-fields and, through amplitude modulation of the kHz carrier frequency, may mimic E-fields at physiological frequencies. To evaluate the efficacy of kTMP, we used suprathreshold TMS to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in a peripheral muscle, comparing the amplitude of the MEPs before and after kTMP stimulation. In Experiment 1, we used non-modulated kTMP with an E-field amplitude of 2 V/m over motor cortex. Ten minutes of kTMP stimulation resulted in an increase in cortical excitability in a frequency-specific manner. We replicated this effect in Experiment 2 and found that amplitude-modulation at 20 Hz produced an additional boost in cortical excitability. The only percept associated with kTMP is a faint auditory tone, making kTMP ideal for double-blind experimentation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Trajectory of rich club properties in structural brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Many organizational principles of structural brain networks are established before birth and undergo considerable developmental changes afterwards. These include the topologically central hub regions and a densely connected rich club. While several studies have mapped developmental trajectories of brain connectivity and brain network organization across childhood and adolescence, comparatively little is known about subsequent development over the course of the lifespan. Here, we present a cross-sectional analysis of structural brain network development in N = 8,066 participants aged 5 to 80 years. Across all brain regions, structural connectivity strength followed an 'inverted-U'-shaped trajectory with vertex in the early 30s. Connectivity strength of hub regions showed a similar trajectory and the identity of hub regions remained stable across all age groups. While connectivity strength declined with advancing age, the organization of hub regions into a rich club did not only remain intact but became more pronounced, presumingly through a selected sparing of relevant connections from age-related connectivity loss. The stability of rich club organization in the face of overall age-related decline is consistent with a 'first come, last served' model of neurodevelopment, where the first principles to develop are the last to decline with age. Rich club organization has been shown to be highly beneficial for communicability and higher cognition. A resilient rich club might thus be protective of a functional loss in late adulthood and represent a neural reserve to sustain cognitive functioning in the aging brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Impaired oligodendrocyte maturation is an early feature in SCA3 disease pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), the most common dominantly inherited ataxia, is a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease for which there is no disease-modifying therapy. The polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene results in expression of a mutant form of the ATXN3 protein, a deubiquitinase that causes selective neurodegeneration despite being widely expressed. The mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in SCA3 are unclear. Research to date, however, has focused almost exclusively on neurons. Here, using equal male and female age-matched transgenic mice expressing full-length human mutant ATXN3, we identified early and robust transcriptional changes in selectively vulnerable brain regions that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. We mapped transcriptional changes across early, mid, and late stages of disease in two selectively vulnerable brain regions, the cerebellum and brainstem. The most significant disease-associated module through weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed dysfunction in SCA3 oligodendrocyte maturation. These results reflect a toxic gain of function mechanism, as ATXN3 knockout mice do not exhibit any impairments in oligodendrocyte maturation. Genetic crosses to reporter mice revealed a marked reduction in mature oligodendrocytes in SCA3-disease vulnerable brain regions and ultrastructural microscopy confirmed abnormalities in axonal myelination. Further study of isolated oligodendrocyte precursor cells from SCA3 mice established that this impairment in oligodendrocyte maturation is a cell autonomous process. We conclude that SCA3 is not simply a disease of neurons and the search for therapeutic strategies and disease biomarkers will need to account for non-neuronal involvement in SCA3 pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anatomical connectivity along the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus: new insights using quantitative fibre-tracking.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus supports multiple cognitive functions including episodic memory. Recent work has highlighted functional differences along the anterior-posterior axis of the human hippocampus but the neuroanatomical underpinnings of these differences remain unclear. We leveraged track-density imaging to systematically examine anatomical connectivity between the cortical mantle and the anterior-posterior axis of the in-vivo human hippocampus. We first identified the most highly connected cortical areas and detailed the degree to which they preferentially connect along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Then, using a tractography pipeline specifically tailored to measure the location and density of streamline endpoints within the hippocampus, we characterised where, within the hippocampus, these cortical areas preferentially connect. Our results were striking in showing that different parts of the hippocampus preferentially connect with distinct cortical areas. Furthermore, we provide evidence that both gradients and circumscribed areas of dense extrinsic anatomical connectivity exist within the human hippocampus. These findings inform conceptual debates in the field by unveiling how specific regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus are associated with different cortical inputs/outputs. Overall, our results represent a major advance in our ability to map the anatomical connectivity of the human hippocampus in-vivo and inform our understanding of the neural architecture of hippocampal dependent memory systems in the human brain. This detailed characterization of how specific portions of the hippocampus anatomically connect with cortical brain regions may promote a better understanding of its role in cognition and we emphasize the importance of considering the hippocampus as a heterogeneous structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Not so fast: Limited validity of deep convolutional neural networks as in silico models for human naturalistic face processing</a></h4>

              
                Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained for face identification can rival and even exceed human-level performance. The relationships between internal representations learned by DCNNs and those of the primate face processing system are not well understood, especially in naturalistic settings. We developed the largest naturalistic dynamic face stimulus set in human neuroimaging research (700+ naturalistic video clips of unfamiliar faces) and used representational similarity analysis to investigate how well the representations learned by high-performing DCNNs match human brain representations across the entire distributed face processing system. DCNN representational geometries were strikingly consistent across diverse architectures and captured meaningful variance among faces. Similarly, representational geometries throughout the human face network were highly consistent across subjects. Nonetheless, correlations between DCNN and neural representations were very weak overall--DCNNs captured 3% of variance in the neural representational geometries at best. Intermediate DCNN layers better matched visual and face-selective cortices than the final fully-connected layers. Behavioral ratings of face similarity were highly correlated with intermediate layers of DCNNs, but also failed to capture representational geometry in the human brain. Our results suggest that the correspondence between intermediate DCNN layers and neural representations of naturalistic human face processing is weak at best, and diverges even further in the later fully-connected layers. This poor correspondence can be attributed, at least in part, to the dynamic and cognitive information that plays an essential role in human face processing but is not modeled by DCNNs. These mismatches indicate that current DCNNs have limited validity as in silico models of dynamic, naturalistic face processing in humans.

                The neocortex can be viewed as a tapestry consisting of variations of rather stereotypical local cortical microcircuits. Hence understanding how these microcircuits compute holds the key to understanding brain function. Intense research efforts over several decades have culminated in a detailed model of a generic cortical microcircuit in the primary visual cortex from the Allen Institute. We are presenting here methods and first results for understanding computational properties of this large-scale data-based model. We show that it can solve a standard image-change-detection task almost as well as the living brain. Furthermore, we unravel the computational strategy of the model and elucidate the computational role of diverse subtypes of neurons. Altogether this work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific potential of a methodology based on close interaction of detailed data and large-scale computer modelling for understanding brain function.

                Estimating temporal regularities in incoming sensory inputs supports optimal decisions in noisy environments. In particular, inferred temporal structure can ease the detection of likely target events. Here we postulated that timely urgency signals can adapt subjects' decision-making to the ongoing task temporal structure, possibly through neuromodulatory tone. To test this hypothesis, we used an auditory change detection task in which targets followed a block-based temporal contingency, unbeknownst to participants. False alarm occurrences were driven by the distribution of target timings, indicating that participants adapted their behavior to the ongoing temporal structure. Task-evoked pupillary responses were larger for blocks with earliest target timings, and correlated with individual subjects' behavioral adaptation. Individual pupil responses matched an urgency signal extracted from a decision model fitted to behavior. This work demonstrates that internal temporal expectation can be tracked through pupillary dynamics, suggesting a role of neuromodulatory systems in context-dependent modulation of decision variable dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sharing individualised template MRI data for MEG source reconstruction: a solution for open data while keeping subject confidentiality</a></h4>

              
                The increasing requirements for adoption of FAIR data management and sharing original research data from neuroimaging studies can be at odds with protecting the anonymity of the research participants due to the person-identifiable anatomical features in the data. We propose a solution to this dilemma for anatomical MRIs used in MEG source analysis. In MEG analysis, the channel-level data is reconstructed to the source-level using models derived from anatomical MRIs. Sharing data, therefore, requires sharing the anatomical MRI to replicate the analysis. The suggested solution is to replace the individual anatomical MRIs with individualised warped templates that can be used to carry out the MEG source analysis and that provide sufficient geometrical similarity to the original participants' MRIs. First, we demonstrate how the individualised template warping can be implemented with one of the leading open-source neuroimaging analysis toolboxes. Second, we compare results from four different MEG source reconstruction methods performed with an individualised warped template to those using the participant's original MRI. While the source reconstruction results are not numerically identical, there is a high similarity between the results for single dipole fits, dynamic imaging of coherent sources beamforming, and atlas-based virtual channel beamforming. There is a moderate similarity between minimum-norm estimates, as anticipated due to this method being anatomically constrained and dependent on the exact morphological features of the cortical sheet. We also compared the morphological features of the warped template to those of the original MRI. These showed a high similarity in grey matter volume and surface area, but a low similarity in the average cortical thickness and the mean folding index within cortical parcels. Taken together, this demonstrates that the results obtained by MEG source reconstruction can be preserved with the warped templates, whereas the anatomical and morphological fingerprint is sufficiently altered to protect the anonymity of research participants. In cases where participants consent to sharing anatomical MRI data, it remains preferable to share the original defaced data with an appropriate data use agreement. In cases where participants did not consent to share their MRIs, the individualised warped MRI template offers a good compromise in sharing data for reuse while retaining anonymity for those research participants.
