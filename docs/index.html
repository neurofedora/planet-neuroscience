<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The melanocortin system is a key regulator of appetite and food intake in vertebrates. This system includes the neuropeptides neuropeptide y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AGRP), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). An important center for appetite control in mammals is the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, with neurons that coexpress either the orexigenic NPY/AGRP or the anorexigenic CART/POMC neuropeptides. In ray-finned fishes, such a center is less characterized. The Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) has multiple genes of these neuropeptides due to whole-genome duplication events. To better understand the potential involvement of the melanocortin system in appetite and food intake control, we have mapped the mRNA expression of <i>npy</i>, <i>agrp</i>, <i>cart</i>, and <i>pomc</i> in the brain of Atlantic salmon parr using in situ hybridization. After identifying hypothalamic mRNA expression, we investigated the possible intracellular coexpression of <i>npy/agrp</i> and <i>cart/pomc</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The results showed that the neuropeptides were widely distributed, especially in sensory and neuroendocrine brain regions. In the hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus, the putative homolog to the mammalian arcuate nucleus, <i>npya</i>, <i>agrp1</i>, <i>cart2b</i>, and <i>pomca</i> were predominantly localized in distinct neurons; however, some neurons coexpressed <i>cart2b/pomca</i>. This is the first demonstration of coexpression of <i>cart2b/pomca</i> in the tuberal hypothalamus of a teleost. Collectively, our data suggest that the lateral tuberal nucleus is the center for appetite control in salmon, similar to that of mammals. Extrahypothalamic brain regions might also be involved in regulating food intake, including the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain.</p>

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/06a83ccd-db36-445c-8073-cf9040cae9b3/cne25423-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Chromatic organization of retinal photoreceptors during eye migration of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)"/>
<p>Flatfishes undergo a pronounced metamorphosis whereby a bilateral, pelagic larva transforms into a flattened, benthic juvenile with both eyes on the same side of the head. The changes in photoreceptor visual pigment protein (opsin) expression during this period of eye migration are unknown. Here, we describe the chromatic organization of photoreceptors during eye migration using antibodies that label blue (SWS2) opsin, and green (RH) and red (LWS) opsins simultaneously. Our results reveal opsin co-expression within individual cone photoreceptors and a gradient in SWS2-expressing cones that may guide the creation of the square mosaic from an hexagonal mosaic.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retinas of fishes often have single and double cone photoreceptors that are organized in lattice-like mosaics. In flatfishes experiencing eye migration (i.e., the metamorphic process whereby one eye migrates to the other side of the head), the hexagonal lattice of single cones present in the larva undergoes major restructuring resulting in a dominant square mosaic postmetamorphosis consisting of four double cones surrounding each single cone. The expression of different opsin types during eye migration has not been examined despite its importance in understanding photoreceptor plasticity and whether cell fate (in terms of spectral phenotype) could influence square mosaic formation. Here, we probed the retina of Atlantic halibut undergoing eye migration for opsin expression using two antibodies, AHblue and AB5407, that labeled short wavelength sensitive 2 (SWS2) opsin and longer wavelength (predominantly middle wavelength sensitive, RH2) opsins, respectively. Throughout the retina, double and triple cones labeled with AB5407 exclusively, whereas the vast majority of single cones labeled with AHblue. A minority (&lt;5%) of single cones in the square mosaic of the centroventral retina labeled with AB5407. In regions of mosaic transition and near peripheral growth zones, some single cones co-expressed at least two opsins as they labeled with both antibodies. Short wavelength (SWS2 expressing, or S) cones formed a nonrandom mosaic gradient from central to dorsal retina in a region dominated by the larval single cone mosaic. Our results demonstrate the expression of at least two opsins throughout the postmetamorphic retina and suggest opsin switching as a mechanism to create new cone spectral phenotypes. In addition, the S cone gradient at the onset of eye migration may underlie a plastic, cell induction mechanism by which a cone's phenotype determines that of its neighbors and the formation of the square mosaic.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">In vivo tracking of KCC2b expression during early brain development</a></h4>

     alt="In vivo tracking of KCC2b expression during early brain development"/><p>We used CRISPR/Cas9 transgenesis to generate a KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence reporter zebrafish line and characterized KCC2b regional distribution and dynamics in vivo during early brain development. We demonstrate KCC2b expression in postmigration stage neurons and suppression of KCC2b expression by exposure to bisphenol-A. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing this protein's complex dynamics during brain development and screening compounds aimed at modulating chloride homeostasis through KCC2b.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuronal chloride (Cl−) exporter, KCC2, regulates neuron excitability and development and undergoes a stereotypical pattern of delayed upregulation as neurons mature. KCC2 upregulation favors neural inhibition by establishing a negative Cl− gradient, ensuring GABA-induced Cl− currents are inward and inhibitory. We developed a zebrafish fluorescent reporter line, KCC2b:mCitrine, to track KCC2 expression in vivo during early brain development. KCC2b:mCitrine was first detected at 16 h postfertilization and by day 6 labeled most central and peripheral neurons and processes. At 20 h, expression was greatest in the soma-dense basal neuroepithelium but largely absent in apical and mantle zones where differentiation and migration primarily occur, and time lapse imaging at this stage supports a postmigration upregulation of KCC2b. Central dopamine neurons showed low KCC2b expression as observed in other species. KCC2b:mCitrine fluorescence was stable over minutes in most neurons, but brightness transients observed in single cells fit our expectation for real-time tracking of KCC2b upregulation in new neurons. To further assess whether fluorescence brightness tracks KCC2b expression, zebrafish embryos were exposed to bisphenol-A (BPA), which is known to suppress KCC2 expression. Fluorescence decreased after 6 days of BPA exposure but not after 2 or 4 days, suggesting that it is an accurate but delayed indicator of KCC2b expression. KCC2b:mCitrine zebrafish present a new method for visualizing KCC2b's complex dynamics during brain development, and potentially screening compounds aimed at modulating KCC2 expression.</p>

                A diversity of prokaryotes currently exhibit multicellularity with different generation mechanisms in a variety of contexts of ecology on Earth. In the present study, we report a new type of multicellular bacterium, HS-3, isolated from an underground stream. HS-3 self-organizes its filamentous cells into a layer-structured colony with the properties of a nematic liquid crystal. After maturation, the colony starts to form a semi-closed sphere accommodating clusters of coccobacillus daughter cells and selectively releases them upon contact with water. This is the first report that shows that a liquid-crystal status of cells can support the prokaryotic multicellular behavior. Importantly, the observed behavior of HS-3 suggests that the recurrent intermittent exposure of colonies to water flow in the cave might have been the ecological context that cultivated the evolutionary transition from unicellular to multicellular life. This is the new extant model that underpins theories regarding a role of ecological context in the emergence of multicellularity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A single cell transcriptional roadmap of human pacemaker cell differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Each heartbeat is triggered by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker of the heart. Studies in animal models have revealed that pacemaker cells share a common progenitor with the (pro)epicardium, and that the pacemaker cardiomyocytes further diversify into ‘transitional’, ‘tail’, and ‘head’ subtypes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially of human pacemaker cell development, are poorly understood. Here, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and trajectory inference on human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiating to SAN-like cardiomyocytes (SANCMs) to construct a roadmap of transcriptional changes and lineage decisions. In differentiated SANCM, we identified distinct clusters that closely resemble different subpopulations of the in vivo SAN. Moreover, the presence of a side population of proepicardial cells suggested their shared ontogeny with SANCM, as also reported in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the divergence of SANCM and proepicardial lineages is determined by WNT signaling. Furthermore, we uncovered roles for TGFβ and WNT signaling in the branching of transitional and head SANCM subtypes, respectively. These findings provide new insights into the molecular processes involved in human pacemaker cell differentiation, opening new avenues for complex disease modeling in vitro and inform approaches for cell therapy-based regeneration of the SAN.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cannabinoid signaling modulation through JZL184 restores key phenotypes of a mouse model for Williams–Beuren syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Williams–Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a rare genetic multisystemic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability and hypersocial phenotype, while the most life-threatening features are cardiovascular abnormalities. Nowadays, there are no pharmacological treatments to directly ameliorate the main traits of WBS. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), given its relevance for both cognitive and cardiovascular function, could be a potential druggable target in this syndrome. We analyzed the components of the ECS in the complete deletion (CD) mouse model of WBS and assessed the impact of its pharmacological modulation in key phenotypes relevant for WBS. CD mice showed the characteristic hypersociable phenotype with no preference for social novelty and poor short-term object-recognition performance. Brain cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) in CD male mice showed alterations in density and coupling with no detectable change in main endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoid signaling modulation with subchronic (10 days) JZL184, a selective inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase, specifically normalized the social and cognitive phenotype of CD mice. Notably, JZL184 treatment improved cardiovascular function and restored gene expression patterns in cardiac tissue. These results reveal the modulation of the ECS as a promising novel therapeutic approach to improve key phenotypic alterations in WBS.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Touch-sensitive stamens enhance pollen dispersal by scaring away visitors</a></h4>

              
                Animal-pollinated plants have to get pollen to a conspecific stigma while protecting it from getting eaten. Touch-sensitive stamens, which are found in hundreds of flowering plants, are thought to function in enhancing pollen export and reducing its loss, but experimental tests are scarce. Stamens of <i>Berberis</i> and <i>Mahonia</i> are inserted between paired nectar glands and when touched by an insect’s tongue rapidly snap forward so that their valvate anthers press pollen on the insect’s tongue or face. We immobilized the stamens in otherwise unmodified flowers and studied pollen transfer in the field and under enclosed conditions. On flowers with immobilized stamens, the most common bee visitor stayed up to 3.6× longer, yet removed 1.3× fewer pollen grains and deposited 2.1× fewer grains on stigmas per visit. Self-pollen from a single stamen hitting the stigma amounted to 6% of the grains received from single bee visits. Bees discarded pollen passively placed on their bodies, likely because of its berberine content; nectar has no berberine. Syrphid flies fed on both nectar and pollen, taking more when stamens were immobilized. Pollen-tracking experiments in two <i>Berberis</i> species showed that mobile-stamen-flowers donate pollen to many more recipients. These results demonstrate another mechanism by which plants simultaneously meter out their pollen and reduce pollen theft.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Considerable evidence from mouse models and human postmortem brain suggests loss of Muscleblind-like protein 2 (MBNL2) function in brain is a major driver of CNS symptoms in Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Increased hypersomnia, fatigue, and surgical complications associated with general anesthesia suggest possible sensitivity to GABAergic inhibition in DM1. To test the hypothesis that MBNL2 depletion leads to behavioral sensitivity to GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-R) modulation, <I>Mbnl2</I> knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) littermates were treated with the anesthetic sevoflurane, the benzodiazepine diazepam, the imidazopyridine zolpidem, and the benzodiazepine rescue agent, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), and assessed for various behavioral metrics. <I>Mbnl2</I> KO mice exhibited delayed recovery following sevoflurane, delayed emergence and recovery from zolpidem, and enhanced sleep time at baseline that was modulated by flumazenil. A significantly higher proportion of <I>Mbnl2</I> KO mice also loss their righting reflex [loss of righting reflex (LORR)] from a standard diazepam dose. We further examined whether MBNL2 depletion affects total GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-R mRNA subunit levels and validated RNA-sequencing data of mis-spliced <I>Gabrg2</I>, whose isoform ratios are known to regulate GABA sensitivity and associated behaviors. While no other GABA<SUB>A</SUB>-R subunit mRNA levels tested were altered in <I>Mbnl2</I> KO mouse prefrontal cortex, <I>Gabrg2S/L</I> mRNA ratio levels were significantly altered. Taken together, our findings indicate that loss of MBNL2 function affects GABAergic function in a mouse model of myotonic dystrophy (DM1).</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Despite increased prevalence of maternal cannabis use, little is understood regarding potential long-term effects of prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) on neurodevelopmental outcomes. While neurodevelopmental cannabis exposure increases the risk of developing affective/mood disorders in adulthood, the precise neuropathophysiological mechanisms in male and female offspring are largely unknown. Given the interconnectivity of the endocannabinoid (ECb) system and the brain&rsquo;s fatty acid pathways, we hypothesized that prenatal exposure to <sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may dysregulate fetal neurodevelopment through alterations of fatty-acid dependent synaptic and neuronal function in the mesolimbic system. To investigate this, pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to vehicle or THC (3 mg/kg) from gestational day (GD)7 until GD22. Anxiety-like, depressive-like, and reward-seeking behavior, electrophysiology, and molecular assays were performed on adult male/female offspring. Imaging of fatty acids using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS) was performed at prepubescence and adulthood. We report that PCE induces behavioral, neuronal, and molecular alterations in the mesolimbic system in male and female offspring, resembling neuropsychiatric endophenotypes. Additionally, PCE resulted in profound dysregulation of critical fatty acid pathways in the developing brain lipidome. Female progeny exhibited significant alterations to fatty acid levels at prepubescence but recovered from these deficits by early adulthood. In contrast, males exhibited persistent fatty acid deficits into adulthood. Moreover, both sexes maintained enduring abnormalities in glutamatergic/GABAergic function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These findings identify several novel long-term risks of maternal cannabis use and demonstrate for the first time, sex-related effects of maternal cannabinoid exposure directly in the developing neural lipidome.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the avian ascending auditory pathway, the nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis (MLd; the auditory midbrain center) receives inputs from virtually all lower brainstem auditory nuclei and sends outputs bilaterally to the nucleus ovoidalis (Ov; the auditory thalamic nucleus). Axons from part of the MLd terminate in a particular domain of Ov, thereby suggesting a formation of segregated pathways point-to-point from lower brainstem nuclei via MLd to the thalamus. However, it has not yet been demonstrated whether any spatial clustering of thalamic neurons that receive inputs from specific domains of MLd exists. Ov neurons receive input from bilateral MLds; however, the degree of laterality has not been reported yet. In this study, we injected a recombinant avian adeno-associated virus, a transsynaptic anterograde vector into the MLd of the chick, and analyzed the distribution of labeled postsynaptic neurons on both sides of the Ov. We found that fluorescent protein-labeled neurons on both sides of the Ov were clustered in domains corresponding to subregions of the MLd. The laterality of projections was calculated as the ratio of neurons labeled by comparing ipsilateral to contralateral projections from the MLd, and it was 1.86 on average, thereby indicating a slight ipsilateral projection dominance. Bilateral inputs from different subdomains of the MLd converged on several single Ov neurons, thereby implying a possibility of a de novo binaural processing of the auditory information in the Ov.</p>

                Background: To evaluate functional visceral adipose tissue (VAT) activity assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) as a predictive factor of metastases in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Methods: We reviewed study protocols and PET/CT data of 534 CRC patients; 474 patients were subsequently excluded for various reasons. The remaining 60 patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma were then prospectively assessed and were exposed to 18F-FDG PET/CT after a surgical treatment and chemoradiotherapy. Age, histology, stage, and tumor grade data were recorded. Functional VAT activity was verified with maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) using 18F-FDG PET/CT and tested as a predictive factor of later metastases in eight subdomains of abdominal regions (RE – epigastric region, RLH – left hypochondriac region, RRL – right lumbar region, RU – umbilical region, RLL – left lumbar region, RRI – right inguinal region, RP – hypogastric (pubic) region, RLI – left inguinal region) and pelvic cavity (P) in the adjusted regression models. In addition, we studied the best areas under the curve (AUC) for SUVmax with the corresponding sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp). Results: In both adjusted for age regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, 18F-FDG accumulation in RLH (cut-off SUVmax 0.74; Se 75%; Sp 61%; AUC 0.668; p=0.049), RU (cut-off SUVmax 0.78; Se 69%; Sp 61%; AUC 0.679; p=0.035), RRL (cut-off SUVmax 1.05; Se 69%; Sp 77%; AUC 0.682; p=0.032) and RRI (cut-off SUVmax 0.85; Se 63%; Sp 61%; AUC 0.672; p=0.043) could predict later metastases in CRC patients, as opposed to age, sex, primary tumor location, tumor grade and histology. Conclusions: Functional VAT activity was importantly related to later metastases in CRC patients and can be used as their predictive factor.

                The sudden precipitation of the pandemic forced undergraduates to take refuge at home, deserting the campus. Consequently, the age-old classroom in person teaching-learning (T-L) method shifted and lessons had to be conducted online. In previous decades, archetypical classroom lectures survived a lot of criticism in the face of the quasi-passive nature of T-L  methodology. There are very few studies that reflect undergraduate students' perceptions of lectures. This study aimed to evaluate undergraduate students’ perceptions of lectures using an online questionnaire with 13 items, which was circulated to undergraduate students of medical, physiotherapy, and nursing courses in three settings at different locations of private and public health schools. There was a total of 877 responses. The surveyed students were in favor of lectures and considered them indispensable for undergraduate learning. They preferred it as a kind of organized learning through the teacher’s own experiences. Our study suggests that it is not the ‘lecture’ that requires mending but possibly teachers require better training, application of effective audio-visual aids, and innovative techniques to sustain students' interest in the class.

                Introduction: Overweight and obesity affects over 70% of the UK population and is a major risk factor for the development of co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There now exists a considerable evidence base for the management of obesity. However, this is not the case for the prevention of obesity. Preventing weight gain in periods of life where there is an elevated risk of fat mass expansion could be beneficial to preventing associated diseases in later life. This protocol investigates the impact of novel food ingredient inulin propionate ester (IPE) in the prevention of weight gain. This trial aims to investigate the primary hypothesis that IPE has a superior effect on preventing body weight gain, compared with inulin, in young (<40 years old) adults over 12 months, whilst also investigating several complementary mechanisms that may explain the prevention of weight gain and improved long-term energy balance from consuming IPE.    Methods: In this multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group study, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to consume 10g IPE or 10g inulin (control) daily for 12 months. Study visits will be conducted at baseline, two-month, six-month and 12-month time points. The primary outcome is weight gain from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes will examine changes in metabolic and cardiovascular health biomarkers, body composition and appetite. A mechanistic sub-group will explore causal mechanisms around energy balance, body composition, appetite regulation and the gut microbiota. Based on the power calculation, the sample size required is 270 participants or 135 per study group. Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol and participant-facing documents have been reviewed and approved, by the London Hampstead Ethics Committee (REC Reference 19/LO/0095, 29th January 2019). Upon completion, the trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific conferences. Trial registration number: ISRCTN16299902, 1st March 2018.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">(Re)conceptualizing vulnerability in health under the syndemics perspective: protocol for a scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The concept of vulnerability has been widely used in global health research to assess susceptibility to diseases and disasters in individuals and groups. This perspective has proven to be useful for policy making by bringing attention to the unequal distribution of risks and impacts in specific populations and contexts. However, it is often insufficient to explain interactions between environmental, zoonotic, and social realms involved in the experience of health and disease. Theoretical developments proposed under the syndemics approach have intended to explore this gap by studying the underlying political, economic, and social dynamics affecting the occurrence of overlapping health issues. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the term syndemics has been used to refer to underlying conditions and social factors impacting disease outcomes. This scoping review aims to explore the contributions of the syndemics perspective to the (re)conceptualization of vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to do so by identifying social and environmental arrangements so far described in original research, opinion pieces or reviews published since December 2019. Variations in the explanations provided about the role played by socio-environmental dynamics in the observed interactions in populations, settings, and interacting conditions will be subsequently examined. Finally, we will track the contributions and limitations of the syndemics perspective to the study of vulnerability in health in light of the evidence produced around COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Visualization for treatment of insomnia, anxiety, and depression caused by PTSD [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Depression and anxiety are disorders related to insomnia that generally affect quality of life, especially if they are related to traumatic events. One of the therapeutic methods that has shown effectiveness in treating depression, anxiety and insomnia associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the visualization method, which is a cognitive behavioral method. The aim of this case study is to investigate the effectiveness of visualization in treating symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia associated with posttraumatic experiences. Methods: Sulaiman is a university student who suffered with his family a painful traffic accident, and he has become unable to slee p. This affected his general life, so he became anxious and depressed and had nightmares when sleeping, which lasted for more than a year. He was trained on visualization exercises, including laughter, music, directed visualization, receptive visualization, programmed visualization, and others, which lasted for 17 sessions. Results: The results showed an average improvement of 77.8% for each of the symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and the number of minutes it takes to fall asleep. The results of the nonparametric test also showed that there were statistically significant differences in the ranks of measures, as it showed z-values for each of insomnia (z= -2.32, p=0.008), depression (z= -2.54, p=0.04), anxiety (z= -3.08, p=0.03), the time taken to enter sleep (z= -2.64, p=0.04), and the time spent asleep (z= -2.44, p=0.02). Conclusions: Sulaiman reported that he became more effective and said that depression, rumination, symptoms of anxiety and stressful thoughts had been reduced to a minimum due to learning more positive alternatives and effective and healthy fantasies.

<p>Monosynaptic tracing analysis demonstrates the direct connectivity of Dmrt3 neurons to proprioceptors and brain centers involved in motor control, suggesting a sensorimotor integrative role for Dmrt3 interneurons in a neuronal path for motion and locomotion.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the spinal cord, sensory-motor circuits controlling motor activity are situated in the dorso–ventral interface. The neurons identified by the expression of the transcription factor Doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor 3 (Dmrt3) have previously been associated with the coordination of locomotion in horses (<i>Equus caballus</i>, Linnaeus, 1758), mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>, Linnaeus, 1758), and zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>, F. Hamilton, 1822). Based on earlier studies, we hypothesized that, in mice, these neurons may be positioned to receive sensory and central inputs to relay processed commands to motor neurons. Thus, we investigated the presynaptic inputs to spinal Dmrt3 neurons using monosynaptic retrograde replication-deficient rabies tracing. The analysis showed that lumbar Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from intrasegmental neurons, and intersegmental neurons from the cervical, thoracic, and sacral segments. Some of these neurons belong to the excitatory V2a interneurons and to plausible Renshaw cells, defined by the expression of Chx10 and calbindin, respectively. We also found that proprioceptive primary sensory neurons of type Ia2, Ia3, and Ib, defined by the expression of calbindin, calretinin, and Brn3c, respectively, provide presynaptic inputs to spinal Dmrt3 neurons. In addition, we demonstrated that Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from brain areas involved in motor regulation, including the red nucleus, primary sensory–motor cortex, and pontine nuclei. In conclusion, adult spinal Dmrt3 neurons receive inputs from motor-related brain areas as well as proprioceptive primary sensory neurons and have been shown to connect directly to motor neurons. Dmrt3 neurons are thus positioned to provide sensory–motor control and their connectivity is suggestive of the classical reflex pathways present in the spinal cord.</p>

                Background: Xerostomia is a condition that has been shown to have a negative impact on the quality of life. Thus, exploring the associated risk factors and conditions needs special attention. There is still a lack of complete information regarding this condition among the Saudi population. Methods: In this cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey, 30-70 years old were included. Demographic data with systemic and dental- related history was collected. The presence of xerostomia and the risk factors such as age, sex, history of smoking, history of systemic disease, and medication history are noted. All the results were tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS. Results: The prevalence of xerostomia was 42.3%. The prevalence of xerostomia was found to be increasing with age. For gender, xerostomia was significantly higher among women than men (p<0.05). There was a statistically significant association between xerostomia and associated diseases such as gastrointestinal disorders, endocrine disorder, blood diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and allergies (p<0.001). Only 12.5% of participants who had xerostomia were smokers and 44.2% of participants who had xerostomia were  using medications. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of xerostomia among the Saudi population, with a higher prevalence in the older age group and women. An association between systemic disease and medication history was also noted. Dental practitioners need to be alert to this condition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">EpiLPS: A fast and flexible Bayesian tool for estimation of the time-varying reproduction number</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Oswaldo Gressani, Jacco Wallinga, Christian L. Althaus, Niel Hens, Christel Faes</p>

In infectious disease epidemiology, the instantaneous reproduction number R t is a time-varying parameter defined as the average number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual at time <i>t</i>. It is therefore a crucial epidemiological statistic that assists public health decision makers in the management of an epidemic. We present a new Bayesian tool (EpiLPS) for robust estimation of the time-varying reproduction number. The proposed methodology smooths the epidemic curve and allows to obtain (approximate) point estimates and credible intervals of R t by employing the renewal equation, using Bayesian P-splines coupled with Laplace approximations of the conditional posterior of the spline vector. Two alternative approaches for inference are presented: (1) an approach based on a maximum a posteriori argument for the model hyperparameters, delivering estimates of R t in only a few seconds; and (2) an approach based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme with underlying Langevin dynamics for efficient sampling of the posterior target distribution. Case counts per unit of time are assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution to account for potential overdispersion in the data that would not be captured by a classic Poisson model. Furthermore, after smoothing the epidemic curve, a “plug-in’’ estimate of the reproduction number can be obtained from the renewal equation yielding a closed form expression of R t as a function of the spline parameters. The approach is extremely fast and free of arbitrary smoothing assumptions. EpiLPS is applied on data of SARS-CoV-1 in Hong-Kong (2003), influenza A H1N1 (2009) in the USA and on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (2020-2021) for Belgium, Portugal, Denmark and France.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Rapid detection and recognition of whole brain activity in a freely behaving Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuxiang Wu, Shang Wu, Xin Wang, Chengtian Lang, Quanshi Zhang, Quan Wen, Tianqi Xu</p>

Advanced volumetric imaging methods and genetically encoded activity indicators have permitted a comprehensive characterization of whole brain activity at single neuron resolution in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The constant motion and deformation of the nematode nervous system, however, impose a great challenge for consistent identification of densely packed neurons in a behaving animal. Here, we propose a cascade solution for long-term and rapid recognition of head ganglion neurons in a freely moving <i>C. elegans</i>. First, potential neuronal regions from a stack of fluorescence images are detected by a deep learning algorithm. Second, 2-dimensional neuronal regions are fused into 3-dimensional neuron entities. Third, by exploiting the neuronal density distribution surrounding a neuron and relative positional information between neurons, a multi-class artificial neural network transforms engineered neuronal feature vectors into digital neuronal identities. With a small number of training samples, our bottom-up approach is able to process each volume—1024 × 1024 × 18 in voxels—in less than 1 second and achieves an accuracy of 91% in neuronal detection and above 80% in neuronal tracking over a long video recording. Our work represents a step towards rapid and fully automated algorithms for decoding whole brain activity underlying naturalistic behaviors.

                <p>by Behzad D. Karkaria, Angelika Manhart, Alex J. H. Fedorec, Chris P. Barnes</p>

Predictability is a fundamental requirement in biological engineering. As we move to building coordinated multicellular systems, the potential for such systems to display chaotic behaviour becomes a concern. Therefore understanding which systems show chaos is an important design consideration. We developed a methodology to explore the potential for chaotic dynamics in small microbial communities governed by resource competition, intercellular communication and competitive bacteriocin interactions. Our model selection pipeline uses Approximate Bayesian Computation to first identify oscillatory behaviours as a route to finding chaotic behaviour. We have shown that we can expect to find chaotic states in relatively small synthetic microbial systems, understand the governing dynamics and provide insights into how to control such systems. This work is the first to query the existence of chaotic behaviour in synthetic microbial communities and has important ramifications for the fields of biotechnology, bioprocessing and synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiple bumps can enhance robustness to noise in continuous attractor networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Raymond Wang, Louis Kang</p>

A central function of continuous attractor networks is encoding coordinates and accurately updating their values through path integration. To do so, these networks produce localized bumps of activity that move coherently in response to velocity inputs. In the brain, continuous attractors are believed to underlie grid cells and head direction cells, which maintain periodic representations of position and orientation, respectively. These representations can be achieved with any number of activity bumps, and the consequences of having more or fewer bumps are unclear. We address this knowledge gap by constructing 1D ring attractor networks with different bump numbers and characterizing their responses to three types of noise: fluctuating inputs, spiking noise, and deviations in connectivity away from ideal attractor configurations. Across all three types, networks with more bumps experience less noise-driven deviations in bump motion. This translates to more robust encodings of linear coordinates, like position, assuming that each neuron represents a fixed length no matter the bump number. Alternatively, we consider encoding a circular coordinate, like orientation, such that the network distance between adjacent bumps always maps onto 360 degrees. Under this mapping, bump number does not significantly affect the amount of error in the coordinate readout. Our simulation results are intuitively explained and quantitatively matched by a unified theory for path integration and noise in multi-bump networks. Thus, to suppress the effects of biologically relevant noise, continuous attractor networks can employ more bumps when encoding linear coordinates; this advantage disappears when encoding circular coordinates. Our findings provide motivation for multiple bumps in the mammalian grid network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Credibility assessment of patient-specific computational modeling using patient-specific cardiac modeling as an exemplar</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suran Galappaththige, Richard A. Gray, Caroline Mendonca Costa, Steven Niederer, Pras Pathmanathan</p>

Reliable and robust simulation of individual patients using patient-specific models (PSMs) is one of the next frontiers for modeling and simulation (M&S) in healthcare. PSMs, which form the basis of digital twins, can be employed as clinical tools to, for example, assess disease state, predict response to therapy, or optimize therapy. They may also be used to construct virtual cohorts of patients, for <i>in silico</i> evaluation of medical product safety and/or performance. Methods and frameworks have recently been proposed for evaluating the credibility of M&S in healthcare applications. However, such efforts have generally been motivated by models of medical devices or generic patient models; how best to evaluate the credibility of PSMs has largely been unexplored. The aim of this paper is to understand and demonstrate the credibility assessment process for PSMs using patient-specific cardiac electrophysiological (EP) modeling as an exemplar. We first review approaches used to generate cardiac PSMs and consider how verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) apply to cardiac PSMs. Next, we execute two simulation studies using a publicly available virtual cohort of 24 patient-specific ventricular models, the first a multi-patient verification study, the second investigating the impact of uncertainty in personalized and non-personalized inputs in a virtual cohort. We then use the findings from our analyses to identify how important characteristics of PSMs can be considered when assessing credibility with the approach of the ASME V&V40 Standard, accounting for PSM concepts such as inter- and intra-user variability, multi-patient and “every-patient” error estimation, uncertainty quantification in personalized vs non-personalized inputs, clinical validation, and others. The results of this paper will be useful to developers of cardiac and other medical image based PSMs, when assessing PSM credibility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Probabilistic edge weights fine-tune Boolean network dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Dávid Deritei, Nina Kunšič, Péter Csermely</p>

Biological systems are noisy by nature. This aspect is reflected in our experimental measurements and should be reflected in the models we build to better understand these systems. Noise can be especially consequential when trying to interpret specific regulatory interactions, i.e. regulatory network edges. In this paper, we propose a method to explicitly encode edge-noise in Boolean dynamical systems by probabilistic edge-weight (PEW) operators. PEW operators have two important features: first, they introduce a form of edge-weight into Boolean models through the noise, second, the noise is dependent on the dynamical state of the system, which enables more biologically meaningful modeling choices. Moreover, we offer a simple-to-use implementation in the already well-established BooleanNet framework. In two application cases, we show how the introduction of just a few PEW operators in Boolean models can fine-tune the emergent dynamics and increase the accuracy of qualitative predictions. This includes fine-tuning interactions which cause non-biological behaviors when switching between asynchronous and synchronous update schemes in dynamical simulations. Moreover, PEW operators also open the way to encode more exotic cellular dynamics, such as cellular learning, and to implementing edge-weights for regulatory networks inferred from omics data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Structured random receptive fields enable informative sensory encodings</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Biraj Pandey, Marius Pachitariu, Bingni W. Brunton, Kameron Decker Harris</p>

Brains must represent the outside world so that animals survive and thrive. In early sensory systems, neural populations have diverse receptive fields structured to detect important features in inputs, yet significant variability has been ignored in classical models of sensory neurons. We model neuronal receptive fields as random, variable samples from parameterized distributions and demonstrate this model in two sensory modalities using data from insect mechanosensors and mammalian primary visual cortex. Our approach leads to a significant theoretical connection between the foundational concepts of receptive fields and random features, a leading theory for understanding artificial neural networks. The modeled neurons perform a randomized wavelet transform on inputs, which removes high frequency noise and boosts the signal. Further, these random feature neurons enable learning from fewer training samples and with smaller networks in artificial tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Experimental guidance for discovering genetic networks through hypothesis reduction on time series</a></h4>

Large programs of dynamic gene expression, like cell cyles and circadian rhythms, are controlled by a relatively small “core” network of transcription factors and post-translational modifiers, working in concerted mutual regulation. Recent work suggests that system-independent, quantitative features of the dynamics of gene expression can be used to identify core regulators. We introduce an approach of iterative network hypothesis reduction from time-series data in which increasingly complex features of the dynamic expression of individual, pairs, and entire collections of genes are used to infer functional network models that can produce the observed transcriptional program. The culmination of our work is a computational pipeline, Iterative Network Hypothesis Reduction from Temporal Dynamics (Inherent dynamics pipeline), that provides a priority listing of targets for genetic perturbation to experimentally infer network structure. We demonstrate the capability of this integrated computational pipeline on synthetic and yeast cell-cycle data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by decreased Pavlovian influence on instrumental behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ziwen Peng, Luning He, Rongzhen Wen, Tom Verguts, Carol A. Seger, Qi Chen</p>

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by uncontrollable repetitive actions thought to rely on abnormalities within fundamental instrumental learning systems. We investigated cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying Pavlovian biases on instrumental behavior in both clinical OCD patients and healthy controls using a Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) task. PIT is typically evidenced by increased responding in the presence of a positive (previously rewarded) Pavlovian cue, and reduced responding in the presence of a negative cue. Thirty OCD patients and thirty-one healthy controls completed the Pavlovian Instrumental Transfer test, which included instrumental training, Pavlovian training for positive, negative and neutral cues, and a PIT phase in which participants performed the instrumental task in the presence of the Pavlovian cues. Modified Rescorla-Wagner models were fitted to trial-by-trial data of participants to estimate underlying computational mechanism and quantify individual differences during training and transfer stages. Bayesian hierarchical methods were used to estimate free parameters and compare the models. Behavioral and computational results indicated a weaker Pavlovian influence on instrumental behavior in OCD patients than in HC, especially for negative Pavlovian cues. Our results contrast with the increased PIT effects reported for another set of disorders characterized by compulsivity, substance use disorders, in which PIT is enhanced. A possible reason for the reduced PIT in OCD may be impairment in using the contextual information provided by the cues to appropriately adjust behavior, especially when inhibiting responding when a negative cue is present. This study provides deeper insight into our understanding of deficits in OCD from the perspective of Pavlovian influences on instrumental behavior and may have implications for OCD treatment modalities focused on reducing compulsive behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The inner nuclear membrane protein NEMP1 supports nuclear envelope openings and enucleation of erythroblasts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Didier Hodzic, Jun Wu, Karen Krchma, Andrea Jurisicova, Yonit Tsatskis, Yijie Liu, Peng Ji, Kyunghee Choi, Helen McNeill</p>

Nuclear envelope membrane proteins (NEMPs) are a conserved family of nuclear envelope (NE) proteins that reside within the inner nuclear membrane (INM). Even though <i>Nemp1</i> knockout (KO) mice are overtly normal, they display a pronounced splenomegaly. This phenotype and recent reports describing a requirement for NE openings during erythroblasts terminal maturation led us to examine a potential role for Nemp1 in erythropoiesis. Here, we report that <i>Nemp1</i> KO mice show peripheral blood defects, anemia in neonates, ineffective erythropoiesis, splenomegaly, and stress erythropoiesis. The erythroid lineage of <i>Nemp1</i> KO mice is overrepresented until the pronounced apoptosis of polychromatophilic erythroblasts. We show that NEMP1 localizes to the NE of erythroblasts and their progenitors. Mechanistically, we discovered that NEMP1 accumulates into aggregates that localize near or at the edge of NE openings and <i>Nemp1</i> deficiency leads to a marked decrease of both NE openings and ensuing enucleation. Together, our results for the first time demonstrate that NEMP1 is essential for NE openings and erythropoietic maturation in vivo and provide the first mouse model of defective erythropoiesis directly linked to the loss of an INM protein.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cell shape anisotropy contributes to self-organized feather pattern fidelity in birds</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Camille Curantz, Richard Bailleul, María Castro-Scherianz, Magdalena Hidalgo, Melina Durande, François Graner, Marie Manceau</p>

Developing tissues can self-organize into a variety of patterned structures through the stabilization of stochastic fluctuations in their molecular and cellular properties. While molecular factors and cell dynamics contributing to self-organization have been identified in vivo, events channeling self-organized systems such that they achieve stable pattern outcomes remain unknown. Here, we described natural variation in the fidelity of self-organized arrays formed by feather follicle precursors in bird embryos. By surveying skin cells prior to and during tissue self-organization and performing species-specific ex vivo drug treatments and mechanical stress tests, we demonstrated that pattern fidelity depends on the initial amplitude of cell anisotropy in regions of the developing dermis competent to produce a pattern. Using live imaging, we showed that cell shape anisotropy is associated with a limited increase in cell motility for sharp and precisely located primordia formation, and thus, proper pattern geometry. These results evidence a mechanism through which initial tissue properties ensure stability in self-organization and thus, reproducible pattern production.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A genome-wide screen identifies SCAI as a modulator of the UV-induced replicative stress response</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jean-François Lemay, Edlie St-Hilaire, Daryl A. Ronato, Yuandi Gao, François Bélanger, Sari Gezzar-Dandashi, Aimé Boris Kimenyi Ishimwe, Christina Sawchyn, Dominique Lévesque, Mary McQuaid, François-Michel Boisvert, Frédérick A. Mallette, Jean-Yves Masson, Elliot A. Drobetsky, Hugo Wurtele</p>

Helix-destabilizing DNA lesions induced by environmental mutagens such as UV light cause genomic instability by strongly blocking the progression of DNA replication forks (RFs). At blocked RF, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulates and is rapidly bound by Replication Protein A (RPA) complexes. Such stretches of RPA-ssDNA constitute platforms for recruitment/activation of critical factors that promote DNA synthesis restart. However, during periods of severe replicative stress, RPA availability may become limiting due to inordinate sequestration of this multifunctional complex on ssDNA, thereby negatively impacting multiple vital RPA-dependent processes. Here, we performed a genome-wide screen to identify factors that restrict the accumulation of RPA-ssDNA during UV-induced replicative stress. While this approach revealed some expected “hits” acting in pathways such as nucleotide excision repair, translesion DNA synthesis, and the intra-S phase checkpoint, it also identified SCAI, whose role in the replicative stress response was previously unappreciated. Upon UV exposure, SCAI knock-down caused elevated accumulation of RPA-ssDNA during S phase, accompanied by reduced cell survival and compromised RF progression. These effects were independent of the previously reported role of SCAI in 53BP1-dependent DNA double-strand break repair. We also found that SCAI is recruited to UV-damaged chromatin and that its depletion promotes nascent DNA degradation at stalled RF. Finally, we (i) provide evidence that EXO1 is the major nuclease underlying ssDNA formation and DNA replication defects in SCAI knockout cells and, consistent with this, (ii) demonstrate that SCAI inhibits EXO1 activity on a ssDNA gap in vitro. Taken together, our data establish SCAI as a novel regulator of the UV-induced replicative stress response in human cells.

                Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are both as classified blood-borne viruses since they are transmitted through contact with contaminated blood. Approximately 1.3 million of the 2.75 million global HIV/HCV carriers inject drugs (PWID). HIV co-infection has a harmful effect on the progression of HCV, resulting in greater rates of HCV persistence after acute infection, higher viral levels, and accelerated progression of liver fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. In this study, we developed and investigated a mathematical model for the dynamical behavior of HIV/AIDS and HCV co-infection, which includes therapy for both diseases, vertical transmission in HIV cases, unawareness and awareness of HIV infection, inefficient HIV treatment follow-up, and efficient condom use. Methods: Positivity and boundedness of the model under investigation were established using well-known theorems. The equilibria were demonstrated by bringing all differential equations to zero. The associative reproduction numbers for mono-infected and dual-infected models were calculated using the next-generation matrix approach. The local and global stabilities of the models were validated using the linearization and comparison theorem and the negative criterion techniques of bendixson and dulac, respectively. Results: The growing prevalence of HIV treatment dropout in each compartment of the HIV model led to a reduction in HIV on treatment compartments while other compartments exhibited an increase in populations. In dually infected patients, treating HCV first reduces co-infection reproduction number Rech, which reduces liver cancer risk. Conclusions: From the model's results, we infer various steps that policymakers could take to reduce the number of mono-infected and co-infected individuals.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Predicting Functional Outcome Using 24‐hour Post‐treatment Characteristics: Application of Machine Learning Algorithms in the STRATIS Registry</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful predictive tools in the field stroke. Here, we examine the predictive accuracy of ML models for predicting functional outcomes using 24-hour post-treatment characteristics in the Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke (STRATIS) Registry.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ML models, adaptive boost, random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), C5.0 decision tree (C5.0), support vector machine (SVM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and logistic regression (LR), and traditional LR models were used to predict 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2). Twenty-four-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was examined as a continuous or dichotomous variable in all models. Model accuracy was assessed using the area under characteristic curve (AUC).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 24-Hour NIHSS score was a top-predictor of functional outcome in all models. ML models using the continuous 24-hour NIHSS scored showed moderate-to-good predictive performance (range mean AUC:0.76-0.92); however, RF (AUC:0.92±0.028) outperformed all ML models, except LASSO (AUC:0.89±0.023, p=0.0958). Importantly, RF demonstrated a significantly higher predictive value than LR (AUC:0.87±0.031, p=0.048) and traditional LR (AUC:85±0.06, p=0.035) when utilizing the 24-hour continuous NIHSS score. Predictive accuracy was similar between the 24-hour NIHSS score dichotomous and continuous ML models.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this substudy, we found similar predictive accuracy for functional outcome when utilizing the 24-hr NIHSS score as a continuous or dichotomous variable in ML models. ML models had moderate-to-good predictive accuracy, with RF outperforming LR models. External validation of these ML models is warranted.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MRI images implicate glymphatic alterations mediate cognitive dysfunction in AD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The glymphatic system cleans amyloid and tau proteins from the brain in animal studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is no direct evidence showing this in humans.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Participants (n = 50; 62.6 ± 5.4 years; 36 women) with AD and normal controls (NCs) underwent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological evaluation. Whole-brain glymphatic activity was measured by diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>ALPS-indexes showed negative correlations with deposition of amyloid and tau on PET images and positive correlations with cognitive scores even after adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and APOE4 genotype covariates in multiple AD-related brain regions (all Ps &lt; 0.05). Mediation analysis showed that ALPS-index acted as a significant mediator between regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) of amyloid and tau images and cognitive dysfunction even after correcting for multiple covariates in AD-related brain regions. These regions are responsible for attention, memory and executive function, which are vulnerable to sleep deprivation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Glymphatic system activity may act as a significant mediator in AD-related cognitive dysfunction even after adjusting for multiple covariates and gray matter volumes. ALPS-index may provide useful disease progression or treatment biomarkers for patients with AD as an indicator of modulation of glymphatic activity.</p>

                The purpose of this case report was to demonstrate the efficacy of Tocilizumab in the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in obese patients who presented with a week's history of fever and one day of shortness of breath (SOB). It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). COVID-19 has rapidly spread throughout the world, resulting in a global pandemic. Severe COVID-19 causes proinflammatory cytokine release and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Furthermore, obesity is an independent risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 complications with a high mortality. Stopping this cascade early in the disease's progression has resulted in a significant improvement in outcome. Tocilizumab in conjunction with systemic corticosteroids as part of the standard of care for halting pro-inflammatory cytokine cascades in early disease courses and prone positioning has been shown to improve respiratory parameters while also reducing the need for mechanical ventilation and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay (14 days as in our case).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Localized Ewing’s sarcoma of the scapula in an adult [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ewing’s sarcoma (ES) of the scapula is a rare entity. It is often discovered late at the metastatic stage of the disease because of its deep location. This neoplasm is common in children and adolescents. We present the first reported case of a localized Ewing’s sarcoma of the scapula in an adult over 40 years-old. Case presentation: A 48-year-old man presented with left shoulder pain evolving for one year. Physical examination showed a painful, ill-defined swelling of the left shoulder measuring 5 x 3 cm. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed showing a mass of the left scapula invading the soft tissues of the shoulder suggestive of a sarcoma. The patient underwent a surgical biopsy finding an ES of the scapula with no secondary localization on the computerized tomography (CT) scan nor on the bone scintigraphy. Neo-adjuvant multiagent chemotherapy was started obtaining a total response. Therefore, the patient underwent a total left scapulectomy. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of ES with a complete response to chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was then indicated. After 3 years of follow-up, no local or distant recurrence was found. Discussion: ES is a high-grade aggressive lesion that most commonly originates in bone. The ES may affect any bone but is frequent in femur, tibia and ilium, the tumors arising from the scapula comprise fewer than 4% of all ES. No cases of localized Ewing’s sarcoma in adults have been reported to our knowledge. The diagnosis is confirmed by immunohistochemical examination and cytogenic. A multimodal treatment approach including a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation can modestly improve local tumor outcomes. Metastatic tumors still have poor diagnosis. Conclusions: ES occurs rarely in adults greater than 20 years-old, and tumors localized in the scapula are even rarer. Histopathology differentiates it from other primary bone/soft tissues tumors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Surfing Corona waves – instead of breaking them: Rethinking the role of natural immunity in COVID-19 policy [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Current COVID-19 response policies have aimed to break Corona waves through non-pharmaceutical interventions and mass vaccination. However, for long-term strategies to be effective and efficient, and to avoid massive disruption and social harms, it is crucial to introduce the role of natural immunity in our thinking about COVID-19 control and prevention. We argue that any Corona control policy must appropriately balance five key elements simultaneously: balancing the various fundamental interests of the nation, as well as the various interventions within the health sector; tailoring the prevention measures and treatments to individual needs; limiting social interaction restrictions; and balancing the role of vaccinations against the role of naturally induced immunity. Given the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and its differential impact on population segments, we examine this last element in more detail and argue that an important aspect of ‘living with the virus’ will be to better understand the role of naturally induced immunity in our overall COVID-19 policy response. In our eyes, a policy approach that factors natural immunity should be considered for persons without major comorbidities and those having ‘encountered’ the antigen in the past.

     alt="Neuronal density and expression of calcium-binding proteins across the layers of the superior colliculus in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>Using stereological sampling, we demonstrate that neuronal density decreases across layers of the superior colliculus in marmoset monkeys. Neuronal density in this structure tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) display variable gradients of density across layers in the superior colliculus. Calbindin- and calretinin-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the upper layers, while the distribution of parvalbumin-expressing neurons is more uniform.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The superior colliculus (SC) is a layered midbrain structure with functions that include polysensory and sensorimotor integration. Here, we describe the distribution of different immunohistochemically identified classes of neurons in the SC of adult marmoset monkeys (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) staining was used to determine the overall neuronal density in the different SC layers. In addition, we studied the distribution of neurons expressing different calcium-binding proteins (calbindin [CB], parvalbumin [PV] and calretinin [CR]). Our results indicate that neuronal density in the SC decreases from superficial to deep layers. Although the neuronal density within the same layer varies little across the mediolateral axis, it tends to be lower at rostral levels, compared to caudal levels. Cells expressing different calcium-binding proteins display differential gradients of density according to depth. Both CB- and CR-expressing neurons show markedly higher densities in the stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), compared to the stratum opticum and intermediate and deep layers. However, CR-expressing neurons are twice as common as CB-expressing neurons outside the SGS. The distribution of PV-expressing cells follows a shallow density gradient from superficial to deep layers. When normalized relative to total neuronal density, the proportion of CR-expressing neurons increases between the superficial and intermediate layers, whereas that of CB-expressing neurons declines toward the deep layers. The proportion of PV-expressing neurons remains constant across layers. Our data provide layer-specific and accurate estimates of neuronal density, which may be important for the generation of biophysical models of how the primate SC transforms sensory inputs into motor signals.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The olfactory placode (OP) of vertebrates generates several classes of migrating cells, including hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-producing neurons, which play essential roles in the reproduction system. Previous studies using OP cell labeling have demonstrated that OP-derived non-GnRH cells enter the developing forebrain; however, their final fates and phenotypes are less well understood. In chick embryos, a subpopulation of migratory cells from the OP that is distinct from GnRH neurons transiently expresses somatostatin (SS). We postulated that these cells are destined to develop into brain neurons. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of SS mRNA in the olfactory-forebrain region during development, as well as the destination of OP-derived migratory cells, including SS mRNA-expressing cells. Utilizing the Tol2 genomic integration system to induce long-term fluorescent protein expression in OP cells, we found that OP-derived migratory cells labeled at embryonic day (E) 3 resided in the olfactory nerve and medial forebrain at E17–19. A subpopulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled GnRH neurons that remained in the olfactory nerve was considered to comprise terminal nerve neurons. In the forebrain, GFP-labeled cells showed a distribution pattern similar to that of GnRH neurons. A large proportion of GFP-labeled cells expressed the mature neuronal marker NeuN. Among the GFP-labeled cells, the percentage of GnRH neurons was low, while the remaining GnRH-negative neurons either expressed SS mRNA, neuropeptide Y, or calbindin D-28k or did not express any of them. These results indicate that a diverse population of OP-derived neuronal cells, other than GnRH neurons, integrates into the chick medial forebrain.</p>

     alt="Localization of chemical synapses and modulatory release sites in the cardiac ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis"/>
<p>The crustacean cardiac ganglion is a heavily modulated nine-neuron central pattern generator. We describe the distribution of chemical synapses and several neuromodulators within this system, which includes unusual clusters of synapsin-like immunoreactivity surrounding motor neuron cell bodies. These putative synapses near somata colocalize with many neuromodulators including the excitatory peptide proctolin (shown).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The crustacean cardiac ganglion (CG) comprises nine neurons that provide rhythmic drive to the heart. The CG is the direct target of multiple modulators. Synapsin-like immunoreactivity was found clustered around the somata of the large cells (LC) and in a neuropil at the anterior branch of the CG trunk of <i>Cancer borealis</i>. This implicates the soma as a key site of synaptic integration, an unusual configuration in invertebrates. Proctolin is an excitatory neuromodulator of the CG, and proctolin-like immunoreactivity exhibited partial overlap with putative chemical synapses near the LCs and at the neuropil. A proctolin-like projection was also found in a pair of excitatory nerves entering the CG. GABA-like immunoreactivity was nearly completely colocalized with chemical synapses near the LCs but absent at the anterior branch neuropil. GABA-like projections were found in a pair of inhibitory nerves entering the CG. <i>C. borealis</i> Allatostatin B1 (CbASTB), red pigment concentrating hormone, and FLRFamide-like immunoreactivity each had a unique pattern of staining and co-localization with putative chemical synapses. These results provide morphological evidence that synaptic input is integrated at LC somata in the CG. Our findings provide a topographical organization for some of the multiple inhibitory and excitatory modulators that alter the rhythmic output of this semi-autonomous motor circuit.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The large black beetle, the chafer <i>Holotrichia parallela</i>, shows a unique ca. 48-h endogenous rhythm (viz., a circabidian rhythm) in appearance on the ground. The ecological significance and the molecular mechanism remain obscure, but a previous study implied that the circadian clock system is responsible for the 2-day rhythm. In the present study, we investigated neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor-immunoreactive (PDF-ir) neurons in the brain of <i>H. parallela</i> in order to search for circadian neural components since PDF is a well-known output neuromodulator of circadian pacemakers in several insects. We anatomically identified ∼ 100 PDF-ir cells near the accessory medulla (AME) in the optic lobe, which is a site for circadian pacemakers in the cockroach and flies, and furthermore, we found that their varicose terminal arbors in the lateral protocerebrum form output synapses upon unknown fibers as well as other PDF-ir fibers. Their conceivable function in the circabidian rhythm was discussed based on the anatomical insights.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is a well-known output neuropeptide modulator of circadian pacemakers in insects. Here, we investigated PDF-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the brain of the large black chafer <i>Holotrichia parallela</i> to search for circadian neural components, which are potentially involved in its circabidian rhythm. PDF-ir cells were exclusively detected near the accessory medulla (AME) as a cluster of ∼ 100 cells with almost homogeneous size. No other cells exhibited immunoreactivity. The PDF-ir cells send beaded fibers into the proximal half of the AME and ventral elongation in an anterior region between the medulla (ME) and lobula (LO). Neither the lamina, ME, LO, nor lobula plate receives PDF-ir fibers. Primary axons derived from the PDF-ir cells extend toward the contralateral hemisphere through the dorsolateral protocerebrum anterior to the calyx to connect the bilateral AME. The axons form varicose outgrowths exclusively in the lateral protocerebrum. Double labeling with antisynapsin revealed partial overlaps between PDF-ir varicosities and synapsin-ir puncta. Thus, it was assumed that the PDF-ir fibers form output synapses there. To verify this, we investigated the ultrastructure of the PDF-ir varicosities in the lateral protocerebrum by preembedding immunoelectron microscopy. The PDF-ir profiles contain small clear synaptic vesicles as well as both PDF-positive and PDF-negative dense-core vesicles, and the profiles form output synapses upon unknown profiles and receive synapses from other PDF-ir profiles. PDF neurons near the AME are considered to be prominent circadian pacemakers in the cockroach and flies. Their possible function in the circabidian rhythm was discussed based on these anatomical insights.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is ultimately fatal. Currently, millions of Americans are living with AD, and this number is predicted to grow with increases in the aging population. Interestingly, despite the prevalence of AD in human populations, the full AD phenotype has not been observed in any nonhuman primate (NHP) species, and it has been suggested that NHPs are immune to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.</p>
<p>Here, we review the typical age-related changes and pathologies in humans along with the neuropathologic changes associated with AD, and we place this information in the context of the comparative neuropathology of NHPs. We further propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell technology as a way of addressing initial molecular processes and changes that occur in neurons and glia (in both humans and NHPs) when exposed to AD-inducing pathology prior to cell death.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corvidae, passerine songbirds such as jays, crows, and ravens known as corvids, have become model systems for the study of avian cognition. The superior cognitive capabilities of corvids mainly emerge from a disproportionally large telencephalon found in these species. However, a systematic mapping of the neuroanatomy of the corvid brain, and the telencephalon in particular, is lacking so far. Here, we present a brain atlas of the carrion crow, <i>Corvus corone</i>, with special emphasis on the telencephalic pallium. We applied four staining techniques to brain slices (Nissl, myelin, combination of Nissl and myelin, and tyrosine hydroxylase targeting catecholaminergic neurons). This allowed us to identify brain nuclei throughout the brain and delineate the known pallial subdivisions termed hyperpallium, entopallium, mesopallium, nidopallium, arcopallium, and hippocampal complex. The extent of these subdivisions and brain nuclei are described according to stereotaxic coordinates. In addition, 3D depictions of pallial regions were reconstructed from these slices. While the overall organization of the carrion crow's brain matches other songbird brains, the relative proportions and expansions of associative pallial areas differ considerably in agreement with enhanced cognitive skills found in corvids. The presented global organization of the crow brain in stereotaxic coordinates will help to guide future neurobiological studies in corvids.</p>

     alt="Small sensory spinal lesions that affect hand function in monkeys greatly alter primary afferent and motor neuron connections in the cord"/><p>The segmental organization of primate spinal cord differs depending on modality, and these modalities are differentially affected by spinal cord injury. Sensory inputs from the hand have a widespread input range which span 10 segments of cervical and thoracic cord. These inputs are drastically reduced by a dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL) affecting digits 1-3 of one hand. In contrast, digit related motor neurons (MNs) have a tight distribution across only 2 spinal segments, and their numbers are unaffected by a DRL/DCL. However, individual synaptic inputs to motor neurons are altered which means that even focal sensory injuries to the spinal cord can have a profound effect on motor output.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Small sensory spinal injuries induce plasticity across the neuraxis, but little is understood about their effect on segmental connections or motor neuron (MN) function. Here, we begin to address this at two levels. First, we compared afferent input distributions from the skin and muscles of the digits with corresponding MN pools to determine their spatial relationship, in both the normal state and 4–6 months after a unilateral dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL), affecting digits 1–3. Second, we looked at specific changes to MN inputs and membrane properties that likely impact functional recovery. Monkeys received a targeted unilateral DRL/DCL, and 4–6 months later, cholera toxin subunit B (CT-B) was injected bilaterally into either the distal pads of digits 1–3, or related intrinsic hand muscles, to label inputs to the cord, and corresponding MNs. In controls (unlesioned side), cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents from digits 1–3 showed different distribution patterns but similar rostrocaudal spread within the dorsal horn from C1 to T2. In contrast, MNs were distributed across just two segments (C7–8). Following the lesion, sensory inputs were significantly diminished across all 10 segments, though this did not alter MN distributions. Afferent and monoamine inputs, as well as KCC2 cotransporters, were also significantly altered on the cell membrane of CT-B labeled MNs postlesion. In contrast, inhibitory neurotransmission and perineuronal net integrity were not altered at this prechronic timepoint.  Our findings indicate that even a small sensory injury can significantly impact sensory and motor spinal neurons and provide new insight into the complex process of recovery.</p>

     alt="Positive effects of running exercise on astrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex in an animal model of depression"/>
<p>Using immunohistochemical and stereological methods, immunofluorescence assays, RNA sequencing and qRT–PCR techniques, we found that running exercise increased the total number of astrocytes and the density of newborn astrocytes and reversed the changes in the gene expression levels of GFAP, S100b, and the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST in the mPFC of CUS animals. Our results suggested that changes in the astrocyte number and glutamate transporter function may be potential meditators of the effects of running exercise in the treatment of depression.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and seriously affects all aspects of life. Running exercise has been suggested to prevent or alleviate the occurrence and development of depression; however, the underlying mechanisms of these effects remain unclear. Independent studies have indicated that astrocytes play essential roles and that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is an important brain region involved in the pathology underlying depression. However, it is unknown whether running exercise achieves antidepressant effects by affecting the number of astrocytes and glutamate transport function in the mPFC. Here, animal models of depression were established using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), and depression-like behavior was assessed by the sucrose preference test. After successfully establishing the depression model, experimental animals performed running exercise. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP<sup>+</sup>) cell number in the mPFC was precisely quantified using immunohistochemical and stereological methods<span style="text-decoration:underline">,</span> and the densities of bromodeoxyuridine-positive (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) and BrdU<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC were measured using a semiquantitative immunofluorescence assay. Changes in glutamate transporter gene expression in mPFC astrocytes were detected by mRNA sequencing and qRT–PCR. We found that running exercise reversed CUS-induced decreases in sucrose preference, increased astrocyte number and the density of newborn astrocytes, and reversed decreases in gene expression levels of GFAP, S100b, and the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST in the mPFC of CUS animals. These results suggested that changes in astrocyte number and glutamate transporter function may be potential meditators of the effects of running exercise in the treatment of depression.</p>

     alt="Analysis of the distribution of vagal afferent projections from different peripheral organs to the nucleus of the solitary tract in rats"/>
<p>We injected retrograde pseudotyped adeno-associated viruses into different peripheral organs and mapped the axonal projections of vagal viscerosensory neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We observed no obvious viscerotopy, with axons from different organs overlapping in NTS subnuclei and with NTS neurons of different neurochemical phenotype. The implications for deciphering this viscerosensory code are discussed.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anatomical tracing studies examining the vagal system can conflate details of sensory afferent and motor efferent neurons. Here, we used a serotype of adeno-associated virus that transports retrogradely and exhibits selective tropism for vagal afferents, to map their soma location and central termination sites within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We examined the vagal sensory afferents innervating the trachea, duodenum, stomach, or heart, and in some animals, from two organs concurrently. We observed no obvious somatotopy in the somata distribution within the nodose ganglion. The central termination patterns of afferents from different organs within the NTS overlap substantially. Convergence of vagal afferent inputs from different organs onto single NTS neurons is observed. Abdominal and thoracic afferents terminate throughout the NTS, including in the rostral NTS, where the 7th cranial nerve inputs are known to synapse. To address whether the axonal labeling produced by viral transduction is so widespread because it fills axons traveling to their targets, and not just terminal fields, we labeled pre and postsynaptic elements of vagal afferents in the NTS . Vagal afferents form multiple putative synapses as they course through the NTS, with each vagal afferent neuron distributing sensory signals to multiple second-order NTS neurons. We observe little selectivity between vagal afferents from different visceral targets and NTS neurons with common neurochemical phenotypes, with afferents from different organs making close appositions with the same NTS neuron. We conclude that specific viscerosensory information is distributed widely within the NTS and that the coding of this input is probably determined by the intrinsic properties and projections of the second-order neuron.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolutionary rescue of phosphomannomutase deficiency in yeast models of human disease</a></h4>

              
                The most common cause of human congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are mutations in the phosphomannomutase gene <i>PMM2</i>, which affect protein <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation. The yeast gene <i>SEC53</i> encodes a homolog of human <i>PMM2</i>. We evolved 384 populations of yeast harboring one of two human-disease-associated alleles, <i>sec53-</i>V238M and <i>sec53</i>-F126L, or wild-type <i>SEC53</i>. We find that after 1,000 generations, most populations compensate for the slow-growth phenotype associated with the <i>sec53</i> human-disease-associated alleles. Through whole-genome sequencing we identify compensatory mutations, including known <i>SEC53</i> genetic interactors. We observe an enrichment of compensatory mutations in other genes whose human homologs are associated with Type 1 CDG, including <i>PGM1</i>, which encodes the minor isoform of phosphoglucomutase in yeast. By genetic reconstruction, we show that evolved <i>pgm1</i> mutations are dominant and allele-specific genetic interactors that restore both protein glycosylation and growth of yeast harboring the <i>sec53</i>-V238M allele. Finally, we characterize the enzymatic activity of purified Pgm1 mutant proteins. We find that reduction, but not elimination, of Pgm1 activity best compensates for the deleterious phenotypes associated with the <i>sec53</i>-V238M allele. Broadly, our results demonstrate the power of experimental evolution as a tool for identifying genes and pathways that compensate for human-disease associated alleles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Presynaptic Rac1 controls synaptic strength through the regulation of synaptic vesicle priming</a></h4>

              
                Synapses contain a limited number of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that are released in response to action potentials (APs). Therefore, sustaining synaptic transmission over a wide range of AP firing rates and timescales depends on SV release and replenishment. Although actin dynamics impact synaptic transmission, how presynaptic regulators of actin signaling cascades control SV release and replenishment remains unresolved. Rac1, a Rho GTPase, regulates actin signaling cascades that control synaptogenesis, neuronal development, and postsynaptic function. However, the presynaptic role of Rac1 in regulating synaptic transmission is unclear. To unravel Rac1’s roles in controlling transmitter release, we performed selective presynaptic ablation of Rac1 at the mature mouse calyx of Held synapse. Loss of Rac1 increased synaptic strength, accelerated EPSC recovery after conditioning stimulus trains, and augmented spontaneous SV release with no change in presynaptic morphology or AZ ultrastructure. Analyses with constrained short-term plasticity models revealed faster SV priming kinetics and, depending on model assumptions, elevated SV release probability or higher abundance of tightly docked fusion-competent SVs in Rac1-deficient synapses. We conclude that presynaptic Rac1 is a key regulator of synaptic transmission and plasticity mainly by regulating the dynamics of SV priming and potentially SV release probability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dynamics of cooperative excavation in ant and robot collectives</a></h4>

              
                The solution of complex problems by the collective action of simple agents in both biologically evolved and synthetically engineered systems involves cooperative action. Understanding the resulting emergent solutions requires integrating across the organismal behaviors of many individuals. Here we investigate an ecologically relevant collective task in black carpenter ants Camponotus pennsylvanicus: excavation of a soft, erodible confining corral. Individual ants show a transition from individual exploratory excavation at random locations to spatially localized collective exploitative excavation and eventual excavate out from the corral. An agent minimal continuum theory that coarse-grains over individual actions and considers their integrated influence on the environment leads to the emergence of an effective phase space of behaviors in terms of excavation strength and cooperation intensity. To test the theory over the range of both observed and predicted behaviors, we used custom-built robots (RAnts) that respond to stimuli to characterize the phase space of emergence (and failure) of cooperative excavation. By tuning the amount of cooperation between RAnts, we found that we could vary the efficiency of excavation and synthetically generate the other macroscopic phases predicted by our theory. Overall, our approach shows how the cooperative completion of tasks can arise from simple rules that involve the interaction of agents with a dynamically changing environment that serves as both an enabler and a modulator of behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unrestrained growth of correctly oriented microtubules instructs axonal microtubule orientation</a></h4>

              
                In many eukaryotic cells, directed molecular transport occurs along microtubules. Within neuronal axons, transport over vast distances particularly relies on uniformly oriented microtubules, whose plus-ends point towards the distal axon tip (anterogradely polymerizing, or plus-end-out). However, axonal microtubules initially have mixed orientations, and how they orient during development is not yet fully understood. Using live imaging of primary <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> neurons, we found that, in the distal part of the axon, catastrophe rates of plus-end-out microtubules were significantly reduced compared to those of minus-end-out microtubules. Physical modelling revealed that plus-end-out microtubules should therefore exhibit persistent long-term growth, while growth of minus-end-out microtubules should be limited, leading to a bias in overall axonal microtubule orientation. Using chemical and physical perturbations of microtubule growth and genetic perturbations of the anti -catastrophe factor p150, which was enriched in the distal axon tip, we confirmed that the enhanced growth of plus-end-out microtubules is critical for achieving uniform microtubule orientation. Computer simulations of axon development integrating the enhanced plus-end-out microtubule growth identified here with previously suggested mechanisms, that is, dynein-based microtubule sliding and augmin-mediated templating, correctly predicted the long-term evolution of axonal microtubule orientation as found in our experiments. Our study thus leads to a holistic explanation of how axonal microtubules orient uniformly, a prerequisite for efficient long-range transport essential for neuronal functioning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The landscape of transcriptional and 1translational changes over 22 years of bacterial adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Organisms can adapt to an environment by taking multiple mutational paths. This redundancy at the genetic level, where many mutations have similar phenotypic and fitness effects, can make untangling the molecular mechanisms of complex adaptations difficult. Here we use the E. coli long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) as a model to address this challenge. To understand how different genomic changes could lead to parallel fitness gains, we characterize the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes across 12 replicate populations evolving in parallel for 50,000 generations. By quantifying absolute changes in mRNA abundances, we show that not only do all evolved lines have more mRNAs but that this increase in mRNA abundance scales with cell size. We also find that despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations in the LTEE are remarkably similar in their gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Furthermore, we show that the majority of the expression changes are due to changes at the transcriptional level with very few translational changes. Finally, we show how mutations in transcriptional regulators lead to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Decoding the IGF1 signaling gene regulatory network behind alveologenesis from a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia</a></h4>

              
                Lung development is precisely controlled by underlying Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN). Disruption of genes in the network can interrupt normal development and cause diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)–a chronic lung disease in preterm infants with morbid and sometimes lethal consequences characterized by lung immaturity and reduced alveolarization. Here, we generated a transgenic mouse exhibiting a moderate severity BPD phenotype by blocking IGF1 signaling in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) at the onset of alveologenesis. Using approaches mirroring the construction of the model GRN in sea urchin’s development, we constructed the IGF1 signaling network underlying alveologenesis using this mouse model that phenocopies BPD. The constructed GRN, consisting of 43 genes, provides a bird’s-eye view of how the genes downstream of IGF1 are regulatorily connected. The GRN also reveals a mechanistic interpretation of how the effects of IGF1 signaling are transduced within SCMF from its specification genes to its effector genes and then from SCMF to its neighboring alveolar epithelial cells with WNT5A and FGF10 signaling as the bridge. Consistently, blocking WNT5A signaling in mice phenocopies BPD as inferred by the network. A comparative study on human samples suggests that a GRN of similar components and wiring underlies human BPD. Our network view of alveologenesis is transforming our perspective to understand and treat BPD. This new perspective calls for the construction of the full signaling GRN underlying alveologenesis, upon which targeted therapies for this neonatal chronic lung disease can be viably developed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (ndrg1) functions as a molecular switch for cellular adaptation to hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Lack of oxygen (hypoxia and anoxia) is detrimental to cell function and survival and underlies many disease conditions. Hence, metazoans have evolved mechanisms to adapt to low oxygen. One such mechanism, metabolic suppression, decreases the cellular demand for oxygen by downregulating ATP-demanding processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptation are poorly understood. Here, we report on the role of <i>ndrg1a</i> in hypoxia adaptation of the anoxia-tolerant zebrafish embryo. <i>ndrg1a</i> is expressed in the kidney and ionocytes, cell types that use large amounts of ATP to maintain ion homeostasis. <i>ndrg1a</i> mutants are viable and develop normally when raised under normal oxygen. However, their survival and kidney function is reduced relative to WT embryos following exposure to prolonged anoxia. We further demonstrate that Ndrg1a binds to the energy-demanding sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA) pump under anoxia and is required for its degradation, which may preserve ATP in the kidney and ionocytes and contribute to energy homeostasis. Lastly, we show that sodium azide treatment, which increases lactate levels under normoxia, is sufficient to trigger NKA degradation in an Ndrg1a-dependent manner. These findings support a model whereby Ndrg1a is essential for hypoxia adaptation and functions downstream of lactate signaling to induce NKA degradation, a process known to conserve cellular energy.

                Munc13 proteins are priming factors for SNARE-dependent exocytosis, which are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding to their C1-domain. Several Munc13 paralogs exist, but their differential roles are not well understood. We studied the interdependence of phorbolesters (DAG mimics) with Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. Although expression of either Munc13-1 or ubMunc13-2 stimulated secretion, phorbolester was only stimulatory for secretion when ubMunc13-2 expression dominated, but inhibitory when Munc13-1 dominated. Accordingly, phorbolester stimulated secretion in wildtype cells, or cells overexpressing ubMunc13-2, but inhibited secretion in Munc13-2/<i>Unc13b</i> knockout (KO) cells or in cells overexpressing Munc13-1. Phorbolester was more stimulatory in the Munc13-1/<i>Unc13a</i> KO than in WT littermates, showing that endogenous Munc13-1 limits the effects of phorbolester. Imaging showed that ubMunc13-2 traffics to the plasma membrane with a time-course matching Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent secretion, and trafficking is independent of Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7). However, in the absence of Syt7, phorbolester became inhibitory for both Munc13-1 and ubMunc13-2 driven secretion, indicating that stimulatory phorbolester x Munc13-2 interaction depends on functional pairing with Syt7. Overall, DAG/phorbolester, ubMunc13-2 and Syt7 form a stimulatory triad for dense-core vesicle priming.

                A forward mutagenesis assay using the <i>supF</i> gene has been widely employed for the last several decades in studies addressing mutation frequencies and mutation spectra associated with various intrinsic and environmental mutagens. In this study, by using a <i>supF</i> shuttle vector and non-SOS-induced <i>Escherichia coli</i> with short read Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, we present an advanced method for the study of mutations, which is simple, versatile, and cost-effective. We demonstrate the performance of our newly developed assay via pilot experiments with UV-irradiation, the results from which emerge more relevant than expected. The NGS data obtained from samples of the indicator <i>E. coli</i> grown on titer plates provides mutation frequency and spectrum data, and uncovers obscure mutations that cannot be detected by a conventional <i>supF</i> assay. Furthermore, a very small amount of NGS data from selection plates reveals the almost full spectrum of mutations in each specimen and offers us a novel insight into the mechanisms of mutagenesis, despite them being considered already well-known. We believe that the method presented here will contribute to future opportunities for research on mutagenesis, DNA repair, and cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transient regulation of focal adhesion via Tensin3 is required for nascent oligodendrocyte differentiation</a></h4>

              
                The differentiation of oligodendroglia from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to complex and extensive myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) is a multistep process that involves largescale morphological changes with significant strain on the cytoskeleton. While key chromatin and transcriptional regulators of differentiation have been identified, their target genes responsible for the morphological changes occurring during OL myelination are still largely unknown. Here, we show that the regulator of focal adhesion, Tensin3 (Tns3), is a direct target gene of Olig2, Chd7, and Chd8, transcriptional regulators of OL differentiation. Tns3 is transiently upregulated and localized to cell processes of immature OLs, together with integrin-b1, a key mediator of survival at this transient stage. Constitutive <i>Tns3</i> loss-of-function leads to reduced viability in mouse and humans, with surviving knockout mice still expressing Tns3 in oligodendroglia. Acute deletion of <i>Tns3 in vivo</i>, either in postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) or in OPCs, leads to a two-fold reduction in OL numbers. We find that the transient upregulation of Tns3 is required to protect differentiating OPCs and immature OLs from cell death by preventing the upregulation of p53, a key regulator of apoptosis. Altogether, our findings reveal a specific time window during which transcriptional upregulation of Tns3 in immature OLs is required for OL differentiation likely by mediating integrin-b1 survival signaling to the actin cytoskeleton as OL undergo the large morphological changes required for their terminal differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Restricted effects of the sole C. elegans Daughterless/E homolog, HLH-2, on nervous system development</a></h4>

              
                Are there common mechanisms of neurogenesis used throughout an entire nervous system? Making use of the well-defined and relatively small size of the nervous system of the nematode C. elegans, we explored to what extent canonical proneural class I/II bHLH complexes are responsible for neurogenesis throughout the entire C. elegans nervous system. Distinct, lineage-specific proneural class II bHLH factors are generally thought to operate via interaction with a common, class I bHLH subunit, encoded by Daugtherless in flies, the E (E2A, E2-2, HEB) proteins in vertebrates, and hlh-2 in C. elegans. To eliminate function of all proneuronal class I/II bHLH complexes, we therefore genetically removed maternal and zygotic hlh-2 gene activity. We observed broad effects on neurogenesis, but still detected normal neurogenesis in many distinct neuron-producing lineages of the central and peripheral nervous system. Moreover, we find that hlh-2 selectively affects some aspects of neuron differentiation while leaving others unaffected. While our studies confirm the function of proneuronal class I/II bHLH complexes in many different lineages throughout a nervous system, we conclude that their function is not universal, but rather restricted by lineage, cell type and components of differentiation programs affected.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unattended visual stimuli do not produce prediction error responses despite being initially encoded</a></h4>

              
                Prediction error is a basic component of predictive-coding theory of brain processing. According to the theory, each stage of brain processing of sensory information generates a model of the current sensory input; subsequent input is compared against the model and only if there is a mismatch, a prediction error, is further processing performed. Recently, Smout et al. found that a signature of prediction error, the visual (v) mismatch negativity (MMN), for a fundamental property of visual input--its orientation--was absent without attention on the stimuli. This is remarkable because the weight of evidence for MMNs from audition and vision is that they occur without attention. To resolve this discrepancy, we conducted an experiment addressing two alternative explanations for Smout et al.'s finding: that it was from a lack of reproducibility or that participants' visual systems did not encode the stimuli when attention was on something else. We conducted a similar experiment to Smout et al.'s. We showed 21 participants sequences of identically oriented Gabor patches, standards, and, unpredictably, otherwise identical, Gabor patches differing in orientation by {+/-}15{degrees}, {+/-}30{degrees}, and {+/-}60{degrees}, deviants. To test whether participants encoded the orientation of the standards, we varied the numbers of standards preceding a deviant, allowing us to search for a decrease in activity with the number of repetitions of standards--repetition suppression. We diverted participants' attention from the oriented stimuli with a central, letter-detection task. We reproduced Smout et al.'s finding of no vMMN without attention, strengthening their finding. We also found that our participants showed repetition suppression: they did encode the stimuli pre-attentively. We also found early processing of deviants. We discuss whether this earlier processing of deviants may be why no further processing, in the vMMN time window, occurs.

                Somatosensory neurons (SSNs) that detect and transduce mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli densely innervate an animal's skin. However, despite the fact that epidermal cells provide the first point of contact for sensory stimuli. our understanding of roles that epidermal cells play in SSN function, particularly nociception, remains limited. Here, we show that stimulating Drosophila epidermal cells elicits activation of SSNs including nociceptors and triggers a variety of behavior outputs, including avoidance and escape. Further, we find that epidermal cells are intrinsically mechanosensitive and that epidermal mechanically evoked calcium responses require the store-operated calcium channel Orai. Epidermal cell stimulation augments larval responses to acute nociceptive stimuli and promotes prolonged hypersensitivity to subsequent mechanical stimuli. Hence, epidermal cells are key determinants of nociceptive sensitivity and sensitization, acting as primary sensors of noxious stimuli that tune nociceptor output and drive protective behaviors.

                Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder characterized by failure of functional integration (aka dysconnection) across the brain. Recent functional connectivity (FC) studies have adopted functional parcellations to define subnetworks of large-scale networks, and to characterize the (dys)connection between them, in normal and clinical populations. While FC examines statistical dependencies between observations, model-based effective connectivity (EC) can disclose the causal influences that underwrite the observed dependencies. In this study, we investigated resting state EC between the subnetworks of seven large-scale networks, in 66 SZ and 74 healthy subjects from a public dataset. The results showed that a remarkable 33% of the effective connections (among subnetworks) of the cognitive control network had been pathologically modulated in SZ. Further dysconnection was identified within the visual, default mode and sensorimotor networks of SZ subjects, with 24%, 20% and 11% aberrant couplings. Overall, the proportion of diagnostic connections was remarkably larger in EC (24%) than FC (1%) analysis. Subsequently, to study the neural correlates of impaired cognition in SZ, we conducted a canonical correlation analysis between the EC parameters and the cognitive scores of the patients. As such, the self-inhibitions of supplementary motor area and paracentral lobule (in the sensorimotor network) and the excitatory connection from parahippocampal gyrus to inferior temporal gyrus (in the cognitive control network) were significantly correlated with the social cognition, reasoning/problem solving and working memory capabilities of the patients. Future research can investigate the potential of whole-brain EC as a biomarker for diagnosis of brain disorders and for cognitive assessment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast prediction in marmoset reach-to-grasp movements for dynamic prey</a></h4>

              
                Primates have evolved sophisticated visually guided reaching behaviors for interacting with dynamic objects, such as insects during foraging. Reaching control in dynamic natural conditions requires active prediction of the target's future position in order to compensate for visuo-motor processing delays and enhance online movement adjustments. Past reaching research in non-human primates mainly focused on seated subjects engaged in repeated ballistic arm movements to either stationary targets, or targets that step once during the movement. However, those highly constrained approaches also impose task constraints that limit the natural dynamics of reaching. A recent field study in marmoset monkeys highlights predictive aspects of visually-guided reaching during insect prey capture among wild marmoset monkeys (Ngo et. al. 2022). To examine the complementary dynamics for similar natural behavior within a laboratory context we developed an ecologically motivated unrestrained reach-to-grasp task involving live crickets. We used multiple high-speed video cameras to capture the movements of marmosets and crickets stereoscopically and applied machine vision algorithms for marker-free object and hand tracking. Contrary to estimates under traditional constrained reaching paradigms, we find that prediction for dynamic targets can operate at incredibly short visuo-motor delays, rivaling the speeds that are typical of the oculomotor systems during closed-loop visual pursuit. Multivariate linear regression modeling of the kinematic relationships between the hand and cricket velocity revealed a visuo-motor delay below 100ms. Predictive corrections for moving crickets were incorporated into hand motion especially during the latter stage of the reach-to-grasp trajectory. This approach reveals that the marmoset motor system for reaching can operate at short visuo-motor delays comparable to the oculomotor system under natural dynamic conditions.

                The existence of a neural representation for whole words(i.e.,a lexicon) is a common feature of many models of speech processing. Prior studies have provided evidence for a visual lexicon containing representations of whole written words in an area of the ventral visual stream known as the "Visual Word Form Area" (VWFA). Similar experimental support for an auditory lexicon containing representations of spoken words has yet to be shown. Using fMRI rapid adaptation techniques, we provide evidence for an auditory lexicon in the "Auditory Word Form Area" (AWFA) in the human left anterior superior temporal gyrus that contains representations highly selective for individual spoken words. Furthermore, we show that familiarization with novel auditory words sharpens their selectivity in the AWFA. These findings reveal strong parallels in how the brain represents written and spoken words, showing convergent processing strategies across speech modalities in the visual and auditory ventral streams.

                Recording and modulating neural activity in vivo enables investigations of neural circuits during behavior. However, there is a dearth of tools for simultaneous recording and localized receptor modulation in large animal models. We address this limitation by translating multifunctional fiber-based neurotechnology previously only available for rodent studies to enable cortical and subcortical neural modulation in macaques. We record single unit and local field potential activity before, during, and after intracranial GABA infusions in the premotor cortex and putamen. We apply state-space models to characterize changes in neural activity and investigate how neural activity evoked by a working memory task varies in the presence of local inhibition. The recordings provide detailed insight into the electrophysiological effect of neurotransmitter receptor modulation in both cortical and subcortical structures in an awake, behaving macaque. Our results demonstrate a first-time translation of multifunctional fibers for causal studies in behaving non-human primates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generalized habitual tendencies in alcohol dependent rats</a></h4>

              
                Habitual responses and ultimately compulsive behavior are thought to be at the core of addiction including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Little is known whether the habitization concerns exclusively the response towards alcohol or generalizes to other daily activities. Here, we address this question in a well-established animal model of AUD - the post-dependent rat model - by testing habitual responses towards a sweet palatable reward in two striatal learning paradigms: spatial navigation and reward conditioning. For the spatial navigation task, alcohol-dependent and control rats were tested on a sequential decision-making test after short and prolonged T-Maze training; for the reward conditioning task, rats were trained under a random interval schedule for a short and prolonged period and tested in a satiety devaluation test at each time point. Another cohort of alcohol-naive rats was trained and tested on both paradigms under DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs)-mediated inactivation of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) which controls goal-directed behavior. Our results show that alcohol-dependent rats displayed increased habitual behavior to obtain saccharin reward on both paradigms, with overall more habitual choices after prolonged training on the spatial navigation task, and increased habitual responses already after short training on the reward conditioning task. Finally, DREADD-mediated inactivation of the DMS increased habitual behavior in non-dependent rats on both paradigms. Our results provide evidence that a history of alcohol dependence produces a bias towards habitual responding that generalizes to a natural reward in rats. Similarly, a habitual bias was induced in non-dependent rats after inactivation of the DMS, thus confirming the critical role of this region in maintaining goal-directed behavior and suggesting its diminished control in AUD.

                We consider a model of associative storage and retrieval of compositional memories in an extended cortical network. Our model network is comprised of Potts units, which represent patches of cortex, interacting through long-range connections. The critical assumption is that a memory is composed of a limited number of items, each of which has a pre-established representation: storing a new memory only involves acquiring the connections, if novel, among the participating items. The model is shown to have a much lower storage capacity than when it stores simple unitary representations. It is also shown that an input from the hippocampus facilitates associative retrieval. When it is absent, it is advantageous to cue rare rather than frequent items. The implications of these results for emerging trends in empirical research are discussed.

                Copy number variations at 7q11.23 cause neurodevelopmental disorders with shared and opposite manifestations. Deletion causes Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), while duplication causes 7q11.23 microduplication syndrome (7Dup). Converging evidence indicates GTF2I, from the 7q11.23 locus, is a key mediator of the cognitive-behavioral phenotypes associated with WBS and 7Dup. Here we integrate molecular profiling of patient-derived cortical organoids (COs) and transgenic mouse models to dissect 7q11.23 disease mechanisms. Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of COs revealed opposite dynamics of neural progenitor proliferation and transcriptional imbalances, leading to precocious excitatory neuron production in 7Dup. The accelerated excitatory neuron production in 7Dup COs could be rescued by GTF2I knockdown. Transgenic mice with Gtf2i duplication recapitulated early neuronal differentiation defects and ASD-like behaviors. Remarkably, inhibition of LSD1, a downstream effector of GTF2I, was sufficient to rescue ASD-like phenotypes. We propose that the GTF2I-LSD1 axis constitutes a molecular pathway amenable to therapeutic intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dopamine depletion leads to pathological synchronization of distinct basal ganglia loops in the beta band</a></h4>

              
                Motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) are associated with dopamine deficits and pathological oscillation of basal ganglia (BG) neurons in the beta range ([12-30] Hz). However, how the dopamine depletion affects the oscillation dynamics of BG nuclei is still unclear. With a spiking neurons model, we here captured the features of BG nuclei interactions leading to oscillations in dopamine-depleted condition. We found that both the loop between subthalamic nucleus and Globus Pallidus pars externa (GPe) and the loop between striatal fast spiking and medium spiny neurons and GPe displayed resonances in the beta range, and synchronized to a common beta frequency through interaction. Crucially, the synchronization depends on dopamine depletion: the two loops were largely independent for high levels of dopamine, but progressively synchronized as dopamine was depleted due to the increased strength of the striatal loop. Our results highlight the role of the interplay between the GPe-STN and the GPe-striatum loop in generating sustained beta oscillations in PD subjects, and explain how this interplay depends on the level of dopamine. This paves the way to the design of therapies specifically addressing the onset of pathological beta oscillations.

                With the emerging role of the autophagic machinery in healthy brain development and aging, there is a pressing need to better characterize its functions in different neuronal populations, providing cellular insight into autophagy-related brain diseases. Here, we generated and characterized mice with conditional ablation of atg5 in GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV-atg5KO), mostly comprising fast-spiking interneurons, as well as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Using light-sheet microscopy to image PV neurons throughout the brain, we reveal that autophagy is required for the sustenance of Purkinje cells but not of PV-interneurons. Yet, proteomic analysis showed that autophagy deficiency in cortical and hippocampal PV-interneurons alters the proteostasis of key synaptic proteins, as well as the surface expression of glutamate receptor subunits. Consistently, hippocampal autophagy-deficient PV-interneurons exhibit reduced inhibitory neurotransmission and PV-atg5KO mice display excitation-inhibition imbalance in the hippocampus and memory deficits. Our findings demonstrate a neuronal type-specific vulnerability to autophagy deficiency, while also identifying PV-interneurons as cellular substrates where autophagy is required for memory.

                Copy number variations (CNVs) at 7q11.23 cause Williams-Beuren (WBS) and 7q microduplication syndromes (7Dup), two neurodevelopmental disorders with shared and opposite cognitive-behavioral phenotypes. Using patient-derived and isogenic neurons, we integrated transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of this dosage effect. We found that 7q11.23 CNVs cause opposite alterations in neuronal differentiation and excitability. Genes related to neuronal transmission chiefly followed 7q11.23 dosage and appeared transcriptionally controlled, while translation and ribosomal protein genes followed the opposite trend and were post-transcriptionally buffered. Mechanistically, we uncovered REST regulon as a key mediator of observed phenotypes and rescued transcriptional and excitability alterations through REST inhibition. We identified downregulation of global protein synthesis, mGLUR5 and ERK-mTOR pathways activity in steady-state in both WBS and 7Dup, whereas BDNF stimulation rescued them specifically in 7Dup. Overall, we show that 7q11.23 CNVs alter protein synthesis and neuronal firing-established molecular and cellular phenotypes of neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<p>Background: Despite promising results, the role of intra-arrest hypothermia in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of trans-nasal evaporative cooling (TNEC) during resuscitation on neurological recovery in OHCA patients admitted alive to the hospital. Methods: A post hoc analysis of the PRINCESS trial, including only patients admitted alive to the hospital, either assigned to TNEC or standard of care during resuscitation. The primary endpoint was favorable neurological outcome (FO) defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 at 90 days. The secondary outcomes were overall survival at 90 days and CPC 1 at 90 days. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the initial cardiac rhythm. Results: A total of 149 patients in the TNEC and 142 in the control group were included. The number of patients with CPC 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 at 90 days was 56/149 (37.6%) in the intervention group and 45/142 (31.7%) in the control group (p = 0.29). Survival and CPC 1 at 90 days was observed in 60/149 patients (40.3%) vs. 52/142 (36.6%; p = 0.09) and 50/149 (33.6%) vs. 35/142 (24.6%; p = 0.11) in the two groups. In the subgroup of patients with an initial shockable rhythm, the number of patients with CPC 1 at 90 days was 45/83 (54.2%) in the intervention group and 27/78 (34.6%) in the control group (p = 0.01). Conclusions: In this post hoc analysis of admitted OHCA patients, no statistically significant benefits of TNEC on neurological outcome at 90 days was found. In patients with initial shockable rhythm, TNEC was associated with increased full neurological recovery.</p>

	<p>Background: Although chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) has been known for over several hundred years, the etiology and pathogenesis of it are still not completely understood. Neurosurgical procedures resulting in CSDH are a rare clinical complication, and there was no report about how subdural effusion (SDE) evolves into CSDH after deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The formation mechanism of CSDH after surgery, especially in DBS surgery, and the effect of recovery, need to be explored. Methods: We present two cases, complicated with SDE after DBS surgery, serious dysfunction complications such as hemiplegia and aphasia occurred on the postoperative day 36 and 49 individually, and images showed CSDH. Fusion image showed the bilateral electrodes were significantly shifted. Then, they were performed to drill craniotomy with a closed system drainage. Result: The symptoms of hemiplegia and aphasia caused by CSDH were completely recovered, and the follow-up images showed CSDH was disappeared. However, DBS stimulation is poorly effective, it cannot reach the preoperative level, especially in the ipsilateral side of CSDH. Conclusions: The iatrogenic SDE that evolved into CSDH in the present two cases shows that SDE is one of the causes of CSDH. Patients develop SDE after DBS, which increases the risk of developing CSDH. CSDH after DBS can be successfully treated. however, the postoperative efficacy of DBS will decline.</p>

                To what extent do speech and music processing rely on domain-specific and domain-general neural networks? Adopting a dynamical system framework, we investigate the presence of frequency-specific and network-level selectivity and combine it with a statistical approach in which a clear distinction is made between shared, preferred, and category-selective neural responses. Using intracranial EEG recordings in 18 epilepsy patients listening to natural and continuous speech and music, we show that the majority of focal and network-level neural activity is shared between speech and music processing. Our data also reveal an absence of regional selectivity. Instead, neural selectivity is restricted to distributed and frequency-specific coherent oscillations, typical of spectral fingerprints. Our work addresses a longstanding debate and redefines an epistemological posture on how to map cognitive and brain functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effects of biological sex on estimates of persistent inward currents in the human lower limb</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive recordings of motor unit (MU) spike trains help us understand how neural drive is modulated by various motor commands and/or physiological conditions. The majority of study participants in human and non-human animal physiology studies are male, and it is assumed mechanisms uncovered in these studies are shared between males and females. However, sex differences in neurological impairment and physical performance warrant the study of sex as a biological variable in human physiology and performance. To begin addressing this gap in the study of biophysical properties of human motoneurons, we quantified MU discharge rates and estimates of persistent inward current (PIC) magnitude in both sexes by quantifying {Delta}F. We decomposed MU spike trains from the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and soleus (SOL) using high-density surface electromyography and blind source separation algorithms. Ten participants of each sex performed slow triangular (10s up and down) isometric contractions to a peak of 30% of their maximum voluntary contraction. We then used linear mixed effects models to determine if peak discharge rate and {Delta}F were predicted by the fixed effects of sex, muscle, and their interaction. Despite similar peak discharge rates across all muscles, {Delta}F was larger ({chi}2(1) = 6.26, p = 0.012) in females (4.73 [0.242 pps]) than males (3.81 [0.240 pps]). These findings suggest that neuromodulatory drive and/or biophysical properties of motoneurons differ between the sexes and may contribute to differences in MU discharge patterns.

                Epileptic seizure is typically characterized by highly synchronized episodes of neural activity. Existing stimulation therapies focus purely on suppressing the pathologically synchronized neuronal firing patterns during the ictal (seizure) period. While these strategies are effective in suppressing seizures when they occur, they fail to prevent the re-emergence of seizures once the stimulation is turned off. Previously, we developed a novel neurostimulation motif, which we refer to as "Forced Temporal Spike-Time Stimulation" (FTSTS) [1] that has shown remarkable promise in long-lasting desynchronization of excessively synchronized neuronal firing patterns by harnessing synaptic plasticity. In this paper, we build upon this prior work [1] by optimizing the parameters of the FTSTS protocol in order to efficiently desynchronize the pathologically synchronous neuronal firing patterns that occur during epileptic seizures using a recently published computational model of neocortical-onset seizures [2]. We show that the FTSTS protocol applied during the ictal period can modify the excitatory-to inhibitory synaptic weight in order to effectively desynchronize the pathological neuronal firing patterns even after the ictal period. Our investigation opens the door to a possible new neurostimulation therapy for epilepsy.

                Glaucoma is an age-related neurodegenerative disease of the visual system, affecting both the eye and the brain. Yet its underlying metabolic mechanisms and neurobehavioral relevance remain largely unclear. Here, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems in the visual cortex of glaucoma patients, as well as neural specificity, which is shaped by GABA and glutamate signals and underlies efficient sensory and cognitive functions. Our study showed that among the older adults, both GABA and glutamate levels decrease with increasing glaucoma severity regardless of age. Further, the reduction of GABA but not glutamate predicted the neural specificity. This association was independent of the impairments on the retina structure and age. Our results suggest that glaucoma-specific decline of GABA undermines neural specificity in the visual cortex and that targeting GABA could improve the neural specificity in glaucoma.

                Resilience to Alzheimer's disease (RAD) is an uncommon combination of high disease burden without dementia that may provide critical insights into limiting the clinical impact of this incurable disease. In this study, we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify regional protein differences that characterize RAD. Starting with over 700 brain donations, we identified 43 extensively annotated research participants who met stringent inclusion exclusion criteria and analyzed matched isocortical regions, hippocampus, and caudate nucleus. Differential expression analysis of 7,115 soluble proteins identified lower isocortical and hippocampal soluble A{beta}; peptide levels as a significant feature of RAD. Protein co-expression analysis revealed a group of 181 densely-interacting proteins significantly associated with RAD that were enriched for actin filament-based process, cellular detoxification, and wound healing in isocortex and hippocampus. We further support our findings using data from 689 human isocortical samples from four independent external cohorts that were the closest approximations of our clinico-pathologic groups. The molecular basis of RAD, a widely replicated state in older adults for which there is no experimental model, likely holds important insights into therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Domino-like Effect of C112R Mutation on APOE4 Aggregation and Its Suppression by Alzheimer's Disease Drug Candidate</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein 4 (APOE) {epsilon}4 genotype is the most prevalent risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Although APOE4 differs from its non-pathological APOE3 isoform only by the C112R mutation, the mechanism of its proteinopathy is poorly understood. Here, we combine experimental and computational techniques to uncover a domino-like effect of C112R mutation on APOE4 behavior. We found that C112R substitution in APOE4 induces long-distance (>15 [A]) conformational changes leading to the formation of a T-shaped dimeric unit that is geometrically different and more aggregation-prone than the APOE3 structure. AD drug candidate tramiprosate and its metabolite 3-sulfopropanoic acid induce APOE3-like conformational behavior in APOE4 and suppress its aggregation propensity. Analysis of APOE {varepsilon}4/{varepsilon}4 cerebral organoids treated with tramiprosate revealed its effect on cholesteryl esters, the storage products of excess cholesterol. Overall, our results connect the APOE4 structure with its aggregation propensity, providing a new druggable target for neurodegeneration and ageing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Longitudinal investigation of changes in resting-state co-activation patterns and their predictive ability in the zQ175 DN mouse model of Huntington's disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded ([&ge;]40) glutamine-encoding CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene, which leads to dysfunction and death of predominantly striatal and cortical neurons. While the genetic profile and behavioural signs of the disease are better known, changes in the functional architecture of the brain, especially before the behavioural signs become apparent, are not fully and consistently characterized. In this study, we sought markers at pre, early and late manifest states of phenotypic progression in the heterozygous (HET) zQ175 delta-neo (DN) mouse model, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). This mouse model shows molecular, cellular, and circuitry alterations that resemble those seen in HD in humans. Specifically, we investigated, longitudinally, changes in co-activation patterns (CAPs) that are the transient states of brain activity constituting the resting-state networks (RSNs). Most robust changes in the temporal properties of CAPs occurred at the late manifest state; the durations of two anti-correlated CAPs, characterized by simultaneous co-activation of the default-mode-like network (DMLN) and co-deactivation of the lateral-cortical network (LCN) and vice-versa, were reduced in the zQ175 DN HET animals compared to the wild-type mice. Changes in the spatial properties, measured in terms of activation levels of different brain regions, during CAPs were found at all three states and became progressively more pronounced at the manifest states. We then assessed the cross-validated predictive power of CAP metrics to distinguish HET animals from controls. Spatial properties of CAPs performed significantly better than the chance level at all three states with 80% classification accuracy at the early and late manifest states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">1H-MRS characterization of metabolic changes induced by photoperiod in the sheep brain: a promising eye into in-vivo adult neurogenesis?</a></h4>

              
                The hypothalamus is a central structure of the mammalian brain, which controls physiological, endocrine and metabolic brain homeostasis. Despite this essential role, little is known about the normal and altered neurochemical changes occurring within the hypothalamic structures. Here, the metabolism of the hypothalamus of ewes was investigated at 3T using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). We used the sensitivity of these animals to photoperiod i.e. the ratio of day to night length, to investigate the hypothalamic metabolic changes and their relationship to hypothalamic adult neurogenesis. A longitudinal study involving 4 ewes per timepoint was conducted at 4 time points (P01, P02, P03 and P04) during long days (LD) and 4 time points during short days (SD). Significant metabolic changes were found between LD and SD at all time points in particular for glutamate (Glu), glutamine, myo-inositol and total N-acetyl-Aspartate (NAA). During SD, glutamate and glutamine concentrations were significantly smaller at P01 compared to all other time points while significant neurochemical changes occurred during the entire LD period. Neurochemical changes relative to P01 remained stable during LD and SD except for Glu and Gln which increased between P01 and P02 during SD. Relative metabolic changes were significantly higher on average for NAA and Glu and significantly smaller on average for total choline during SD compared to LD, respectively, paralleling the average changes in the numbers of neural stem cells and glial and oligodendrocyte progenitors found by immunohistochemistry. Despite important differences between MRS and immunohistochemistry in terms of spatial resolution, both techniques suggest complementary findings that should contribute to a better characterization of the hypothalamus during photoperiodism and adult neurogenesis. We conclude that 1H-MRS could be a promising non-invasive translational technique to investigate the existence of adult neurogenesis in-vivo in gyrencephalic

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Entorhinal grid-like codes and time-locked network dynamics track others navigating through space</a></h4>

              
                Navigating through crowded, dynamically changing social environments requires the ability to keep track of other individuals. Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are a central component of self-related navigation but whether they also track others' movement is unclear. Here, we propose that entorhinal grid-like codes make an essential contribution to socio-spatial navigation. Sixty human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while observing and re-tracing different paths of a demonstrator that navigated a virtual reality environment. Results revealed that grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex tracked the other individual navigating through space. Further, the activity of grid-like codes was time-locked to increases in co-activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity that included the striatum, the hippocampus, parahippocampal and right posterior parietal cortices, altogether modulated by accuracy when subsequently re-tracing the paths. This suggests that network dynamics time-locked to entorhinal grid-cell-related activity might serve to distribute information about the "socio-spatial map" throughout the brain.

	<p>Psychiatric disorders are a class of complex disorders characterized by brain dysfunction with varying degrees of impairment in cognition, emotion, consciousness and behavior, which has become a serious public health issue. The NGFR gene encodes the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which regulates neuronal growth, survival and plasticity, and was reported to be associated with depression, schizophrenia and antidepressant efficacy in human patient and animal studies. In this study, we investigated its association with schizophrenia and major depression and its role in the behavioral phenotype of adult mice. Four NGFR SNPs were detected based on a study among 1010 schizophrenia patients, 610 patients with major depressive disorders (MDD) and 1034 normal controls, respectively. We then knocked down the expression of NGFR protein in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of the mouse brain by injection of shRNA lentivirus to further investigate its behavioral effect in mice. We found significant associations of s2072446 and rs11466162 for schizophrenia. Ngfr knockdown mice showed social and behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that it is linked to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. We found significant associations between NGFR and schizophrenia and that Ngfr may contribute to the social behavior of adult mice in the functional study, which provided meaningful clues to the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.</p>

	<p>Shooting is a sport dominated by psychological factors. Hence, disturbing the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s sensory function during aiming will seriously affect his psychological state and shooting performance. Electroencephalograph (EEG) measurements of 30 skilled marksmen in the shooting preparation stage under noisy disturbance, weak light, and normal conditions were recorded. Therefore, the differences in neural mechanisms in the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain during shooting aiming in different disturbance conditions were explored using an analytical approach that employs functional connectivity and brain network analysis based on graph theory. The relationship between these brain network characteristics and shooting performance was also compared. The results showed that (1) the average connection strength in the beta frequency band and connection intensity in the left and right temporal lobes of the shooters under noise disturbance were significantly higher than those under the other two conditions, and their brain networks also showed a higher global and local efficiency. In addition, (2) the functional connection intensity in the occipital region of the beta band was higher than that in the normal condition in the weak-light condition. The information interaction in the left parietal region also increased continually during the shooting process. (3) Furthermore, the shooters&amp;amp;rsquo; eigenvector centrality in the temporal and occipital regions with limited sensory function in the two conditions was lower than those in the normal condition. These findings suggest that noise disturbance activates the arousal level of the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain and enhances the information processing efficiency of the brain network; however, it increases the mental workload. In weak-light conditions, shooters focus more on visual information processing during aiming and strengthen the inhibition of functions in the brain regions unrelated to shooting behavior. Audiovisual disturbance renders the cortical regions equivalent to the audiovisual perception function in the shooter&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain less important in the entire brain network than in the normal condition. Therefore, these findings reveal the effect of audiovisual disturbance on the functional network of the cortex in the shooting preparation stage and provide a theoretical basis for further understanding the neural mechanism of the shooting process under sensory disturbances.</p>

	<p>Postoperative delirium (POD) is a complication characterized by disturbances in attention, awareness, and cognitive function that occur shortly after surgery or emergence from anesthesia. Since it occurs prevalently in neurosurgical patients and poses great threats to the well-being of patients, much emphasis is placed on POD in neurosurgical units. However, there are intricate theories about its pathogenesis and limited pharmacological interventions for POD. In this study, we review the recent insights into its pathogenesis, mainly based on studies within five years, and the five dominant pathological theories that account for the development of POD, with the intention of furthering our understanding and boosting its clinical management.</p>

	<p>Background: Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s dementia (AD) is a degenerative disease that impairs cognitive function, initially, and then motor or other function, eventually. Motor coordination function impairment usually accompanies cognition impairment but it is seldom examined whether it can reflect the clinical outcomes of AD. Methods: 113 clinically diagnosed AD patients with a mean age of 78.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.9 years underwent an annual neuropsychological assessment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), the Sum of Boxes of Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-SB), and the CDR. The cerebral coordination function was evaluated through correlations among 15 joints with a kinetic depth sensor annually. An intra-individual comparison of both cognitive and motor coordination functions was performed to examine their correlations. Results: The changes in coordination function in the lower limbs can significantly reflect the clinical outcomes, MMSE (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), CASI (p = 0.006), CDR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and CDR-SB (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), but the changes in upper limbs can only reflect the clinical outcome in CDR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The use of a kinetic depth sensor to determine the coordination between joints, especially in lower limbs, can significantly reflect the global functional and cognitive outcomes in AD. Such evaluations could be another biomarker used to evaluate non-cognitive outcomes in AD for clinical and research purposes.</p>

	<p>This study aims to investigate distractibility quantified by recording and analyzing eye movements during task-irrelevant distraction in children with and without ADHD and in children with and without neurological disorders. Gaze behavior data and press latencies of 141 participants aged 6&amp;amp;ndash;17 that were collected during a computerized distraction paradigm with task-irrelevant stimuli (IDistrack) were analyzed. Children using attention-regulating medication were excluded from participation. Data were analyzed for subgroups that were formed based on the presence of neurological disorders and the presence of ADHD separately. Participants with ADHD and participants with neurological disorders spent less time fixating on the target stimuli compared to their peers without ADHD (p = 0.025) or their peers without neurological disorders (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Participants with and without ADHD had equal press latencies (p = 0.79). Participants with neurological disorders had a greater press latency compared to their typically developing peers (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Target fixation duration shows a significant association with parent-reported attention problems (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.39, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). We conclude that eye tracking during a distraction task reveals potentially valid clinical information that may contribute to the assessment of dysfunctional attentional processes. Further research on the validity and reliability of this paradigm is recommended.</p>

	<p>Abstract: Multisensory integration refers to sensory inputs from different sensory modalities being processed simultaneously to produce a unitary output. Surrounded by stimuli from multiple modalities, animals utilize multisensory integration to form a coherent and robust representation of the complex environment. Even though multisensory integration is fundamentally essential for animal life, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms, especially at the molecular, synaptic and circuit levels, remains poorly understood. The study of sensory perception in Caenorhabditis elegans has begun to fill this gap. We have gained a considerable amount of insight into the general principles of sensory neurobiology owing to C. elegans&amp;amp;rsquo; highly sensitive perceptions, relatively simple nervous system, ample genetic tools and completely mapped neural connectome. Many interesting paradigms of multisensory integration have been characterized in C. elegans, for which input convergence occurs at the sensory neuron or the interneuron level. In this narrative review, we describe some representative cases of multisensory integration in C. elegans, summarize the underlying mechanisms and compare them with those in mammalian systems. Despite the differences, we believe C. elegans is able to provide unique insights into how processing and integrating multisensory inputs can generate flexible and adaptive behaviors. With the emergence of whole brain imaging, the ability of C. elegans to monitor nearly the entire nervous system may be crucial for understanding the function of the brain as a whole.</p>

	<p>The present work is a replication article based on the paper &amp;amp;ldquo;Are there shared neural correlates between dyslexia and ADHD? A meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies&amp;amp;rdquo; by McGrath and Stoodley (2019). In the original research, the authors used activation likelihood estimation (ALE), a technique to perform coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA), to investigate the existence of brain regions undergoing gray matter alteration in association with both attention-deficit/hyper-activity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia. Here, the same voxel-based morphometry dataset was analyzed, while using the permutation-subject images version of signed differential mapping (PSI-SDM) in place of ALE. Overall, the replication converged with the original paper in showing a limited overlap between the two conditions. In particular, no significant effect was found for dyslexia, therefore precluding any form of comparison between the two disorders. The possible influences of biological sex, age, and medication status were also ruled out. Our findings are in line with literature about gray matter alteration associated with ADHD and dyslexia, often showing conflicting results. Therefore, although neuropsychological and clinical evidence suggest some convergence between ADHD and dyslexia, more future research is sorely needed to reach a consensus on the neuroimaging domain in terms of patterns of gray matter alteration.</p>

	<p>Proper brain development requires the precise coordination and orchestration of various molecular and cellular processes and dysregulation of these processes can lead to neurological diseases. In the past decades, post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression has been shown to contribute to various aspects of brain development and function in the central nervous system. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short non-coding RNAs, are emerging as crucial players in post-transcriptional gene regulation in a variety of tissues, such as the nervous system. In recent years, miRNAs have been implicated in multiple aspects of brain development, including neurogenesis, migration, axon and dendrite formation, and synaptogenesis. Moreover, altered expression and dysregulation of miRNAs have been linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging technology to obtain high-quality, detailed structural and functional information from the brains of human and animal models in a non-invasive manner. Because the spatial expression patterns of miRNAs in the brain, unlike those of DNA and RNA, remain largely unknown, a whole-brain imaging approach using MRI may be useful in revealing biological and pathological information about the brain affected by miRNAs. In this review, we highlight recent advancements in the research of miRNA-mediated modulation of neuronal processes that are important for brain development and their involvement in disease pathogenesis. Also, we overview each MRI technique, and its technological considerations, and discuss the applications of MRI techniques in miRNA research. This review aims to link miRNA biological study with MRI analytical technology and deepen our understanding of how miRNAs impact brain development and pathology of neurological diseases.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability. Effective early treatments with reasonable therapeutic windows remain critically important to improve the outcomes of stroke. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an established noninvasive technique that has been applied clinically and in animal research for multiple brain disorders, but few studies have examined acute neuroprotection against ischemic stroke. The present investigation tested the novel approach of low-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) as an acute treatment after ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Adult male rats received focal ischemic surgery through occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 60 minutes. The rats received either rTMS or sham treatment with 1.5-, 3-, 4-, or 7-hour delay after the onset of stroke. Low-frequency and low-intensity rTMS was applied to the rat brain for two 30-minute episodes separated by a 1-hour interval.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three days after stroke, compared to stroke controls, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5-hour delay showed a 35% reduction of infarct volume. Protective effects were also seen with 3- or 4-hour-delayed treatments by rTMS, shown as reduced infarct volume and cell death. rTMS treatment upregulated the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 and downregulated the proapoptotic caspase-3 cleavage, expressions of Bax and matrix metallopeptidase-9. In sensorimotor functional assessments 3 to 21 days after stroke, rats receiving rTMS treatment with a 1.5- or 3-hour delay showed significantly better performance compared to stroke controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support the inference that low-frequency rTMS may be feasible as a neuroprotective acute treatment after ischemic stroke. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Ablation of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Pantr2 re- sults in microcephaly in a knockout murine model of cor- ticogenesis, however, the precise mechanisms used are un- known. We present evidence that Pantr2 is a trans-acting lncRNA that regulates gene expression and chromatin ac- cessibility both in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrate that ec- topic expression of Pantr2 in a neuroblastoma cell line alters gene expression under differentiating conditions, and that both loss and gain of function of Pantr2 results in changes to cell-cycle dynamics. We show that expression of both the transcription factor Nfix and the cell cycle regulator Rgcc are negatively regulated by Pantr2. Using RNA binding pro- tein motif analysis and existing CLIP-seq data, we annotate potential HuR and QKI binding sites on Pantr2, and demon- strate that HuR does not directly bind Pantr2 using RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, we identify disruption of both Notch and Wnt signaling following loss of Pantr2 expression, indi- cating potential Pantr2-dependent regulation of these path- ways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noninvasive, automated and reliable detection of spreading depolarizations in severe traumatic brain injury using scalp EEG</a></h4>

              
                Background: Noninvasive detection of spreading depolarizations (SD), as a potentially treatable mechanism of worsening brain injuries after traumatic brain injuries (TBI), has remained elusive. Current methods to detect SDs are based on intracranial recording, an invasive method with limited spatial coverage. Less invasive methods to diagnose SD are needed to improve generalizability and application of this emerging science and to guide worsening brain injury treatments. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, a signal processing paradigm that can enable automated detection of SDs using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: Building on our previously developed WAVEFRONT algorithm, we have designed a novel automated SD detection method. This algorithm, with learnable parameters and improved velocity estimation, extracts and tracks propagating power depressions, as well as near-DC shifts using low-density EEG. This modified WAVEFRONT is robust to the amplitude outliers and non-propagating depressions on the scalp. We show the feasibility of detecting SD events (700 total SDs) in continuous, low-density scalp EEG recording (95{+/-}42.2 hours with 19 electrodes) acquired from 12 severe TBI patients who underwent decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) and intracranial EEG that could be used as a ground truth for event detection. We quantify the performance of WAVEFRONT in terms of SD detection accuracy, including true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), as well as the accuracy of estimating the frequency of SDs. Results: WAVEFRONT achieves the best average validation accuracy of 74% TPR (with 95% confidence interval of 70.8%-76.7%), with less than 1.5% FPR using Delta band EEG. Preliminary evidence suggests that WAVEFRONT can achieve a very good performance (regression with R2 [~=] 0.71) in the estimation of SD frequencies. Conclusions: We demonstrate feasibility and quantify the performance of noninvasive SD detection after severe TBI using an automated algorithm. WAVEFRONT can potentially be used for diagnosis and monitoring of worsening brain injuries to guide treatments by providing a measure of SD frequency. Extension of these results to patients with intact skulls requires further study.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficiency of heterogenous functional connectomes explains variance in callous-unemotional traits after computational lesioning of cortical midline and salience regions</a></h4>

              
                Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are a youth antisocial phenotype hypothesized to be a result of differences in the integration of multiple brain systems. However, mechanistic insights into these brain systems are a continued challenge. Where prior work describes activation and connectivity of the connectome in relation to these systems, new mechanistic insights can be derived by removing nodes and characterizing changes in network properties (hereafter referred to as computational lesioning) to characterize the resilience and vulnerability of the brains functional connectome. Here, we study the resilience of connectome integration in CU traits by estimating changes in efficiency after computationally lesioning individual-level connectomes. From resting-state data of 86 participants (48% female, age: mean= 14.52, SD= 1.31) drawn from the Nathan Kline institutes Rockland study, individual-level connectomes were estimated using graphical lasso. Computational lesioning was conducted both sequentially and by targeting global and local hubs. We calculated changes in network efficiency after each lesion. Then, elastic net regression was applied to determine how these changes explained variance in CU traits. Follow-up analyses characterized modeled node hubs, examined moderation, determined impact of targeting, and decoded the brain mask by comparing regions to meta-analytic maps. Elastic net regression revealed that computational lesioning of 23 nodes, network modularity, and Tanner stage explained variance in CU traits. Hub assignment of selected hubs differed at higher CU traits. No evidence for moderation between simulated lesioning and CU traits was found. Targeting global hubs increased efficiency and targeting local hubs had no effect at higher CU traits. Identified brain mask meta-analytically associated with more emotion and cognitive terms. Although reliable patterns were found across participants, adolescent brains were heterogeneous even for those with a similar CU traits score. Adolescent brain response to simulated lesioning revealed a pattern of connectome resiliency and vulnerability that explains variance in CU traits, which can aid prediction of youth at greater risk for higher CU traits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Too Much Information Is No Information: How Machine Learning and Feature Selection Could Help in Understanding the Motor Control of Pointing</a></h4>

              
                The aim of this study was to develop the use of Machine Learning techniques as a means of multivariate analysis in studies of motor control. These studies generate a huge amount of data, the analysis of which continues to be largely univariate. We propose the use of machine learning classification and feature selection as a means of uncovering feature combinations that are altered between conditions. High dimensional electromyograms (EMG) vectors were generated as several arm and trunk muscles were recorded while subjects pointed at various angles above and below the gravity neutral horizontal plane. We used Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to carry out binary classifications between the EMG vectors for pointing at a particular angle, versus pointing at the gravity neutral direction. Classification success provided a composite index of muscular adjustments for various task constraints (in this case, pointing angles). In order to find the combination of features that were significantly altered between task conditions, we conducted a post classification feature selection i.e. investigated which combination of features had allowed for the classification. Feature selection was done by comparing the representations of each category created by LDA for the classification. In other words computing the difference between the representations of each class. We propose that this approach will help with comparing high dimensional EMG patterns in two ways; i) quantifying the effects of the entire pattern rather than using single arbitrarily defined variables and ii) identifying the parts of the patterns that convey the most information regarding the investigated effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tight control of the APP-Mint1 interaction in regulating amyloid production</a></h4>

              
                Generation of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides through the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is one pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP is a type I transmembrane protein and endocytosis of APP mediated by the endocytic YENPTY sequence is a key step in A{beta} generation. We and others have found that Mints, a family of cytosolic adaptor proteins, directly binds to the YENPTY motif of APP via phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of Mints, facilitates APP trafficking and processing. We also show mutation of Tyr633 of Mint1 (Mint1Y633A) enhances APP binding and processing. Now, we created a low-affinity Mint1 mutant that targets two conserved residues, Tyr549 and Phe610 (Mint1Y549A/F610A), that reduced APP binding. Here, we investigate how perturbing the APP-Mint1 interaction alters APP and Mint1 cellular dynamics as well as Mint1's interaction with its other binding partners. We show that Mint1Y633A increased binding affinity specifically for APP and presenilin1, enhanced APP endocytosis, and A{beta} secretion in primary neurons. Conversely, Mint1Y549A/F610A exhibited reduced APP affinity and A{beta} secretion. In fact, the effect of Mint1Y549A/F610A on A{beta} release was greater compared to knocking down all three Mint proteins, supporting targeting APP-Mint1 interaction as a potential AD therapeutic.

	<p>Aiming to examine whether specific motor signs are associated with worse performance in specific cognitive domains among cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the baseline evaluations of older, CU participants from the National Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set. In total, 8149 CU (&amp;amp;ge;60 years) participants were included. Of these, 905 individuals scored &amp;amp;ge; 2 on at least one of the motor domains of the Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRSIII). Cognitively impaired individuals, participants with psychiatric disorders and/or under treatment with antipsychotic, anxiolytic, sedative or hypnotic agents were excluded. Nine motor signs were examined: hypophonia, masked facies, resting tremor, action/postural tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, impaired chair rise, impaired posture/gait and postural instability. Their association with performance on episodic memory, semantic memory, language, attention, processing speed or executive function was assessed using crude and adjusted linear regression models. Individuals with impaired chair rise had worse episodic memory, semantic memory, processing speed and executive function, while those with bradykinesia had worse language, processing speed and executive function. Sensitivity analyses, by excluding participants with cerebrovascular disease or PD, or other Parkinsonism, produced similar results with the exception of the relationship between bradykinesia and language performance.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive impairment and the presence of amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; (A&amp;amp;beta;) plaques and tau tangles. This study was conducted to assess the effects of white button mushroom (WBM) supplementation on spatial memory and plaque formation in mice with mutations in amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;). Mice with amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) mutations and their wildtype (WT) littermates were fed a 10% white button mushroom (WBM) feed ad libitum three times per week, in addition to their normal diet. Morris water maze (MWM) was conducted at 14 and 32 weeks of age to assess spatial memory and A&amp;amp;beta; plaque pathology in the hippocampus was analyzed. Our results showed that hAPP mice on the WBM diet were faster in reaching the platform in the MWM compared to hAPP mice on the control diet at 32 weeks (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Significantly fewer plaque deposits were found in the hippocampi of hAPP mice on the WBM diet compared to those on the control diet at 32 weeks (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Overall, hAPP mice on the WBM diet had improved spatial memory at 32 weeks of age compared to those on the control diet and exhibited fewer amyloid plaques.</p>

	<p>A better understanding of biological and emotional variables associated with health-related quality of life in people with long-COVID is needed. Our aim was to identify potential direct and indirect effects on the relationships between sensitization-associated symptoms, mood disorders such as anxiety/depressive levels, and sleep quality on health-related quality of life in people suffering from post-COVID-19 pain. One hundred and forty-six individuals who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic and suffering from long-term post-COVID-19 pain completed different patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including clinical features, symptoms associated with sensitization of the central nervous system (Central Sensitization Inventory), mood disorders (Hospital Anxiety and Depressive Scale), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and health-related quality of life (paper-based five-level version of EuroQol-5D) in a face-to-face interview conducted at 18.8 (SD 1.8) months after hospitalization. Different mediation models were conducted to assess the direct and indirect effects of the associations among the different variables. The mediation models revealed that sensitization-associated symptoms and depressive levels directly affected health-related quality of life; however, these effects were not statistically significant when sleep quality was included. In fact, the effect of sensitization-associated symptomatology on quality of life (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.10, 95% CI &amp;amp;minus;0.1736, &amp;amp;minus;0.0373), the effect of depressive levels on quality of life (&amp;amp;beta;= &amp;amp;minus;0.09, 95% CI &amp;amp;minus;0.1789, &amp;amp;minus;0.0314), and the effect of anxiety levels on quality of life (&amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.09, 95% CI &amp;amp;minus;0.1648, &amp;amp;minus;0.0337) were all indirectly mediated by sleep quality. This study revealed that sleep quality mediates the relationship between sensitization-associated symptoms and mood disorders (depressive/anxiety levels) with health-related quality of life in individuals who were hospitalized with COVID-19 at the first wave of the pandemic and reporting post-COVID-19 pain. Longitudinal studies will help to determine the clinical implications of these findings.</p>

	<p>(1) Aim: We aim to evaluate the association between arousals during sleep and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis detected by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). (2) Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. Consecutive newly diagnosed OSA patients, who underwent coronary CTA examinations within 3 months of the sleep study, were eligible. We used the arousal index (ArI) derived from polysomnography to assess arousals during sleep and a semi-automated plaque quantification software to characterize and quantify the subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Multiple regression models were used to evaluate the associations of the ArI with the coronary atherosclerotic plaque presence, volume, and composition. (3) Results: A total of 99 patients with OSA were included in the study. In the multivariable models, patients with a high ArI (ArI &amp;amp;gt; 32.2 events/h) were more likely to have coronary plaques compared to those with a low ArI (ArI &amp;amp;le; 32.2 events/h) (OR: 3.29 [95% CI: 1.284 to 8.427], p = 0.013). Furthermore, the ArI exhibited significant associations with total (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.015), noncalcified (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.015), and low-attenuation (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.012) coronary plaque volume after accounting for established risk factors (p = 0.008, 0.004, and 0.002, respectively). However, no association between the ArI and calcified plaque volume was found. (4) Conclusion: Repetitive arousals during sleep are associated with an increased coronary plaque burden in patients with OSA, which remained robust after adjusting for multiple established cardiovascular risk factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Paradigm shift in medical education due to the COVID-19 pandemic: guidelines for developing a blended learning curriculum in medical education [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the world’s economy, health and education in a blink of an eye. Almost 1 billion learners have been affected across the globe. This has resulted in a paradigm shift to blended learning. Therefore, it was felt necessary to provide practical guidelines for the development of blended curriculum in medical education. It would help to overcome the challenges faced due to unprecedented transformation of medical education on account of pandemic. Methods: Guidelines based on personal experience of the authors and literature search were developed using the complex adapted blended learning system (CALBS) framework. Seven experts developed these guidelines using the nominal group technique. The consent form and literature for CABLS framework was shared with experts. The experts developed the guidelines independently during phase one of the technique. After a given time, phase 2 started with moderator mediated discussion about the individual guidelines developed by the experts. After discussion and mutual consensus four types of guideline ideas were developed. During the third phase the experts ranked the guideline ideas on a scale of 1 to 5. The guideline idea that ranked highest was selected as a final guideline for developing a blended learning curriculum. Results: The group consensus resulted in developing seven guidelines for a blended course or curriculum in medical education. These guidelines are based on a conceptual framework supplemented by expert’s own personal experience and current evidence from literature. Conclusions: These guidelines would provide a comprehensive and systematic approach to develop a blended learning curriculum in medical education.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sex-related differences in symptom presentation of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In patients with myocardial infarction, atypical symptoms at onset have been demonstrated in women. We aimed to investigate the presence of sex-related differences in symptom presentation in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) to enable earlier diagnosis and treatment. Methods: We assessed symptoms on admission to hospital in 343 patients with aSAH in this retrospective single-center cohort-study. Univariate statistical analysis was performed by comparing sexes including the whole study population and subgroups (dichotomized using Fisher scale 1-2 vs. 3-4, WFNS grade 1-3 vs. 4-5, and anterior vs. posterior circulation aneurysms, respectively). Results: The majority of patients was female (63.6%, n=218, vs. 36.4%, n=125), the mean age 57.4 years (standard deviation (SD) 13.3) with older women compared to men (59.2, SD 13.8, vs. 54.4, SD 11.6; p=0.003). Anterior communicating artery (AcomA) aneurysms were most common (30.9%, n=106), predominantly in men (43.2%, n=54, vs. 23.9%, n=52; p=0.0002), whereas posterior communicating artery (PcomA) aneurysms were more frequent in women (19.3%, n=42, vs. 8.8%, n=11; p=0.005). Exercise-induced headache was more often reported by men (10.4%, n=13, vs. 5%, n=11; p=0.04) in all patients as well as in the subgroup of WFNS 1-3. Anisocoria was more frequent in women within the subgroup of severely impaired consciousness (WFNS 4-5; 25.3%, n=22, vs. 10.7%, n=6; p=0.032). For all other symptoms, there was no evidence for sex-specific differences in the whole study group as well as in subgroups. Conclusion: Our results show no evidence for relevant sex-related differences in symptom presentation at onset in aSAH patients. Women presenting with an acute onset anisocoria should be screened even more carefully for an underlying ruptured Pcom aneurysm.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Aspergillus oryzae attenuates quorum sensing -associated virulence factors and biofilm formation in Klebsiella pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae communicate between and among species using quorum sensing (QS). Biofilm formation and virulence factors are regulated by QS. This QS is indirectly responsible for K. pneumoniae pathogenicity. Inhibiting QS is a novel and highly effective method for controlling K. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (KP-ESBL) infections. This study aimed to investigate how Aspergillus oryzae extracellular protein (AOEP) affected QS and KP-ESBL virulence factors. Methods: Methods used included minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) through the microdilution method, biofilms with crystal violet staining, extracellular polysaccharides using the Congo Red assay, quantifying the expression of genes coding for capsular polysaccharide (wzI gene) and adhesion (mrkA gene) through quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), siderophore level measurement using Chrome Azurol sulphonate assay (CAS assay), biofilm morphology using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and confirmation using the life span killing assay method on Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Results: In vitro studies revealed that AOEP inhibited biofilms and exopolysaccharides (EPS) in KP-ESBL at the sub-MIC level. In addition, AOEP inhibited the expression of the mrkA gene, which is involved in the adhesion process. Furthermore, an in vivo study revealed that AOEP levels of 75 and 150 µg/mL respectively increased C. elegans survival rates by 72.67% and 80.76% against K. pneumoniae infection. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the extracellular protein of A. oryzae may be an effective QS inhibitor and a novel anti-virulence agent to control bacterial pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Viewing the global health system as a complex adaptive system – implications for research and practice [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The global health system (GHS) is ill-equipped to deal with the increasing number of transnational challenges. The GHS needs reform to enhance global resilience to future risks to health. In this article we argue that the starting point for any reform must be conceptualizing and studying the GHS as a complex adaptive system (CAS) with a large and escalating number of interconnected global health actors that learn and adapt their behaviours in response to each other and changes in their environment. The GHS can be viewed as a multi-scalar, nested health system comprising all national health systems together with the global health architecture, in which behaviours are influenced by cross-scale interactions. However, current methods cannot adequately capture the dynamism or complexity of the GHS or quantify the effects of challenges or potential reform options. We provide an overview of a selection of systems thinking and complexity science methods available to researchers and highlight the numerous policy insights their application could yield.   We also discuss the challenges for researchers of applying these methods and for policy makers of digesting and acting upon them. We encourage application of a CAS approach to GHS research and policy making to help bolster resilience to future risks that transcend national boundaries and system scales.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and laser-assisted new attachment procedure for the treatment of alveolar bone loss provoked by an aggressive pyogenic granuloma [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a common benign vascular lesion found in the oral cavity. The gold standard treatment of this lesion, comprising surgical excision and the elimination of etiological factors, cannot avoid tooth loss in the case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Because of the prominent properties of 980 nm and 635 nm diode lasers in photocoagulation and photobiomodulation, we applied these wavelengths in the treatment of a large pyogenic granuloma with alveolar bone loss. Case presentation: Our objective was to use a combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and laser-assisted new attachment procedure (LANAP) to preserve the teeth and periodontal tissue in a case of an aggressive pyogenic granuloma. Results: The patient was a 13-year-old Thai male with a pyogenic granuloma involving the interdental papilla and lingual gingiva of the lower left first and second molars. The teeth were also displaced by the lesion. After treatment with three sessions of photocoagulation, three sessions of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy and two sessions of LANAP, the lesion was completely resolved. The periodontal status of the teeth was improved at the six-month follow-up. Conclusion: The combination of interstitial-intralesional laser therapy, photocoagulation and LANAP was able to treat an aggressive pyogenic granuloma with tooth preservation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Understanding molecular mechanisms and predicting phenotypic effects of pathogenic tubulin mutations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas J. Attard, Julie P. I. Welburn, Joseph A. Marsh</p>

Cells rely heavily on microtubules for several processes, including cell division and molecular trafficking. Mutations in the different tubulin-α and -β proteins that comprise microtubules have been associated with various diseases and are often dominant, sporadic and congenital. While the earliest reported tubulin mutations affect neurodevelopment, mutations are also associated with other disorders such as bleeding disorders and infertility. We performed a systematic survey of tubulin mutations across all isotypes in order to improve our understanding of how they cause disease, and increase our ability to predict their phenotypic effects. Both protein structural analyses and computational variant effect predictors were very limited in their utility for differentiating between pathogenic and benign mutations. This was even worse for those genes associated with non-neurodevelopmental disorders. We selected tubulin-α and -β disease mutations that were most poorly predicted for experimental characterisation. These mutants co-localise to the mitotic spindle in HeLa cells, suggesting they may exert dominant-negative effects by altering microtubule properties. Our results show that tubulin mutations represent a blind spot for current computational approaches, being much more poorly predicted than mutations in most human disease genes. We suggest that this is likely due to their strong association with dominant-negative and gain-of-function mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Rule-based and stimulus-based cues bias auditory decisions via different computational and physiological mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathan Tardiff, Lalitta Suriya-Arunroj, Yale E. Cohen, Joshua I. Gold</p>

Expectations, such as those arising from either learned rules or recent stimulus regularities, can bias subsequent auditory perception in diverse ways. However, it is not well understood if and how these diverse effects depend on the source of the expectations. Further, it is unknown whether different sources of bias use the same or different computational and physiological mechanisms. We examined how rule-based and stimulus-based expectations influenced behavior and pupil-linked arousal, a marker of certain forms of expectation-based processing, of human subjects performing an auditory frequency-discrimination task. Rule-based cues consistently biased choices and response times (RTs) toward the more-probable stimulus. In contrast, stimulus-based cues had a complex combination of effects, including choice and RT biases toward and away from the frequency of recently presented stimuli. These different behavioral patterns also had: 1) distinct computational signatures, including different modulations of key components of a novel form of a drift-diffusion decision model and 2) distinct physiological signatures, including substantial bias-dependent modulations of pupil size in response to rule-based but not stimulus-based cues. These results imply that different sources of expectations can modulate auditory processing via distinct mechanisms: one that uses arousal-linked, rule-based information and another that uses arousal-independent, stimulus-based information to bias the speed and accuracy of auditory perceptual decisions.

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensor which binds and regulates a wide range of target-proteins. This implicitly enables the concentration of calcium to influence many downstream physiological responses, including muscle contraction, learning and depression. The antipsychotic drug trifluoperazine (TFP) is a known CaM inhibitor. By binding to various sites, TFP prevents CaM from associating to target-proteins. However, the molecular and state-dependent mechanisms behind CaM inhibition by drugs such as TFP are largely unknown. Here, we build a Markov state model (MSM) from adaptively sampled molecular dynamics simulations and reveal the structural and dynamical features behind the inhibitory mechanism of TFP-binding to the C-terminal domain of CaM. We specifically identify three major TFP binding-modes from the MSM macrostates, and distinguish their effect on CaM conformation by using a systematic analysis protocol based on biophysical descriptors and tools from machine learning. The results show that depending on the binding orientation, TFP effectively stabilizes features of the calcium-unbound CaM, either affecting the CaM hydrophobic binding pocket, the calcium binding sites or the secondary structure content in the bound domain. The conclusions drawn from this work may in the future serve to formulate a complete model of pharmacological modulation of CaM, which furthers our understanding of how these drugs affect signaling pathways as well as associated diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DLoopCaller: A deep learning approach for predicting genome-wide chromatin loops by integrating accessible chromatin landscapes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Siguo Wang, Qinhu Zhang, Ying He, Zhen Cui, Zhenghao Guo, Kyungsook Han, De-Shuang Huang</p>

In recent years, major advances have been made in various chromosome conformation capture technologies to further satisfy the needs of researchers for high-quality, high-resolution contact interactions. Discriminating the loops from genome-wide contact interactions is crucial for dissecting three-dimensional(3D) genome structure and function. Here, we present a deep learning method to predict genome-wide chromatin loops, called DLoopCaller, by combining accessible chromatin landscapes and raw Hi-C contact maps. Some available orthogonal data ChIA-PET/HiChIP and Capture Hi-C were used to generate positive samples with a wider contact matrix which provides the possibility to find more potential genome-wide chromatin loops. The experimental results demonstrate that DLoopCaller effectively improves the accuracy of predicting genome-wide chromatin loops compared to the state-of-the-art method Peakachu. Moreover, compared to two of most popular loop callers, such as HiCCUPS and Fit-Hi-C, DLoopCaller identifies some unique interactions. We conclude that a combination of chromatin landscapes on the one-dimensional genome contributes to understanding the 3D genome organization, and the identified chromatin loops reveal cell-type specificity and transcription factor motif co-enrichment across different cell lines and species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Prioritizing interventions for preventing COVID-19 outbreaks in military basic training</a></h4>

Like other congregate living settings, military basic training has been subject to outbreaks of COVID-19. We sought to identify improved strategies for preventing outbreaks in this setting using an agent-based model of a hypothetical cohort of trainees on a U.S. Army post. Our analysis revealed unique aspects of basic training that require customized approaches to outbreak prevention, which draws attention to the possibility that customized approaches may be necessary in other settings, too. In particular, we showed that introductions by trainers and support staff may be a major vulnerability, given that those individuals remain at risk of community exposure throughout the training period. We also found that increased testing of trainees upon arrival could actually increase the risk of outbreaks, given the potential for false-positive test results to lead to susceptible individuals becoming infected in group isolation and seeding outbreaks in training units upon release. Until an effective transmission-blocking vaccine is adopted at high coverage by individuals involved with basic training, need will persist for non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent outbreaks in military basic training. Ongoing uncertainties about virus variants and breakthrough infections necessitate continued vigilance in this setting, even as vaccination coverage increases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Disentangling choice value and choice conflict in sequential decisions under risk</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura Fontanesi, Amitai Shenhav, Sebastian Gluth</p>

Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in understanding the neural and cognitive dynamics that drive sequential decision making in general and foraging behavior in particular. Due to the intrinsic properties of most sequential decision-making paradigms, however, previous research in this area has suffered from the difficulty to disentangle properties of the decision related to (a) the value of switching to a new patch versus, which increases monotonically, and (b) the conflict experienced between choosing to stay or leave, which first increases but then decreases after reaching the point of indifference between staying and switching. Here, we show how the same problems arise in studies of sequential decision-making under risk, and how they can be overcome, taking as a specific example recent research on the ‘pig’ dice game. In each round of the ‘pig’ dice game, people roll a die and accumulate rewards until they either decide to proceed to the next round or lose all rewards. By combining simulation-based dissections of the task structure with two experiments, we show how an extension of the standard paradigm, together with cognitive modeling of decision-making processes, allows to disentangle properties related to either switch value or choice conflict. Our study elucidates the cognitive mechanisms of sequential decision making and underscores the importance of avoiding potential pitfalls of paradigms that are commonly used in this research area.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Theoretical investigation of active listening behavior based on the echolocation of CF-FM bats</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takahiro Hiraga, Yasufumi Yamada, Ryo Kobayashi</p>

Bats perceive the three-dimensional environment by emitting ultrasound pulses from their nose or mouth and receiving echoes through both ears. To determine the position of a target object, it is necessary to know the distance and direction of the target. Certain bat species that use a combined signal of long constant frequency and short frequency modulated ultrasounds synchronize their pinnae movement with pulse emission, and this behavior has been regarded as helpful for localizing the elevation angle of a reflective sound source. However, the significance of bats’ ear motions remains unclear. In this study, we construct a model of an active listening system including the motion of the ears, and conduct mathematical investigations to clarify the importance of ear motion in direction detection of the reflective sound source. In the simulations, direction detection under rigid ear movements with interaural level differences was mathematically investigated by assuming that bats accomplish direction detection using the amplitude modulation in the echoes caused by ear movements. In particular, the ear motion conditions required for direction detection are theoretically investigated through exhaustive simulations of the pseudo-motion of the ears, rather than simulations of the actual ear motions of bats. The theory suggests that only certain ear motions, namely three-axis rotation, allow for accurate and robust direction detection. Our theoretical analysis also strongly supports the behavior whereby bats move their pinnae in the antiphase mode. In addition, we suggest that simple shaped hearing directionality and well-selected uncomplicated ear motions are sufficient to achieve precise and robust direction detection. Our findings and mathematical approach have the potential to be used in the design of active sensing systems in various engineering fields.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictive factor of renal function recoverability in upper-tract obstructive uropathy after percutaneous nephrostomy and Double -J stent insertion in Indonesian National Referral Hospital [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Obstructive uropathy (OU) is defined as an alteration in any level of the urinary tract that is caused by abnormalities of its system organs, or external pathological factors. Hydronephrosis and progressive renal impairment are signs of upper-tract OU. OU  accounted to be around 0,9% - 3,8% of prevalence for etiology of hydronephrosis. The aim of OU treatment is to achieve optimal urinary diversion, either by retrograde intra-ureteral stenting or percutaneous drainage. However, improvement of renal function after urinary diversion is not always evident. The purpose of this study was to identify predictive factors of improvement in renal function following ureteral stent insertion or percutaneous nephrostomy in OU cases. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center study on patients with OU, who underwent ureteral stenting with Double J (DJ) stent or percutaneous nephrostomy. Several commonly measured clinical indices were documented, including preoperative haemoglobin, Ht, leucocyte, thrombocyte, serum creatinine, blood urea, electrolyte, blood urea to serum creatinine ratio, and renal parenchymal thickness. We focused on finding which parameters correlated with postsurgical decrease in serum creatinine level. Result: We evaluate 567 patients that underwent DJ stent insertion and percutaneous nephrostomy. There was a statistically significant relationship between parenchymal thickness with post-operative creatinine serum decrease, with an OR of 11.24 (p<0.01, CI 7,5 – 16,8). Another parameter that has a statistically significant relationship with successful operative outcomes was blood urea to serum creatinine with OR = 27,9 (p-value < 0.01, 95% CI 17,4 – 44,8. Other laboratory factors had no statistical significance in predicting renal function recoverability. Conclusion: There was a statistically significant relationship between renal parenchymal thickness and blood urea-creatinine ratio with a favourable operational outcome in OU, as evidenced by a reduction in postoperative creatinine serum level.

                Background There is evidence that patients with COVID-19 have a higher prevalence of mental health problems than the normal population. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental health problems and their associated factors in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in the hospitel in Thailand. Methods Mental health problems were evaluated using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 items, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. McNemar's test was used to compare the prevalence of mental health problems between day 1 and day 7. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems. Results A total of 186 participants (68.3% female; mean age = 37.21 years (SD 13.66) were recruited. The depression, anxiety, and stress rate on day 1 of admission was 26.9%, 32.3% and 25.8%, respectively. Having mild COVID-19 symptoms was a significantly associated factor with anxiety (OR=2.69, 95%CI: 1.05-6.89) and stress (OR=4.53, 95%CI: 1.32-15.55). Conclusions There was a high rate of mental health problems in COVID-19 patients. Detecting and managing mental health problems should be considered standard care for COVID-19 patients.

                Background: Open Science seeks to render research outputs visible, accessible and reusable. In this context, Research Data and Research Software sharing and dissemination issues provide real challenges to the scientific community, as consequence of recent progress in political, legal and funding requirements. Methods: We take advantage from the approach we have developed in a precedent publication, in which we have highlighted the similarities between the Research Data and Research Software definitions. Results: The similarities between Research Data and Research Software definitions can be extended to propose protocols for Research Data dissemination and evaluation derived from those already proposed for Research Software dissemination and evaluation. We also analyze FAIR principles for these outputs. Conclusions: Our proposals here provide concrete instructions for Research Data and Research Software producers to make them more findable and accessible, as well as arguments to choose suitable dissemination platforms to complete the FAIR framework. Future work could analyze the potential extension of this parallelism to other kinds of research outputs that are disseminated under similar conditions to those of Research Data and Research Software, that is, without widely accepted publication procedures involving editors or other external actors and where the dissemination is usually restricted through the hands of the production team.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Associated predictor covariates of cervical cancer stage and impact on survival at Khartoum oncology hospital, Sudan [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cervical cancer can be invasive and advanced at diagnosis causing devastating suffering and premature death. The cancer stage at presentation is related to survival evaluation and several factors determine stage. The aim of the study was to examine predictors covariates associated with cervical cancer stage at diagnosis and its impact on patient prognosis and survival. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out at Khartoum oncology hospital, Sudan. Participants were 239 cervical cancer patients diagnosed and treated between 2011-2015. Patients’ pathological and socio-demographic data were extracted from their medical files and survival times were calculated from follow-up. Chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, Log-rank test and Cox regression model were used to examine relationships between demographic and clinical variables and survival outcome. Results: The mean age of the participants was 56.91 years and the majority were ≥45 years. Cancer survival analysis showed that the stage at diagnosis had limited association with socio-demographic factors, except where patients reside. Multivariate regression using the Cox proportional hazard model confirmed strongly that stage (p=0.035), chemotherapy (p=0.000) and radiotherapy (p=0.001) were the most likely predictor covariates of patient prognosis and survival time. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest cancer stage at diagnosis and certain treatments are the most important factors impacting the prognosis and survival of patients with cervical cancer. Early detection and vaccination of women against HPV infection provide enormous opportunities for early diagnosis, more effective treatment and better chances of survival.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Qualitative analysis of HIV and AIDS disease transmission: impact of awareness, testing and effective follow up [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Since the early 1980s, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and its accompanying acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have spread worldwide, becoming one of the world's major global health issues. From the beginning of the epidemic until 2020, about 79.3 million people became infected, with 36.3 million deaths due to AIDS illnesses. This huge figure is a result of those unaware of their status due to stigmatization and invariably spreading the virus unknowingly. Methods: Qualitative analysis through a mathematical model that will address HIV unaware individuals and the effect of an increasing defaulter on the dynamics of HIV/AIDS was investigated. The impact of treatment and the effect of inefficient follow-up on the transmission of HIV/AIDS were examined. The threshold for the effective reduction of the unaware status of HIV through testing, in response to awareness, and the significance of effective non-defaulting in treatment commonly called defaulters loss to follow-up as these individuals contribute immensely to the spread of the virus due to their increase in CD4+ count was determined in this study. Stability analysis of equilibrium points is performed using the basic reproduction number $R_0$, an epidemiological threshold that determines disease eradication or persistence in viral populations. We tested the most sensitive parameters in the basic reproduction numbers. The model of consideration in this study is based on the assumption that information (awareness) and non-stigmatization can stimulate change in the behaviours of infected individuals, and can lead to an increase in testing and adherence to treatment. This will in turn reduce the basic reproduction number, and consequently, the spread of the virus. Results: The results portray that the early identification and treatment are inadequate for the illness to be eradicated. Conclusions: Other control techniques, such as treatment adherence and effective condom usage, should be investigated in order to lessen the disease's burden.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Disease Progression in CMT related to MPZ Mutations: A Longitudinal Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The paucity of longitudinal natural history studies in <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathy remains a barrier to clinical trials. We have completed a longitudinal natural history study in patients with <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathies across 13 sites of the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Change in Charcot Marie Tooth Examination scores (CMTES) and Rasch modified CMTES (CMTES-R) scores were evaluated using longitudinal regression over a 5-year period in subjects with <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathy. Data from 139 patients with <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathy were examined.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The average baseline CMTES and CMTES-R scores were 10.84 (SD 6.0, range 0 – 28) and 14.60 (SD= 7.56, range 0 - 32), respectively. A mixed regression model showed significant change in CMTES at years 2-5 [mean change from baseline of 0.87 points at 2 years (p=0.008)]. Subgroup analysis revealed greater change in CMTES at 2 years in subjects with axonal as compared to demyelinating neuropathy [mean change of 1.30 points, (p=0.016) versus 0.06 points, (p=0.889)]. Patients with a moderate baseline neuropathy severity also showed more notable change, by estimate, than those with mild or severe neuropathy [mean 2 year change of 1.14 for baseline CMTES 8-14 (p=0.025), versus -0.03 for baseline CMTES 0-7 (p=0.958) and 0.25 for baseline CMTES ≥15 (p=0.6897)]. The progression in patients harboring specific <i>MPZ</i> mutations was highly variable.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CMTES scores are sensitive to change over time in adult patients with axonal but not demyelinating forms of <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathy. Change in CMTES was greatest in patients with moderate baseline disease severity. These findings will inform future clinical trials of <i>MPZ</i>-neuropathies.</p>

However, their signals report a reaction between the target and the sensor molecules rather than the activity of interest per se. Thus, understanding the location, sensitivity and imaging environment of a sensor should help to avoid misinterpretation of its readout.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Stability and asynchrony of local communities but less so diversity increase regional stability of Inner Mongolian grassland</a></h4>

              
                Extending knowledge on ecosystem stability to larger spatial scales is urgently needed because present local-scale studies are generally ineffective in guiding management and conservation decisions of an entire region with diverse plant communities. We investigated stability of plant productivity across spatial scales and hierarchical levels of organization and analyzed impacts of dominant species, species diversity, and climatic factors using a multisite survey of Inner Mongolian grassland. We found that regional stability across distant local communities was related to stability and asynchrony of local communities. Using only dominant instead of all-species dynamics explained regional stability almost equally well. The diversity of all or only dominant species had comparatively weak effects on stability and synchrony, whereas a lower mean and higher variation of precipitation destabilized regional and local communities by reducing population stability and synchronizing species dynamics. We demonstrate that, for semi-arid temperate grassland with highly uneven species abundances, the stability of regional communities is increased by stability and asynchrony of local communities and these are more affected by climate rather than species diversity. Reduced amounts and increased variation of precipitation in the future may compromise the sustainable provision of ecosystem services to human well-being in this region.
