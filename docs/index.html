              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-368/v3?src=rss">Scoping review for physiotherapy interventions for people living with long COVID [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background A diverse spectrum of long COVID symptoms (LCS) have the scope of physical rehabilitation. Due to limited resources, very little is known about the physiotherapy and rehabilitation interventions for LCS and their clinical application. This study aims to enlist the physiotherapy and rehabilitation interventions in the management of musculoskeletal, neurological, cognitive, cardiorespiratory, mental health, and functional impairments of LCS. Methods The study was a scoping review of the literature published between April 2020 and July 2022. Results 87 records were extracted followed by a standard process of The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) extension for Scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The included records had a 3223 LCS population. All types of primary and secondary evidences were retrieved except for qualitative studies. The evidence was evaluated by an appraisal scoring tool followed by the guidelines of the “Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) network”. The included papers had a mean appraisal score of 0.7807 on a 0 to 1 scale (SD 0.08), the minimum score was for study protocols (0.5870), and the maximum score was for Cohort studies (.8977). Sixty seven (67) evidence-based interventions were documented from 17 clinical categories. The most weighted interventions were treating underlying symptoms of long COVID (Adjusted score 1/1), management of fatigue (Adjusted score 0.963/1), aerobic exercise and balance training (Adjusted score 0.951/1), multidisciplinary rehabilitation (Adjusted score 0.926/1), and low resistance training and aerobic exercise (Adjusted score 0.889/1). Conclusion We recommend Long COVID rehabilitation in a multidisciplinary approach by treating the individual symptoms, especially fatigue. Physiotherapy interventions include were exercise, modalities, patient education, respiratory rehabilitation, and telerehabilitation. Scoping reviews do not require protocol registration from PROSPERO.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11609">A Stochastic Quantum Neural Network Model for Ai</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.11609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has drawn significant inspiration from neuroscience to develop artificial neural network (ANN) models. However, these models remain constrained by the Von Neumann architecture and struggle to capture the complexity of the biological brain. Quantum computing, with its foundational principles of superposition, entanglement, and unitary evolution, offers a promising alternative approach to modeling neural dynamics. This paper explores the possibility of a neuro-quantum model of the brain by introducing a stochastic quantum approach that incorporates random fluctuations of neuronal processing within a quantum framework. We propose a mathematical formalization of stochastic quantum neural networks (QNNS), where qubits evolve according to stochastic differential equations inspired by biological neuronal processes. We also discuss challenges related to decoherence, qubit stability, and implications for AI and computational neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12715">Predicting upcoming visual features during eye movements yields scene representations aligned with human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scenes are complex, yet structured collections of parts, including objects and surfaces, that exhibit spatial and semantic relations to one another. An effective visual system therefore needs unified scene representations that relate scene parts to their location and their co-occurrence. We hypothesize that this structure can be learned self-supervised from natural experience by exploiting the temporal regularities of active vision: each fixation reveals a locally-detailed glimpse that is statistically related to the previous one via co-occurrence and saccade-conditioned spatial regularities. We instantiate this idea with Glimpse Prediction Networks (GPNs) -- recurrent models trained to predict the feature embedding of the next glimpse along human-like scanpaths over natural scenes. GPNs successfully learn co-occurrence structure and, when given relative saccade location vectors, show sensitivity to spatial arrangement. Furthermore, recurrent variants of GPNs were able to integrate information across glimpses into a unified scene representation. Notably, these scene representations align strongly with human fMRI responses during natural-scene viewing across mid/high-level visual cortex. Critically, GPNs outperform architecture- and dataset-matched controls trained with explicit semantic objectives, and match or exceed strong modern vision baselines, leaving little unique variance for those alternatives. These results establish next-glimpse prediction during active vision as a biologically plausible, self-supervised route to brain-aligned scene representations learned from natural visual experience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13668">Integrative Model for Interoception and Exteroception: predictive coding, points of modulation, and testable predictions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interoception and exteroception provide continuous feedback about the body and the environment, yet how they are dynamically integrated within a unified predictive coding framework has remained under-specified. This paper develops and empirically validates an integrative predictive coding model that treats interoceptive and exteroceptive inference as parallel hierarchical systems exchanging precision-weighted prediction errors. Within this framework, arbitration between the two streams is governed by relative precision weights (w) and integrated within the anterior insula (AIC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Computational simulations of the model reproduced biologically plausible dynamics: prediction errors decayed exponentially while arbitration weights self-normalized toward equilibrium (w = 0.5), demonstrating stable convergence and coherent integration. Simulated anxiety and PTSD profiles, characterized respectively by interoceptive and exteroceptive overweighting, yielded rigid, self-sustaining imbalances (w to 1 or w to 0) and slowed recalibration. Empirical application of the arbitration equation to published EEG-fMRI datasets further validated the model. The framework contributes a unifying account of how dysregulated precision weighting may underlie anxiety (overweighted interoception) and PTSD (underweighted interoception). Building on this validation, a proposed experimental paradigm is outlined to test the model's predictions in humans. It examines recalibration across anxiety, neutral, and PTSD groups following targeted interoceptive or exteroceptive therapies. Key predictions include identifiable neural markers of coherence, modulation of heartbeat-evoked potentials by vagal stimulation, and precision-sensitive behavioral signatures in interoceptive-exteroceptive congruency tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16136">Modeling Dynamic Neural Activity by combining Naturalistic Video Stimuli and Stimulus-independent Latent Factors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.16136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neural activity in the visual processing is influenced by both external stimuli and internal brain states. Ideally, a neural predictive model should account for both of them. Currently, there are no dynamic encoding models that explicitly model a latent state and the entire neuronal response distribution. We address this gap by proposing a probabilistic model that predicts the joint distribution of the neuronal responses from video stimuli and stimulus-independent latent factors. After training and testing our model on mouse V1 neuronal responses, we find that it outperforms video-only models in terms of log-likelihood and achieves improvements in likelihood and correlation when conditioned on responses from other neurons. Furthermore, we find that the learned latent factors strongly correlate with mouse behavior and that they exhibit patterns related to the neurons' position on the visual cortex, although the model was trained without behavior and cortical coordinates. Our findings demonstrate that unsupervised learning of latent factors from population responses can reveal biologically meaningful structure that bridges sensory processing and behavior, without requiring explicit behavioral annotations during training.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15813">Meta-Learning an In-Context Transformer Model of Human Higher Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.15813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05178">Associative Memory and Generative Diffusion in the Zero-noise Limit</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.05178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that generative diffusion processes converge to associative memory systems at vanishing noise levels and characterizes the stability, robustness, memorization, and generation dynamics of both model classes. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are shown to be universal approximators of associative memory models, with diffusion processes as their white-noise perturbations. The universal properties of associative memory that follow are used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise diminishes. Structural stability of Morse-Smale flows -- that is, the robustness of their global critical point structure -- implies the stability of both trajectories and invariant measures for diffusions in the zero-noise limit. The learning and generation landscapes of these models appear as parameterized families of gradient flows and their stochastic perturbations, and the bifurcation theory for Morse-Smale systems implies that they are generically stable except at isolated parameter values, where enumerable sets of local and global bifurcations govern transitions between stable systems in parameter space. These landscapes are thus characterized by ordered bifurcation sequences that create, destroy, or alter connections between rest points and are robust under small stochastic or deterministic perturbations. The framework is agnostic to model formulation, which we verify with examples from energy-based models, denoising diffusion models, and classical and modern Hopfield networks. We additionally derive structural stability criteria for Hopfield-type networks and find that simple cases violate them. Collectively, our geometric approach provides insight into the classification, stability, and emergence of memory and generative landscapes.

                arXiv:2506.23293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel paradigm of emergent local memory. It is a continuous-learning completely-parallel content-addressable memory encoding global order. It demonstrates how local constraints on uncoordinated learning can produce topologically protected memories realizing emergent symbolic order. It is therefore a neuro-symbolic bridge.
  It further has the ability to produce human language without data, by exploiting its own self-organizing dynamics. It teaches us that words arise as a side-effect of emergent symbolic order, and that human language patterns at all structural levels reflect a universal mechanism of word formation (which is subregular). This work answers essential questions about the existence \& origin of all the human language data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11848">Phase-Coded Memory and Morphological Resonance: A Next-Generation Retrieval-Augmented Generator Architecture</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cognitive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) architecture that transcends transformer context-length limitations through phase-coded memory and morphological-semantic resonance. Instead of token embeddings, the system encodes meaning as complex wave patterns with amplitude-phase structure. A three-tier design is presented: a Morphological Mapper that transforms inputs into semantic waveforms, a Field Memory Layer that stores knowledge as distributed holographic traces and retrieves it via phase interference, and a Non-Contextual Generator that produces coherent output guided by resonance rather than fixed context. This approach eliminates sequential token dependence, greatly reduces memory and computational overhead, and enables unlimited effective context through frequency-based semantic access. The paper outlines theoretical foundations, pseudocode implementation, and experimental evidence from related complex-valued neural models, emphasizing substantial energy, storage, and time savings.

                arXiv:2511.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking has driven scientific progress in Evolutionary Computation, yet current practices fall short of real-world needs. Widely used synthetic suites such as BBOB and CEC isolate algorithmic phenomena but poorly reflect the structure, constraints, and information limitations of continuous and mixed-integer optimization problems in practice. This disconnect leads to the misuse of benchmarking suites for competitions, automated algorithm selection, and industrial decision-making, despite these suites being designed for different purposes.
  We identify key gaps in current benchmarking practices and tooling, including limited availability of real-world-inspired problems, missing high-level features, and challenges in multi-objective and noisy settings. We propose a vision centered on curated real-world-inspired benchmarks, practitioner-accessible feature spaces and community-maintained performance databases. Real progress requires coordinated effort: A living benchmarking ecosystem that evolves with real-world insights and supports both scientific understanding and industrial use.

                arXiv:2511.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Quadratic Multiple Constraints Variable-Sized Bin Packing Problem (QMC-VSBPP), a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that generalizes the classical bin packing by incorporating multiple capacity dimensions, heterogeneous bin types, and quadratic interaction costs between items. We propose two complementary methods that advance the current state-of-the-art. First, a linearized mathematical formulation is introduced to eliminate quadratic terms, enabling the use of exact solvers such as Gurobi to compute strong lower bounds - reported here for the first time for this problem. Second, we develop RKO-ACO, a continuous-domain Ant Colony Optimization algorithm within the Random-Key Optimization framework, enhanced with adaptive Q-learning parameter control and efficient local search. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances show that the proposed linearized model produces significantly tighter lower bounds than the original quadratic formulation, while RKO-ACO consistently matches or improves upon all best-known solutions in the literature, establishing new upper bounds for large-scale instances. These results provide new reference values for future studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of evolutionary and random-key metaheuristic approaches for solving complex quadratic packing problems.

                arXiv:2511.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts that elicit toxic content even after safety alignment. We present ToxSearch, a black-box evolutionary framework that tests model safety by evolving prompts in a synchronous steady-state loop. The system employs a diverse set of operators, including lexical substitutions, negation, back-translation, paraphrasing, and two semantic crossover operators, while a moderation oracle provides fitness guidance. Operator-level analysis shows heterogeneous behavior: lexical substitutions offer the best yield-variance trade-off, semantic-similarity crossover acts as a precise low-throughput inserter, and global rewrites exhibit high variance with elevated refusal costs. Using elite prompts evolved on LLaMA 3.1 8B, we observe practically meaningful but attenuated cross-model transfer, with toxicity roughly halving on most targets, smaller LLaMA 3.2 variants showing the strongest resistance, and some cross-architecture models retaining higher toxicity. These results suggest that small, controllable perturbations are effective vehicles for systematic red-teaming and that defenses should anticipate cross-model reuse of adversarial prompts rather than focusing only on single-model hardening.

Abstract: Boolean functions with strong cryptographic properties, such as high nonlinearity and algebraic degree, are important for the security of stream and block ciphers. These functions can be designed using algebraic constructions or metaheuristics. This paper examines the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to evolve homogeneous bent Boolean functions, that is, functions whose algebraic normal form contains only monomials of the same degree and that are maximally nonlinear. We introduce the notion of density of homogeneous bent functions, facilitating the algorithmic design that results in finding quadratic and cubic bent functions in different numbers of variables.

                arXiv:2511.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) are recognized as a promising avenue for achieving efficient, low-energy neuromorphic computing. Direct training of SNNs typically relies on surrogate gradient (SG) learning to estimate derivatives of non-differentiable spiking activity. However, during training, the distribution of neuronal membrane potentials varies across timesteps and progressively deviates toward both sides of the firing threshold. When the firing threshold and SG remain fixed, this may lead to imbalanced spike firing and diminished gradient signals, preventing SNNs from performing well. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-stage synergistic learning algorithm that achieves forward adaptive thresholding and backward dynamic SG. In forward propagation, we adaptively adjust thresholds based on the distribution of membrane potential dynamics (MPD) at each timestep, which enriches neuronal diversity and effectively balances firing rates across timesteps and layers. In backward propagation, drawing from the underlying association between MPD, threshold, and SG, we dynamically optimize SG to enhance gradient estimation through spatio-temporal alignment, effectively mitigating gradient information loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements. Moreover, it allows neurons to fire stable proportions of spikes at each timestep and increases the proportion of neurons that obtain gradients in deeper layers.

                arXiv:2511.12922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems have achieved high-quality performance by bridging the discrepancy between the item space and the language space through item tokenization. However, existing item tokenization methods typically require training separate models for each item domain, limiting generalization. Moreover, the diverse distributions and semantics across item domains make it difficult to construct a unified tokenization that preserves domain-specific information. To address these challenges, we propose UniTok, a Unified item Tokenization framework that integrates our own mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a series of codebooks to convert items into discrete tokens, enabling scalable tokenization while preserving semantic information across multiple item domains. Specifically, items from different domains are first projected into a unified latent space through a shared encoder. They are then routed to domain-specific experts to capture the unique semantics, while a shared expert, which is always active, encodes common knowledge transferable across domains. Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines.

                arXiv:2511.13053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by conducting a geometric analysis of the network's energy landscape. We introduce a novel metric, ``Pinnacle Sharpness,'' to quantify the local stability of attractors. By systematically varying the kernel width and storage load, we uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor shapes. Our central finding is the emergence of a ``ridge of optimization,'' where the network maximizes attractor stability under challenging high-load and global-kernel conditions. Through a theoretical decomposition of the landscape gradient into a direct ``driving'' force and an indirect ``feedback'' force, we reveal the origin of this phenomenon. The optimization ridge corresponds to a regime of strong anti-correlation between the two forces, where the direct force, amplified by the high storage load, dominates the opposing collective feedback force. This demonstrates a sophisticated self-organization mechanism: the network adaptively harnesses inter-pattern interactions as a cooperative feedback control system to sculpt a robust energy landscape. Our findings provide a new physical picture for the stability of high-capacity associative memories and offer principles for their design.

                arXiv:2312.07083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As optimization challenges continue to evolve, so too must our tools and understanding. To effectively assess, validate, and compare optimization algorithms, it is crucial to use a benchmark test suite that encompasses a diverse range of problem instances with various characteristics. Traditional benchmark suites often consist of numerous fixed test functions, making it challenging to align these with specific research objectives, such as the systematic evaluation of algorithms under controllable conditions. This paper introduces the Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator (GNBG) for singleobjective, box-constrained, continuous numerical optimization. Unlike the commonly used test suites that rely on multiple baseline functions and transformations, GNBG utilizes a single, parametric, and configurable baseline function. This design allows for control over various problem characteristics. Researchers using GNBG can generate instances that cover a broad range of morphological features, from unimodal to highly multimodal functions, various local optima patterns, and symmetric to highly asymmetric structures. The generated problems can also vary in separability, variable interaction structures, dimensionality, conditioning, and basin shapes. These customizable features enable the systematic evaluation and comparison of optimization methods, allowing researchers to examine the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms under diverse and controllable conditions.

                arXiv:2110.09138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) can perform algorithmic tasks such as sorting. However, they often fail to generalise to input sequence lengths not encountered during training. We introduce two approaches that constrain the state space of the MANN's controller network: state compression and state regularisation. We empirically demonstrated that both approaches can improve generalisation to input sequences of out-of-distribution lengths for a specific type of MANN: the differentiable neural computer (DNC). The constrained DNC could process input sequences that were up to 2.3 times longer than those processed by an unconstrained baseline controller network. Notably, the applied constraints enabled the extension of the DNC's memory matrix without the need for retraining and thus allowed the processing of input sequences that were 10.4 times longer. However, the improvements were not consistent across all tested algorithmic tasks. Interestingly, solutions that performed better often had a highly structured state space, characterised by state trajectories exhibiting increased curvature and loop-like patterns. Our experimental work demonstrates that state-space constraints can enable the training of a DNC using shorter input sequences, thereby saving computational resources and facilitating training when acquiring long sequences is costly.

                arXiv:2507.00032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive exercise recommendation (ER) aims to choose the next activity that matches a learner's evolving Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). We present KUL-Rec, a biologically inspired ER system that couples a fast Hebbian memory with slow replay-based consolidation to enable continual, few-shot personalization from sparse interactions. The model operates in an embedding space, allowing a single architecture to handle both tabular knowledge-tracing logs and open-ended short-answer text. We align evaluation with tutoring needs using bidirectional ranking and rank-sensitive metrics (nDCG, Recall@K). Across ten public datasets, KUL-Rec improves macro nDCG (0.316 vs. 0.265 for the strongest baseline) and Recall@10 (0.305 vs. 0.211), while achieving low inference latency and an $\approx99$\% reduction in peak GPU memory relative to a competitive graph-based model. In a 13-week graduate course, KUL-Rec personalized weekly short-answer quizzes generated by a retrieval-augmented pipeline and the personalized quizzes were associated with lower perceived difficulty and higher helpfulness (p < .05). An embedding robustness audit highlights that encoder choice affects semantic alignment, motivating routine audits when deploying open-response assessment. Together, these results indicate that Hebbian replay with bounded consolidation offers a practical path to real-time, interpretable ER that scales across data modalities and classroom settings.

                arXiv:2507.22787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality presents a pervasive challenge in optimization problems, with exponential expansion of the search space rapidly causing traditional algorithms to become inefficient or infeasible. An adaptive sampling strategy is presented to accelerate optimization in this domain as an alternative to uniform quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.
  This method, referred to as Hyperellipsoid Density Sampling (HDS), generates its sequences by defining multiple hyperellipsoids throughout the search space. HDS uses three types of unsupervised learning algorithms to circumvent high-dimensional geometric calculations, producing an intelligent, non-uniform sample sequence that exploits statistically promising regions of the parameter space and improves final solution quality in high-dimensional optimization problems.
  A key feature of the method is optional Gaussian weights, which may be provided to influence the sample distribution towards known locations of interest. This capability makes HDS versatile for applications beyond optimization, providing a focused, denser sample distribution where models need to concentrate their efforts on specific, non-uniform regions of the parameter space.
  The method was evaluated against Sobol, a standard QMC method, using differential evolution (DE) on the 29 CEC2017 benchmark test functions. The results show statistically significant improvements in solution geometric mean error (p < 0.05), with average performance gains ranging from 3% in 30D to 37% in 10D. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of HDS as a robust alternative to QMC sampling for high-dimensional optimization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103017">Mother-child dyadic interactions shape the developing social brain and Theory of Mind in young children</a></h4>

              
                Social cognition develops through a complex interplay between neural maturation and environmental factors, yet the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Using a naturalistic fMRI paradigm, we investigated the effects of age and parental caregiving on social brain development and Theory of Mind (ToM) in 34 mother-child dyads. The functional maturity of social brain networks was positively associated with age, while mother-child neural synchronization during movie viewing was related to dyadic relationship quality. Crucially, parenting and child factors interactively shaped social cognition outcomes, mediated by ToM abilities. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic interplay of neurocognitive development and interpersonal synchrony in early childhood social cognition, and provide novel evidence for neurodevelopmental plasticity and reciprocal determinism. This integrative approach, bridging brain, behavior, and parenting environment, advances our understanding of the complex mechanisms shaping social cognition. The insights gained can inform personalized interventions promoting social competence, emphasizing the critical importance of nurturing parental relationships in facilitating healthy social development.

                Background Heart failure (HF) is progressive, with high morbidity and mortality. Salivary biomarkers are being explored as non-invasive tools for HF monitoring. This study examined salivary NT-proBNP and hs-cTn alongside serum levels to distinguish HF patients from healthy controls and to assess diagnostic potential and cross-matrix concordance. Method In a two-center, prospective case-control study (Nov 2024–Apr 2025), 100 HF patients and 100 healthy controls were enrolled. HF diagnoses followed European Society of Cardiology criteria, supported by labs and echocardiography. Serum and saliva NT-proBNP and hs-cTn were measured using sandwich ELISA kits. Results Heart failure patients had higher serum NT-proBNP (317.71 ± 18.16 ng/L) and saliva NT-proBNP (24.54 ± 1.27 ng/L) than controls (88.86 ± 6.26 ng/L; 17.93 ± 0.86 ng/L; both p < 0.001). Serum hs-cTn tended to be higher in HF (93.39 ± 7.15 pg/mL) vs controls (75.48 ± 6.68 pg/mL; p = 0.070); saliva hs-cTn was significantly higher in HF (24.58 ± 4.37 pg/mL) than controls (6.97 ± 0.94 pg/mL; p < 0.001). Saliva NT-proBNP correlated moderately with serum NT-proBNP (r = 0.317; p = 0.003). ROC analysis: serum NT-proBNP showed excellent discrimination (AUC 0.97; 95% CI 0.94–1.00; p < 0.001). Saliva NT-proBNP showed good discrimination (AUC 0.77; 95% CI 0.67–0.87; p < 0.001). Serum hs-cTn had modest discrimination (AUC 0.60; 95% CI 0.48–0.73; p = 0.080), while saliva hs-cTn showed strong discrimination (AUC 0.88; 95% CI 0.82–0.95; p < 0.001). Saliva creatinine and uric acid correlated with serum markers, supporting saliva’s reflection of systemic status. Conclusion Saliva NT-proBNP and hs-cTn show diagnostic potential and concordance with serum measurements, suggesting saliva could complement serum tests for non-invasive HF monitoring. Serum NT-proBNP remained the strongest discriminator. Standardization and cross-population validation are needed, but saliva offers a practical adjunct when venipuncture is undesirable.

                Little is known about the success of alcohol reduction attempts made outside of an experimental setting, and the association between brief alcohol interventions and other evidence-based support and the success of these attempts. This study aimed to answer these questions among risky drinkers using observational data (baseline and 6-month follow-up surveys) from England between 2014 and 2016 (n=3,129). Around one third (31.4%, 95% CI=29.8-33.0) of risky drinkers reported making an alcohol reduction attempt between baseline and 6-month follow-up. Of those making an attempt, nearly two-thirds (64.1%, 95% CI=61.1-67.1) self-reported their attempt was successful. Those who received a brief alcohol intervention in primary care were 3-times more likely to report their attempt was successful (ORadj=3.01, 95% CI=1.87-4.82). No association was detected between using evidence-based support during an attempt and self-reported success (ORadj=0.87, 95% CI=0.47-1.66). A different pattern of results was found when using AUDIT score at 6-month follow-up (adjusted for baseline) as the outcome: receiving (vs. not receiving) a brief alcohol intervention in primary care (Badj=3.56, 95% CI=2.78-4.35) and using (vs. not using) evidence-based support during an alcohol reduction attempt (Badj=1.89, 95% CI=0.72-3.06) was associated with higher AUDIT scores. These findings were not robust to sensitivity analyses, highlighting the importance of using measures focused on more recent alcohol consumption in this type of study design. Further research is needed to unpick these findings and to capture the potential heterogeneity in goals for alcohol reduction attempts.

                Background Mortality rates after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) remain higher in resource-limited areas compared to developed countries. In low-income settings, children often begin ART with higher viral loads and lower CD4 counts. Ethiopia’s national ART guidelines, introduced in 2014 based on WHO recommendations, advocate for universal ART for children to reduce mortality and improve health outcomes. However, there is limited data on mortality rates and their predictors since these guidelines were implemented. Therefore, this study was aimed to figure out these issues. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 612 children undergoing ART in Comprehensive Specialized Hospitals in the Amhara region of Ethiopia from January 1, 2015, to December 30, 2024. Participants were selected through simple random sampling. Data were processed using EPi Info 7 and analyzed in STATA-17, employing actuarial life table analysis to estimate mortality rates and Kaplan-Meier analysis for comparing time to death across groups. Cox proportional-hazard regression was applied to identify mortality predictors, using a significance level of P < 0.05. Results Of 602 included children initiated on ART during the follow-up period, 45(7.5%) died. The overall median (IQR) follow-up time was 47 (26-60) months. The overall death rate was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.6-2.8) per 100 person-years of follow-up. The predictors of mortality among children initiated ART were; Baseline CD4 count below the threshold [AHR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2-5.8], opportunistic infections [AHR: 3.7; 95% CI: 1.7-7.9], Poor adherence to treatment [AHR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.4-5.7] and child caregiver with no formal education [AHR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.1-11.6]. Conclusion The observed mortality rate exceeded the expected rate of under 5%. Key factors for higher mortality include low baseline CD4 counts, opportunistic infections, poor treatment adherence, and uneducated caregivers. Enhancing caregiver education, early detection of infections, and prompt ART initiation can help reduce mortality in these children.

                Background Chemicals can perturb gene functions to affect chronic human diseases, and a significant amount of biological knowledge involved in environmental health is available in public databases. Combining information across resources can assist in the discovery of novel testable hypotheses related to how chemical exposures influence human diseases, such as autism. Methods The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public resource that provides curated content for chemicals, genes, phenotypes, diseases, and exposures. The AOP-Wiki is a repository of adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) that provide defined biological frameworks describing disease processes. Here, we intersect CTD toxicogenomic content with the AOP-Wiki to identify environmental chemicals that could potentially modulate key steps in autism. Results We identify numerous chemical stressors that intersect with the individual events of the autism AOP, including bisphenol compounds, per/polyfluoroalkyl substances, pesticides, metals, and air pollutants, suggesting a wide range of environmental factors that could synergize to potentially affect autism. By integrating additional CTD curated content for three autism-associated chemicals (bisphenol A, particulate matter, and valproic acid), we discover other mechanisms, including specific genes (e.g., SLC1A1, GSTP1, CNTNAP2) and phenotypes (e.g., lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, social behavior) that can be used to help refine or expand this AOP or create an entirely new pathway for autism. Furthermore, related diseases are identified to build interconnected networks, mechanistically linking autism to fatty liver disease, intellectual disability, and cancer. Conclusions We demonstrate the value of integrating content from different resources to address environmental health questions related to autism etiology and co-morbidities. Importantly, our methodology is easily adapted for any AOP in the AOP-Wiki to identify potential environmental influences on the disease process and help support or refine AOPs. This analysis underscores the importance of standardizing public databases to make them efficiently interoperable for enhanced shared utility across the numerous bioknowledge digital landscapes.

                Introduction Early-onset neonatal bacterial infections (EONBI) are a major public health issue, causing significant neonatal mortality, especially in preterm infants. The clinical diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, while the bacteriological profile is shifting with increasing multidrug-resistant strains. Objective This study aimed to analyze microbiological data from EONBI cases and identify predictive factors for infections caused by resistant pathogens. Methods A retrospective study was conducted from January 2022 to December 2023 at the neonatal unit of Habib Bougatfa Maternity Center, Tunisia. Newborns with microbiologically confirmed EONBI within 48 hours of admission were included. Maternal and neonatal data were collected and analyzed, with antibiotic resistance determined by antibiogram results. Results Among 5,342 live births, 135 EONBI cases were confirmed (incidence: 25.27 per 1,000 live births). Gram-negative bacilli predominated (96.3%), notably Serratia marcescens (37.78%) and Escherichia coli (27.41%). Resistant pathogens were present in 46.66% of cases. Significant predictive factors for resistance included positive maternal screening for resistant bacteria, third trimester hospitalization, and other maternal infections. Resistant EONBI cases required longer antibiotic courses and hospital stays and were more frequently linked to complications. Conclusion The high prevalence of resistant bacterial strains in EONBI underscores the need for enhanced maternal screening and tailored antibiotic protocols to improve neonatal outcomes.

                Background The surge in non-performing loans (NPLs) critically threatens the stability of commercial banks, especially in developing economies. Corporate governance is widely seen as a key mitigating factor. However, the specific mechanisms and causal pathways through which governance attributes such as shareholders’ rights influence NPL levels remain inadequately understood, particularly within the unique institutional context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods This investigation employed a cross-sectional, mixed-methods design focusing on commercial banks in Western Uganda. Quantitative data were collected from 195 bank employees and board members using structured questionnaires, with participants selected via stratified, purposive, and simple random sampling techniques. This data was analyzed with SPSS version 28, applying descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and simple linear regression. Concurrently, qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with six senior bank officials and analyzed thematically using NVivo software to provide contextual depth and nuance. Results The quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant, strong positive relationship between board accountability and the reduction of NPLs (r = .779, p < .05). In contrast, a significant positive relationship was also found between shareholders’ rights and the perceived level of NPLs (β = .718, p < .05), suggesting a complex and potentially counterproductive role. Qualitative findings triangulated these results, identifying two key mechanisms: the reduction of improper board interference in loan approval processes and proactive board engagement in NPL resolution. Conclusions The study concludes that robust shareholders’ right is a critical determinant for mitigating NPLs, whereas the effect of shareholders’ rights is ambiguous and potentially negative. A well-functioning, accountable board that aligns management actions with long-term bank stability is paramount. The findings underscore the necessity of implementing holistic governance reforms that balance empowered shareholders with strong ethical safeguards to ensure prudent credit risk management.

Burst firing is an important property of neuronal activity, thought to enhance sensory encoding. While previous studies show significant differences in burst firing between <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> conditions, how burst firing contributes to neural coding <i>in vivo</i> and how it is modulated by underlying biophysical mechanisms when neurons are under active synaptic bombardments remains poorly understood. Here, we combined intracellular recordings and computational modeling to investigate how cellular and synaptic mechanisms can explain the <i>in vivo</i> firing activity of electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) pyramidal cells in <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>. We developed a biophysically detailed compartmental model incorporating voltage-gated currents, NMDA receptor-mediated calcium (Ca<sup>2 + </sup>) influx, Ca<sup>2 + </sup>-activated SK channels, Ca<sup>2 + </sup> mobilization, and stochastic synaptic inputs to reproduce <i>in vivo</i> firing activities of ELL pyramidal cells. Specifically, using bifurcation analysis, we identified dynamical transitions between quiescent, tonic, and bursting regimes, governed by interactions among SK conductance, NMDA receptor activation, and applied current. Model parameters were optimized against <i>in vivo</i> data, accurately reproducing action potential waveforms and temporal dynamics, including characteristic bimodal interspike interval distributions reflecting intra- and inter-burst intervals. We further developed a modified Hindmarsh-Rose model incorporating dual adaptation variables and stochastic noise. This simplified phenomenological model successfully captured burst firing comparable to that observed in the biophysical model and recorded data, while replicating diverse firing patterns observed across the population. Finally, parameter sensitivity analysis revealed slow adaptation dynamics and noise intensity as key determinants of spiking variability within cells. Overall, our modeling results demonstrate that <i>in vivo</i> bursting arises from synergistic interactions between intrinsic conductances (e.g., NMDA-SK coupling), Ca<sup>2 + </sup> mobilization, and synaptic stochasticity, offering a potential reconciliation for discrepancies with <i>in vitro</i> firing activity. The models provide mechanistic insights into how background synaptic activity modulates burst firing.

In high-dimensional gene co-expression network analysis, capturing the temporal changes of gene associations is crucial for unveiling dynamic regulatory mechanisms inherent in biological systems. Examining how these interactions change over time offers valuable insights into the developmental and adaptive processes that drive an organism’s lifecycle. Moreover, incorporating structural prior information can substantially enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the estimated sparse dynamic gene network. Methods previously proposed in the literature cannot simultaneously model sparse time-varying co-expression network structure and have the power-law degree distribution. Additionally, there is a demand of time-efficient, memory-light software implementations and possibility to utilize repeated measures at each time-point (if available). In this paper, we introduce the time-varying scale-free graphical lasso (tvsfglasso), a novel scalable framework for estimating high-dimensional time-varying gene co-expression networks under the assumption that these networks simultaneously exhibit sparse and a scale-free structure. We utilize fast algorithms developed for the graphical lasso (glasso), which makes tvsfglasso a scalable tool for high-dimensional problems. We evaluate the performance of tvsfglasso using both simulated and real-world dynamic gene expression time series datasets, demonstrating its capability to detect temporal changes in gene associations. Our results highlight the potential of tvsfglasso to advance the understanding of dynamic gene networks, making this estimator useful for more accurate modeling of complex biological processes.

                <p>by Ari E. Kahn, Dani S. Bassett, Nathaniel D. Daw</p>

Decisions in humans and other organisms depend, in part, on learning and using models that capture the statistical structure of the world, including the long-run expected outcomes of our actions. One prominent approach to forecasting such long-run outcomes is the successor representation (SR), which predicts future states aggregated over multiple timesteps. Although much behavioral and neural evidence suggests that people and animals use such a representation, it remains unknown how they acquire it. It has frequently been assumed to be learned by temporal difference bootstrapping (SR-TD(0)), but this assumption has largely not been empirically tested or compared to alternatives including eligibility traces (SR-TD(λ>0)). Here we address this gap by leveraging trial-by-trial reaction times in graph sequence learning tasks, which are favorable for studying learning dynamics because the long horizons in these studies differentiate the transient update dynamics of different learning rules. We examined the behavior of SR-TD(<i>λ</i>) on a probabilistic graph learning task alongside a number of alternatives, and found that behavior was best explained by a hybrid model which learned via SR-TD(<i>λ</i>) alongside an additional predictive model of recency. The relatively large <i>λ</i> we estimate indicates a predominant role of eligibility trace mechanisms over the bootstrap-based chaining typically assumed. Our results provide insight into how humans learn predictive representations, and demonstrate that people simultaneously learn the SR alongside lower-order predictions.

Physics-based simulation generate movement patterns based on a neuro-musculoskeletal model without relying on experimental movement data, offering a powerful approach to study how neuro-musculoskeletal properties shape locomotion. Yet, simulated gait patterns and metabolic powers do not always agree with experiments, pointing to modeling errors reflecting gaps in our understanding. Here, we systematically evaluated the predictive capability of simulations based on a 3D musculoskeletal model to predict gait mechanics, muscle activity, and metabolic power across gait conditions. We simulated the effect of adding mass to body segments, variations in walking speed, inclined walking, and crouched walking. We chose tasks that are relatively straightforward to model to limit the contribution of errors in modeling the task to prediction errors. The simulations predicted stride frequency and walking kinematics with reasonable accuracy but underestimated variation in metabolic power across conditions. In particular, simulations underestimated changes in metabolic power with respect to level walking in tasks requiring substantial positive mechanical work, such as incline walking (27% underestimation). We identified two possible errors in simulated metabolic power. First, the phenomenological metabolic power model produced high maximal mechanical efficiency (average 0.58) during concentric contractions, compared to the observed 0.2–0.3 in laboratory experiments. Second, when we multiplied the mechanical work with more realistic estimates of mechanical efficiency (i.e., 0.25), simulations overestimated the metabolic power by 84%. This suggests that positive work by muscle fibers was overestimated in the simulations. This overestimation may be caused by several assumptions and errors in (the parameters of) the musculoskeletal model including its interaction with the environment or in the cost function. This study highlights the need for more accurate models of musculoskeletal mechanics, energetics, passive elastic structures, and neural control (e.g., optimality criteria) to improve the realism of human movement simulations. Validating simulations across a broad range of conditions is important to pinpoint shortcomings in model-based simulations.

Down syndrome, caused by an extra copy of Chromosome 21, causes lifelong problems. One of the most common phenotypes among people with Down syndrome is premature aging, including early tissue decline, neurodegeneration, and shortened life span. Yet the reasons for premature systemic aging are a mystery and difficult to study in humans. Here we show that chromosome amplification in wild yeast also produces premature aging and shortens life span. Chromosome duplication disrupts nutrient-induced cell-cycle arrest, entry into quiescence, and cellular health during chronological aging, across genetic background and independent of which chromosome is amplified. Using a genomic screen, we discovered that these defects are due in part to aneuploidy-induced dysfunction in Ribosome Quality Control (RQC). We show that aneuploids entering quiescence display aberrant ribosome profiles, accumulate RQC intermediates, and harbor an increased load of protein aggregates compared to euploid cells. Although they maintain proteasome activity, aneuploids also show signs of ubiquitin dysregulation and sequestration into foci. Remarkably, inducing ribosome stalling in euploids produces similar aging phenotypes, while up-regulating limiting RQC subunits or poly-ubiquitin alleviates many of the aneuploid defects. We propose that the increased translational load caused by having too many mRNAs accelerates a decline in translational fidelity, contributing to premature aging.

Single-cell (SC) sequencing enables detailed characterization of transcriptional heterogeneity but lacks spatial context, while spatial transcriptomics (ST) preserves tissue organization yet is limited by resolution and incomplete gene capture. To bridge these gaps, we developed Cell2Spatial, a computational framework that segments spatial spots at single-cell resolution, even when SC and ST datasets are not fully matched in cell types. The method integrates information-theoretic gene selection, spatially weighted likelihood modeling, and spatial hotspot detection to improve signal fidelity. A corrected saturation model calibrates library size against gene complexity, ensuring accurate cell count estimation in low-resolution ST. To enhance scalability and spatial coherence, Cell2Spatial incorporates neural-network-guided clustering and a cost-minimizing assignment algorithm that balances transcriptional similarity with spatial proximity. Evaluations on synthetic data demonstrated that Cell2Spatial consistently outperforms existing tools in reconstructing tissue architectures and cellular compositions, with particular strength in handling unmatched datasets. Applications to 10× Visium data across mouse brain, human thymus, mouse kidney, and human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex revealed detailed anatomical structures and developmental trajectories. Moreover, for high-resolution platforms including Xenium In Situ, Visium HD, and Slide-seqV2, Cell2Spatial remained robust despite reduced transcript capture, effectively delineating fine-scale spatial patterns in complex tissues. Collectively, these results highlight Cell2Spatial as a versatile framework that expands the analytical scope of ST and provides a powerful tool for uncovering the spatial organization of cellular function and tissue architecture.

                Entrepreneurship worldwide faces persistent challenges such as unequal access to resources, institutional disparities, and inconsistent policy frameworks. Higher education institutions (HEIs) face the critical challenge of fostering sustainable entrepreneurial intentions among students, particularly in developing economies where institutional and resource constraints limit entrepreneurship’s potential to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study investigates the influence of universities, sustainable business values, and key antecedents of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) on sustainable entrepreneurial intentions among students in Indian higher education institutions. Employing a cross-sectional design, data were gathered through a structured questionnaire administered to students enrolled in entrepreneurship education programs. The analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to explore path relationships and test the hypothesized model. This study provides a theoretical contribution to the field of sustainable entrepreneurship education and sustainable entrepreneurial intention by offering valuable insights into the impact of behavioral factors on EI development among students in higher education institutions. These insights emphasize the need for integrating comprehensive, sustainability-focused content into entrepreneurship curricula to equip future entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skills essential for addressing environmental, social, and economic challenges. The practical implications of this research are twofold. First, it provides universities and policymakers with actionable insights to design and implement more effective and sustainability-centered entrepreneurship programs. Second, by fostering sustainable entrepreneurial mindsets, the study contributes to the promotion of responsible business practices and the stimulation of new venture creation, thereby supporting broader economic development goals in emerging economies.

                Background Sustainable Entrepreneurship (SE) has grown as an emerging theory from the conceptual roots of entrepreneurship and sustainability. While its relevance is increasingly acknowledged in both scholarship and practice, SE remains theoretically young, particularly in how it accounts for the real-world emergence of SE ventures across diverse and underrepresented contexts. This study addresses that gap through a qualitative multiple-case analysis of hydroponic ventures in the urban agriculture sector of Jakarta Metropolitan Area (Jabodetabek), Indonesia. Methods Guided by a constructivist paradigm, we collected data through in-depth interviews, field observations, and document analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted across four analytical levels: individual, process, firm, and contextual environment. Results This study identifies eight key themes that reflect the ‘how’ and ‘why’ SE emerges in the lived experiences of the hydroponic entrepreneurs. Engagement with existing theories leads to three conceptual propositions that contribute to a grounded understanding of SE emergence. Our findings reveal an alternative path to SE that departs from the intention-led models dominant in the extant literature. Rather than beginning with strategic sustainability goals for the broader society, SE in these cases is triggered by personally meaningful concerns and evolves through insurgent, organic growth, and effectuation logic. Conclusion Based on these insights, we develop a multi-level pathway model that illustrates two SE emergence pathways, whether intentional or reflexive. We offer an alternative to prevailing models that assume predefined sustainable entrepreneurial intention.

<p>Visceral and somatic motor neurons (MNs) of the lumbosacral (L6–S1) spinal cord control the genitourinary organs and pelvic striated muscles. We produced a three-dimensional (3D) MN atlas of the lumbosacral spinal cord using whole-mount immunostaining, tissue clearing, and advanced 3D microscopy in male and female rats. In so doing, we identified novel axon projections and sexually dimorphic features of MN populations, in addition to providing a definitive online open-access resource for 3D visualization of visceral and somatic MNs within intact lumbosacral cord.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The sexually dimorphic genitourinary organs and specialized striated muscles in the pelvis are controlled by a spinal cord motor neuron (MN) subsystem that produces reflexogenic and psychogenic (conscious) visceral and somatic motor activity during urinary continence and voiding, scent marking (in some species), defecation, reproduction, and sexual activity. To produce a three-dimensional (3D) atlas of the pelvic MN system, we performed whole-mount immunostaining and advanced 3D microscopy on the caudal spinal cord of adult female and male rats. We used choline acetyltransferase immunolabeling to study the macroscopic topology of visceral (autonomic preganglionic; VMN) and somatic MN (SMN) subcolumns and retrograde neural tracing from major pelvic ganglia to locate preganglionic neurons required for pelvic organ regulation. This identified parasympathetic VMNs in the sacral intermediolateral nucleus of segments L6–S1 and pelvic sympathetic preganglionic neurons that were mostly found in the medial dorsal commissural nucleus of segments L1–L2. Retrogradely labeled SMNs were also identified in lumbosacral nuclei containing the urinary rhabdosphincter, cremaster, and levator ani motor pools, suggesting that pelvic MNs project through both the pelvic and pudendal nerves. Evidence of sexual dimorphism was provided by VMN counts and measurements of their dendritic arborizations, and the volume of the dorsolateral and dorsomedial SMN columns. Three-dimensional visualization also revealed areas of overlap between pelvic VMNs and rhabdosphincter SMNs in dendritic bundles, suggesting a possible functional role in coordinating urinary activity. The datasets are available as an open resource (sparc.science) to support 3D visualization of the pelvic motor system in the intact rat spinal cord.</p>

                Schiereck et al. find that expert rats update subjective beliefs to infer hidden task states, a process they show is impaired by inactivation of OFC. Rats naive to hidden states passively adapt to reward statistics. Neural activity in OFC reflected the use of distinct strategies, identifying neural correlates of inference.

Endogenously generated nitric oxide (NO) is highly cardioprotective, but protection is not replicated by nitroso-vasodilators (e.g., nitrates, nitroprusside) used in clinical practice, highlighting specificity in NO-based signaling and untapped therapeutic potential. Signaling by NO is mediated largely by <i>S</i>-nitrosylation, entailing specific enzymes that form and degrade <i>S</i>-nitrosothiols in proteins (SNO-proteins), termed nitrosylases and denitrosylases, respectively. SNO-CoA Reductase 2 (SCoR2; product of the <i>Akr1a1</i> gene) is a recently discovered protein denitrosylase. Genetic variants in SCoR2 have been associated with cardiovascular disease, but its function is unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking SCoR2/AKR1A1 exhibit robust protection in an animal model of MI. SCoR2 regulates ketolytic energy availability, antioxidant levels, and polyol homeostasis via <i>S</i>-nitrosylation of key metabolic effectors. Human cardiomyopathy shows reduced SCoR2 expression and an <i>S</i>-nitrosylation signature of metabolic reprogramming, mirroring SCoR2<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Deletion of SCoR2 thus coordinately reprograms multiple metabolic pathways—ketone body utilization, glycolysis, pentose phosphate shunt, and polyol metabolism—to limit infarct size, establishing SCoR2 as a novel regulator in the injured myocardium and a potential drug target.

                This study investigates the computational potential of single striatal projection neurons (SPNs), emphasizing dendritic nonlinearities and their crucial role in solving complex integration problems. Utilizing a biophysically detailed multicompartmental model of an SPN, we introduce a calcium-based, local synaptic learning rule dependent on dendritic plateau potentials. According to what is known about excitatory corticostriatal synapses, the learning rule is governed by local calcium dynamics from NMDA and L-type calcium channels and dopaminergic reward signals. In order to devise a self-adjusting learning rule, which ensures stability for individual synaptic weights, metaplasticity is also used. We demonstrate that this rule allows single neurons with sufficiently nonlinear dendrites to solve the nonlinear feature binding problem, a task traditionally attributed to neuronal networks. We also detail an inhibitory plasticity mechanism that contributes to dendritic compartmentalization, further enhancing computational efficiency in dendrites. This in silico study highlights the computational potential of single neurons, providing deeper insights into neuronal information processing and the mechanisms by which the brain executes complex computations.

                A major health challenge resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is the manifestation of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). PASC (or long COVID) is a collective term used for clinical symptoms, various pathologies, and life-quality-changing functional impairment that persist for months to years after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mechanisms underlying PASC are not understood, although advances have been made in identifying factors that may contribute to long-term pathology. Recent data have emerged, showing an association between SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence and non-SARS-CoV-2 infections (pre-existing, viral reactivation, or new infections) in facilitating or mediating PASC. However, the heterogeneous nature and timing of co-infections have made it challenging to understand, interpret, and contextualize their contribution to PASC. Here, we summarize the impact of potential viral, bacterial, and fungal infections on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, with a focus on their possible roles in the development of PASC. We also provide a framework to understand the mechanisms of PASC and inform basic, translational, and clinical research initiatives, including RECOVER, a large and ongoing research initiative to understand, treat, and prevent long COVID.

                Prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis is hampered by the limited specificity of current methods, necessitating more reliable biomarkers. To identify causal protein biomarkers and therapeutic targets in humans, we conducted a proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study. We first performed a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association studies, including 94,397 individuals with PCa and 192,372 controls, which identified five possible susceptibility loci (JAZF1, PDILM5, WDPCP, EEFSEC, TNS3) for PCa. Subsequently, MR and colocalization analyses were performed using genetic instruments for 4907 plasma proteins from deCODE Genetics (N=35,559) and 2940 plasma proteins from UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP) (N=54,219). Among 3722 human proteins analyzed, 193 were associated with PCa risk, with 20 high-risk proteins (including KLK3) validated across both cohorts. Functional annotation implicated immune and inflammatory responses and cell–cell interaction pathways. Druggability analyses nominated several potential drug targets for PCa, such as HSPB1, RRM2B, and PSCA. Our findings reveal novel risk loci and candidate protein biomarkers, providing new etiological insights and potential avenues for PCa early detection and therapy.

">Selective engagement of the primate orbitofrontal cortex during value-based but not perceptual decisions</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental question in neuroscience is whether the brain uses specialized sub-systems for different types of decisions or relies on a unified decision-making network. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) provides an ideal test case for this question: it has a well-established role in value-based decisions but it remains unknown whether this reflects functional specialization or participation in a broader, general decision network. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used Neuropixels to monitor large ensembles of OFC neurons as a monkey performed both value-based and perceptual decision tasks. Consistent with prior reports, OFC was robustly engaged during value-based decisions. In contrast, OFC was minimally engaged during perceptual decisions, with no significant encoding of task parameters at either the single neuron or population level. This highlights the functional specialization of the OFC for value-based decisions and suggests that the different cognitive demands underlying different types of decisions recruit distinct neural circuits.

">Nighttime sleep modulates mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Organisms must focus their attention on ethologically relevant stimuli to maximise survival and reproduction. This is achieved, in part, through a process termed habituation, in which responses to repeated or constant sensory inputs are sequentially dampened, favouring robust responses to novel stimuli. Prior investigations in the fruit fly, Drosophila, have uncovered genes and neural mechanisms that facilitate habituation. However, these works have primarily focused on habituation to visual, olfactory, and gustatory, stimuli. In contrast, neurogenetic processes promoting habituation to mechanosensory stimuli have been less studied. Here we develop an automated system that yields long-term analogue measurements of mechanosensory habituation in adult fruit flies. Using this platform, we reveal a role for the neuronal calcium sensor Neurocalcin in habituation to mechanical stimuli. Loss of Neurocalcin disrupts nighttime but not daytime sleep, particularly under long-night conditions. Mimicking a method used to treat insomnia, we show that compressing nighttime duration restores consolidated night sleep in Neurocalcin mutants. Surprisingly, this manipulation also renormalises mechanosensory habituation in this background, suggesting a link between sleep and mechanosensory habituation. Indeed, we show that limiting night sleep duration in wild type flies similarly impairs habituation to mechanosensory stimuli. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated link between nighttime sleep and mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila.

">Probabilistic working memory representations in human cortex guide behavior</a></h4>

              
                Models of working memory make fundamentally different commitments to the architecture of individual memories. Information-sparse models conceptualize individual memories as single point estimates agnostic to meta-cognitive variables such as uncertainty. In contrast, information-rich models propose memories are encoded as probability distributions over feature space that embed memory uncertainty in the shape of the distribution. To distinguish these accounts, we constructed probability distributions of memory from participants iterative reports of motion direction on each trial. Remarkably, the idiosyncratic shape of these distributions (e.g., asymmetry) on single trials matched the shape of neural probability distributions decoded from fMRI patterns measured from occipital and parietal cortex. Consistent with information-rich models, the neural representation of an individual memory encodes more than the memorized feature; its variance (i.e., width and asymmetry) encodes idiosyncrasies whose read-out predicts memory behavior.

">Chewing phase - theta amplitude coupling facilitates working memory</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic chewing enhances cognitive performance, yet the neural mechanisms linking oromotor behavior to cortical dynamics remain poorly understood, in part due to motion artifacts that obscure brain signals. We used high-density EEG with a custom artifact attenuation pipeline to examine how mastication shapes frontocentral theta oscillations during working memory.Thirty one participants performed a visuospatial 2-back task under two conditions: at rest and while chewing. Chewing resulted in faster responses and a selective increase in theta power (4-7 Hz) during the late post-stimulus window (900-1300 ms), a phase associated with cognitive control. Theta amplitude was modulated by the chewing phase, revealing strong cross-frequency coupling between motor output and neural oscillations. The strength of this entrainment increased with chewing frequency, indicating a dose-dependent neural gain. Our results demonstrate that peripheral rhythmic activity can synchronize brain rhythms relevant to cognition in real time, supporting a mechanistic link between bodily action and executive function. These findings enhance our understanding of sensorimotor cognitive integration and point to natural motor rhythms as promising non-invasive tools for modulating brain activity.

">Hemodynamic modelling improves population receptive field estimates</a></h4>

              
                Population receptive field (pRF) modelling is a ubiquitous tool in sensory neuroscience for estimating the functional architecture of the human brain. Most pRF models assume a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) to account for neurovascular effects. But how does this assumption affect results in practice? Here, we concurrently fit the HRF within the pRF model. Using simulations, we demonstrate that this algorithm accurately identifies different ground truth HRFs used for generating data. Moreover, concurrent fitting improves the accuracy of pRF estimates, especially with complex models. Next, we reanalyzed empirical datasets with different stimulus paradigms and scanning parameters. Concurrent fitting substantially reduced the proportion of implausibly small pRFs. Importantly, the best-fitting HRF differed substantially from canonical HRFs or from those measured independently. HRFs also peaked earlier in higher than early visual cortex, suggesting response nonlinearities. All these differences could produce spurious pRF estimates and alter the interpretation of reported findings.

">A Unified Neural Timecourse for Words, Phrases, and Sentences: MEG Evidence from Parallel Presentation</a></h4>

              
                Recent behavioral and neural research on reading shows that humans can extract syntactic structure from short sentences within a fraction of a second - faster than many estimates for recognizing the meaning of a single word. This challenges a core assumption of many language processing models: that combinatory operations depend on prior lexical access. Further, studies using parallel presentation of full sentences have revealed electrophysiological responses remarkably similar to those well established for single words. This raises the question of whether words, phrases, and sentences all move through the same processing stages, regardless of syntactic complexity. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examined how single words, phrases, and sentences are processed when all visual information is available at once. Across all three levels, we observed highly similar waveform dynamics, with early responses reflecting bottom-up detection of form followed by activity in the left anterior and posterior temporal cortices and vmPFC consistent with combinatory processing. Of these regions, the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) showed effects of bigram frequency suggestive of serial left-to-right dynamics. Together, these results support a Global-to-Serial Assembly (GLOSA) model in which the brain first detects the global form of the stimulus in a snapshot-like manner and then probes its combinatory properties through partially serial processes.

">Subliminal beauty engages the brain's valuation circuits</a></h4>

              
                Neuroeconomic models propose that the anterior ventral striatum (aVS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are key regions for computing subjective value (SV) signals that guide choice. However, the role of conscious awareness in this process remains debated. Here we examined whether SV can be automatically computed in these regions without conscious awareness. In an fMRI experiment, participants viewed faces that varied in attractiveness under three conditions: (i) suppressed from awareness via continuous flash suppression (CFS), (ii) clearly visible without suppression, or (iii) absent (background only) with CFS. Participants reported trial-wise facial identity (objective) and visibility (subjective) measures of facial awareness. In a post-fMRI session, they rated the attractiveness of each face as a measure of SV. When faces were seen, task performance (d') exceeded chance and responses were faster than in absent trials. When faces were unseen, performance was at chance but responses were slower than absent trials. Neurally, seen and unseen faces elicited greater neural signal than absent trials and showed similar neural patterns in the fusiform face area (FFA). Critically, neural signal in vmPFC correlated with SV for both seen and unseen faces, with similar neural patterns. In aVS, SV-related signal was only observed for unseen faces. Furthermore, mean face-related signal in FFA correlated with SV-related signals in aVS and vmPFC for unseen faces. These findings demonstrate that SV can be automatically computed in aVS and vmPFC without conscious awareness, suggesting a neural pathway by which subliminal information can influence value-based choice.

                Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential tool for assessing the neural activity behind mental fatigue, a factor that can influence both cognitive and physical performance. Mental fatigue influences alpha-band oscillations (8 to 12 Hz), reflecting cortical engagement and attention stability. In this study, EEG recordings from 109 participants in the Physionet open-source EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset (EEGMMIDB) were analyzed to characterize alpha power changes during sustained attention. Spectral analysis was performed across early and late task blocks to quantify alpha desynchronization over time. Participants demonstrated a consistent decrease in alpha power ( = -0.076 +/- 0.019 log10 units; p = 0.0001), indicating desynchronization associated with sustained attentional demand. These findings show the applicability of open-source EEG datasets for research. Furthermore, these findings support the isolation of posterior activation as a marker of mental fatigue through alpha desynchronization.

">Degraded neural coding of temporal fine structure with age predicts effortful listening in multi-talker environments</a></h4>

              
                Middle age represents a critical window for early detection of neurophysiological decline. Hearing loss is increasingly recognized as both an early marker of neural degeneration and a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Yet many adults report difficulty understanding speech in noise despite normal audiograms, highlighting the limitations of current clinical tests that fail to capture the underlying physiology or effort required for real-world listening. Beyond hearing thresholds, speech comprehension in complex environments depends on precise neural encoding of temporal fine structure (TFS) cues that convey pitch and spatial information. Here, we use a noninvasive EEG-based measure of neural phase-locking (frequency modulation following responses or FMFRs) to quantify TFS encoding in young and middle-aged adults with normal hearing thresholds. Middle-aged listeners exhibited reduced FMFR amplitudes and shallower discriminability slopes, reflecting diminished neural synchrony despite preserved hearing thresholds. Using a multi-talker speech task we further found that pupil-indexed listening effort was significantly greater in middle-aged adults despite matched accuracy across groups. Further, increases in listening effort were predicted by decreases in TFS encoding. Together, these results reveal that degraded neural encoding of TFS underlies subclinical listening difficulties and increased cognitive load, establishing the FMFR as a sensitive biomarker of hidden auditory neural decline.

">Connecting the dots - Recognition of artificial and natural shapes relies on representing points of high information</a></h4>

              
                Physiological and psychophysical evidence suggests that the visual system represents object outlines based on prominent curvature features, in particular regions of extreme curvature (such as convex maxima and concave minima). Curvature extrema often coincide with points of high information content (surprisal, in information-theoretic terms). However, this relationship is only correlational. To date, no study has directly compared the role of curvature extrema with the role of surprisal itself. Does the visual system selectively encode curvature extrema because they tend to be informative-because they are heuristic proxies for high-surprisal points along the contour-or does it directly encode informative points that happen often to be located at curvature extrema? We addressed this question in a series of shape-matching experiments, testing how curvature extrema and information content contribute to recognition. Observers (N = 7) matched a smooth test shape to one of two re-scaled shapes (target and distractor) constructed by connecting, with straight lines, points corresponding to (i) curvature maxima, (ii) both curvature maxima and minima, or (iii) points of maximum surprisal. A baseline condition used identical test and target shapes. Stimuli included artificial shapes composed of compound radial frequency patterns and natural shapes (animal outlines), the latter enabling us to disentangle curvature and information effects by restricting sampled points. Recognition performance was higher for natural than artificial shapes (95% vs. ~86%). Performance for shapes containing a few points of high information matched performance on trials containing all curvature extrema and baseline trials. It also exceeded performance for shapes with curvature maxima alone (65% vs. ~90%). These findings suggest that shape representation emphasizes features with high informational content rather than curvature extrema per se.

">Unmixing the Psychedelic Connectome: Brain Network Traits of Psilocybin</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin induces profound alterations in consciousness, yet prevailing neural models often describe a monolithic change in brain connectivity that may not fully capture the multifaceted nature of the psychedelic state. To test the hypothesis of a composite neural state, this study applied a robust, data-driven framework, Connectome Independent Component Analysis (connICA) with multi-level resampling, to resting-state fMRI data from healthy volunteers. The analysis decomposed connectomes into statistically independent functional connectivity traits ("FC-Traits"), revealing a primary trait whose expression was significantly modulated by plasma psilocin concentration, providing a whole-cortical signature of the drug's physiological action. Crucially, a second, distinct trait was also isolated, which independently associated with impaired performance on a visual divergent thinking task. These findings demonstrate that the acute psilocybin state is a composite of co-occurring neural processes. This validates the application of a decompositional connectomic framework to move beyond global descriptions and successfully disentangle the specific neural patterns underlying distinct pharmacological and cognitive correlates.

">Combinatorial Cell-Adhesion and Activity Codes Instruct Cortical Modality Identity</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of functional sensory modalities requires precise cortical arealization and thalamocortical connectivity. While early morphogen gradients broadly initiate cortical patterning, how sensory identity is specified and refined within these territories remains unclear. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we reveal distinct modality-specific identity genes in primary somatosensory and visual cortices at early stages. These genes are enriched in thalamo-recipient layers and linked to neuronal activity and cell adhesion. Disrupting early thalamic activity alters both cortical activity and the expression of a subset of these genes, demonstrating a causal role for thalamic input in sensory modality acquisition. Remarkably, a core set of identity genes is already differentially expressed embryonically, before thalamic innervation, and encodes cell-adhesion profiles matching those of sensory thalamus, potentially enabling homophilic interactions. Our findings support a two-step model: cortical cell-adhesion codes prime modality-specific thalamocortical targeting, which is subsequently refined by patterned thalamic activity to establish functional cortical modalities.

">An inhibitory feedback circuit mediating sleep need and sensory gating in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Many animals integrate sensory information during the day and sleep at night. How sensory processing during wakefulness contributes to making an organism tired at night, however, remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of excitatory helicon cells in Drosophila (ExR1), a distinct neural population dedicated to processing sensory information. Using combined optogenetics and voltage imaging, we show that helicon cells excite sleep-promoting R3m ring neurons and trigger a subsequent autoinhibition of R3m via voltage- and Ca2+-gated K+ channels such as Slowpoke. Investigating the flies' sleep patterns, we found that blocking synaptic output from helicon as well as RNAi-mediated knockdown of Slowpoke in R3m reduces sleep quality and leads to loss of nocturnal sleep, indicating that sleep need is generated via this route. Further, we show that excitation of R3m induces feedback inhibition of helicon cells via ionotropic GABA receptors. Knockdown of the ionotropic GABA receptor subunit Rdl in helicon cells increases sleep latency and causes sleep loss at the beginning of the night. We show that inhibition via Rdl facilitates nocturnal slow-wave activity which forms a sensory filter and prevents sleep disruption through auditory stimuli. We therefore uncover an inhibitory feedback circuit, in which neurons processing sensory information directly activate sleep promoting neurons to generate sleep need. At night, this sleep need is then converted into actual sleep, facilitated by the formation of a neural filter that stabilizes sleep/wake transition.

">Insular error network enables self-correcting intracranial brain-computer interface</a></h4>

              
                Error recognition is fundamental to adaptive behavior, enabling rapid compensatory action when outcomes deviate from expectations. Central to this function are neural circuits for performance monitoring, encoding cognitive signals that could support more reliable neural interfaces. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in epilepsy patients to enable a motor brain-computer interface (BCI) while sampling error-related activity across a distributed network. Our work reveals high-frequency population dynamics emerging in the anterior insula and propagating to the prefrontal cortex as the interface fails to follow the user's intention. We identify spatially organized insular responses to error processing and movement feedback, highlighting it as a heterogeneous hub linking action and outcome. Real-time integration of error responses enables a self-correcting neural interface that enhances usability by reducing the need for manual user intervention. Together, our work demonstrates a human intracranial BCI harnessing insular brain activity, integrating cognitive processes directly into device control.

">Micro-/nano-plastics accentuate Parkinson's Disease-relevant phenotypes in a Drosophila model</a></h4>

              
                Micro- and nano-plastic (MNP) particles are a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that are increasingly bioaccumulating in human tissues, particularly the brain. MNPs induce mitochondrial defects, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and neurotoxicity in cellular and organismal models. This raises the possibility that MNP exposure could cause or exacerbate neurological conditions associated with these pathological phenomena. Parkinson's Disease (PD), a common movement disorder characterised by degeneration of striatal dopaminergic neurons, and associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, represents such a condition. We therefore hypothesised that MNP exposure might interact with PD risk mutations affecting mitochondrial fidelity. We used a fruit fly model of PRKN-dependent PD associated with defects in mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control pathway, to test this hypothesis. We found that ingestion of MNPs at concentrations tolerated by wild-type controls selectively enhanced PD-relevant phenotypes - including progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration, movement defects, and sleep disruption - in this model of PD. Our data suggest that defects in mitochondrial quality control can increase vulnerability to MNP exposure, and more broadly, that MNPs may synergistically interact with existing genetic risk factors to worsen neurological disease.

">Mislocalisation of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm of either neurons or oligodendrocytes causes axonopathy and dysmyelination</a></h4>

              
                Neurons with large, myelinated axons are vulnerable to degeneration across the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) frontotemporal dementia (FTD) disease spectrum. The defining molecular pathology of this spectrum is mislocalisation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Even though cytoplasmic TDP-43 is prevalent in neurons and oligodendrocytes, how these molecular pathologies contribute to neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we developed humanised zebrafish in which we restricted TDP-43 to the cytoplasm of either neurons or oligodendrocytes. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 restricted to neurons led to a severe axonopathy, with extreme distal axonal swelling and reduced myelination. Axonopathy was mirrored by cell type specific loss of TDP-43 function from neurons, pointing to loss of function, rather than a toxic gain of function of mislocalised TDP-43, as driving this phenotype. Preventing oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination when TDP-43 was mislocalised in neurons exacerbated axonopathy, indicating that oligodendrocytes limit neurodegeneration. Indeed, when TDP-43 was mislocalised to the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes this also led to axonopathy and reduced myelination, pointing to complex contributions of neurons and oligodendrocytes to neurodegeneration.

">Critical neuronal avalanches emerge from excitation-inhibition balanced spontaneous activity</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal avalanches are sequences of neural activations that exhibit scale-invariant statistics, suggesting neural activity operates near a critical point. Theoretical studies proposed that the balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I), along with neuromodulation, are key factors influencing this critical behavior. Here, we performed in-vivo studies to investigate the role of E and I neurons in generating neuronal avalanches in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae. For this, we used double-transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing cell-type-specific fluorescent proteins and GCaMP6f, combined with immunostaining and selective-plane illumination microscopy to monitor spontaneous neuronal activity and neurotransmitter identity. We found that neural activity approached criticality at balanced E-I ratios but became disordered when E-I ratios were imbalanced. A stochastic network model operating at a critical point, where excitation and inhibition couplings are balanced and balanced amplification drives network avalanches, successfully reproduced the observed statistics of neuronal avalanches and their dependence on E-I ratio fluctuations.

">Distinct prior expectations shape tactile and proprioceptive localization</a></h4>

              
                When a mosquito lands on your finger, swatting it away requires your brain to calculate its location in the external space, which depends on the body's 3D posture. Two competing hypotheses explain how the brain solves this challenge: the integration hypothesis, where tactile signals are transformed into spatial coordinates by integrating touch and posture information; and the cueing hypothesis, where touch merely cues a location on the body whose position is specified via proprioception. Adjudicating between these hypotheses is nearly impossible without modeling the latent factors underlying somatosensory spatial perception. We fill this gap in the present study. We first formalized each hypothesis from a Bayesian perspective: If touch merely triggers proprioceptive localization (cueing hypothesis), tactile and proprioceptive localization should rely on the same Bayesian computations, with identical prior expectations about the mosquito's spatial location; If they involve distinct Bayesian computational processes (integration hypothesis), distinct prior expectations may shape tactile and proprioceptive localization. To test these predictions, we had nineteen participants localize either proprioceptive or tactile targets on their fingertips. We then fit their data with several Bayesian models of each hypothesis. Models allowing different prior distributions between modalities provided the best fit for most participants, with 17 out of 19 participants showing significantly different prior distributions across modalities. These provide strong computational evidence that tactile and proprioceptive localization rely on distinct computational mechanisms, a conclusion that has important implications for how we understand these everyday behaviors and their neural mechanisms.

">Active vision modulates early cortical stages of visual processing: Evidence from MEG and eye-tracking</a></h4>

              
                It has been hypothesized that the visual system anticipates upcoming visual input contingent on the execution of saccadic eye movements. In line with this idea, it has been shown that changes in visual input across saccades elicit stronger post-saccadic fixation-locked neural responses compared to no-change conditions; an effect known as the preview effect. In the present study, we demonstrate that this preview effect depends on active vision and cannot be explained by either classical or spatiotopic adaptation. In a gaze-contingent experiment, in which participants were cued to make saccades to object stimuli, we concurrently recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking data. The source-localized MEG signal was deconvolved with stimulus onset and eye movement events in order to account for systematic variation in gaze behavior related to the no-change (valid preview) and change (invalid preview) conditions. Crucially, preview effects in the primary visual and in ventral-occipital cortices were markedly larger when participants made saccades compared to replay blocks in which we simulated the visual consequences of saccades absent saccade execution, demonstrating that the preview effect cannot be simply explained by classic adaptation. A further control condition ruled out spatiotopic adaptation. Our results show that early visual cortical areas which are not known to exhibit saccadic remapping neurons still show signs of sequential neural history effects across saccades. Previous research might have overlooked this influence of active vision because of the lack of an invalid preview condition which breaks the correspondence between pre-saccadic extrafoveal and post-saccadic foveal stimulation.

">An integrative computational approach for obstacle avoidance during action selection</a></h4>

              
                Action selection in cluttered environments, where individuals must simultaneously pursue goals and avoid obstacles, presents a significant challenge for the brain. To understand the underlying mechanisms of action selection in such contexts, we propose a computational model that extends stochastic optimal control theory through a novel framework for obstacle avoidance. The model decomposes action selection as a weighted combination of individual control policies, each generated for either target approach or obstacle avoidance. By integrating value information from goals, obstacles, and actions into a unified measure of "relative desirability", the model dynamically determines the contribution of each policy to the overall action selection process. We evaluated the framework using simulated target-reaching tasks in cluttered environments based on previous human studies. The results showed that the model captures key features of human motor behavior, including the influence of obstacle properties on movement trajectories and the transient tendency to initiate movements toward obstacles before avoidance. This work offers new insights into the dynamic interaction between approach and avoidance behaviors, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding action selection in complex and naturalistic settings.

">Vectorial boundary representation of 3D layout in human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Human spatial navigation relies on the brains ability to visually represent the 3D layout of the environment. To understand how the brain encodes the layout information, it is crucial to identify the key features of environmental layout and how they are processed in the human brain. The vector coding principle, which highlight the role of boundary distance and orientation, provides a theoretical framework supported by physiological evidence from rodents. In this study, we developed a reconstruction approach to quantitatively estimate 3D layout information from natural indoor scene images. This approach enabled analyses of fMRI data from the large-scale Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) using vector-based models of 3D layout. To validate the NSD-based results and examine task-related dynamics, we further conducted fMRI and MEG experiments with navigation-related and non-navigational tasks. Controlling for low-, mid-, and high-level visual and semantic features of natural indoor scenes, we found a spatiotemporal dissociation between boundary distance and orientation representations in the human brain. Relative distance was encoded in the early visual cortex during early processing in a task-invariant manner, whereas orientation was represented in scene-selective higher visual areas during later processing and was modulated by navigation-related tasks. Importantly, task modulation manifested as feedback-induced enhancement of orientation coding in the early visual cortex. Together, these findings provide a novel perspective on how the human brain represents navigation-relevant information about the immediate surrounding environment, advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms that link perception to action in spatial navigation.

">CochleaNet: deep learning-based image analysis for cochlear connectomics and gene therapy</a></h4>

              
                With the emergence of gene and optogenetic therapies targeting deafness, the comprehensive analysis of the molecular anatomy and physiology of the cochlea has become ever more important. Here, we introduce CochleaNet, a deep learning-based framework to analyze volumetric imaging data obtained by light-sheet microscopy of decalcified, cleared and fluorescently labeled cochleae. CochleaNet covers the workflow from reconstruction of the cochlea to segmentation of inner hair cells, spiral ganglion neurons and their afferent synapses, to analyzing the expression of gene therapy products. We validated CochleaNet by comparison to manual image analysis. Trained on high isotropic resolution mouse data, CochleaNet was also applicable to the cochlea of the gerbil, another relevant animal model, and lower-resolution mouse data from a commercially available microscope. We conclude that the combination of light-sheet microscopy and image analysis with CochleaNet paves the way for rapid and reliable quantification of cochlear molecular anatomy and preclinical gene therapy outcomes.

">Eigenmode decomposition of asymmetries in whole-brain effective connectivity reveals multiscale hierarchical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The human brain is a complex, hierarchical system operating far from equilibrium, yet the mechanisms linking its directed network architecture to temporal irreversibility remain largely unknown. While prior studies have revealed functional and structural hierarchies, no framework has captured the hierarchical organization of the brain's directed network in relation to its non-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we present the first large-scale eigendecomposition of whole-brain effective connectivity (EC), estimated from resting-state fMRI using sparse Dynamic Causal Modeling. We isolate the irreversible component of EC, which encodes the directionality of information flow and forms a comprehensive hierarchical network of forward and backward interactions. This hierarchy strengthens in brain states approaching criticality, where slow, oscillatory modes dominate and reflects the influence of long-range anatomical connections that scaffold whole-brain information flow. Our decomposition provides the first multiscale quantification of temporal irreversibility, revealing dual counterpropagating streams along the unimodal-transmodal axis operating at distinct frequencies. Crucially, these hierarchical dynamics carry robust, individual-specific signatures, with unimodal networks contributing disproportionately to subject identifiability. Altogether, this work delivers the first dynamic, whole-brain characterization of effective connectivity-derived hierarchies across spatiotemporal scales and individuals, offering a unified framework for studying brain hierarchy, non-equilibrium dynamics, and subject identifiability.

">Dynamic interactions in human amygdala subregions support hierarchical processing of fearful faces</a></h4>

              
                Fearful-expression recognition is vital for survival, relying on rapid fear detection and fine-grained face encoding. However, how human amygdala subregions differentially implement these distinct cognitive components remains unclear. Here, we recorded intracranial EEG from lateral and medial amygdala in epilepsy patients performing an emotional face-matching task, and combined multivariate decoding, time-frequency and directed-connectivity analyses with intracranial stimulation. We found that the lateral subregion exhibited early, fear-specific theta/alpha-band (4-12 Hz) activity with higher decoding accuracy and directed transfer of fear-specific information to the medial subregion, which showed delayed and sustained activation. By contrast, the medial subregion encoded face-specific information at a later stage in the 2-16 Hz band with superior decoding accuracy, and then relayed this information back to the lateral subregion. Critically, intracranial stimulation yielded double-dissociable behavioural effects, with lateral stimulation disrupting early fear detection while medial stimulation accelerated neutral-face recognition. Together, our study delineates a hierarchically organized, temporally structured division of labour within the human amygdala and show that dynamic interactions underlie hierarchical processing of fearful expressions.

">A Novel Cell-Type Specific Circadian Reporter Mouse Reveals Self-Sustained Food Entrainable Nature in Enteric Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Global luciferase reporter gene technology is an important real-time readout for the analysis of circadian oscillations. However, because nearly all cells in the body possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators, developing cell-type-specific reporter systems is essential to dissect how these oscillators interact within complex multicellular tissues and are modulated by brain-body circadian signals. The intestine is a complex organ composed of diverse cell types with distinct origins and functions, and it exhibits robust daily rhythms in physiological activities driven by intrinsic circadian clocks. While the circadian regulation of the mucosal compartment, including the intestinal epithelium, has been relatively well characterized, the mechanisms governing the circadian rhythms in the cells of the muscularis externa remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel Cre-dependent Per2-luciferase reporter mouse that enables precise measurement of circadian oscillations in specific peripheral cell populations ex vivo and demonstrate its utility in revealing the hierarchical circadian chrono-architecture within the intestine. Ex vivo gut explants from mice expressing the reporter in one of five major cell types of the muscularis externa-enteric neurons (ENs), enteric glial cells (EGCs), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and muscularis macrophages (MMs)-exhibited robust, self-sustained circadian bioluminescence rhythms, indicating that all of these cell types possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators. Notably, ENs in the small intestine entrained more rapidly to feeding schedules than did those in the colon, revealing regional differences in food entrainment among the gut clocks. Moreover, the clocks of ENs, SMCs, and MMs shifted their phase in response to daytime-restricted feeding, whereas ICC clocks remained unaffected even after three weeks of restricted feeding. These findings demonstrate that distinct intestinal cell types possess unique entrainment properties and that feeding rhythms can induce heterogeneous phase shifts within the gut clocks. Given that circadian disruption, such as that caused by shift work, contributes to intestinal disorders, this reporter system could provide a powerful platform to dissect the mechanisms linking intercellular circadian desynchrony to intestinal homeostasis.

                Potato leaf diseases pose a serious challenge to global food security, often leading to considerable yield losses if not detected promptly. The growing maturity of deep learning has enabled automated, high-precision plant disease recognition, even on devices with limited computational resources. In this study, several lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) models--MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), EfficientNet-Lite, ShuffleNet, and SqueezeNet--are comparatively assessed for the task of potato leaf disease classification. The models were trained under identical preprocessing and fine-tuning conditions, incorporating checkpoint-based training for stability. Among the evaluated networks, ShuffleNet delivered the highest overall performance with 99% accuracy, 0.97 precision, 0.99 recall, and an F1-score of 0.98, making it well-suited for real-time field deployment. EfficientNet-Lite also demonstrated a strong balance between speed and accuracy (91.9%), outperforming both MobileNet variants. Conversely, SqueezeNet, though the most compact model, recorded lower metrics (76% accuracy), indicating limited feature discrimination capability. This analysis underscores the balance between efficiency, robustness, and predictive accuracy, providing practical insights for deploying deep learning models in precision agriculture and low-resource environments.

                The ability to recognize odor identity across a wide range of concentrations is essential for natural olfactory behaviors However how odor identity is represented in the early olfactory system remains an open question One theory proposes that glomeruli in the olfactory bulb along with their associated odorant receptors ORs are activated by odorants in a temporal order that conveys information about odor identity This order code is relatively robust to concentration changes as the rank order of glomerular activation by a given odorant remains similar across concentrations Alternatively the primacy coding theory suggests that odor identity is defined by the most sensitive ORs those that respond first collectively referred to as the primacy set To test these theories we measured glomerular responses to a large set of odorants in the mouse olfactory bulb using calcium imaging We found that receptor affinities can be embedded in a lowdimensional space D 10 with minimal loss of information Within this space we identified two clusters of glomeruli with distinct tuning properties that form independent odor representations These clusters may correspond to the two phylogenetic classes of ORs as revealed by both their functional characteristics and anatomical locations In the OR affinity space odorants evoke orderly activation waves whose directions can be used to define odor identities in the order coding model Finally we compared the order code and primacy model in predicting odor identity both across concentrations and across animals Despite containing less information overall the primacy model performed comparably to the order code We confirmed the primacy models prediction that each receptor tends to contribute to the primacy set of at least one odorant Analysis of binary odor mixtures revealed that mixture responses lie along geodesic lines connecting their component odors Together these findings suggest that odor information in the olfactory bulb may be represented through two complementary coding strategies the primacy and order codes.

">Selective distractor representations resolve multidimensional interference</a></h4>

              
                How can humans manage multiple sources of information competing for attention? To approach this question, we adopted a multi-dimensional task-set interference paradigm that requires individuals to handle distractions from three independent dimensions. Behavioral results suggest that people track prior interference from each dimension to selectively modulate their attentional gain. Testing the mechanism of this adaptation at the neural level requires measuring multi-dimensional task representations. To achieve this, we applied representational similarity analyses and encoding models to human EEG and investigated how the history of interference simultaneously affected the time-resolved representations of target and distractor dimensions. EEG analyses revealed that target and distractor features are initially encoded in parallel, but distractors are rapidly suppressed around 250 ms, with suppression scaling with prior interference. Proactive task-level control enhanced the efficiency of this reactive suppression, without producing sustained preparatory changes. Behavioral and neural effects converged to show that dimension-specific interference and adaptation are associated with the speed of visual integration of each dimension, as captured by a connectionist model with temporal integration. Altogether, these results suggest that proactive control mechanisms operate on the speed and efficiency of a reactive suppression mechanism that constrains selective distractor representations from biasing the response process.

">A Load-Induced Energetic Tipping Point Explains Selective Vulnerability of Substantia Nigra Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are selectively vulnerable in Parkinson's disease, while closely related neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are comparatively spared. Although mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium stress, and -synuclein aggregation have each been implicated, none alone explains why anatomically similar populations exhibit such different fates. Here we develop a minimal two-variable energetic model that captures only mitochondrial functional capacity, energetic reserve, and the combined load from axonal arborization and calcium handling. Despite its simplicity, the model reveals that increasing structural load deforms the energetic landscape until a saddle-node bifurcation emerges, producing coexisting healthy-energy and collapsed-energy states. SNc-like neurons, which bear extreme axonal and calcium-handling demands, reside inside this bistable regime, operating near a separatrix that renders them vulnerable to even modest metabolic perturbations. In contrast, VTA-like neurons lie outside the bistable window and robustly return to their high-energy state following similar disturbances. The model reproduces hallmark features of Parkinsonian degeneration - long periods of stability, sudden irreversible collapse, and population-specific susceptibility - using only the geometry of load-dependent energy regulation. These findings suggest that selective SNc vulnerability arises not from unique molecular defects, but from the fundamental dynamical structure imposed by their extraordinary anatomical and physiological load.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sharing personal life stories fosters close relationships and enhances mental wellbeing. When recalling negative experiences, individuals often engage in counterfactual reconstruction—imagining how events could have unfolded differently (eg “<span style="font-style:italic;">If only…</span>”). This study used fNIRS hyperscanning to examine how different storytelling modes influence interpersonal neural synchronization (INS). Dyads (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 114) took turns speaking and listening while recounting negative experiences either factually (Real-Memory retelling, RM) or counterfactually (Counterfactual Reconstruction, CF). Participants were assigned to a no-feedback (monologue) or feedback (interactive dialogue) condition. In the no-feedback group, RM elicited stronger INS than CF between the speaker's right dlPFC (dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex) and the listener's left dlPFC/FPC (frontopolar cortex)—regions involved in executive control—whereas CF elicited stronger INS than RM from the speaker's left temporal parietal junction (TPJ) (mentalizing) to the listener's left dlPFC. In the feedback group, CF elicited weaker INS than RM from the speaker's left TPJ to the listener's left dlPFC. Additionally, INS during CF was positively correlated with the emotional empathy scores of the more empathic partner in each dyad. These results suggest that INS patterns reflect distinct cognitive and social demands of factual vs. counterfactual storytelling and are modulated by empathy. We propose that such neural alignment underpins a shared workspace supporting interpersonal communication.</span>

We conducted a behavioral task of conceptual similarity rating for emotional words, and emotion categorization tasks for emotional words and faces while recording electroencephalographic signals. We also performed a representational similarity analysis to assess the degree of correspondence between the representations of emotion concepts and categories with emotional faces over time. The results showed that the behavioral representations of emotion categories and concepts were successively correlated with the neural representations of the late processing stage for emotional faces at ~ 600–800 ms and ~800–1,000 ms, respectively. Furthermore, the representation of visual features of emotional faces was correlated with the neural representation of the early processing stage for faces (120–160 ms). Together, these results suggest that there is a temporal hierarchy in facial emotion perception that proceeds from visual to emotionally categorial to conceptual feature processing, providing electrophysiological evidence in support of basic emotion theory.</span>

We identified that treatment of the rpIC with a cocktail containing the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 and the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP35348 enhanced restraint-evoked tachycardia, whereas the same pharmacological approach in the cpIC decreased this response. Treatment of the rpIC with the nonselective ionotropic glutamate receptors antagonist kynurenic acid decreased the drop in tail skin temperature, and GABA receptor antagonism caused an opposite effect. Restraint increased Fos-positive cells in rpIC and cpIC, and local treatment with the glutamate receptor antagonism decreased this effect in both subregions. These data suggest a site-specific control of stress-evoked tachycardia by GABAergic mechanisms in the pIC.

Participants performed cue-variant WM tasks with retro-cue, refresh-cue, and no-cue trials. The cues instructed participants to either refocus or refresh one of the memorized stimuli (a face or a scene) during the retention interval. Univariate, multivariate, and functional connectivity analyses revealed that retro and refresh cues engaged overlapping brain regions but also exhibited distinct activation patterns. Whole-brain analyses showed overlapping activations and decoding patterns in the ventral occipitotemporal and posterior brain regions. Region-of-interest analyses confirmed the selective modulation of category-specific visual areas by both cues. Functional connectivity analyses further revealed inter-regional correlations between the prefrontal cortex and visual areas for both cues. Importantly, the multivariate pattern analysis revealed distinct effects in the prefrontal and parietal cortices (PFC and PPC): retro cues exerted a greater influence on representational patterns in the PFC, whereas refresh cues had a greater impact on patterns within the PPC. Taken together, this study provides direct evidence that refocusing and refreshing rely on both distinct and overlapping neural mechanisms to support WM maintenance.</span>

<p>The study investigated the spatial distribution and myelination status of dopaminergic fibers coursing through the medial forebrain bundle (mfb) in a rodent depression model (Flinders Sensitive Line, FSL) and Control animals, in males and females. All dopaminergic fibers examined were small diameter, unmyelinated and mainly restricted to the dorsolateral quadrant on the mfb's anterior–posterior (AP) axis. Fiber densities were similar, except at segment AP −2.8 mm: here FSL males had significantly fewer DA fibers vs. Control males, and vs. FSL females. Divergence in phenotype and stimulation-evoked responses reported previously could be due to differences in the recruited DAergic fibers.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>It has been hypothesized that the rapid/long-lasting antidepressant action observed following medial forebrain bundle DBS in clinical trials of Treatment-Resistant Depression patients could partially be driven by modulation of the midbrain-to-forebrain dopaminergic fibers. The study investigated the spatial distribution and myelination status of dopaminergic fibers within the rodent equivalent structure in a preclinical depression model, the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL). Fixed, sliced brain sections were double stained with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase/anti-dopamine-β-hydroxylase antibodies to distinguish dopaminergic from noradrenergic fibers, and with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase/anti-myelin antibodies to specifically investigate myelination. Quantification was done at six predefined segments. The dopaminergic fibers coursing through the medial forebrain bundle were small diameter, unmyelinated and mainly restricted to the dorsolateral quadrant on the AP axis. Analyses across six predefined planes revealed significantly fewer dopaminergic fibers in FSL males (vs control males, and vs. FSL females) at AP −2.8 mm, the segment corresponding to the medial forebrain bundle DBS target in the rat. No differences were observed elsewhere along the medial forebrain bundle. Previously reported differences in stimulation-evoked dopamine release in the FSLs could be due to differences in the numbers of recruited dopaminergic fibers.</p>

                Background Head and neck cancer (HNCs) is a major health issue worldwide, and India has contributed to approximately 2.4 lakh new cases in 2022. Definitive chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced disease but carries a risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) that add to morbidity, hospitalization, cost, and possible delay in treatment. The increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has also contributed to management burden. This study aimed to assess the microbiological profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns of lower respiratory tract infections in patients with head and neck cancer receiving chemoradiation. Methods Patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and who developed LRTIs were included in the study. Sputum and tracheostomy suction tip cultures were obtained and processed using standard microbiological techniques such as Gram staining, biochemical tests, and VITEK-2 automated systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and EUCAST recommendations. Clinical and treatment-related factors were documented and compared using SPSS version 23.0, with descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and logistic regression models. Results Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequently isolated pathogen (35.0%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%). The pathogens were strongly resistant to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins but were susceptible to carbapenems and aminoglycosides in the majority of isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen in all age groups and chemotherapy regimens (p<0.001). Conclusion LRTIs in patients with HNC treated with chemoradiation were mainly caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance patterns are crucial for directing empirical antibiotic therapy, minimizing treatment delays, and enhancing clinical outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-902/v2?src=rss">Graph-based epidemic modeling of West Nile Virus: Forecasting and containment [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The increasing prevalence of vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus (WNV) highlights the critical need for predictive modeling tools that can guide public health decision-making, particularly given the absence of effective vaccines. We developed a modular computational framework that simulates and analyzes WNV transmission dynamics through compartmental models capturing the intricate ecological interactions among avian hosts, mosquito vectors, and human populations. Our system integrates epidemiological parameters with customizable intervention mechanisms, facilitating the assessment of scenario-specific mitigation approaches. Distinguishing itself from conventional static models, this framework enables users to model dynamic, time-sensitive interventions including targeted mosquito control and strategic bird population management—the two principal containment strategies currently employed against WNV. Using simulations that reflect realistic outbreak scenarios, we evaluated how varying intervention intensities and implementation timings affect epi- demic progression. Our findings reveal that early implemented, dual-target strategies addressing both vector populations and avian reservoirs can substantially reduce transmission dynamics and minimize human exposure risk. This framework serves as a comprehensive decision-support platform for policymakers and vector control agencies, delivering mechanistic insights into the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions against zoonotic pathogens within complex ecological systems. The tool’s modular design and scenario-testing capabilities make it particularly valuable for proactive outbreak preparedness and evidence-based intervention planning.

                Background Antibiotic resistance in oral pathogens such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococcus faecalis necessitates alternative antimicrobial strategies. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising approach that utilizes a photosensitizer (PS), light, and oxygen to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. This study evaluated the efficacy of two natural photosensitizers, curcumin and chlorophyll (from Medicago sativa L.), for the photodynamic inactivation of these bacteria. Methods Planktonic cultures of A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis were subjected to PDI using a 405 nm diode laser at various energy densities. The bacteria were treated with either curcumin (1.6 mg/mL) or chlorophyll (1.6 mg/mL) prior to laser irradiation. Bacterial viability was assessed using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. Groups without PS and without light served as controls. Results At an energy density of 1.59 J/cm2, laser irradiation resulted in a reduction of 35.8% and 36.7% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis, respectively. The addition of chlorophyll significantly enhanced bacterial reduction to 64.4% and 69.3%. Curcumin demonstrated superior efficacy, achieving bacterial reduction of 89.8% and 89.4% for A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis, respectively. The differences between the PS groups and the control groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusions Curcumin is a significantly more effective natural photosensitizer than chlorophyll from Medicago sativa L. for the photodynamic inactivation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis. These findings point to the prospect of curcumin-based PDI as a potent therapeutic alternative for combating resistant oral infections.

                Background Frozen shoulder (FS) is a common musculoskeletal condition characterized by inflammatory contracture of the glenohumeral joint capsule, leading to restricted active and passive range of motion, particularly in external rotation. Eccentric control exercises have demonstrated effectiveness in managing various upper limb disorders, including subacromial impingement, tennis elbow, and rotator cuff tendinopathy. However, there is limited evidence on their efficacy in individuals with frozen shoulder. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of eccentric control exercises on pain, functional disability, range of motion, psychosocial outcomes, and patient satisfaction in individuals with FS and mild to moderate disability. Methods A single-group pre-post design was used. Twenty patients with clinically diagnosed FS and mild to moderate disability participated. All underwent 20 sessions of supervised eccentric control exercises over four weeks. Outcome measures included the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), shoulder range of motion (flexion, abduction, hand-behind-back, and external rotation), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK), and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention (4 weeks), and follow-ups at 3 and 6 months. A 6-point Likert scale was used to measure patient satisfaction post-intervention. Data were analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA. Results All outcome measures showed statistically significant improvement post-intervention (p < 0.05), with the benefits maintained at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Effect size indices at 4 weeks demonstrated a large treatment effect across all variables, suggesting strong clinical relevance. Conclusions Eccentric control exercises significantly improved pain, functional disability, range of motion, kinesiophobia, pain self-efficacy, and patient satisfaction in individuals with frozen shoulder and mild to moderate disability. These findings support the incorporation of eccentric training in rehabilitation programs for frozen shoulder.

                Background Networking plays a pivotal role in achieving business success and mitigating startup failures. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the networking experience of startup entrepreneurs for the growth of their businesses. Methods A qualitative semi-structured interview was conducted mainly in Bangalore and the Delhi regions of India. Using a cluster sampling method, interviews were held with 36 startup entrepreneurs. These startup owners were mainly from Bangalore and Delhi. The age group, gender, demographic profile, and popular startup sector of these startup owners have also been analyzed in this study. The data were analyzed using Atlas. Ti software. Results The qualitative findings revealed four overall themes related to networking, namely, the “role of networking for the success of the startups”, “supportive environment for networking”, “crucial stages of networking” and “role of past working experience of entrepreneurs”. It was found that most entrepreneurs leverage prior work experience to interact effectively in business, utilizing skills such as communication, leadership, and market intelligence. Conclusion Entrepreneurs mainly prefer networking with colleagues and their ex-bosses in building and creating formal networking. During crises, network members provide expert advice, moral support, and connections to specialists, which helps them solve problems and access new opportunities. Networking is crucial mainly in the early stage of a startup, where connections and relationship structures are needed for navigating upcoming challenges.

                This study employs a meta-analytic approach to synthesize empirical evidence on the psychological and behavioral determinants of fast fashion consumption. Integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with brand-related constructs—perceived scarcity, perceived quality, and self-congruity—this research examines how these factors shape consumer attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, consumption intentions, brand loyalty, and word-of-mouth. Using studies published between 2004 and 2024, a random-effects meta-analysis reveals that brand attitude is the strongest predictor of purchase intention, while self-congruity with fashion brands significantly enhances all TPB components. Perceived quality exerts a cross-cutting influence on both cognitive and social evaluations, reinforcing the multidimensional nature of consumer judgments. The findings extend the TPB framework by embedding symbolic and perceptual brand dimensions, offering a more comprehensive explanatory model of fashion consumption. From a managerial perspective, the results suggest that marketing strategies emphasizing authentic scarcity cues and alignment with consumers’ self-identity can strengthen emotional attachment, perceived control, and loyalty. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications for designing culturally sensitive and identity-driven branding strategies in the fast fashion sector.

                A diffuse and heavily calcified coronary lesion represents a complex clinical scenario, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. The optimal management, whether percutaneous coronary intervention, surgery, or medical treatment, remains debatable. A 64-year-old male was referred to our outpatient clinic with persistent typical chest pain. Coronary angiography revealed diffuse and heavily calcified lesions with 75% stenosis at the proximal to middle LAD. A physiological assessment was performed using a hybrid approach of resting full-cycle ratio (RFR) and fractional flow reserve (FFR). Initial RFR was inconclusive (0.91). Follow-up FFR measurement supported the indication for stenting. Lesion characterization using intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a thick, long, and heavily calcified lesion with an OCT Calcium score of 4. The minimal lumen area (MLA) was only 1.78 cm2 and indicative of stent deployment since the MLA was less than 3 mm2. Three runs of rotational atherectomy were performed, followed by non-compliant balloon dilatation and two DES implantations. The procedure was successful with TIMI flow grade 3 and optimal OCT evaluation. The combination of hybrid physiological assessment and intravascular imaging is an effective and efficient strategy for managing complex diffuse-calcified coronary lesions.

                Background Adrenal pseudocysts are rare and usually asymptomatic lesions of the adrenal gland, often discovered incidentally during imaging or post-mortem examination. When large, they may cause compressive symptoms. We report a case of a giant adrenal pseudocyst presenting with flank pain and dysuria. Case presentation A 70-year-old man presented with left flank pain, upper abdominal pressure, and dysuria for three months. Imaging revealed a large left retroperitoneal cystic mass displacing adjacent organs. The patient underwent surgical excision with left adrenalectomy. Histopathology confirmed a giant adrenal pseudocyst. Discussion Adrenal pseudocysts are uncommon and often misdiagnosed preoperatively. Symptoms are typically related to mass effect when lesions are large. CT imaging helps localize the lesion, but definitive diagnosis relies on histopathology. Surgical excision is recommended for symptomatic or large lesions. Conclusion Giant adrenal pseudocysts are rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal cystic masses. Surgery is indicated in symptomatic or uncertain cases to relieve symptoms and confirm the diagnosis.

                Background Women’s financial empowerment remains a critical component of inclusive development in sub-Saharan Africa, yet its realization is often constrained by socio-cultural factors. In Uganda, Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) play a pivotal role in improving women’s access to credit, savings, and financial literacy. However, the influence of cultural norms on the effectiveness of SACCO strategies has not been adequately explored. This study therefore examined the mediating role of cultural factors in the relationship between SACCO strategies financial training, savings, credit access, and government policy and women’s financial empowerment in Masaka District, Uganda. Methods The study adopted a mixed-methods descriptive cross-sectional design under the pragmatic paradigm. Data were collected from 340 women SACCO members and 10 managers using structured questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and hierarchical multiple regression, while qualitative data were thematically analyzed. Instrument reliability (Cronbach’s α ≥ 0.70) and validity were confirmed, and ethical approval was obtained from the Kampala International University Research Ethics Committee. Findings Results indicated that SACCO strategies significantly enhance women’s financial empowerment (R2 = 0.304, F(4,335) = 36.526, p < 0.001). Financial training exerted the strongest positive influence, while access to credit showed mixed outcomes due to high interest rates and repayment pressures. Cultural factors partially mediated these effects, strengthening the impact of financial training but constraining credit and savings outcomes through patriarchal norms and spousal control. Conclusions SACCO strategies are instrumental in promoting women’s empowerment when implemented within supportive cultural environments. Policymakers and SACCO managers should adopt gender-sensitive training, flexible credit terms, and culturally responsive community engagement to ensure equitable and sustainable empowerment outcomes.

                Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention for solving differential equations, yet their efficiency is often hindered by the need for intricate and computationally costly loss-balancing techniques to address residual term imbalance. This paper introduces a direct differential equation term scaling framework that removes the loss-balancing bottleneck entirely. By scaling each term in the governing equations using characteristic physical dimensions, the proposed method ensures numerical consistency across all contributions, eliminating the need for adaptive weighting during training. This not only simplifies the PINN formulation but also improves stability and convergence. The approach is validated on challenging nonlinear one-dimensional elasticity problems, demonstrating that high-accuracy solutions can be obtained with compact neural network architectures and reducing floating-point operations by at least two orders of magnitude. A reverse scaling step restores the solution to the original physical domain, preserving physical interpretability. The results demonstrate that direct term scaling transforms PINN training into an efficient, and easily deployable process, paving the way for broader adoption in computational mechanics and other physics-driven domains.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) is an evolutionarily conserved brain nucleus that receives direct input from the habenula (Hb). In zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>), it is involved in decision-making dependent on the idiothetic perception of the status of the body, such as head direction and posture. It is also known that the potentiation of the Hb–IPN–griseum centrale (GC) circuit makes fish resilient to stress in coping with fear and social conflict. To address why the same neural circuit controls these two distinctive physiological aspects, we performed anterograde and retrograde trans-synaptic viral tracing, retrograde mono-synaptic viral tracing, and lipophilic dye tracing to map the connectivity from the dorsal and intermediate IPN. We revealed reciprocal connections of d/iIPN and GC neurons with multiple brain regions for sensory inputs, including interoceptive systems that receive proprioception and the perception of balance and water flow, autonomic nervous systems for visceral control, and exteroceptive systems that receive vision and olfaction through the Hb. The positively labeled signals also cover the emotional regulatory system (i.e., serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine neurons) and the motor control system that administers the presentation of behaviors. Our anatomical results imply that multimodal sensorimotor information may converge in the Hb–IPN–GC circuit, hinting at its possible involvement in integrating inner states for responses to upcoming external challenges and in regulating allostasis through anticipatory biological reactions.</p>

                Background The regulation of receptor expression is crucial for fine-tuned signal transduction. Notch signaling is a key signaling pathway involved in retinal development. Compared to the knowledge on this signaling pathway in the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells, less is known about its involvement in earlier stages of retinal progenitor cell differentiation and its regulation, although NOTCH1, and probably NOTCH3, are involved in earlier stage differentiation. We aimed to clarify the timing of Notch receptor expression in undifferentiated retinal progenitor cells and elucidate the possible involvement of chromatin remodeling in the regulation of Notch receptor expressions. Methods We re-analyzed publicly available human fetal retina single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data (GSE183684) using Seurat/Signac pipelines. Results On days 59, 74 and 78, we observed NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 mRNA expressions in early retinal progenitor cells, which diminished at later stages of differentiation. Integration of single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq revealed that chromatin remodeling in part of the NOTCH1 and NOTCH3 loci were accompanied by transitions in their mRNA expressions. Importantly, the NOTCH1 locus, which showed chromatin remodeling, contained multiple binding motifs for transcription factors important in early retinal progenitor cell differentiation. Since genome-wide investigation of transcription factor binding motifs showed enrichment of such motifs for the early retinal progenitor cell-associated transcription factors (LHX2, RAX and VSX2), the motifs in the NOTCH1 locus might be of biological significance rather than observed by chance. Indeed, footprinting analysis suggested actual binding of those transcription factors (LHX2, RAX and VSX2) and their motifs in the whole genome, strengthening potential involvement of these transcription factor activities in early retinal progenitor cell differentiation. Conclusions These results suggest that chromatin remodeling may be involved in the differential expression of NOTCH1, although another type of Notch mRNA expression regulations may also exist.

Introduction <p>Influenza continuously evolves to escape population immunity, which makes formulating a vaccine challenging. Antigenic differences between vaccine strains and circulating strains can affect vaccine effectiveness (VE). Quantifying the antigenic difference between vaccine strains and circulating strains can aid interpretation of VE, and several antigenic distance metrics have been discussed in the literature. Here, we compare how the predicted breadth of vaccine-induced antibody response varies when different metrics are used to calculate antigenic distance.</p> Methods <p>We analyzed data from a seasonal influenza vaccine cohort that collected serum samples from 2013/14 – 2017/18 at three study sites. The data include pre- and post-vaccination HAI titers to the vaccine strains and a panel of heterologous strains. We used that data to calculate four different antigenic distance measures between assay strains and vaccine strains: difference in year of isolation (temporal), <i>p</i>-Epitope (sequence), Grantham’s distance (biophysical), and antigenic cartography distance (serological). We analyzed agreement between the four metrics using Spearman’s correlation and intraclass correlation. We then fit Bayesian generalized additive mixed-effects models to predict the effect of antigenic distance on post-vaccination titer after controlling for confounders and analyzed the pairwise difference in predictions between metrics.</p> Results <p>The four antigenic distance metrics had low or moderate correlation for influenza subtypes A(H1N1), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. A(H3N2) distances were highly correlated. We found that after accounting for pre-vaccination titer, study site, and repeated measurements across individuals, the predicted post-vaccination titers conditional on antigenic distance and subtype were nearly identical across antigenic distance metrics, with A(H1N1) showing the only notable deviation between metrics.</p> Discussion <p>Despite moderate correlation among metrics, we found that different antigenic distance metrics generated similar predictions about breadth of vaccine response. Costly titer assays for antigenic cartography may not be needed when simpler sequence-based metrics suffice for quantifying vaccine breadth.</p>

Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters for several aquatic and terrestrial species. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and genetic biocontrol strategies. Close-kin methods have advantages over traditional mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with movement behavior. Here, we extend CKMR methods to accommodate spatial structure alongside life history for mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for parent-offspring and full-sibling pairs in a spatial context, where an individual in each pair may be a larva or adult. Using the dengue vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> as a case study, we use an individual-based model of mosquito life history to test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating parameters such as mean dispersal distance, daily staying probability, and the strength of a barrier to movement. Considering a simulated population of 9,025 adult mosquitoes arranged on a 19-by-19 grid, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased and precise estimates of mean dispersal distance given a total of 2,500 adult females sampled over a three-month period using 25 traps evenly spread throughout the landscape. The CKMR approach is also able to estimate parameters of more complex dispersal kernels, such as the daily staying probability of a zero-inflated exponential kernel, or the strength of a barrier to movement, provided the magnitude of these parameters is greater than 0.5. These results suggest that CKMR provides an insightful characterization of mosquito dispersal that is complementary to conventional MRR methods.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in cancer progression, invasion, and response to treatment, particularly in regulating anticancer drug resistance and sensitivity. Identifying potential human miRNA-drug associations (MDAs) that manifest as resistance or sensitivity relationships offers valuable insights for cancer treatment and drug development. With the growing availability of biological data, computational methods have emerged as powerful tools to complement experimental approaches. However, limited attention has been paid to computational prediction of MDAs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically rely on known MDA information, overlooking the valuable insights available from multi-source data related to miRNAs and drugs. In this study, we present a multi-view fusion-based graph convolutional network with attention mechanism (MGCNA) to predict miRNA-associated drug resistance/sensitivity. Specifically, MGCNA integrates macro- and micro- level information of miRNAs and drugs to construct multi-view node features from different perspectives. The proposed multi-view graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder obtains miRNA and disease features from different views and learns adaptive importance weights of the embedding using an attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on manually curated benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGCNA outperforms existing baseline methods. Case studies of two common drugs further establish MGCNA’s effectiveness in discovering novel MDAs.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Intense electrical activity modifies the cellular properties of neurons to enable the nervous system to store information. The dentate gyrus (DG) plays a role in learning and memory and its principal cell type, the granule cell (GC), can fire vigorously during behavior. To explore how experience modifies GC electrophysiology, we harnessed the immediate early gene, Fos, to target a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor to neurons that are activated by experience and are hypothesized to encode information. Voltage imaging from these engram GCs in mouse hippocampal slices revealed distinct patterns of stimulation-evoked spiking that depended on prior experience. Compared to unchallenged mice, engram GCs from mice exposed to novelty burst more often, and have longer inter-spike intervals following the blockade of inhibition. Voltage imaging from randomly targeted non-engram GCs revealed distinct firing patterns that did not depend on novelty. Thus, experience modifies the firing of both engram and non-engram GCs in distinctly different ways. The altered bursting will tune the facilitation of transmission from engram GCs to their various postsynaptic targets, and thus redirect the flow of information through the hippocampus. The pattern of GC firing constitutes a substrate for the encoding of information and will alter how the DG processes sensory inputs.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Growing evidence underscores the importance of host-response/secondary-injury—likely influenced by genetics—in outcome variability post-traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intracranial hypertension and hemorrhage progression are critical secondary injuries in severe TBI; these are mediated by the SUR1-TRPM4 channel (a target in clinical trials). We aimed to deconstruct the complex network surrounding SUR1-TRPM4 and define the cumulative impact of key genetic variants on mechanistically connected secondary injuries/outcomes after severe TBI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This exploratory study analyzed 492 prospectively enrolled patients with severe TBI. A network of regulators, mediators, and effectors upstream/downstream of SUR1-TRPM4 was bioinformatically constructed. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were evaluated for multivariable model association with intracranial pressure, intraparenchymal hemorrhage progression, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) score. Weighted/unweighted polygenic-risk scores (PRS) were constructed and interrogated. Spatial modeling and functional predictions were determined. Single-cell cortical transcriptomic differences were assessed in a parallel murine TBI model.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ninety-seven genes (625 SNVs) were analyzed. Nineteen genes contained variants associated with all outcomes (intracranial pressure, hemorrhage progression, and GOS score; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Twenty-two genes (42 SNVs) retained significance for ≥ 1 outcome, with overlap across outcomes. Functions included Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transport/signaling, glutamate-clearance, neuroinflammation, and cell death. Single-cell analyses revealed cell-specific gene-expression differences. SNVs were brain-specific cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTLs)/missense/frameshift mutations suggesting high likelihood of biological impact. PRSs were associated with all outcomes with large effects, and markedly improved model explanatory power/performance (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup>, receiver operating characteristic [ROC]).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Polygenic variability in key nodes linked to SUR1-TRPM4 were associated with mechanistically related secondary injuries and outcome after severe TBI; findings suggest a major role of heritability. Functional implications indicate biological plausibility and identify novel targets. The data, whereas requiring validation, support a shift toward incorporating biologically relevant genetics in advancing precision medicine. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for financial stability, and sector-specific Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI-ML) models have proven superior in performance. However, a significant gap exists, as most models are designed for advanced economies, leaving their efficacy in emerging markets like India unexplored. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the applicability of these advanced models to predict bankruptcy within India’s dynamic trade services sector. Methods The research utilized a substantial sample of 5,527 Indian companies. To counter the challenge of having far fewer bankrupt firms than solvent ones, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed. The study then leveraged a comprehensive suite of eight popular AI-ML models, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. To add practical context, business rules based on key financial metrics—liquidity, profitability, and asset size—were integrated. Results The findings robustly demonstrate that AI-ML models can accurately predict bankruptcy in Indian trade services firms. A critical discovery was the variation in early warning signals between an analysis of the entire dataset (aggregate) and segmented groups of companies. This indicates that a one-size-fits-all approach obscures important, segment-specific risk factors. The segmented analysis successfully uncovered hidden risks that were not apparent at the aggregate level. Conclusions The study concludes that AI-ML models are highly effective for bankruptcy prediction in India’s trade services sector. For stakeholders like investors and creditors, the key takeaway is the superior value of a segmented analytical approach. This strategy maintains high predictive accuracy while revealing nuanced, specific risks. Ultimately, it provides a powerful, tailored tool for safeguarding financial interests in an emerging market context.

                Background In an increasingly competitive healthcare sector, delivering exceptional services is crucial for enhancing patient satisfaction and fostering long-term loyalty. However, the direct impact of leadership and governance on patient experience and retention remains underexplored. This study examines the relationships between corporate governance, service quality, patient satisfaction, and loyalty, with a particular focus on entrepreneurial leadership in healthcare organizations in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 384 executive patients across hospitals in Indonesia. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), with p-values reported to indicate statistical significance. Results The findings reveal that entrepreneurial leadership significantly enhances both corporate governance and service quality. Corporate governance positively influences patient satisfaction and loyalty. Service quality was found to moderately influence patient satisfaction, but had a stronger, direct effect on patient loyalty. Additionally, patient satisfaction emerged as a critical mediator in the development of patient loyalty. Conclusions This study provides valuable insights for healthcare managers and policymakers seeking to improve organizational performance and patient retention. Theoretically, it advances the understanding of how leadership and governance frameworks impact patient retention and service quality in the Indonesian context. Practically, the study offers actionable recommendations for hospital administrators to enhance patient satisfaction and loyalty by implementing entrepreneurial leadership, robust governance practices, and continuous service improvement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1250/v1?src=rss">The Effects of Hospital Noise Pollution and Noise Sensitivity on Patient`s Acoustic Comfort, Noise Annoyance, and Intention to Leave [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Hospitals are intended to serve as healing environments; however, they are frequently characterized by high levels of environmental noise pollution that can contradict their therapeutic purpose. This study aimed to investigate the complex relationships among hospital noise pollution, individual noise sensitivity, and significant patient-centered outcomes, including acoustic comfort, noise annoyance, and intention to leave the hospital. Methods This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in 2024 at a public hospital in Saveh, Iran. A stratified random sampling method with proportional allocation was used to select a sample of 226 hospitalized adult patients. Objective day-evening-night noise levels (Lden) were measured over 24 hours, while subjective data on noise sensitivity, acoustic comfort, noise annoyance, and intention to leave the hospital were collected using standardized questionnaires. Bayesian Network modeling combined with delta-p sensitivity analysis was applied to examine the relationships among the variables. Results The mean Lden in the studied hospital was found to be 57.95 dB (±6.61). The Bayesian Network analysis revealed that under conditions of high Level Lden, the probability of high annoyance, low acoustic comfort and high intention to leave increased by 12.4%, 6.3% and 5%, respectively. Under conditions of high-Level Sensitivity, the probability of these variables increased by 9.1%, 6.2 and 4.7 %, respectively. While these two variables are at high level, the most substantial positive variations occurred in high annoyance, low acoustic comfort and high intention to leave, with increases of 26.1%, 13.1% and 10.6%. Conclusion Noise levels in the hospital exceed international standards, negatively affecting acoustic comfort, increasing annoyance, and influencing individuals’ intent to leave. Personal noise sensitivity further intensifies these effects.

                Apathy is a common symptom across a wide range of neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, characterised by a loss of goal-directed action. It is associated with faster rates of cognitive and functional decline, poor prognosis, and high caregiver burden. Effective treatments remain elusive. In this article, we propose that apathy is not merely the result of actions becoming undesirable due to insufficient reward or an inflated sense of cost. Instead, actions become unnecessary due to a loss of prior precision on action outcomes in the context of the ‘Bayesian brain’. We outline the theoretical background and current evidence to support this framework and propose testable hypotheses regarding the behaviour, neuroanatomy, and neuropharmacology of apathy.

                Hypertension is a major cause of cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Using scRNA-seq in an angiotensin II mouse model, Schaeffer and Pacholko identify early endothelial, interneuron, and oligodendrocyte vulnerability linked to angiotensin II signaling, revealing molecular pathways that drive later neurovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment in hypertension.

                This study positions intermediate filaments (IFs) as functional drivers and molecular markers of glioblastoma invasion. van Bodegraven et al. reveal that vimentin expression correlates with pro-invasive markers in patients. They show that while IFs reduce glioblastoma cell deformability, they promote matrix degradation via MMP14 expression, which facilitates 3D invasion.

The proposed mechanism could inform therapeutic strategies for inducing undetectable levels of HIV without antiretroviral therapy.

                Deprivation amblyopia can be reversed by the temporary inactivation of one eye after the critical period. Here, Echevarri-Leet et al. show that this is caused by increased burst firing in the neurons that relay information from the retina to the visual cortex. Even inactivation of the amblyopic eye can drive recovery.

                Gastruloids derived from ES cells mimic embryonic patterning through robust self-organization. Mayran et al. uncover that this competence depends on a cadherin switch regulated by Snai1-driven E-cadherin repression and pluripotency exit. Unexpectedly, N-cadherin inactivation enhances morphogenesis, enabling proper rostro-caudal somite patterning without exogenous extracellular matrix, linking differentiation dynamics to self-organization.
