              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20109">A Unified Theory of Language</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.20109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation, self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

                arXiv:2508.20465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider motivation and value-alignment in AI systems from the perspective of (constrained) entropy maximization. Though the structures encoding knowledge in any physical system can be understood as energetic constraints, only living agents harness entropy in the endogenous generation of actions. I argue that this exploitation of "mortal" or thermodynamic computation, in which cognitive and physical dynamics are inseparable, is of the essence of desire, motivation, and value, while the lack of true endogenous motivation in simulated "agents" predicts pathologies like reward hacking.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20336">Adaptive Segmentation of EEG for Machine Learning Applications</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.20336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals. We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

                arXiv:2508.20363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mitigation of stress is a key challenge for all biological systems. Conditions of unresolvable stress have been associated with a diverse array of pathologies, from cancer to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, I unify insights from evolutionary and developmental biology with trauma psychology to present a novel framework for tumorigenesis which synthesizes stress-perception, tissue dysfunction, and the hallmarks of neoplastic growth. This view carries therapeutic implications, suggesting a reintegrative approach that seeks to return cancer cells to the homeostatic control of the surrounding tissue.

                arXiv:2508.20674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories, while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics through cognitive co-evaluation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20961">Distinct weak asymmetric interactions shape human brain functions as probability fluxes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.20961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective behaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the recording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks is expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data. Thermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by the brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high energy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy consumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not involved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide repertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy consumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by subtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We first show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced whole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the microscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns depending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function is a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the parameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal that the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and task-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and task-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed probability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs its functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction among the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.

                arXiv:2410.00258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a roadmap for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20378">Hyperbolic embedding of multilayer networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.20378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks offer a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across diverse domains, effectively capturing multiple types of connections and interdependent subsystems commonly found in real world scenarios. To analyze these networks, embedding techniques that project nodes into a lower-dimensional geometric space are essential. This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic embedding framework that advances the state of the art in multilayer network analysis. Our method, which supports heterogeneous node sets across networks and inter-layer connections, generates layer-specific hyperbolic embeddings, enabling detailed intra-layer analysis and inter-layer comparisons, while simultaneously preserving the global multilayer structure within hyperbolic space, a capability that sets it apart from existing approaches, which typically rely on independent embedding of layers. Through experiments on synthetic multilayer stochastic block models, we demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves community structure, even when layers consist of different node sets. When applied to real brain networks, the method successfully clusters disease-related brain regions from different patients, outperforming layer-independent approaches and highlighting its relevance for comparative analysis. Overall, this work provides a robust tool for multilayer network analysis, enhancing interpretability and offering new insights into the structure and function of complex systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20125">Improving Liver Disease Diagnosis with SNNDeep: A Custom Spiking Neural Network Using Diverse Learning Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision medicine.

A key neuronal parameter, the leaky time constant (LTC), governs temporal integration of information in Leaky Integrateand-Fire (LIF) neurons, yet its impact on feedforward SNN performance across different data modalities remains underexplored. This study investigates the role of LTC in a temporally adaptive feedforward SNN applied to static image, dynamic image, and biosignal time-series classification. Presented experiments demonstrate that LTCs critically affect inference accuracy, synaptic weight distributions, and firing dynamics. For static and dynamic images, intermediate LTCs yield higher accuracy and compact, centered weight histograms, reflecting stable feature encoding. In time-series tasks, optimal LTCs enhance temporal feature retention and result in broader weight sparsity, allowing for tolerance of LTC variations. The provided results show that inference accuracy peaks at specific LTC ranges, with significant degradation beyond this optimal band due to over-integration or excessive forgetting. Firing rate analysis reveals a strong interplay between LTC, network depth, and energy efficiency, underscoring the importance of balanced spiking activity. These findings reveal that task-specific LTC tuning is essential for efficient spike coding and robust learning. The results provide practical guidelines for hardware-aware SNN optimization and highlight how neuronal time constants can be designed to match task dynamics. This work contributes toward scalable, ultra-lowpower SNN deployment for real-time classification tasks in neuromorphic computing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20122">Spatio-Temporal Pruning for Compressed Spiking Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.20122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing. Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs. This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here, we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time, low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20123">Particle swarm optimization for online sparse streaming feature selection under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS) mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

                arXiv:2508.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes the Ecological Cycle Optimizer (ECO), a novel metaheuristic algorithm inspired by energy flow and material cycling in ecosystems. ECO draws an analogy between the dynamic process of solving optimization problems and ecological cycling. Unique update strategies are designed for the producer, consumer and decomposer, aiming to enhance the balance between exploration and exploitation processes. Through these strategies, ECO is able to achieve the global optimum, simulating the evolution of an ecological system toward its optimal state of stability and balance. Moreover, the performance of ECO is evaluated against five highly cited algorithms-CS, HS, PSO, GWO, and WOA-on 23 classical unconstrained optimization problems and 24 constrained optimization problems from IEEE CEC-2006 test suite, verifying its effectiveness in addressing various global optimization tasks. Furthermore, 50 recently developed metaheuristic algorithms are selected to form the algorithm pool, and comprehensive experiments are conducted on IEEE CEC-2014 and CEC-2017 test suites. Among these, five top-performing algorithms, namely ARO, CFOA, CSA, WSO, and INFO, are chosen for an in-depth comparison with the ECO on the IEEE CEC-2020 test suite, verifying the ECO's exceptional optimization performance. Finally, in order to validate the practical applicability of ECO in complex real-world problems, five state-of-the-art algorithms, including NSM-SFS, FDB-SFS, FDB-AGDE, L-SHADE, and LRFDB-COA, along with four best-performing algorithms from the "CEC2020 competition on real-world single objective constrained optimization", namely SASS, sCMAgES, EnMODE, and COLSHADE, are selected for comparative experiments on five engineering problems from CEC-2020-RW test suite (real-world engineering problems), demonstrating that ECO achieves performance comparable to those of advanced algorithms.

                arXiv:2508.20850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a generalizable encoding strategy that maps tactile sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille letter classification accuracy of 61 percent with a single organoid, which increased significantly to 83 percent when responses from a three-organoid ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing architectures.

HGB reflects local neuronal activity, while SWOs inform on the temporal characteristics of movement, especially during repetitive tasks.

Here, we looked at Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC) to assess interactions between SWO phase and HGB power. We use a publicly-available electrocorticography (ECoG) dataset recorded during repetitive motor execution (ME) and motor imagery (MI) of hand and tongue movements. We found channels with significant SWO-HGB PAC for all subjects and tasks, distributed across multiple brain regions. In the sensorimotor cortex PAC occurred at specific coupling phases and was primarily observed during ME, while frontal and temporal regions exhibited similar PAC levels across ME and MI but lacked distinct preferred coupling phases. When training decoders for movement detection, PAC underperformed compared to SWOs or HGB; however, it showed a strong correlation with accuracy when single-channel SWOs were used as decoding feature, highlighting its potential for channel selection. Weaker correlations were found when PAC was compared to task-related HGB power increases, suggesting that these represent distinct neural features.</span>

                <p>Cortical tracking of the speech envelope is an emerging, noninvasive measure of neurophysiological processing of speech that is being widely adopted. It demonstrates good ecological validity, as it allows researchers to study human processing of continuous, naturalistic speech containing dynamic spectrotemporal variations and rich linguistic content. While measures of cortical tracking have strong clinical and research applications, there is a lack of research documenting the reliability of these measures, including how they are affected by the stimulus and how the stimulus is represented, as well as electroencephalography (EEG) acquisition and analysis parameters. In this study, we measured the test&ndash;retest reliability of cortical tracking of the speech envelope across different stimuli (an audiobook vs a podcast), stimulus features (broadband envelope and its derivative, multiband envelope and its derivative), reference electrodes (average mastoid vs common average reference), and EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, full) in 26 neurotypical adults (20 female) to assess the potential for cortical tracking to serve as a reliable measure of speech processing. We also examined the amount of data required to achieve stable reliability estimates. We observed moderate to good test&ndash;retest reliability for most parameters with as little as 390&nbsp;s of data, supporting the utility of cortical tracking of the speech envelope as a reliable tool for assessing speech processing. The findings of this study will allow researchers to more effectively design and implement studies on cortical tracking in neurotypical adults and adults with language disorders.</p>

                <p>Sleep is a vital physiological phenomenon observed among almost all organisms. Although its exact purpose remains elusive, sleep has been linked to memory consolidation. In our present study, we investigated the role of sleep quality on sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Previous studies have shown that <I>tequila</I>, a serine protease, affects long-term memory (LTM) consolidation in flies. In the present study, we identified that the hypomorphic mutation in the <I>tequila</I> gene (<I>tequila<sup>f01792</sup></I>) leads to increased daytime sleep fragmentation at a very early age in male flies. Intrigued by this observation, we delved into further understanding the role of <I>tequila</I> in sleep-dependent memory consolidation by manipulating sleep duration using pharmacological methods such as GABA-A agonist. Inducing sleep using GABA-A agonist resulted in improved sleep during the day. This further led to a significant improvement in the LTM of these flies when compared with the vehicle-treated flies. In conclusion, daytime-dependent sleep fragmentation is possibly one of the reasons behind the LTM deficit observed in <I>tequila<sup>f01792</sup></I> flies. Furthermore, we observed that these flies had disturbed sleep only during the daytime, whereas in the night the flies had increased sleep duration. The increased sleep fragmentation during the daytime possibly leads to memory impairment and rescuing sleep fragmentation partially rescues memory consolidation. These outcomes suggest that the <I>tequila</I> gene is involved in sleep-dependent memory consolidation.</p>

Understanding animal movements at different spatial scales presents a significant challenge as their patterns can vary widely from daily foraging behaviours to broader migration or territorial movements. This challenge is of general interest because it impacts the ability to manage wildlife populations effectively. In this study, we conduct diffusion analysis based on European badger (<i>Meles meles</i>) movement data obtained from three different regions in the UK (Gloucestershire, Cornwall, and Northern Ireland) and fit a generalised linear mixed-effects model to examine the relationship between variables. We also feature a novel application of <i>extended dynamic mode decomposition</i> (EDMD) to uncover patterns relating to badger social organisation. By applying our approach to these different populations, we were able to assess its performance across a range of badger densities. A key result was that in some areas, EDMD clusters matched observed group home ranges, whilst in others, discrepancies likely arose because of population management interventions, such as badger culling. The methods presented offer a promising approach for studying territoriality and the impacts of management strategies on animal movement behaviour.

                <p>by Daiki Wakita, Satoshi Yamaji, Daiki Umetsu, Takeshi Kano</p>

Collective cell behavior is fundamental to structure multicellular organisms. There, constituting cells always have heterogeneous properties across cell types (macro-heterogeneity) and within a cell type (micro-heterogeneity). Many studies have described the existence of heterogeneity in various systems at the cellular level, whereas little has investigated its effect on the systems. Unveiling how heterogeneity plays a role in the collective behavior would build a bridge from microscopic to macroscopic biological phenomena. We use the muscle remodeling in <i>Drosophila</i> as a model system, in which drastic reconstruction processes involve the physical interactions of various cells. At the early pupal stages, hundreds of hemocytes vigorously migrate and decompose the larval muscles into fragments called sarcolytes. We used in vivo and in silico approaches to understand how the dynamics of the sarcolyte population are characterized by hemocytes and other cells in the environment. Our in vivo imaging showed that the sarcolyte population gradually reduced the speed while changing the spatial arrangements. We also found that the sarcolyte dynamics involve macro-heterogeneity, namely, the coexistence of fat body cells and hemocytes, as well as micro-heterogeneity within hemocytes. To computationally evaluate the effects of factors determining the speed and arrangement of the sarcolyte population, we built a mathematical model assuming simplified interactions between sarcolytes, hemocytes, and fat body cells. Our simulations showed that, firstly, the efficient spreading and stable pattern formation of sarcolytes were together achieved by a delayed emergence of fat body cells and the micro-heterogeneity in hemocyte motility. Secondly, based on the similarity of observed and simulated network-like arrangements of sarcolytes, spatial confinement was another factor that causes the stabilization of sarcolytes. This study provides a pattern formation mechanism by which macro- and micro-heterogeneous migratory cells generate a ‘dual-purpose’ collective behavior—quickly spreading particles throughout the field while efficiently organizing them into an orderly arrangement.

Apoptosis has been reported to drive regeneration in many species. Executioner caspases, the key effectors in apoptosis, are responsible for production and secretion of various pro-regenerative signals from apoptotic cells to the surrounding cells. However, whether executioner caspase activation (ECA) can promote regeneration without inducing apoptosis is poorly understood. Here, by generating transgenic mice carrying a lineage tracing system for cells that have experienced ECA, we demonstrate that ECA occurs in a few hepatocytes in homeostatic livers. The fraction of hepatocytes with ECA dramatically expands during regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) treatment. Interestingly, rather than undergoing apoptosis, the majority of hepatocytes with ECA survive and proliferate during liver regeneration. Inhibition of ECA in livers results in reduced hepatocyte proliferation and impaired regeneration, whereas increasing ECA to a level sufficient to kill hepatocytes also impedes regeneration, suggesting that ECA needs to be precisely controlled at a sublethal level. Mechanistically, we show that ECA promotes hepatocyte proliferation through enhancing JAK/STAT3 activity. Our work reveals an essential apoptosis-independent role of executioner caspases in liver regeneration.

Ratios between two metabolites are sensitive indicators of metabolic changes. Lipidomic profiling studies have revealed that plasma ether lipids, a class of glycero- and glycerophospho-lipids with reported health benefits, are negatively associated with obesity. Here, we utilized lipid ratios as surrogate markers of lipid metabolism to explore the processes underlying the inverse relationship between ether lipid metabolism and obesity. Plasma lipidomics data from two independent human cohorts (<i>n</i> = 10,339 and <i>n</i> = 4,492) were integrated to assess the associations between 82 lipid ratios and obesity-related markers in males and females. Results were externally validated using mouse transcriptomics data from the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (<i>n</i> = 152−227 across 74 strains). Genome-wide association studies using imputed genotypes from a population cohort (<i>n</i> = 4,492) were performed to examine the genetic architecture of the ratios. Findings showed that waist circumference (WC), body mass index, and waist–hip ratio were inversely associated with total plasmalogens relative to total phospholipids in both sexes. Ratios comprising product–substrate pairs positioned either side of enzymes involved in plasmalogen synthesis and degradation showed positive and negative associations with WC, respectively. Branched-chain fatty acids negatively correlated with WC, while omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids exhibited differing associations depending on their position within the pathway. Mouse transcriptomics corroborated these results. Genomics data showed strong associations between ratios containing choline-plasmalogens and single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the transmembrane protein 229B (<i>TMEM229B</i>) gene region. This work demonstrates the utility of lipid ratios in understanding lipid metabolism. By applying the ratios to multi-omic datasets, we identified alterations in enzymatic activity and genetic variants likely affecting ether lipid synthesis in obesity that could not have been obtained from lipidomics data alone. Additionally, we characterized a potential role for <i>TMEM229B</i>, offering new perspectives on ether lipid metabolism and regulation.

The placenta is a dynamic, embryo-derived organ essential for fetal growth and development. While all eutherian mammals have placentas composed of fetal-derived trophoblasts that mediate maternal–fetal exchange, their anatomical and histological structures vary across species due to evolutionary divergence. Despite the cellular heterogeneity of porcine trophoblasts in vivo, understanding the mechanisms driving porcine placental development has been limited by the lack of in vitro models replicating this heterogeneity. In this study, we derived swine trophoblast organoids (sTOs) from full-term porcine placentas, retaining key transcriptional signatures of in vivo trophoblasts. To identify conserved cell populations, we integrated Visium spatial transcriptomics from mid-gestation porcine placentas with single-cell transcriptomics from sTOs. Spatial transcriptomics revealed novel markers of the porcine uterus and placenta, enabling precise separation of histological structures at the maternal–fetal interface. The integration of tissue and sTO transcriptomics showed that sTOs spontaneously differentiate into distinct trophoblast populations, with conserved gene expression and cell communication programs. These findings demonstrate that sTOs recapitulate porcine placental trophoblast populations, offering a powerful model for advancing placentation research. Our work also provides a spatially resolved whole-transcriptome dataset of the porcine maternal–fetal interface, opening new avenues for discoveries in placental development, evolution, and health across mammals.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cortical malformations, including microgyria, are often associated with neurodevelopmental comorbidities such as epilepsy and cognitive impairments in humans. To investigate how early cortical disruption leads to persistent behavioral impairments, we employed a neonatal neocortical focal freeze lesion (FFL) model of polymicrogyria in male Wistar rats. Unilateral cortical lesions were induced at postnatal day 0 (P0), and molecular changes in hippocampal gene expression (glutamatergic signaling: <i>Grin1</i>, <i>Grin2a</i>, <i>Grin2b</i>, <i>Gria1</i>, <i>Gria2</i>; neuroinflammation: <i>Nlrp3</i>, <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Il1rn</i>; glial markers: <i>Gfap</i>, <i>Aif1</i>; neurotrophic factors: <i>Bdnf</i>, <i>Fgf2</i>) were analyzed at P21. Behavioral outcomes, including locomotor activity, exploratory behavior, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, and recognition memory, were assessed in adulthood (P70–P90). Neonatal cortical lesions induced subregion-specific alterations in hippocampal gene expression: <i>Grin2b</i> and <i>Gria1</i> expression decreased in the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus, while <i>Grin2a</i>, <i>Bdnf</i>, and <i>Fgf2</i> increased in the contralateral ventral hippocampus. These molecular changes were associated with subsequent cognitive deficits (impaired recognition memory) and emotional dysregulation (heightened anxiety-like behavior) in adult rats, alongside reduced exploratory activity. Basic motor functions and sociability remained unaffected, and seizure susceptibility (assessed via maximal electroshock threshold) was unchanged, highlighting the specificity of the observed impairments. Our findings suggest a potential mechanistic link between early-life cortical malformations with microgyrus formation, dysregulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurotrophic signaling, and persistent neurobehavioral deficits. These results underscore the translational relevance of the freeze lesion model for studying the neurodevelopmental trajectory of cortical malformation-related comorbidities.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a focal epilepsy extensively examined through advanced neuroimaging techniques to elucidate its pathophysiological mechanisms. This study investigates the differences in dynamic brain activity and gene expression in TLE patients. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were collected from 60 TLE patients and 30 healthy controls (HC). Dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) was employed to identify regions with dALFF variance differences, which were then designated as regions of interest (ROIs). Co-activation patterns (CAP) was constructed to compare brain dynamic changes. Pearson's correlation analysis and pathway enrichment analysis were used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms associated with atypical neural dynamics in TLE. Five CAP states were identified from the rs-fMRI data. Compared to HC, TLE with cognitive normal (TLE-CN) and TLE with cognitive impairment (TLE-CI) patients exhibited atypical state-specific temporal characteristics, including number of states (counts), fraction of time, persistence, resilience, and transition probability (TP) between states. Importantly, dynamic indicators of CAP states were significantly correlated with cognitive performance. Furthermore, 2752 genes were significantly associated with atypical dynamic brain states in TLE, with these genes primarily enriched in synapse-related pathways. This study offers novel insights into atypical neural dynamics from a temporal perspective. The brain network dynamics defined by CAP analysis deepen our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of TLE and TLE-CI, revealing a link between atypical neural architecture and gene expression in TLE.</p>

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>To assess the impact of SK channel agonists on seizure-like events (SLEs) in various seizure models in slices of the temporal cortex obtained from pharmacoresistant patients. SLEs were triggered by applying 4-aminopyridine (100 μM) to slices of the entorhinal cortex taken from both normal and pilocarpine-treated rats. Additionally, SLEs were induced in slices of the temporal cortex obtained from individuals who had undergone epilepsy surgery. In the case of human slices, SLEs were also provoked by increasing potassium levels along with the administration of either 4-AP (100 μM) or bicuculline (50 μM). The activation of SK2/3 channels by the compound CYPPA (<i>n</i> = 8) effectively prevented SLEs in slices from the brains of normal rats, pilocarpine-treated rats (<i>n</i> = 8), and in human cortex slices (<i>n</i> = 9) when SLEs were triggered by 4-AP. In human temporal cortex slices, CYPPA also demonstrated efficacy in preventing SLEs induced by an elevation in potassium concentration combined with bicuculline application (<i>n</i> = 5). SKA-31, exhibited efficacy in slices from normal rats (<i>n</i> = 8), rats treated with pilocarpine (<i>n</i> = 8), and in human slices (<i>n</i> = 7) when SLEs were provoked by 4-AP. However, its effectiveness was limited when applied to human tissue slices exposed to bicuculline and elevated potassium levels. The SK1 channel activator GW-542573X displayed only moderate anticonvulsant effects in the models under investigation. SK2 channels showed the highest effectiveness across the different epilepsy models. Sensitivity to the SK3 channel activator was found to be more pronounced compared to the other two activators studied.</p>

                Clarke et al. reveal that non-hematopoietic cells, fibroblastic in nature, located outside the islet of Langerhans, spontaneously present β cell antigens. These cells, associated with the post-capillary venule, express PD-L1. Their potential role in immune modulation is shown by their induction of a tolerance program in pre-activated CD4 T cells.

                Shaikh et al. demonstrate that basigin binds to and controls trafficking of mouse voltage-sensitive lipid phosphatase (mVSP). Basigin promotes plasma membrane localization of mVSP, allowing for control of its activity by the membrane potential. Functional characterization of electrochemical coupling shows phosphoinositide phosphatase activity in a physiological voltage range.

                Yokota et al. reconstruct a time course of the human hair cycle by temporally ordering single-cell transcriptomes of 19 skin samples, each containing a single hair follicle. This time course delineates dynamic changes in gene expression of 16 cell populations and in their interactions underlying the hair-cycle-dependent tissue remodeling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106654">Innate immunity and training to subvert original antigenic sin by the humoral immune response</a></h4>

              
                Originally defined in the context of influenza vaccines by Thomas Francis Jr. in the late 1950s, original antigenic sin (OAS) refers to the tendency of the immune system to preferentially recall B cell memory against primary antigen after secondary exposure to different but related antigen. This competes with the elicitation of <i>de novo</i> antibodies by lowering the frequency of antigen reception by the naïve B cell lymphocyte pool residing within secondary lymphoid organs. Consequently, OAS imposes a ‘primary addiction’ that modulates the target epitope specificity of the secondary antibody response and has wide-reaching consequences for vaccines that require seasonal updating, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2. Rationally designed vaccines that preferentially stimulate the production of <i>de novo</i> antibodies rather than those derived from recalled B cell memory are of central interest, particularly for universal vaccine formulations tasked with directing robust humoral immunity against these viruses which, due to their ongoing evolution, have ‘resisted’ conventional vaccine approaches. Largely absent from this discussion is an integrated evaluation of what Janeway famously called ‘the immunologists dirty secret’, that humoral immune reactions require stimulation by the innate immune system. In this perspective piece, we present a hypothesis that innate immune cells and trained immunity, a collective term for the epigenetic reprogramming that enhances responsiveness upon re-stimulation, provides a template for promoting <i>de novo</i> expansion of the naïve B cell repertoire over recallable memory. This natural control axis may inform the design of vaccines that seek to avoid primary addiction and OAS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105937">C-terminal tagging, transmembrane domain hydrophobicity, and an ER retention motif influence the secretory trafficking of the inner nuclear membrane protein emerin</a></h4>

              
                The inner nuclear membrane (INM), a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), sequesters hundreds of transmembrane proteins within the nucleus. We previously found that one INM protein, emerin, can evade the INM by secretory transport to the lysosome, where it is degraded (Buchwalter et al., 2019). In this work, we used targeted mutagenesis to identify intrinsic sequences that promote or inhibit emerin’s secretory trafficking. By manipulating these sequences across several tag and expression level combinations, we now find that emerin’s localization is sensitive to C-terminal GFP tagging. While emerin’s long, hydrophobic C-terminal transmembrane domain facilitates trafficking to the lysosome, extending its lumenal terminus with a GFP tag biases the protein toward this pathway. In contrast, we identify a conserved ER retention sequence that stabilizes N- and C-terminally tagged emerin by limiting its lysosomal flux. These findings underscore long-standing concerns about tagging artifacts and reveal novel determinants of tail-anchored INM protein targeting.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106557">Unsupervised pipeline for the identification of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons in high-density multielectrode arrays with ground-truth validation</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale extracellular recording techniques have advanced the study of neuronal circuits but lack methods to reliably identify cell types while scaling to thousands of neurons. We introduce spikeMAP, a pipeline for analyzing large-scale in vitro cortical recordings that combines spike sorting with cell-type identification using viral and optogenetic validation. SpikeMAP integrates data analysis with optogenetic, viral, and pharmacological protocols to dynamically probe distinct cell types while recording from large populations. The pipeline fits spike waveforms using spline interpolation to measure half-amplitude and peak-to-peak durations, applies principal component analysis and k-means clustering to isolate single-neuron signals, and uses linear discriminant analysis to optimize cluster separability. Channel source locations are determined through spatiotemporal spike waveform characteristics. Applied to mouse prefrontal cortex slices recorded on a 4096-channel array, spikeMAP effectively distinguishes regular-spiking excitatory neurons from fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons via action potential waveform, Fano factor, and spatial cross-correlations. This validated toolbox enables comprehensive characterization of neuronal activity across cell types in high-density recordings, offering a scalable approach to study microcircuit interactions in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100739">DeePosit, an AI-based tool for detecting mouse urine and fecal depositions from thermal video clips of behavioral experiments</a></h4>

              
                In many mammals, including rodents, social interactions are often accompanied by active urination (micturition), which is considered a mechanism for spatial scent marking. Urine and fecal deposits contain a variety of chemosensory signals that convey information about the individual’s identity, genetic strain, social rank, and physiological or hormonal state. Furthermore, scent marking has been shown to be influenced by the social context and by the individual’s internal state and experience. Therefore, analyzing scent-marking behavior during social interactions can provide valuable insight into the structure of mammalian social interactions in health and disease. However, conducting such analyses has been hindered by several technical challenges. For example, the widely used void spot assay lacks temporal resolution and is prone to artifacts, such as urine smearing. To solve these issues, recent studies employed thermal imaging for the spatio-temporal analysis of urination activity. However, this method involved manual analysis, which is time-consuming and susceptible to observer bias. Moreover, defecation activity was hardly analyzed by previous studies. In the present study, we integrate thermal imaging with an open-source algorithm based on a transformer-based video classifier for automatic detection and classification of urine and fecal deposits made by male and female mice during various social behavior assays. Our results reveal distinct dynamics of urination and defecation in a test-, strain-, and sex-dependent manner, indicating two separate processes of scent marking in mice. We validate this algorithm, termed by us DeePosit, and show that its accuracy is comparable to that of a human annotator and that it is efficient in various setups and conditions. Thus, the method and tools introduced here enable efficient and unbiased automatic spatio-temporal analysis of scent-marking behavior in the context of behavioral experiments in small rodents.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104456">A neural network model that generates salt concentration memory-dependent chemotaxis in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                A neuroanatomical minimal network model was revisited to elucidate the mechanism of salt concentration memory-dependent chemotaxis observed in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans</i> memorizes the salt concentration during cultivation, manifesting a pronounced taste preference for this concentration. The right-side head sensory neuron, designated ASER, exhibits a response to a decrease in salt concentration. The basal level of glutamate transmission from ASER has been demonstrated to transiently increase and decrease when the current environmental salt concentrations are lower and higher, respectively, than that during previous cultivation. Given the sensitivity of excitatory/inhibitory glutamate receptors expressed on the postsynaptic AIY interneurons, it can be anticipated that the ASER–AIY synaptic transmission will undergo a reversal due to alterations in the basal glutamate release. The neural network, derived from the hypothesis, reproduced the salt concentration memory-dependent preference behavior and revealed that the circuit downstream of ASE functions as a module that is responsible for salt klinotaxis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96515">Optogenetic silencing of hippocampal inputs to the retrosplenial cortex causes a prolonged disruption of spatial working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory allows us to keep information in memory for the time needed to perform a given task. Such fundamental cognitive ability relies on a neural circuit, including the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), connected to several cortical areas, functionally and anatomically, namely primary visual areas, and higher cognitive areas such as the cingulate, midcingulate, and subicular cortices. RSC bears intimate anatomical and functional connections with the hippocampus and has been implicated in integrating and translating spatial-temporal contextual information between ego- and allocentric reference frames to compute predictions about goals in goal-directed behaviors. The relative contribution of the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex in working memory-guided behaviors remains unclear due to the lack of studies reversibly interfering with synapses connecting the two regions during such behaviors. We here used eArch3.0, a hyperpolarizing proton pump, to silence hippocampal axon terminals in RSC while animals perform a standard delayed non-match to place task. We found that such manipulation impairs memory retrieval, significantly decreasing performance and hastening decision-making. Furthermore, we found that such impairment outlasts light activation of the opsin, its effects being noticed up to three subsequent trials.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101036">Age-dependent predictors of effective reinforcement motor learning across childhood</a></h4>

              
                Across development, children must learn motor skills such as drawing with a crayon. Reinforcement learning, driven by success and failure, is fundamental to such sensorimotor learning. It typically requires a child to explore movement options along a continuum (grip location on a crayon) and learn from probabilistic rewards (whether the crayon draws or breaks). We studied the development of reinforcement motor learning using online motor tasks to engage children aged 3–17 years and adults (cross-sectional sample, N=385). Participants moved a cartoon penguin across a scene and were rewarded (animated cartoon clip) based on their final movement position. Learning followed a clear developmental trajectory when participants could choose to move anywhere along a continuum and the reward probability depended on the final movement position. Learning was incomplete or absent in 3–8 year-olds and gradually improved to adult-like levels by adolescence. A reinforcement learning model fit to each participant identified two age-dependent factors underlying improvement across development: an increasing amount of exploration after a failed movement and a decreasing level of motor noise. We predicted, and confirmed, that switching to discrete targets and deterministic reward would improve 3–8 year-olds’ learning to adult-like levels by increasing exploration after failed movements. Overall, we show a robust developmental trajectory of reinforcement motor learning abilities under ecologically relevant conditions, that is, continuous movement options mapped to probabilistic reward. This learning may be limited by immature spatial processing and probabilistic reasoning abilities in young children and can be rescued by reducing task demands.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103738">Orexin population activity precisely reflects net body movement across behavioral and metabolic states</a></h4>

              
                Tracking net body movement in real time may enable the brain to estimate ongoing demands and thus better orchestrate muscle tone, energy balance, and arousal. To identify neural populations specializing in tracking net body movement, here, we compared self-initiated movement-related activity across genetically-defined subcortical neurons in the mouse brain, including dopaminergic, glutamatergic, noradrenergic, and key peptidergic neurons. We show that hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin-producing neurons (HONs) are exceptionally precise movement-trackers, encoding net body movement across multiple classified behaviors with a high degree of precision, independent of head acceleration. This tracking was so precise that video analysis of the mouse body movement reliably served as a low-cost biometric for HON population activity. The movement tracking was independent of internal nutritional states, and occurred in a communication bandwidth distinct from HON encoding of blood glucose. At key projection targets, orexin/hypocretin peptide outputs correlated with self-initiated movement in a projection-specific manner, indicating functional heterogeneity in HON outputs. Finally, we found that body movement was not encoded to the same extent in other key neural populations related to arousal or energy. These findings indicate that subcortical orchestrators of arousal and metabolism are finely tuned to encode net body movement, constituting a bridge multiplexing ongoing motor activity with internal energy resources.

                Aging increases the risk of a myriad of chronic diseases, which are expensive and difficult to treat owing to their various risk factors. Repurposing existing medications has accelerated the development of therapies aimed at slowing aging. In this study, using IMR90 cells and aged mice, we revealed that enalapril, a drug widely prescribed for hypertension, can improve both cellular senescence and individual health. Mechanistically, phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 act as pivotal mediators of the anti-senescence properties of enalapril. It stimulates downstream genes involved in cell cycle regulation and antioxidative defenses, facilitating cell proliferation and diminishing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus increasing the antioxidative ability of enalapril. At the organismal level, enalapril has been shown to bolster the physiological performance of various organs; it notably enhances memory capacity and renal function and relieves lipid accumulation. Our work highlights the potential of enalapril to augment antioxidative defenses and combat the effects of aging, thereby indicating its promise as a treatment strategy for aging-associated diseases and its use for healthy aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98072">NAB2-STAT6 drives an EGR1-dependent neuroendocrine program in solitary fibrous tumors</a></h4>

              
                The pathogenesis of many rare tumor types is poorly understood, preventing the design of effective treatments. Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are neoplasms of mesenchymal origin that affect 1/1,000,000 individuals every year and are clinically assimilated to soft tissue sarcomas. SFTs can arise throughout the body and are usually managed surgically. However, 30–40% of SFTs will relapse local-regionally or metastasize. There are no systemic therapies with durable activity for malignant SFTs to date. The molecular hallmark of SFTs is a gene fusion between the <i>NAB2</i> and <i>STAT6</i> loci on chromosome 12, resulting in a chimeric protein of poorly characterized function called NAB2-STAT6. We use primary samples and an inducible cell model to discover that NAB2-STAT6 operates as a transcriptional coactivator for a specific set of enhancers and promoters that are normally targeted by the EGR1 transcription factor. In physiological conditions, NAB2 is primarily localized to the cytoplasm and only a small nuclear fraction is available to operate as a co-activator of EGR1 targets. NAB2-STAT6 redirects NAB1, NAB2, and additional EGR1 to the nucleus and bolsters the expression of neuronal EGR1 targets. The STAT6 moiety of the fusion protein is a major driver of its nuclear localization and further contributes to NAB2’s co-activating abilities. In primary tumors, NAB2-STAT6 activates a neuroendocrine gene signature that sets it apart from most sarcomas. These discoveries provide new insight into the pathogenesis of SFTs and reveal new targets with therapeutic potential.

">The Disruption and Normalization of Cortical Language Network Dynamics After Post-Stroke White Matter Disconnection</a></h4>

              
                The human language network undergoes reorganization across different spatiotemporal scales, limited by its fixed structural neurobiological foundations. Although stroke often damages white matter, its effect on temporary language network reorganization is not fully understood. This study examined longitudinal behavioral and resting-state fMRI data from post-stroke patients with exclusive subcortical lesions at three time points: two weeks (n = 38), three months (n = 29), and one year (n = 27). Patients showed mild to moderate language impairments during the acute phase, which improved within three months. The extent of disconnection in several left-hemispheric white matter tracts was negatively associated with language deficits. Healthy controls (HC, n = 25) exhibited domain-segregation dynamics in the cortical language network, limited by the underlying white matter pathways. In patients, severe, state- and track-specific network disruptions were observed in the acute phase, characterized by hypo- and hyper-connectivity and abnormal topological features. As language recovery progressed, connectivity patterns began to return to normal, resembling those of HC, and the domain-segregation dynamics reappeared. These results deepen our understanding of structure-function coupling and indicate significant post-lesional plasticity within the cortical language network.

">Divergent Excitability of GABAergic Neurons Derived from Bipolar Disorder Patients Shapes Energy Shifts of Network Dynamics, possibly mimicking mania and depression</a></h4>

              
                Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by fluctuating mood states, yet the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms distinguishing lithium-responsive (LR) from non-responsive (NR) patients remain elusive. We derived dentate gyrus granule neurons and GABAergic interneurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of BD patients stratified by lithium response, and from healthy controls. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we assessed intrinsic excitability. We further developed a computational model simulating large-scale neuronal networks based on patient-derived electrophysiological properties and ion channel conductance distributions. Granule neurons from both LR and NR patients exhibited hyperexcitability compared to controls. However, GABAergic neurons showed a striking divergence: LR neurons were hyperexcitable, while NR neurons were hypoexcitable. Transcriptomic profiling revealed distinct molecular signatures between NR and LR neurons, including dysregulation of GABA receptor genes (GABRR1). Computational simulations over 10,000 iterations, mimicking long-term network activity, revealed that dentate granule neuron changes alone failed to recapitulate network shifts between global hyperexcitability and global hypoexcitability. Networks incorporating only granule neuron phenotypes entered persistent hyper- or hypoactive states, depending on lithium response. Remarkably, when GABAergic neuron phenotypes were added to the model, both LR and NR networks exhibited spontaneous transitions between high and low activity states, that may be associated with the mood episodes that the patients exhibit. Control networks did not show such bistability. We, therefore, conclude that GABAergic neuronal excitability is a key determinant of lithium responsiveness in BD and critically shapes the emergence of state-shift dynamics in neural networks. These findings suggest that restoring excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance via targeted modulation of interneuron function may offer novel therapeutic avenues for BD.

">Attention reshapes the representational geometry of a perceptual feature space</a></h4>

              
                Our perception of the world is transformed by attention, both in terms of the efficiency of information processing and the appearance of attended stimuli. A standard theory is that attention regulates how competing stimuli vie for resources. However, an alternative perspective is that attention alters the representational geometry of stimulus spaces, such that changes in processing are not isolated to the particular competing stimuli, but are reflected across the entire perceptual space. To test this representational hypothesis, we conducted an experiment in which participants reported the perceived similarity of orientations spanning the full stimulus space when attention was directed or not directed to specific orientations. We used these similarity judgments to measure the representational geometry of orientation, finding that attention reliably expanded the representational space in a narrow range around the attended orientations. We also found evidence for compression of the representational space in a broad range around unattended orientations. Our findings support the idea that attention acts to reshape the representation of entire perceptual spaces in a way that supports processing of relevant stimulus features. By simultaneously manipulating attention while measuring perceptual similarity, our methodological framework opens the door for future work investigating the interaction between cognitive and perceptual processes from the perspective of representational geometry.

">Ventral Pallidum GABA Neuron Inhibition Augments Context-Appropriate Defensive Responses to Learned Threat Cues</a></h4>

              
                The ventral pallidum (VP) is embedded within the brain circuits controlling motivated behavior, which are heavily implicated in addiction and other psychiatric disorders. Prior work showed that VP GABAergic neurons (VPGABA) promote reward approach and seeking, while intermixed populations of VP glutamate neurons instead promote avoidance and aversion. Some have thus suggested a functional dichotomy between these VP subpopulations in reward versus threat. We test this hypothesis by asking how inhibiting VPGABA impacts active and passive defensive responses to learned threat cues. We taught GAD1:Cre rats with inhibitory VPGABA DREADDs (or WT littermates without DREADDs) that a metal-wrapped probe delivers shock, or that a 20sec auditory cue precedes footshocks. These threats elicit active defensive burying, or passive freezing responses, respectively. We found that VPGABA inhibition markedly increased stimulus-appropriate defensive responses to both types of threats, but failed to alter new learning about threat, suggesting VPGABA mediates aversive motivation but not memory formation. VPGABA inhibition also altered threat-related c-Fos expression patterns within VP cell populations, and in their efferent target region LHb, pointing to underlying circuit mechanisms of these conditioned defensive responses. Results indicate that VPGABA neurons not only promote reward seeking as previously reported, but that they also actively inhibit defensive responses to threats that might otherwise limit reward seeking. This refines our understanding of subcortical valanced motivation circuits, and may suggest new targets for intervening in disorders like addiction and depression.

">Maternal care during early development is necessary for the acquisition of a calming response to back stroking</a></h4>

              
                In many mammals, early postnatal interactions between caregivers and offspring involve rich physical contact, including stroking, holding, and grooming. Offspring typically remain calm and close to the caregiver during such stimulation. Although these behaviors are thought to support emotional regulation and bonding during infancy, the underlying mechanisms and the role of prior experience remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that back stroking induces a conserved calming response in both human infants and mouse pups, characterized by reduced movement and heart rate. In mouse pups, stroking further facilitated sleep onset, increased EEG delta power, and attenuated stress-induced corticosterone elevations. These sleep-promoting and stress-buffering effects were absent in artificially reared pups deprived of postnatal maternal contact, underscoring the importance of early tactile experience. Transcriptomic analysis revealed downregulation of the voltage-gated calcium channel subunit gene Cacna1b in the hypothalamus of artificially reared pups. Moreover, knockdown of hypothalamic Cacna1b in maternally reared pups abolished stroking-induced calming and sleep-promoting effects. This study identifies a conserved, experience-dependent calming response to affiliative tactile input, biologically embedded through plasticity, that supports physiological regulation and stress resilience during early development. Our results highlight that affiliative tactile sensation, like discriminative tactile sensation, depends on early experience to organize neural mechanisms regulating internal states.

">Brain morphology network alterations in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: a sex-stratified study</a></h4>

              
                Background: One of the most persistent questions in autism research is why males are more consistently diagnosed than females. Neuroimaging studies have sought to understand this disparity by examining sex differences, primarily through functional and structural connectivity. However, much less is known about how brain networks are organized in autism from a morphological perspective, and how this organization may help explain its sex-related characteristics. This study aimed to elucidate sex-specific alterations in morphology-based connectivity among adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: T1-weighted MRI scans from 337 individuals (181 with ASD; 162 females in total), aged 8-18 years, were preprocessed using FreeSurfer to extract five morphological features--thickness, surface area, sulcal depth, mean curvature, and gray matter volume--across 68 cortical regions. Connectivity was estimated via Kullback-Leibler divergence between region-wise multivariate feature distributions. Network-Based Statistics was applied within sex-stratified models to identify clusters of significantly altered connections in ASD relative to controls (individual edge threshold p = 0.005; FWE-corrected p = 0.05; 5,000 permutations). An exploratory post hoc analysis using partial correlations further associated identified sex-specific network profiles with behavior and comorbidity. Results: ASD males showed significantly increased connectivity in a cluster centered on the fusiform gyrus, along with the medial orbitofrontal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. This pattern was positively correlated with restricted and repetitive behaviors (r = 0.22, 95% CI [0.01, 0.41]). In females with ASD, increased connectivity was found in a sub-network implicating mainly the entorhinal cortex, followed by the inferior parietal lobule, and lateral occipital cortex. Notably, the fusiform gyrus was disrupted yet in the opposite direction, exhibiting decreased connectivity with the superior temporal sulcus. These alterations were negatively associated with communication skills (r = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.45, -0.03]). No overlap between male- and female-specific profiles was found, highlighting their distinctiveness. Limitations: Our cross-sectional sample does not allow for neurodevelopmental inference. Sex-stratified modeling precluded sex-by-diagnosis testing. Conclusions: Males and females with ASD show non-overlapping profiles of altered morphology-based connectivity, each associated with different behavioral traits, which may contribute to better characterize sex differences in autism.

">Early oligodendrocyte dysfunction signature in Alzheimer's disease: Insights from DNA methylomics and transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Much research into the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has focused on neuronal cell types, while the contribution of glial cells, including oligodendrocytes (OLGs), has often been overlooked. Altered DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that can influence gene expression, is well documented in AD, yet cell-type-specific investigations remain limited. In this study, we examine DNA methylation signatures associated with OLGs across multiple brain regions in AD to better understand the role of DNA methylation and OLGs in the disease, and how such changes may impact gene expression. METHODS: We performed weighted-gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) on multiple omics AD datasets across species: human DNA methylation datasets across 4 brain regions, human brain single-nuclei RNA sequencing data and mouse brain RNA sequencing data. We then investigated networks to identify disease-associated modules enriched for OLG genes, before running comparisons across such modules. RESULTS: We identified a DNA methylation signature associated with AD, enriched for OLGs, and preserved across brain regions. Genes within this signature showed altered expression in OLGs, confirming cell-type specificity and relevance to AD. Dysregulated signatures were observed across multiple disease stages, revealing a conserved pattern of OLG dysfunction from early to late stages and highlighting OLG alterations as a key feature of early AD pathogenesis. DISCUSSION: We reveal a consistent pattern of OLG dysfunction spanning early to late stages of AD, across DNA methylation and gene expression. Our findings implicate early OLG-associated DNA methylation changes as a potential initiating factor in disease pathogenesis.

">Pre-Sensory Spontaneous Activity Accelerates Coordinated Maturation of Synaptic Partners and Drives Transition to the Mature Physiological Phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Pre-sensory (ps), peripherally-generated spontaneous activity (SA) is important for establishing basic topography of central components of sensory pathways. However, roles for psSA in sculpting connections at the single neuron level and in driving functional maturation of postsynaptic targets are difficult to isolate and therefore little explored. We capitalized on the temporal onset of cochlea-generated psSA just prior to growth of the calyx of Held (CH), the largest nerve terminal in the mammalian brain, and its well-defined circuit topography to explore the causal roles for psSA in targeted synaptogenesis and postsynaptic functional maturation. To this end, we developed a viral vector to rapidly express tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT), which blocks neurotransmission, and selectively introduced it into CH-forming neurons at the onset of psSA. TeNT expression did not prevent but delayed and altered the developmental trajectory of neural circuit maturation, which in sum prevented the postsynaptic neuron from acquiring its mature phasic firing phenotype. Thus, psSA initiates and drives circuit maturation along central sensory pathways, but alternative mechanisms can partially compensate in its absence.

">The Lateral Habenula to Ventral Tegmental Area Pathway is Required for Aversive Learning and Defensive Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                The lateral habenula (LHb) provides aversive signals to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but its contribution to learning and behavior remains poorly understood. Using a retrograde viral strategy, we targeted VTA-projecting LHb neurons and monitored calcium activity during active avoidance training. These neurons were activated by aversive stimuli and predictive cues as animals acquired avoidance responses and showed increased activity at movement onset during the tail suspension test (TST). Silencing LHb[-&gt;]VTA transmission impaired avoidance learning, prolonged escape latency, and reduced the persistence and vigor of active coping in the TST, without affecting baseline locomotion. Anatomical and ex vivo electrophysiology revealed that LHb terminals innervate both dopaminergic (TH) and non-dopaminergic (TH-) VTA neurons, exhibiting session-specific synaptic adaptations during avoidance learning. Together, these findings identify the LHb[-&gt;]VTA pathway as a source of aversive predicting signals required for the acquisition of avoidance behavior and the persistence of active coping in aversive context.

">Giant and Opposite Lithium Isotope Effects on Rat Hippocampus Synaptic Activity Revealed by Multi-Electrode Array Electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Lithium (Li) has been a frontline medication for the treatment of bipolar disorder for decades, but its mechanism of action remains poorly understood1,2. While clinically prescribed Li salts consist of a mixture of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the neurobiological effects of each isotope are only beginning to receive attention. Recent theoretical proposals have suggested that the Li isotopes may exert unique effects in the brain, stemming from quantum phenomena linked to their distinct nuclear spin properties3-5. However, aside from earlier observations of isotope-dependent variations in animal behavior6,7, direct experimental evidence is lacking. We used multi-electrode array electrophysiology to probe field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in rat brain slices and demonstrated that 6Li and 7Li have large and opposite effects on synaptic transmission and lead to smaller, but still distinct, differences in synaptic plasticity, particularly, paired-pulse facilitation and the early stages of long-term potentiation. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that Li isotopes exert remarkably different neurological effects, while avoiding many of the interpretive challenges associated with behavioural studies. These findings lay the groundwork for future investigations of quantum phenomena in neuronal activity and promote the idea that Li isotopes are pharmacologically distinct agents.

">Intergenerational effects of maternal and paternal childhood maltreatment on offspring cortical gyrification are sex-specific: the Transmit Radiant Individuality to Offspring (TRIO) study</a></h4>

              
                The effects of parental childhood maltreatment (CM) can be transmitted across generations; however, the underlying sex-specific biological mechanisms are poorly understood. To better understand how parental adversity is passed on to offspring, we investigated the impact of maternal and paternal CM on the local gyrification index (LGI) of offspring using parent-offspring trio data. The LGI was selected as a key neurodevelopmental metric because it is thought to reflect the fetal environment and remain relatively stable postnatally, making it less susceptible to later life experiences. Using multiple regression, we analyzed sex-stratified associations between parental CM subtypes and the offspring LGI and tested for mediation by parental psychosocial functioning. The results revealed a distinct parent-of-origin, sex-specific pattern: maternal emotional abuse was associated with a lower LGI in male offspring, whereas paternal physical neglect was associated with a lower LGI in female offspring. These associations were not mediated by the current mental health or marital relationships of the parents. Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence that the neurodevelopmental consequences of parental CM can be biologically embedded in the next generation even before birth.

">Neutrophil-microglia interaction drives reversible motor dysfunction in neuromyelitis optica model induced by subarachnoid AQP4-IgG</a></h4>

              
                Neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to early neuromyelitis optica (NMO) histopathology initiated by IgG targeting astrocytic aquaporin-4 water (AQP4) channels. Yet, the mechanisms recruiting neutrophils and their pathogenic roles in disease progression remain unclear. To investigate molecular-cellular events preceding classical complement cascade activation in a mouse NMO model, we continuously infused, via spinal subarachnoid route, a non-complement-activating monoclonal AQP4-IgG. Parenchymal infiltration of netting neutrophils containing C5a ensued with microglial activation and motor impairment, but no blood-brain barrier leakage. Motor impairment and neuronal dysfunction both reversed when AQP4-IgG infusion stopped. Two-photon microscopy and electron-microscopy-based reconstructions revealed physical interaction of infiltrating neutrophils with microglia. Ablation of either peripheral neutrophils or microglia attenuated the motor deficit, highlighting their synergistic pathogenic roles. Of note, mice lacking complement receptor C5aR1 exhibited reduction in neutrophil infiltration, microglial lysosomal activation, neuronal lipid-droplet burden and motor impairment. Pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 recapitulated this protection. Immunohistochemical analysis of an NMO patient early spinal cord lesions revealed analogous pathological findings. Our study identifies neutrophil-derived C5a signaling through microglial C5aR1 as a key early driver of reversible motor neuron dysfunction in the precytolytic phase of NMO.

">Early Brain Functional Connectivity Changes Induced by Antidepressants and Placebo</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, the neural mechanisms underlying MDD and its treatment remain insufficiently understood, contributing to limited treatment efficacy and trial-and-error clinical practice. Although pre-treatment brain biomarkers have been associated with MDD diagnosis and antidepressant response, the precise neural circuits underlying these associations remain elusive. Antidepressant and placebo induce widespread cortical metabolic changes after six weeks of treatment6 and increase endogenous opioid release within one week, yet these findings offer limited insight into how interregional brain communication is altered by antidepressants or placebo. Using two independent cohorts of medicated MDD patients, we systematically characterize early treatment-induced changes in functional connectivity (FC) following one or two weeks of antidepressant or placebo administration. We identify a visual-precuneus-thalamus system exhibiting increased FC across patients, regardless of treatment or clinical outcome, and implicate striatal and attention networks in mediating placebo-related symptom improvement. Drug-specific effects center on the amygdala, mid-cingulate, orbitofrontal cortex, and cerebellum but are present only in a subset of patients treated with antidepressants; notably, the responses of those without such changes can be predicted with a placebo response prediction model. These findings reveal generalizable antidepressant-induced early FC changes, parse these changes into constituent placebo and drug-specific effects, and offer mechanistic insights into antidepressant action, supporting the development of interactive treatment optimization for MDD.

">Factorial variation of saccade vigor with dual decision processes</a></h4>

              
                Canonical stochastic models of decision-making treats decision and action as independent and sequential processes. However, studies involving limb movements consistently show that movement duration and kinematics are influenced by the quality of evidence. We tested whether saccade velocity varies with the quality of evidence in monkeys performing a visual search GO/NOGO task in which singleton elongation cued the GO/NOGO stimulus-response rule and the location of a color singleton specified saccade endpoint. We factorially manipulated the efficiency of stimulus-response cue discrimination by varying the elongation of the singleton and the efficiency of singleton localization by varying the color similarity between the singleton and distractors. The effectiveness of the manipulations was revealed by the response times on correct trials that were separately modified by the singleton localizability and stimulus-response cue discriminability, by the incidence of localization and response selection errors with separately modified error response times. Saccade velocity was higher on correct relative to error trials and was inversely proportional to response time. Saccade velocity was separately modified by singleton localizability and stimulus-response cue discriminability. Distinct patterns of error rates and saccade velocity across monkeys indicated individual differences in decision-making strategies. These findings demonstrate that the process selecting endpoints can influence both the timing and dynamics of saccadic eye movements. Incorporating saccade vigor can provide valuable constraints on biologically plausible decision models and help address the persistent challenge of model mimicry.

">Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 impairs the release sites of Parkinson's disease vulnerable dopamine axons</a></h4>

              
                The end-stage pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) involves the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). However, synaptic deregulation of these neurons begins much earlier. Understanding the mechanisms behind synaptic deficits is crucial for early therapeutic intervention, yet these remain largely unknown. In the SNc, different dopamine neuron subtypes show varying susceptibility patterns to PD, complicating our understanding. This study uses intersectional genetic mouse models to uncover synaptic perturbations in vulnerable dopamine neurons, focusing on the LRRK2 kinase, a protein closely linked to PD. Through a combination of immunofluorescence and advanced proximity labeling methods, we found higher LRRK2 expression in the most vulnerable dopamine neuron subclusters. High-resolution imaging revealed that pathogenic LRRK2 disrupts release sites in vulnerable dopamine axons, leading to decreased in vivo evoked striatal dopamine release in mice with LRRK2 mutations. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicate that mutant LRRK2 increases the phosphorylation of RAB3 proteins, reducing their interactions with RIM1/2 effector proteins and impacting their synaptic functions. Overall, this research highlights the cell-autonomous dysfunctions caused by mutant LRRK2 in the neurons that are primarily affected by the disease. It also provides a framework for therapeutic strategies for early nigrostriatal synaptic deficits in PD.

">Quantifying human adaptation to a novel split-belt walking condition after broad experience at different belt speeds</a></h4>

              
                Humans can adapt their gait to minimize energy cost when given sufficient exposure to novel energy landscapes. However, it remains unclear whether broad experience in one energy landscape is sufficient to initiate continuous optimization when encountering similar but distinct conditions. In this study, we used visual biofeedback to guide 15 participants to broadly explore walking gaits with different step length asymmetries (SLAs) while walking on a split-belt treadmill with a large split-belt ratio. We subsequently tested how participants adapted their walking patterns during free exploration trials at the large split-belt ratio and at a new, smaller split-belt ratio. Our results showed that during guided exploration, participants were exposed to energetically favorable conditions. However, participants did not self-select walking patterns that minimized their metabolic cost during either free exploration trial. When first exposed to the smaller split-belt ratio, participants immediately adjusted their leg swing distances and belt contact times while maintaining similar step lengths. Throughout this trial, they continued adapting by significantly increasing step lengths on the fast belt. Taken together, our results suggest that participants actively modified their gait strategy when exposed to an energy landscape distinct from the one in which they gained broad experience.

">Large-Scale Neural Network Compensation Underlying Camouflaging in Trait Autism and Its Potential Mental Health Costs</a></h4>

              
                Social camouflaging refers to strategies to hide or compensate for social difficulties, often at a significant mental health cost, and is particularly prevalent in autism. The large-scale neural network mechanisms underlying this adaptation remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify these neural underpinnings and their link to other potential mental health issues. Using a dimensional approach, we recruited 110 healthy young adults who completed self-report questionnaires measuring autistic traits and camouflaging as well as depression and anxiety, and underwent resting-state fMRI scans. Using the 300-node Seitzman atlas encompassing 13 functional networks, we examined the interaction between camouflaging and autistic traits on brain network connectivity. Results showed that among individuals with higher autistic traits, greater camouflaging was associated with hyperconnectivities between the Default Mode (DMN) and Cingulo-Opercular Networks (CON), and within the CON. Crucially, DMN-CON hyperconnectivity mediated the relationship between camouflaging and potential mental health cost (i.e., depression and anxiety scores) but only in individuals with higher autistic traits. These findings reveal a specific neuro-compensatory mechanism underlying autistic camouflaging involving self-referential and executive control systems and provide a neurobiological explanation for its potential mental health burden, highlighting the need for societal changes that reduce the pressure for such adaptations.

">The Moral Brain in Context: Political Orientation, Empathy, and Evaluation of Everyday Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Moral judgments are central to guiding social interactions, influencing whom we trust, cooperate with, or avoid. While extensive research has examined the cognitive and affective bases of moral evaluation, less is known about how stable traits, such as political orientation and empathy, shape these judgments and their neural correlates in ecologically valid contexts. Across two studies, we investigated how people evaluate individuals who committed harmful, helpful, or neutral actions. In Study 1 (N = 214), participants read everyday moral scenarios paired with neutral faces. Empathy moderated gender effects in judging harmful acts, and political orientation selectively influenced ratings of morally ambiguous (neutral) actions. In Study 2 (N = 39), pre-screened conservatives and progressives (N = 675 prescreen) viewed the same agents in an EEG paradigm. Likeability ratings varied by moral valence but not political orientation. Event-related potential analyses revealed that conservatives showed consistently elevated Late Positive Potentials (LPPs) across all conditions, whereas progressives displayed selective LPP enhancement for helpful individuals, suggesting group differences in motivational salience attribution. Together, these findings show that political orientation and empathy influence both explicit moral evaluations and neural processing of socially relevant information. Such insights deepen our understanding of how enduring traits shape moral judgments.

">Lipid-laden endothelial cells exhibit a transcriptomic signature linked to blood-brain barrier dysfunction, metabolic reprogramming and increased inflammation in the aging brain</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulation in lipid metabolism is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular dysfunction. While prior studies have largely focused on glial cells, the impact of lipid dysregulation on brain endothelial aging remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a secondary analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data from young and aged mouse brains, with a specific focus on endothelial cells (ECs). Our analyses revealed that aging promotes lipid droplet accumulation in brain ECs. These lipid-laden brain ECs exhibit a transcriptomic signature indicative of impaired blood-brain barrier function, increased cellular senescence, and inflammation in aging. Furthermore, lipid accumulation is associated with an altered metabolic phenotype characterized by increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased glycolysis, and impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain activity in the ECs of the aging brain. We have also validated lipid accumulation in aged ECs in vivo. Collectively, our findings indicate that lipid accumulation drives structural, functional, and metabolic impairments in the brain ECs, likely contributing to cerebrovascular aging. Understanding the mechanisms underlying lipid accumulation-induced endothelial dysfunction may offer novel therapeutic strategies for mitigating microvascular dysfunction and cognitive decline in aging.

">Discovery of an Adaptive Neuroimmune Response Driving Itch and Fast Tick Removal with Implications for Preventing Pathogen Transmission</a></h4>

              
                Acquired tick resistance (ATR) is well characterized in tick-exposed animals, compromising tick fitness through antibody-mediated activation of basophils. Yet, anti-tick vaccines inducing ATR have had limited success. Here, we describe a neuroimmune event preceding ATR that leads to rapid host-mediated tick removal. Tick-sensitized guinea pigs mechanically remove ticks within 3-6 hours via an acquired neuroimmune-induced itch response that correlates with increased dermal expression of itch-associated genes like OSM and skin infiltration by T cells and macrophages, independently of IgG and IgE antibodies. When we expose humans to ticks, a similar immune response is observed. Blocking T cells before tick sensitization prevents immune cell infiltration to bite sites and abrogates scratching and tick removal. This neuroimmune response is independent of Trpv1 as tick-sensitized guinea pigs treated with resiniferatoxin remove ticks effectively. Itch-induced tick removal or IITR offers a novel approach to tick-borne disease prevention through early tick detection and removal.

">Reduced melanocortin tone mediates increased feeding during pregnancy in mice</a></h4>

              
                During pregnancy mammals increase their food intake to accommodate the elevated metabolic demands associated with fetal growth and development. However, the molecular and neural circuit mechanisms mediating increased feeding during pregnancy are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that arcuate nucleus agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons are activated and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are inhibited during pregnancy in mice. These changes are required for promoting hyperphagia during pregnancy as chemogenetic inhibition of AgRP neurons or activation of POMC neurons both reduced the feeding of pregnant mice to non-pregnant levels. Finally, we utilized single cell resolution spatial transcriptomics in the arcuate nucleus of non-pregnant and pregnant mice to characterize pregnancy-induced changes in the transcriptomic state of arcuate nucleus neurons, including significant changes in both AgRP and POMC neurons. Together, these findings outline a circuit mechanism mediating increased feeding during pregnancy, providing important mechanistic insights related to conditions at the intersection of reproduction and metabolism.

                Reliable sleep stage classification from EEG signals is critical for the development of clinical decision support systems. However, many deep learning models lack mechanisms for estimating predictive uncertainty, which is important for trust and interpretability. This work explores the use of Monte Carlo Dropout and Deep Ensembles to estimate uncertainty in automatic sleep staging. We apply these methods to convolutional and recurrent neural architectures trained on a publicly available EEG dataset. Evaluation includes calibration analysis and visualization of predictive entropy across sleep stages. LSTM-based models demonstrated more consistent trustworthiness and calibration across runs, while EEGNet remained appealing for lightweight deployment.The results highlight the value of incorporating uncertainty estimates to improve model transparency and support safe use in medical contexts.

">Ethnic Identity Profiles Among Adolescents in the ABCD Study: Associations with Resting State Functional Connectivity and Perceived Discrimination</a></h4>

              
                Ethnic identity refers to how individuals perceive and experience themselves in the context of social groups, racial background, or culture (Phinney & Ong., 2007). Ethnic identity is positively associated with psychological well-being (Rivas-Drake et al., 2014) and negatively associated with depression and anxiety (Forstmeier et al., 2021). Those with strong ethnic identity may display resiliency to the negative effects of discrimination on psychological well-being (Urzua et al., 2021). Phinneys model describes four profiles for how people put effort into, participate in, and reflect upon their ethnic identity (Phinney, 1989). Despite prior work addressing ethnic identity and psychosocial outcomes (for review, see Meca et al., 2023), few studies have considered its neurobiological underpinnings. In the current study, we identified profiles of ethnic identity among participants in The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study) using latent profile analysis. Next, we examined resting state functional connectivity differences across observed profiles and assessed the moderating effects of perceived discrimination. Results indicated heightened cingulo-parietal (CPAR) network connectivity among adolescents with highly diffuse ethnic identities; among moderately achieved ethnic identities, perceived discrimination moderated the association between ethnic identity and CPAR connectivity. We discuss how these findings may be related to attentional shift, error monitoring, autobiographical memory, and social judgements.

                Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a powerful tool to assess white matter (WM) microstructural abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The fourth phase of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) now includes multiple multishell dMRI protocols, enabling both traditional and advanced dMRI model analyses. There is a need to evaluate whether multishell data offer deeper insights into WM pathology in AD than more widely available single-shell data by overcoming single-shell model limitations. Here, we fit single-shell DTI and multishell NODDI to dMRI data from 533 ADNI3/4 participants to assess their sensitivity to key clinical indicators of AD such as cognitive impairment, amyloid-beta and tau PET burden. Overall, we found that NODDI offered no major advantages in detecting cognitive impairment and tau pathology, but NODDI was marginally more sensitive to amyloid pathology.

">The dynamics of episodic recall</a></h4>

              
                The mechanistic understanding of memory recall, a process long known to be influenced by environmental context, has posed a persistent challenge to neuron-centric models. In this study, we approached recall by shifting the focus from internal neuronal representations to brain-environment interactions, employing precise tracking of gaze dynamics within a well-controlled virtual reality (VR) setting. We found that each verbal report of recalled event was consistently preceded by a gradual process of brain-environment coupling: fixational pauses became progressively longer, while gaze direction slowly converged on a specific spatial location associated with the memorized object-a recall-specific location (RSL). Upon the initiation of the verbal report, gaze rapidly diverged from the RSL. Chunked verbal reports were associated with convergence onto shared or spatially clustered RSLs. Moreover, when recall occurred in the same spatial context as encoding, participants recalled objects in the order they were encountered and RSLs were more correlated with gaze locations during encoding. These findings reveal a direct mechanistic dependence of memory recall on the environment and support the view that the environment is not merely a context for memory, but an integral component of the memory itself.

">Bursts of regional cortical inhibition during smartphone use</a></h4>

              
                Transient burst of beta oscillations - brief neural events lasting only a fraction of a second - are increasingly recognised for their role in functional inhibition that may support cognitive processes and motor timing underlying goal-directed behaviour. Smartphone behaviour, which involves sustained engagement across diverse cognitive processes provides a fresh avenue to examine these bursts. In this study, we used EEG to measure {beta}-bursts as participants freely interacted with their smartphones using their right hand for ~ 80 min. Bursts were detected across the scalp, with bilateral sensorimotor electrodes accumulating more periods with bursts than the rest of the electrodes. There was a brain-wide reduction in the probability of bursts preceding a touchscreen touch, followed by an increase, with the strongest modulation in the left sensorimotor electrodes. Interestingly, touchscreen touches sometimes occurred during the bursts. We further examined the intra-burst touch rate across the scalp and found that the rate was lower over the left sensorimotor cortex than the rest of electrodes. Finally, we characterised the diverse behaviours in terms of the interval between touchscreen interactions to find that the behaviours with bursts were typically longer than the behaviours without bursts. We propose that the apparently continuous stream of smartphone touches is supported by brief, spatially localised transient bursts of inhibition. These transients may help support the computational flexibility in distributed neural networks needed for processing continuous motor output and integrating the rich sensory information.

">Brief sleep disruption following hippocampus-dependent learning downscales interneuron synapses within lateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Brief sleep loss alters cognition and the activity and synaptic structures of both principal neurons and interneurons in hippocampus. However, although sleep-dependent coordination of activity between hippocampus and neocortex is essential for memory consolidation, much less is known about how sleep loss affects neocortical input to hippocampus, or excitatory-inhibitory balance within neocortical structures. We aimed to test how the synaptic structures of SST interneurons in lateral and medial entorhinal cortex (LEC and MEC), which are the major neocortical input to hippocampus, are affected by brief sleep disruption in the hours following learning. We used Brainbow 3.0 to label SST interneurons in the LEC or MEC of male SST-IRES-Cre transgenic mice. We then compared synaptic structures in labeled neurons after single trial contextual fear conditioning (CFC) followed by either a 6-h period of ad lib sleep, or gentle handling sleep deprivation (SD), focusing on cortical layers providing input to hippocampus. Dendritic spine density among EC SST interneurons was altered in a subregion-specific manner, with dramatic alterations in dendritic spine type distributions and reductions in spine size in LEC, but not MEC, after post-CFC SD. Our data suggest that the synaptic connectivity of SST interneurons is significantly reduced in LEC when learning is followed by sleep disruption. This suggests that post-learning sleep loss disrupts hippocampus-dependent memory processing in part through altered excitatory-inhibitory balance in neocortical structures providing input to hippocampus. They also provide more mechanistic insight into sleeps role in coordinating neocortical-hippocampal communication in the context of memory consolidation.

">Microglial activation and alpha-synuclein oligomers drive the early inflammatory phase of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by insoluble -synuclein (Syn) aggregates in Lewy bodies (LBs) within the substantia nigra, with cortical pathology appearing as the disease progresses. Late-stage LB deposition, cellular stress, and neuronal loss obscure disease-driving events, we therefore performed multi-regional transcriptomic and aggregate profiling in early-midstage PD brains (Braak 3-4), where cortical regions are pathologically unaffected. We report neuroimmune activation as an early PD feature, characterised by the expansion of a high-SNCA-expressing microglial state. This robust immune signature occurs prior to LB formation, but is associated with oligomeric Syn within cortical microglia. In hiPSC-derived microglia, both endogenous Syn oligomerisation, and exogenous oligomer uptake, trigger transcriptional reprogramming, characterised by interferon-driven inflammation, antigen presentation, and mitochondrial suppression, closely mirroring the early PD brain. These findings describe mechanisms by which Syn oligomerisation potently initiates early neuroinflammation, highlighting a critical interplay between proteinopathy and immune activation at the earliest stages of disease.

">Sex-dependent interferon signaling drives female-biased vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Despite extensive efforts to understand Alzheimer's disease (AD), the biological basis for its greater burden in women remains unclear. We identified a sex-dependent activation of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling as a contributor to this disparity. Transcriptomic profiling of brain from AD patients revealed selective enrichment of IFN-I pathway in females. This immune signature was mirrored in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, where females exhibited more pronounced amyloid accumulation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Acute IFN-I activation reproduced pathological features of AD, whereas chronic IFN-I elevation in APP/PS1 mice aggravated disease progression. In contrast, pharmacological targeting of IFN-I response by inhibiting the cGAS-STING pathway in APP/PS1 female mice reduced neuropathological burden, and preserved cognitive performance. Together, these findings identify interferon signaling as a modifiable and sex-linked driver of AD pathology. Our study uncovers a critical neuroimmune mechanism contributing to female-biased vulnerability and highlights interferon modulation as a promising therapeutic strategy in AD.

">Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) binds to talin and is anchored at the postsynaptic density via direct interaction with PDZ domains</a></h4>

              
                Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) is a serine/threonine kinase essential for brain development and function. Mutations in the CDKL5 gene cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy characterised by defects in synapse formation and function. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms by which CDKL5 mutations disrupt synaptic function and lead to epilepsy remain unclear. Here, we report that the major neuronal isoform of CDKL5 contains a C-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif. We demonstrate that this motif mediates interactions with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and SHANK proteins, facilitating the recruitment of CDKL5 to the postsynaptic density. Disruption of CDKL5's PDZ-binding motif results in its mislocalisation and impaired spine formation. Additionally, we show that CDKL5 directly interacts with the mechanosensitive synaptic scaffold protein talin, via the N-terminal kinase domain of CDKL5 and the R8 rod domain of talin. Our findings establish how CDKL5 is targeted to synapses and suggest that its activity may be spatially regulated through talin-mediated mechanical signalling. We propose that the spatial positioning of the CDKL5 kinase domain might be mechanically-operated and regulated by talin domain unfolding. As talin undergoes structural transitions in its force-dependent binary switch domains, the kinase domain bound to R8 would be moved up and down within the synaptic compartment as a function of the changing talin conformation. These insights enhance our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CDKL5 variants with premature stop codons and highlight the need to re-evaluate studies that have used C-terminally tagged or the non-PDZ-binding isoform of CDKL5 to assess its neuronal function.

                <p>People with cerebellar degeneration show characteristic ataxic motor impairments. Despite cerebellar dysfunction, they can improve motor performance through sensorimotor training. Yet, how such training changes functional brain networks affected by cerebellar degeneration is unknown. We here investigated neuroplastic changes in the cortico-cerebellar network after a 5-d forearm training in 40 patients with mild to severe cerebellar degeneration and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Human participants (41 female) were assigned to one of four motor training conditions, varying online visual feedback and explicit verbal feedback. Anatomical and resting-state fMRI was collected on days before and after training. To overcome the limitations of standard brain templates that fail when encountering severe anatomical abnormalities, we developed a specific template for comparing cerebellar patients with controls. Our new template reduced the spatial spread of cerebellar anatomical landmarks by 30% and tripled fMRI noise classification accuracy. Using this pipeline, we found that patients showed impaired connectivity between cerebellar motor regions and neocortical visuomotor and premotor regions at baseline compared with controls, whereas their corticocortical connectivity remained intact. Training with vision strengthened connectivity in the cortico-cerebellar visuomotor network contralateral to the trained arm in all participants. Cerebellar patients exhibited additional increased connectivity ipsilateral to the training arm in this network. Further, training with explicit verbal feedback affected connectivity between a cerebellar cognitive region and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, although post hoc tests did not reach significance. These results document enhanced cortico-cerebellar connectivity as a neurophysiological response to visuomotor training in people with cerebellar degeneration.</p>

                <p>Human and animal studies implicate theta and alpha oscillations in memory function. We tested whether theta, alpha, and beta phase consistency predicts memory encoding dynamics in neurosurgical patients performing delayed free recall tasks with either unrelated (<I>N</I> = 188: 99 male, 89 female) or categorized words (<I>N</I> = 157: 88 male, 69 female). We observed widespread post-stimulus phase consistency (3&ndash;21 Hz) and, crucially, identified distinct frequency-specific patterns predictive of successful encoding. Specifically, increased early list item recall was significantly correlated across subjects with increased theta (3&ndash;7 Hz) phase consistency. Subsequent recall analyses, controlling for serial position, revealed distinct frequency signatures for successfully encoded items: theta (3&ndash;6 Hz) and alpha (9&ndash;14 Hz) for unrelated lists, and theta (3&ndash;6 Hz) and beta (14&ndash;19 Hz) for categorized lists. Regional analyses for unrelated lists highlighted the lateral temporal cortex for theta effects and the prefrontal cortex for both theta and alpha consistency. These findings provide novel evidence for the frequency-specific presence of increased phase consistency during episodic encoding, revealing its sensitivity to both item context and temporal position within a learning sequence.</p>

                <p>Neurofeedback (NF) training based on motor imagery is increasingly used in neurorehabilitation with the aim to improve motor functions. However, the neuroplastic changes underpinning these improvements are poorly understood. Here, we used mental "finger individuation," i.e., the selective facilitation of single finger representations without producing overt movements, as a model to study neuroplasticity induced by NF. To enhance mental finger individuation, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-based NF training. During motor imagery of individual finger movements, healthy female and male human participants were provided visual feedback on the size of motor evoked potentials, reflecting their finger-specific corticospinal excitability. We found that TMS-NF improved the mental activation of finger-specific representations. First, intracortical inhibitory circuits in the primary motor cortex were tuned after training such that inhibition was selectively reduced for the finger that was mentally activated. Second, motor imagery finger representations in areas of the sensorimotor system assessed with functional MRI became more distinct after training. Together, our results indicate that the neural underpinnings of finger individuation, a well-known model system for neuroplasticity, can be modified using TMS-NF guided motor imagery training. These findings demonstrate that TMS-NF induces neuroplasticity in the sensorimotor system, highlighting the promise of TMS-NF on the recovery of fine motor function.</p>

                <p>Whereas memory consolidation research has traditionally focused on longer temporal windows (i.e., hours to days) following an initial learning episode, recent research has also examined the functional significance of the shorter rest epochs interspersed with blocks of task practice (i.e., "micro-offline" intervals on the timescale of seconds to minutes). In the motor sequence learning (MSL) domain, evidence from young, healthy individuals suggests that micro-offline epochs afford a rapid consolidation process that is supported by the hippocampus. Consistent with these findings, amnesic patients with hippocampal damage were recently found to exhibit degraded micro-offline performance improvements. These offline losses were compensated for by larger performance gains during online practice. Given the known role of the striatum in online MSL, we hypothesized that individuals with dysfunction of the striatal system would exhibit impaired online, yet enhanced micro-offline, learning (i.e., a pattern of results opposite to that observed in patients with hippocampal damage). We tested this hypothesis using Parkinson's disease (PD) as a model of striatal dysfunction. Forty-two drug&ndash;naive individuals with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral PD and 30 healthy control subjects completed a MSL paradigm (participants included both men and women). Relative to age-similar controls, individuals with PD exhibited deficits during online task practice that were paralleled by greater improvements over micro-offline intervals. Results could not be explained by disease-related deficits in movement execution. These data suggest that striatal dysfunction disrupts online learning, yet total learning remains unchanged because of greater micro-offline performance improvements that potentially reflect hippocampal-mediated compensatory processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/35/e0165252025?rss=1">Cholinergic Waves Have a Modest Influence on the Transcriptome of Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the early stages of development, correlated activity known as retinal waves causes periodic depolarizations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The &beta;2KO mouse, which lacks the &beta;2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, serves as a model for understanding the role of the cholinergic waves. &beta;2KO mice have disruptions in several developmental processes of the visual system, including reduced retinotopic and eye-specific refinement of RGC axonal projections to their primary brain targets and an impact on the retinal circuits underlying direction selectivity. However, the effects of this mutation on gene expression in individual functional RGC types remain unclear. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on RGCs isolated at the end of the first postnatal week from wild-type and &beta;2KO mice of either sex. We found that in &beta;2KO, the programs governing RGC differentiation were not impacted and the magnitude of transcriptional changes was modest compared with those observed during 2&nbsp;d of normal postnatal maturation. This contrasts with the substantial transcriptomic changes seen in downstream visual system areas under wave disruption in recent studies. Overall, we identified ~238 genes whose expression was altered in a type-specific manner. We confirmed this result via in situ hybridization and whole-cell recording by focusing on one of the downregulated genes in &alpha;RGCs, <I>Kcnk9</I>, which encodes the two-pore domain leak potassium channel TASK3. Our study reveals a limited transcriptomic impact of cholinergic signaling in the retina, and instead of affecting all RGCs uniformly, these waves show subtle modulation of molecular programs in a type-specific manner.</p>

                <p>Dopamine has been suggested to encode reward-prediction-error (RPE) in reinforcement learning (RL) theory but also shown to exhibit heterogeneous patterns depending on regions and conditions: some exhibiting ramping response to predictable reward while others only responding to reward-predicting cue. It remains elusive how these heterogeneities relate to various RL algorithms proposed to be employed by animals/humans, such as RL under predictive state representation, hierarchical RL, and distributional RL. Here we demonstrate that these relationships can be coherently explained by incorporating the decay of learned values (value-decay), implementable by the decay of dopamine-dependent plastic changes in the synaptic strengths. First, we show that value-decay causes ramping RPE under certain state representations but not under others. This accounted for the observed gradual fading of dopamine ramping across repeated reward navigation, attributed to the gradual formation of predictive state representations. It also explained the cue-type and inter-trial-interval-dependent temporal patterns of dopamine. Next, we constructed a hierarchical RL model composed of two coupled systems&mdash;one with value-decay and one without. The model accounted for distinct patterns of neuronal activity in parallel striatal-dopamine circuits and their proposed roles in flexible learning and stable habit formation. Lastly, we examined two distinct algorithms of distributional RL with and without value-decay. These algorithms explained how distinct dopamine patterns across striatal regions relate to the reported differences in the strength of distributional coding. These results suggest that within-striatum differences&mdash;specifically, a medial-to-lateral gradient in value or synaptic decay&mdash;tune regional RL computations by generating distinct patterns of dopamine/RPE signals.</p>

                <p>Extensive neuronal loss, progressive neurodegeneration, and circuit impairment are the key pathological features of spinal cord injury (SCI). The intrinsic capacity of the injured spinal cord to replenish damaged neurons and reassemble the disrupted spinal circuitry is restricted. Transplantation of exogenous neural precursor cells (NPCs) has shown promise to structurally repair the injured spinal network. However, proper maturation and integration of newly generated neurons from NPC graft within the zhost spinal circuit has remained challenging. Here, in adult female Sprague Dawley rats, we demonstrate that blockade of CSPG/LAR/PTP- axis in combination with neuromodulation by activation of 5-HT<SUB>1/2/7</SUB> receptors augment the generation of spinal cord-specific neurons by NPC grafts and supports the maturity and functional connectivity of NPC-derived neurons with the host local spinal network as well as major descending motor pathways that culminate in recovery of locomotion and sensorimotor integration. Taken together, this novel cellular and pharmacological approach facilitates functional restoration of neural networks within the damaged spinal circuitry that addresses a critical gap in cell-based repair strategies for SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/35/e0447252025?rss=1">Global Motor System Suppression as the Primary Mechanism of Human Action Stopping: Challenging the Pause-Then-Cancel Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to stop a planned or ongoing action is fundamental to inhibitory control. A recent theory proposes that stopping involves two distinct phases: an initial global suppression of motor activity ("pause") followed by a selective cancelation of the targeted action. However, the necessity of a second "cancel" stage remains debated. We tested whether global suppression alone is sufficient to stop movement by analyzing electromyography from task-relevant agonist and antagonist muscles, alongside transcranial magnetic stimulation measures of global motor suppression from task-irrelevant muscles, during a stop signal task in adult human participants of both sexes. In Experiment 1, reanalysis of ballistic finger movements revealed that agonist muscle offset consistently preceded behavioral stopping, aligning with the time course of global suppression. In Experiment 2, we extended these findings to whole-arm reaching movements, demonstrating that global motor suppression persisted beyond the termination of muscle activity when stopping prevented movement initiation, or lasted up to that point, disengaging in time for antagonist activation to interrupt movements that had already begun. These findings challenge the pause-then-cancel model, instead supporting a single-stage global suppression framework. They also suggest that the global suppression mechanism is not a rigid, top&ndash;down stopping mechanism but rather part of a broader motor control system that flexibly adjusts movement commands based on task demands.</p>

                <p>Despite the established link between neuropathic pain and abnormal mitochondrial fission in neurons, the specific role of mitochondrial fission protein 1 (FIS1) in this process remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, the subjects we investigated were 6&ndash;8-week-old male mice. Comprehensive behavioral tests and immunostaining, along with Western blot analysis, revealed that neuropathic pain induced by spared nerve injury (SNI) upregulated FIS1 expression in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SC-DH). Furthermore, artificially upregulated FIS1 in SC-DH caused hyperalgesia behaviors in normal mice, while downregulation alleviated neuropathic pain. Using GAD2-MITO and vGluT2-MITO transgenic mice, we found that mitochondria network of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the SC-DH were disrupted. Selective downregulation of FIS1 in excitatory neurons via vGluT2-Cre mice reversed mitochondrial impairments and alleviated neuropathic pain. Network pharmacological prediction analysis combined with pharmacological tests indicated that compounds capable of downregulating FIS1 expression, such as epigallocatechin gallate, the primary bioactive component of tea polyphenols, may possess analgesic properties. In contrast, cinnamic acid, an organic acid derived from cinnamon bark, did not exhibit the capability to downregulate FIS1 expression and consequently lacked analgesic efficacy. Our research findings suggest that FIS1 may represent a novel molecular target for the treatment of neuropathic pain.</p>

                <p>Altered arousal is characteristic of many mental health disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Several studies link neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with anticipation of reward, including anticipatory sympathetic arousal, which is blunted in MDD. We therefore studied acquisition and consolidation of appetitive pavlovian memories in two groups of adult male rhesus monkeys: unoperated controls (<I>N</I> = 4) and those with selective neurotoxic lesions of OFC (<I>N</I> = 4). The dependent measure was conditioned sympathetic arousal as indexed by differential pupil dilation, and the key comparison was dilation in response to a visual cue that predicted the delivery of a large fluid reward (CS+) versus a cue that predicted no reward (CS&ndash;). Control procedures ruled out global effects of the lesion on pupil dilation. All four unoperated controls and all four monkeys with OFC lesions acquired a conditioned increase in the pupil size in response to the CS+. However, three of the four monkeys in the lesion group failed to consolidate the memory underlying this response. In contrast to this impairment, monkeys with OFC lesions acquired and consolidated an operant visual discrimination for the same reward and did so at the same rate as controls. These findings point to a specialized role of OFC in consolidating memories underlying positive affective responses, which further implicates OFC dysfunction in the blunted positive affect characteristic of MDD and suggests therapeutic approaches involving enhanced consolidation and/or reconsolidation of associative memories.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mutations in <i>TARDBP</i> (encoding TDP-43) are associated with the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and include familial missense mutations where there are a lack of models and mechanisms examining how they are pathogenic.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this study, we developed 2 <i>tardbp</i> (Tdp-43) knock-in (KI) zebrafish mutant models encoding the analogous A382T and G348C variants and investigated their degenerative phenotypes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that both models display reduced survival as well as an age-dependent motor phenotype that manifests at 1.5 years. Both variants in either the heterozygous or homozygous state did not impact protein expression levels of Tdp-43 in the central nervous system. However, homozygous G347C zebrafish displayed reduced expression levels of the <i>tardbp</i> transcript. We observed muscle cell atrophy starting at 1 year of age and loss of large spinal cord motor neurons in both KI models in older fish (2.35–3 years of age). We did not observe Tdp-43 aggregates. However, we did observe increased cytoplasmic Tdp-43 localization in spinal cord motor neurons in A379T zebrafish. At 1 year of age, whole spinal cord RNA-sequencing revealed an upregulation of neuroinflammatory transcripts in both models, as well as the selective downregulation of transcripts involved with synaptic function in G347C zebrafish, including <i>syn2a</i>, <i>syn2b</i>, <i>syt2a</i>, and <i>stxbp1a</i>.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These novel models of common TDP-43 disease variants provide a unique opportunity to further our understanding of neurodegeneration in vivo and demonstrate that mutations in the same protein and domain can manifest with different phenotypes. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The brain accounts for the arm’s posture when generating motor commands, yet it has been unclear how postural signals influence activity in the motor cortex. By systematically varying arm posture in multiple behavioral tasks, Marino et al. find that the organization of posture and goal signals is simpler than previously recognized.
