              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01022">Learning grid cells by predictive coding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) of the mammalian brain exhibit a strikingly regular hexagonal firing field over space. These cells are learned after birth and are thought to support spatial navigation but also more abstract computations. Although various computational models, including those based on artificial neural networks, have been proposed to explain the formation of grid cells, the process through which the MEC circuit ${\it learns}$ to develop grid cells remains unclear. In this study, we argue that predictive coding, a biologically plausible plasticity rule known to learn visual representations, can also train neural networks to develop hexagonal grid representations from spatial inputs. We demonstrate that grid cells emerge robustly through predictive coding in both static and dynamic environments, and we develop an understanding of this grid cell learning capability by analytically comparing predictive coding with existing models. Our work therefore offers a novel and biologically plausible perspective on the learning mechanisms underlying grid cells. Moreover, it extends the predictive coding theory to the hippocampal formation, suggesting a unified learning algorithm for diverse cortical representations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01269">The exponential distance rule based network model predicts topology and reveals functionally relevant properties of the Drosophila projectome</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying structural brain networks has witnessed significant advancement in recent decades. Findings have revealed a geometric principle, the exponential distance rule (EDR) showing that the number of neurons decreases exponentially with the length of their axons. An EDR based network model explained various characteristics of inter-areal cortical networks in macaques, mice, and rats. The complete connectome of the Drosophila fruit fly has recently been mapped at the neuronal level. Our study demonstrates that the EDR holds true in Drosophila, and the EDR model effectively accounts for numerous binary and weighted properties of neuropil networks, also called projectome. Our study illustrates that the EDR model is a suitable null model for analyzing networks of brain regions, as it captures geometric and physical constraints in very different species. The importance of the null model lies in its ability to facilitate the identification of functionally significant features that are not caused by inevitable geometric constraints, as we illustrate with the pronounced asymmetry of connection weights important for functional hierarchy.

                arXiv:2410.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of medical technology has led to an exponential increase in multi-modal medical data, including imaging, genomics, and electronic health records (EHRs). Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to represent this data due to their prominent performance in capturing pairwise relationships. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of multi-modal medical data still pose significant challenges for standard GNNs, which struggle with learning higher-order, non-pairwise relationships. This paper proposes GAMMA-PD (Graph-based Analysis of Multi-modal Motor Impairment Assessments in Parkinson's Disease), a novel heterogeneous hypergraph fusion framework for multi-modal clinical data analysis. GAMMA-PD integrates imaging and non-imaging data into a "hypernetwork" (patient population graph) by preserving higher-order information and similarity between patient profiles and symptom subtypes. We also design a feature-based attention-weighted mechanism to interpret feature-level contributions towards downstream decision tasks. We evaluate our approach with clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and a private dataset. We demonstrate gains in predicting motor impairment symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Our end-to-end framework also learns associations between subsets of patient characteristics to generate clinically relevant explanations for disease and symptom profiles.

                arXiv:2401.09108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the modeling of experiments conducted by Billock and Tsou [V. A. Billock and B. H. Tsou, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 104 (2007), pp. 8490--8495] using an Amari-type neural field that models the average membrane potential of neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (V1). The study specifically focuses on a regular funnel pattern localized in the fovea or the peripheral visual field. It aims to comprehend and model the visual phenomena induced by this pattern, emphasizing their nonlinear nature. The research involves designing sensory inputs that mimic the visual stimuli from Billock and Tsou's experiments. The cortical outputs induced by these sensory inputs are then theoretically and numerically studied to assess their ability to model the experimentally observed visual effects at the V1 level. A crucial aspect of this study is the exploration of the effects induced by the nonlinear nature of neural responses. By highlighting the significance of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the emergence of these visual phenomena, the research suggests that an interplay of both types of neuronal activities plays a crucial role in visual processes, challenging the assumption that the latter is primarily driven by excitatory activities alone.

                arXiv:2404.11842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual electrophysiology is often used clinically to determine functional changes associated with retinal or neurological conditions. The full-field flash electroretinogram (ERG) assesses the global contribution of the outer and inner retinal layers initiated by the rods and cone pathways depending on the state of retinal adaptation. Within clinical centers reference normative data are used to compare with clinical cases that may be rare or underpowered within a specific demographic. To bolster either reference or case datasets the application of synthetic ERG waveforms may offer benefits to disease classification and case-control studies. In this study and as a proof of concept, artificial intelligence (AI) to generate synthetic signals using Generative Adversarial Networks is deployed to up-scale male participants within an ISCEV reference dataset containing 68 participants, with waveforms from the right and left eye. Random Forest Classifiers further improved classification for sex within the group from a balanced accuracy of 0.72 to 0.83 with the added synthetic male waveforms. This is the first study to demonstrate the generation of synthetic ERG waveforms to improve machine learning classification modelling with electroretinogram waveforms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07908">Time-Dependent VAE for Building Latent Representations from Visual Neural Activity with Complex Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.07908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seeking high-quality representations with latent variable models (LVMs) to reveal the intrinsic correlation between neural activity and behavior or sensory stimuli has attracted much interest. Most work has focused on analyzing motor neural activity that controls clear behavioral traces and has modeled neural temporal relationships in a way that does not conform to natural reality. For studies of visual brain regions, naturalistic visual stimuli are high-dimensional and time-dependent, making neural activity exhibit intricate dynamics. To cope with such conditions, we propose Time-Dependent Split VAE (TiDeSPL-VAE), a sequential LVM that decomposes visual neural activity into two latent representations while considering time dependence. We specify content latent representations corresponding to the component of neural activity driven by the current visual stimulus, and style latent representations corresponding to the neural dynamics influenced by the organism's internal state. To progressively generate the two latent representations over time, we introduce state factors to construct conditional distributions with time dependence and apply self-supervised contrastive learning to shape them. By this means, TiDeSPL-VAE can effectively analyze complex visual neural activity and model temporal relationships in a natural way. We compare our model with alternative approaches on synthetic data and neural data from the mouse visual cortex. The results show that our model not only yields the best decoding performance on naturalistic scenes/movies but also extracts explicit neural dynamics, demonstrating that it builds latent representations more relevant to visual stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18582">Optimistic Games for Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization with Application to Protein Design</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework to optimize black-box expensive-to-evaluate functions via sequential interactions. In several important problems (e.g. drug discovery, circuit design, neural architecture search, etc.), though, such functions are defined over large $\textit{combinatorial and unstructured}$ spaces. This makes existing BO algorithms not feasible due to the intractable maximization of the acquisition function over these domains. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{GameOpt}$, a novel game-theoretical approach to combinatorial BO. $\textbf{GameOpt}$ establishes a cooperative game between the different optimization variables, and selects points that are game $\textit{equilibria}$ of an upper confidence bound acquisition function. These are stable configurations from which no variable has an incentive to deviate$-$ analog to local optima in continuous domains. Crucially, this allows us to efficiently break down the complexity of the combinatorial domain into individual decision sets, making $\textbf{GameOpt}$ scalable to large combinatorial spaces. We demonstrate the application of $\textbf{GameOpt}$ to the challenging $\textit{protein design}$ problem and validate its performance on four real-world protein datasets. Each protein can take up to $20^{X}$ possible configurations, where $X$ is the length of a protein, making standard BO methods infeasible. Instead, our approach iteratively selects informative protein configurations and very quickly discovers highly active protein variants compared to other baselines.

                arXiv:2410.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic tensor cores (PTCs) are essential building blocks for optical artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators based on programmable photonic integrated circuits. Most PTC designs today are manually constructed, with low design efficiency and unsatisfying solution quality. This makes it challenging to meet various hardware specifications and keep up with rapidly evolving AI applications. Prior work has explored gradient-based methods to learn a good PTC structure differentiably. However, it suffers from slow training speed and optimization difficulty when handling multiple non-differentiable objectives and constraints. Therefore, in this work, we propose a more flexible and efficient zero-shot multi-objective evolutionary topology search framework ADEPT-Z that explores Pareto-optimal PTC designs with advanced devices in a larger search space. Multiple objectives can be co-optimized while honoring complicated hardware constraints. With only <3 hours of search, we can obtain tens of diverse Pareto-optimal solutions, 100x faster than the prior gradient-based method, outperforming prior manual designs with 2x higher accuracy weighted area-energy efficiency. The code of ADEPT-Z is available at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/ADEPT-Z.

                arXiv:2410.01349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the challenge of rapidly adapting an agent's behavior to solve spatiotemporally continuous problems in novel settings. Animals exhibit extraordinary abilities to adapt to new contexts, a capacity unmatched by artificial systems. Instead of focusing on generalization through deep reinforcement learning, we propose viewing behavior as the physical manifestation of a search procedure, where robust problem-solving emerges from an exhaustive search across all possible behaviors. Surprisingly, this can be done efficiently using online modification of a cognitive graph that guides action, challenging the predominant view that exhaustive search in continuous spaces is impractical. We describe an algorithm that implicitly enumerates behaviors by regulating the tight feedback loop between execution of behaviors and mutation of the graph, and provide a neural implementation based on Hebbian learning and a novel high-dimensional harmonic representation inspired by entorhinal cortex. By framing behavior as search, we provide a mathematically simple and biologically plausible model for real-time behavioral adaptation, successfully solving a variety of continuous state-space navigation problems. This framework not only offers a flexible neural substrate for other applications but also presents a powerful paradigm for understanding adaptive behavior. Our results suggest potential advancements in developmental learning and unsupervised skill acquisition, paving the way for autonomous robots to master complex skills in data-sparse environments demanding flexibility.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01413">Improving Fuzzy Rule Classifier with Brain Storm Optimization and Rule Modification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.01413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expanding complexity and dimensionality in the search space can adversely affect inductive learning in fuzzy rule classifiers, thus impacting the scalability and accuracy of fuzzy systems. This research specifically addresses the challenge of diabetic classification by employing the Brain Storm Optimization (BSO) algorithm to propose a novel fuzzy system that redefines rule generation for this context. An exponential model is integrated into the standard BSO algorithm to enhance rule derivation, tailored specifically for diabetes-related data. The innovative fuzzy system is then applied to classification tasks involving diabetic datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in classification accuracy, as evidenced by our experiments.

Abstract: We explored the mathematical foundations of Recurrent Neural Networks ($\mathtt{RNN}$s) and three fundamental procedures: temporal rescaling, discretisation and linearisation. These techniques provide essential tools for characterizing $\mathtt{RNN}$s behaviour, enabling insights into temporal dynamics, practical computational implementation, and linear approximations for analysis. We discuss the flexible order of application of these procedures, emphasizing their significance in modelling and analyzing $\mathtt{RNN}$s for neuroscience and machine learning applications. We explicitly describe here under what conditions these procedures can be interchangeable.

                arXiv:2405.10183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer simulations are an important tool for studying the mechanics of biological evolution. In particular, in silico work with agent-based models provides an opportunity to collect high-quality records of ancestry relationships among simulated agents. Such phylogenies can provide insight into evolutionary dynamics within these simulations. Existing work generally tracks lineages directly, yielding an exact phylogenetic record of evolutionary history. However, direct tracking can be inefficient for large-scale, many-processor evolutionary simulations. An alternate approach to extracting phylogenetic information from simulation that scales more favorably is post hoc estimation, akin to how bioinformaticians build phylogenies by assessing genetic similarities between organisms. Recently introduced ``hereditary stratigraphy'' algorithms provide means for efficient inference of phylogenetic history from non-coding annotations on simulated organisms' genomes. A number of options exist in configuring hereditary stratigraphy methodology, but no work has yet tested how they impact reconstruction quality. To address this question, we surveyed reconstruction accuracy under alternate configurations across a matrix of evolutionary conditions varying in selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecological dynamics. We synthesize results from these experiments to suggest a prescriptive system of best practices for work with hereditary stratigraphy, ultimately guiding researchers in choosing appropriate instrumentation for large-scale simulation studies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16555">Towards Information Theory-Based Discovery of Equivariances</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.16555v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of symmetries imposes a stringent set of constraints on a system. This constrained structure allows intelligent agents interacting with such a system to drastically improve the efficiency of learning and generalization, through the internalisation of the system's symmetries into their information-processing. In parallel, principled models of complexity-constrained learning and behaviour make increasing use of information-theoretic methods. Here, we wish to marry these two perspectives and understand whether and in which form the information-theoretic lens can "see" the effect of symmetries of a system. For this purpose, we propose a novel variant of the Information Bottleneck principle, which has served as a productive basis for many principled studies of learning and information-constrained adaptive behaviour. We show (in the discrete case and under a specific technical assumption) that our approach formalises a certain duality between symmetry and information parsimony: namely, channel equivariances can be characterised by the optimal mutual information-preserving joint compression of the channel's input and output. This information-theoretic treatment furthermore suggests a principled notion of "soft" equivariance, whose "coarseness" is measured by the amount of input-output mutual information preserved by the corresponding optimal compression. This new notion offers a bridge between the field of bounded rationality and the study of symmetries in neural representations. The framework may also allow (exact and soft) equivariances to be automatically discovered.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17506">Subspace Node Pruning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.17506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiency of neural network inference is undeniably important in a time where commercial use of AI models increases daily. Node pruning is the art of removing computational units such as neurons, filters, attention heads, or even entire layers to significantly reduce inference time while retaining network performance. In this work, we propose the projection of unit activations to an orthogonal subspace in which there is no redundant activity and within which we may prune nodes while simultaneously recovering the impact of lost units via linear least squares. We identify that, for effective node pruning, this subspace must be constructed using a triangular transformation matrix, a transformation which is equivalent to and unnormalized Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We furthermore show that the order in which units are orthogonalized can be optimised to maximally reduce node activations in our subspace and thereby form a more optimal ranking of nodes. Finally, we leverage these orthogonal subspaces to automatically determine layer-wise pruning ratios based upon the relative scale of node activations in our subspace, equivalent to cumulative variance. Our proposed method reaches state of the art when pruning ImageNet trained VGG-16 and rivals more complex state of the art methods when pruning ResNet-50 networks across a range of pruning ratios.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10780">Correlations Are Ruining Your Gradient Descent</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2407.10780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herein the topics of (natural) gradient descent, data decorrelation, and approximate methods for backpropagation are brought into a common discussion. Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.

                <p>Executive control of movement enables inhibiting impulsive responses critical for successful navigation of the environment. Circuits mediating stop commands involve prefrontal and basal ganglia structures with fMRI evidence demonstrating increased activity during response inhibition in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)&mdash;often ascribed to maintaining task attentional demands. Using direct intraoperative cortical recordings in male and female human subjects, we investigated oscillatory dynamics along the rostral-caudal axis of dlPFC during a modified Go/No-go task, probing components of both proactive and reactive motor control. We assessed whether cognitive control is topographically organized along this axis and observed that low-frequency power increased prominently in mid-rostral dlPFC when inhibiting and delaying responses. These findings provide evidence for a key role for mid-rostral dlPFC low-frequency oscillations in sculpting motor control.</p>

                <p>The surprising omission or reduction of vital resources (food, fluid, social partners) can induce an aversive emotion known as frustrative nonreward (FNR), which can influence subsequent behavior and physiology. FNR is an integral mediator of irritability/aggression, motivation (substance use disorders, depression), anxiety/fear/threat, learning/conditioning, and social behavior. Despite substantial progress in the study of FNR during the twentieth century, research lagged in the later part of the century and into the early twenty-first century until the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria initiative included FNR and loss as components of the negative valence domain. This led to a renaissance of new research and paradigms relevant to basic and clinical science alike. The COVID-19 pandemic's extensive individual and social restrictions were correlated with increased drug and alcohol use, social conflict, irritability, and suicide, all potential consequences of FNR. This article highlights animal models related to these psychiatric disorders and symptoms and presents recent advances in identifying the brain regions and neurotransmitters implicated.</p>

                <p>Emotionally salient experiences are encoded and remembered more strongly, an effect that can be amplified by hormones like cortisol. Such memories can in turn profoundly influence later behavior. However, little is known about the link between amplified salience encoding and subsequent behavior. This pathway may be particularly important for risky alcohol drinking, which has been linked to sensitized salience responses, memory, and cortisol. To test this possibility, we integrated pharmacology using a double-blind cross-over design with fMRI, cognitive, and motivation assays across a range of healthy male and female social drinkers. As anticipated, cortisol enhanced memory for salient alcohol-related events; critically, this bias was in turn associated with later alcohol motivation. Increased alcohol motivation was particularly pronounced in more susceptible risky drinkers, for whom cortisol enhanced brain salience responses to alcohol. These sensitized salience responses predicted both memory biases and alcohol motivation. Together, these findings reveal maladaptive consequences of enhanced salience encoding.</p>

This review highlights recent discoveries on the role of glial cells in the establishment of cortical circuits and the regulation of experience-dependent neuronal plasticity during critical periods of neurodevelopment. These studies provide strong evidence that neuronal circuit maturation and plasticity are non-cell autonomous processes that require both glial&ndash;neuronal and glial&ndash;glial cross talk to proceed.

                <p>Primates, as social beings, have evolved complex brain mechanisms to navigate intricate social environments. This review explores the neural bases of body perception in both human and nonhuman primates, emphasizing the processing of social signals conveyed by body postures, movements, and interactions. Early studies identified selective neural responses to body stimuli in macaques, particularly within and ventral to the superior temporal sulcus (STS). These regions, known as body patches, represent visual features that are present in bodies but do not appear to be semantic body detectors. They provide information about posture and viewpoint of the body. Recent research using dynamic stimuli has expanded the understanding of the body-selective network, highlighting its complexity and the interplay between static and dynamic processing. In humans, body-selective areas such as the extrastriate body area (EBA) and fusiform body area (FBA) have been implicated in the perception of bodies and their interactions. Moreover, studies on social interactions reveal that regions in the human STS are also tuned to the perception of dyadic interactions, suggesting a specialized social lateral pathway. Computational work developed models of body recognition and social interaction, providing insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Despite advances, significant gaps remain in understanding the neural mechanisms of body perception and social interaction. Overall, this review underscores the importance of integrating findings across species to comprehensively understand the neural foundations of body perception and the interaction between computational modeling and neural recording.</p>

                <p>Palmitoylation, a lipid-based posttranslational protein modification, plays a crucial role in regulating various aspects of neuronal function through altering protein membrane-targeting, stabilities, and protein&ndash;protein interaction profiles. Disruption of palmitoylation has recently garnered attention as disease mechanism in neurodegeneration. Many proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and associated neuronal dysfunction, including but not limited to amyloid precursor protein, &beta;-secretase (BACE1), postsynaptic density protein 95, Fyn, synaptotagmin-11, mutant huntingtin, and mutant superoxide dismutase 1, undergo palmitoylation, and recent evidence suggests that altered palmitoylation contributes to the pathological characteristics of these proteins and associated disruption of cellular processes. In addition, dysfunction of enzymes that catalyze palmitoylation and depalmitoylation has been connected to the development of neurological disorders. This review highlights some of the latest advances in our understanding of palmitoylation regulation in neurodegenerative diseases and explores potential therapeutic implications.</p>

                <p>The traditional view of glial cells as mere supportive tissue has shifted, due to advances in technology and theoretical conceptualization, to include a diversity of other functions, such as regulation of complex behaviors. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS), have been shown to modulate synaptic functions through gliotransmitter-mediated neurotransmitter reuptake, influencing neuronal signaling and behavioral functions. Contemporary studies further highlight astrocytes&rsquo; involvement in complex cognitive functions. For instance, inhibiting astrocytes in the hippocampus can lead to memory deficits, suggesting their integral role in memory processes. Moreover, astrocytic calcium activity and astrocyte&ndash;neuron metabolic coupling have been linked to changes in synaptic strength and learning. Microglia, another type of glial cell, also extend beyond their supportive roles, contributing to learning and memory processes, with microglial reductions impacting these functions in a developmentally dependent manner. Oligodendrocytes, traditionally thought to have limited roles postdevelopment, are now recognized for their activity-dependent modulation of myelination and plasticity, thus influencing behavioral responses. Recent advancements in technology and computational modeling have expanded our understanding of glial functions, particularly how astrocytes influence neuronal circuits and behaviors. This review underscores the importance of glial cells in CNS functions and the need for further research to unravel the complexities of neuron&ndash;glia interactions, the impact of these interactions on brain functions, and potential implications for neurological diseases.</p>

                <p>The motor cortex is essential for controlling the flexible movements underlying complex behaviors. Behavioral flexibility involves the ability to integrate and refine new movements, thereby expanding an animal's repertoire. This review discusses recent strides in motor learning mechanisms across spatial and temporal scales, describing how neural networks are remodeled at the level of synapses, cell types, and circuits and across time as animals' learn new skills. It highlights how changes at each scale contribute to the evolving structure and function of neural circuits that accompanies the expansion and refinement of motor skills. We review new findings highlighted by advanced imaging techniques that have opened new vistas in optical physiology and neuroanatomy, revealing the complexity and adaptability of motor cortical circuits, crucial for learning and control. At the structural level, we explore the dynamic regulation of dendritic spines mediating corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs to the motor cortex. We delve into the role of perisynaptic astrocyte processes in maintaining synaptic stability during learning. We also examine the functional diversity among pyramidal neuron subtypes, their dendritic computations and unique contributions to single cell and network function. Further, we highlight how cortical activation is characterized by increased consistency and reduced strength as new movements are learned and how external inputs contribute to these changes. Finally, we consider the motor cortex's necessity as movements unfold over long time scales. These insights will continue to drive new research directions, enhancing our understanding of motor cortical circuit transformations that underpin behavioral changes expressed throughout an animal's life.</p>

                <p>When exposed to rhythmic stimulation, the human brain displays rhythmic activity across sensory modalities and regions. Given the ubiquity of this phenomenon, how sensory rhythms are transformed into neural rhythms remains surprisingly inconclusive. An influential model posits that endogenous oscillations entrain to external rhythms, thereby encoding environmental dynamics and shaping perception. However, research on neural entrainment faces multiple challenges, from ambiguous definitions to methodological difficulties when endogenous oscillations need to be identified and disentangled from other stimulus-related mechanisms that can lead to similar phase-locked responses. Yet, recent years have seen novel approaches to overcome these challenges, including computational modeling, insights from dynamical systems theory, sophisticated stimulus designs, and study of neuropsychological impairments. This review outlines key challenges in neural entrainment research, delineates state-of-the-art approaches, and integrates findings from human and animal neurophysiology to provide a broad perspective on the usefulness, validity, and constraints of oscillatory models in brain&ndash;environment interaction.</p>

                <p>Hormonal contraceptives (HCs) are one of the most highly prescribed classes of drugs in the world used for both contraceptive and noncontraceptive purposes. Despite their prevalent use, the impact of HCs on the brain remains inadequately explored. This review synthesizes recent findings on the neuroscience of HCs, with a focus on human structural neuroimaging as well as translational, nonhuman animal studies investigating the cellular, molecular, and behavioral effects of HCs. Additionally, we consider data linking HCs to mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stress response as a potential mediator. The review also addresses the unique sensitivity of the adolescent brain to HCs, noting significant changes in brain structure and function when HCs are used during this developmental period. Finally, we discuss potential effects of HCs in combination with smoking-derived nicotine on outcomes of ischemic brain damage. Methodological challenges, such as the variability in HC formulations and user-specific factors, are acknowledged, emphasizing the need for precise and individualized research approaches. Overall, this review underscores the necessity for continued interdisciplinary research to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of HCs, aiming to optimize their use and improve women's health.</p>

                <p>Understanding the brain requires studying its multiscale interactions from molecules to networks. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets detailing brain circuit composition, connectivity, and activity is transforming neuroscience. However, integrating and interpreting this data remains challenging. Concurrently, advances in supercomputing and sophisticated modeling tools now enable the development of highly detailed, large-scale biophysical circuit models. These mechanistic multiscale models offer a method to systematically integrate experimental data, facilitating investigations into brain structure, function, and disease. This review, based on a Society for Neuroscience 2024 MiniSymposium, aims to disseminate recent advances in large-scale mechanistic modeling to the broader community. It highlights (1) examples of current models for various brain regions developed through experimental data integration; (2) their predictive capabilities regarding cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying experimental recordings (e.g., membrane voltage, spikes, local-field potential, electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography) and brain function; and (3) their use in simulating biomarkers for brain diseases like epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's, aiding in understanding their biophysical underpinnings and developing novel treatments. The review showcases state-of-the-art models covering hippocampus, somatosensory, visual, motor, auditory cortical, and thalamic circuits across species. These models predict neural activity at multiple scales and provide insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying sensation, motor behavior, brain signals, neural coding, disease, pharmacological interventions, and neural stimulation. Collaboration with experimental neuroscientists and clinicians is essential for the development and validation of these models, particularly as datasets grow. Hence, this review aims to foster interest in detailed brain circuit models, leading to cross-disciplinary collaborations that accelerate brain research.</p>

                <p>Somatosensory neuroprostheses restore, replace, or enhance tactile and proprioceptive feedback for people with sensory impairments due to neurological disorders or injury. Somatosensory neuroprostheses typically couple sensor inputs from a wearable device, prosthesis, robotic device, or virtual reality system with electrical stimulation applied to the somatosensory nervous system via noninvasive or implanted interfaces. While prior research has mainly focused on technology development and proof-of-concept studies, recent acceleration of clinical studies in this area demonstrates the translational potential of somatosensory neuroprosthetic systems. In this review, we provide an overview of neurostimulation approaches currently undergoing human testing and summarize recent clinical findings on the perceptual, functional, and psychological impact of somatosensory neuroprostheses. We also cover current work toward the development of advanced stimulation paradigms to produce more natural and informative sensory feedback. Finally, we provide our perspective on the remaining challenges that need to be addressed prior to translation of somatosensory neuroprostheses.</p>

                <p>Neuromodulators act on multiple timescales to affect neuronal activity and behavior. They function as synaptic fine-tuners and master coordinators of neuronal activity across distant brain regions and body organs. While much research on neuromodulation has focused on roles in promoting features of wakefulness and transitions between sleep and wake states, the precise dynamics and functions of neuromodulatory signaling during sleep have received less attention. This review discusses research presented at our minisymposium at the 2024 Society for Neuroscience meeting, highlighting how norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine orchestrate brain oscillatory activity, control sleep architecture and microarchitecture, regulate responsiveness to sensory stimuli, and facilitate memory consolidation. The potential of each neuromodulator to influence neuronal activity is shaped by the state of the synaptic milieu, which in turn is influenced by the organismal or systemic state. Investigating the effects of neuromodulator release across different sleep substates and synaptic environments offers unique opportunities to deepen our understanding of neuromodulation and explore the distinct computational opportunities that arise during sleep. Moreover, since alterations in neuromodulatory signaling and sleep are implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders and because existing pharmacological treatments affect neuromodulatory signaling, gaining a deeper understanding of the less-studied aspects of neuromodulators during sleep is of high importance.</p>

                <p>Most studies on the development of the visual system have focused on the mechanisms shaping early visual stages up to the level of primary visual cortex (V1). Much less is known about the development of the stages after V1 that handle the higher visual functions fundamental to everyday life. The standard model for the maturation of these areas is that it occurs sequentially, according to the positions of areas in the adult hierarchy. Yet, the existing literature reviewed here paints a different picture, one in which the adult configuration emerges through a sequence of unique network configurations that are not mere partial versions of the adult hierarchy. In addition to studying higher visual development per se to fill major gaps in knowledge, it will be crucial to adopt a network-level perspective in future investigations to unravel normal developmental mechanisms, identify vulnerabilities to developmental disorders, and eventually devise treatments for these disorders.</p>

In neuroscience, degeneracy can be seen in the constellation of biophysical properties that produce a neuron's characteristic intrinsic properties and/or the constellation of mechanisms that determine circuit outputs or behavior. Here, we present examples of degeneracy at multiple levels of organization, from single-cell behavior, small circuits, large circuits, and, in cognition, drawing conclusions from work ranging from bacteria to human cognition. Degeneracy allows the individual-to-individual variability within a population that creates potential for evolution.</p>

                <p>The development of the visual system is a complex and multistep process characterized by the precise wiring of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon terminals with their corresponding neurons in the visual nuclei of the brain. Upon reaching primary image-forming nuclei (IFN), such as the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus, RGC axons undergo extensive arborization that refines over the first few postnatal weeks. The molecular mechanisms driving this activity-dependent remodeling process, which is influenced by waves of spontaneous activity in the developing retina, are still not well understood. In this study, by manipulating the activity of RGCs in mice from either sex and analyzing their transcriptomic profiles before eye-opening, we identified the Type I membrane protein synaptotagmin 13 (Syt13) as involved in spontaneous activity-dependent remodeling. Using these mice, we also explored the impact of spontaneous retinal activity on the development of other RGC recipient targets such as nonimage-forming (NIF) nuclei and demonstrated that proper frequency and duration of retinal waves occurring prior to visual experience are essential for shaping the connectivity of the NIF circuit. Together, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms governing activity-dependent axon refinement during the assembly of the visual circuit.</p>

                <p>The human brain exhibits both oscillatory and aperiodic, or 1/<I>f</I>, activity. Although a large body of research has focused on the relationship between brain rhythms and sensory processes, aperiodic activity has often been overlooked as functionally irrelevant. Prompted by recent findings linking aperiodic activity to the balance between neural excitation and inhibition, we investigated its effects on the temporal resolution of perception. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from participants (both sexes) during the resting state and a task in which they detected the presence of two flashes separated by variable interstimulus intervals. Two-flash discrimination accuracy typically follows a sigmoid function whose steepness reflects perceptual variability or inconsistent integration/segregation of the stimuli. We found that individual differences in the steepness of the psychometric function correlated with EEG aperiodic exponents over posterior scalp sites. In other words, participants with flatter EEG spectra (i.e., greater neural excitation) exhibited increased sensory noise, resulting in shallower psychometric curves. Our finding suggests that aperiodic EEG is linked to sensory integration processes usually attributed to the rhythmic inhibition of neural oscillations. Overall, this correspondence between aperiodic neural excitation and behavioral measures of sensory noise provides a more comprehensive explanation of the relationship between brain activity and sensory integration and represents an important extension to theories of how the brain samples sensory input over time.</p>

                <p>by Ruipeng Wei, Masahiro Hitomi, Tammy Sadler, Lamis Yehia, Daniela Calvetti, Jacob Scott, Charis Eng</p>

Persons with germline variants in the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog, <i>PTEN</i>, are molecularly diagnosed with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). PHTS confers high risks of specific malignancies, and up to 23% of the patients are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or developmental delay (DD). The accurate prediction of these two seemingly disparate phenotypes (cancer <i>vs</i>. ASD/DD) for PHTS at the individual level remains elusive despite the available statistical prevalence of specific phenotypes of the syndrome at the population level. The pleiotropy of the syndrome may, in part, be due to the alterations of the key multi-functions of PTEN. Maintenance of genome integrity is one of the key biological functions of PTEN, but no integrative studies have been conducted to quantify the DNA damage response (DDR) in individuals with PHTS and to relate to phenotypes and genotypes. In this study, we used 43 PHTS patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to investigate the associations between DDR and <i>PTEN</i> genotypes and/or clinical phenotypes ASD/DD <i>vs</i>. cancer. The dynamics of DDR of γ-irradiated LCLs were analyzed using the exponential decay mathematical model to fit temporal changes in γH2AX levels which report the degree of DNA damage. We found that <i>PTEN</i> nonsense variants are associated with less efficient DNA damage repair ability resulting in higher DNA damage levels at 24 hours after irradiation compared to <i>PTEN</i> missense variants. Regarding PHTS phenotypes, LCLs from PHTS individuals with ASD/DD showed faster DNA damage repairing rate than those from patients without ASD/DD or cancer. We also applied the reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) mathematical model, a tumor cell growth model with a DNA damage term, to accurately describe the DDR process in the LCLs. For each LCL, we can derive parameters of the PDE. Then we averaged the numerical results by PHTS phenotypes. By performing simple subtraction of two subgroup average results, we found that PHTS-ASD/DD is associated with higher live cell density at lower DNA damage level but lower cell density level at higher DNA damage level compared to LCLs from individuals with PHTS-cancer and PHTS-neither.

                <p>by Jan Lause, Philipp Berens, Dmitry Kobak</p>

A recent paper claimed that <i>t</i>-SNE and UMAP embeddings of single-cell datasets are “specious” and fail to capture true biological structure. The authors argued that such embeddings are as arbitrary and as misleading as forcing the data into an elephant shape. Here we show that this conclusion was based on inadequate and limited metrics of embedding quality. More appropriate metrics quantifying neighborhood and class preservation reveal the elephant in the room: while <i>t</i>-SNE and UMAP embeddings of single-cell data do not preserve high-dimensional distances, they can nevertheless provide biologically relevant information.

                Background Conventional antifungal therapies, including topical applications, are effective against oral candidiasis but have limitations such as resistance development and cytotoxicity especially for immunocompromised patients. Phytotherapy presents a promising alternative, offering potential solutions to these challenges. However, despite numerous clinical trials, there is a lack of standardized protocols for phytotherapeutic applications. This systematic review protocol seeks to evaluate the potential of phytotherapy as an alternative treatment for oral candidiasis and compare its efficacy with standard antifungal therapies. Protocol This protocol aims to assess the effectiveness of phytotherapy compared to standard antifungal treatments for oral candidiasis. Initially, controlled descriptors in MeSH terms (e.g., “Candidiasis, Oral,” “Phytotherapy”) and keywords were selected from MEDLINE and combined using Boolean operators (‘AND’, ‘OR’) to create a comprehensive search strategy. Titles and abstracts will be screened by two independent reviewers to select studies that meet the inclusion criteria. The quality and risk of bias of the selected studies will be assessed afterward. Data will be gathered using standardized tools and subsequently synthesized for analysis. Discrepancies between reviewers will be settled through discussion, or, if required, by involving a third reviewer. Discussion Results obtained from this systematic review will describe various natural compounds like essential oils, herbal extracts, and bioactive plant ingredients that exhibit antifungal properties used against oral candidiasis and will evaluate their effectiveness in comparison to standard antifungal treatments.

                Background The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in electrocardiographic (ECG) devices has become a pivotal area of research, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. These technologies are essential for enhancing cardiac diagnosis and monitoring. Methods This study assesses current trends, key contributors, and collaborative networks in the field of AI-enhanced ECG devices. We utilized a comprehensive analysis, using the Biblioshiny library from Bibliometrix for data exploration of data extracted from the Scopus database and VOSViewer for creating and visualizing maps. These tools were played an important role in conducting an in-depth analysis of the relationships and developments within the field. Results The analysis shows a significant increase in publications related to AI-enhanced ECG devices, with a marked surge during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the growing interest and technological advancements, the study exposes a notable disparity in the geographical distribution of research contributions, highlighting substantial under-representation of African researchers. This gap is attributed to infrastructural, financial constraints, and limited collaborative networks within the continent. Conclusion The rapid evolution and increasing importance of AI in ECG devices underscore the need for more inclusive research practices. There is a critical need to integrate and promote contributions from under-represented regions, particularly Africa, to ensure a globally diverse perspective in tackling health challenges. This study calls for enhanced participation and support for African researchers to bridge the existing research gap and foster global health equity.

                Background Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of death in men worldwide. The treatment of PCa depends on the clinical stage of the disease, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and histology. Lycopene is a bright red carotenoid found in tomatoes, which enhances apoptosis in prostate cells, but its effectiveness has not been studied in East African countries. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of lycopene from tomato extracts in reducing PSA levels, disease progression, and apoptosis in the prostate glands of men with PCa in Tanzania. Methods This study will be a randomized phase III clinical trial of men diagnosed with PCa in Tanzania. In total, 400 men will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive intervention (n=200) and control (n=200) and followed for 12 months. The intervention arm will receive tomato paste for daily use in addition to the standard treatment, whereas the control arm will only follow the standard of care. The primary endpoints will be a reduction in PSA levels, improved clinical status, and apoptosis of the prostate gland. Data analysis was performed based on the intention-to-treat principle. Descriptive statistics were used to compare average lycopene and PSA levels in the intervention group using T-test and Chi-squared tests. Generalized linear mixed models will be used to further assess the effect of lycopene on PCa progression, urinary symptoms, and PSA reduction. All statistical tests were two-sided at an alpha level of <0.05. Discussion The study used a food supplement as a drug/intervention with minimal or no adverse reactions. However, there is a fear that the control group may not adhere to the protocol after learning the benefits of tomato paste. The study findings will promote the consumption of tomato paste in males diagnosed with PCa to improve the clinical status and reduce disease progression. Trial registration The study has been registered at the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry with registration No PACTR202405488763956.

                Endometriosis is a benign, estrogen-dependent, persistent chronic inflammatory heterogeneous condition that features adhesions caused by estrogen-dependent periodic bleeding. It is characterised by a widely spread fibrotic interstitium that comprising of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, collagen fibres, extracellular proteins, inflammatory cells, and active angiogenesis found outside the uterus. Thus, fibrosis is recognized as a critical component because of which current treatments, such as hormonal therapy and surgical excision of lesions are largely ineffective with severe side effects, high recurrence rates, and significant morbidity. The symptoms include dysmenorrhea (cyclic or non-cyclic), dyspareunia, abdominal discomfort, and infertility. The significant lack of knowledge regarding the underlying root cause, etiology, and complex pathogenesis of this debilitating condition, makes it challenging to diagnose early and to implement therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects presenting substantial hurdles in endometriosis management. Research on understanding the pathogenesis of endometriosis is still ongoing to find biomarkers and develop non-hormonal therapeutic approaches. Current clinical research indicates a close relationship between endometriosis and fibrosis, which is thought to be tightly linked to pain, a major factor for the decline in the patient’s quality of life but little is known about the underlying pathophysiological cellular and molecular signaling pathways that lead to endometriosis-related fibrosis. The available experimental disease models have tremendous challenges in reproducing the human characteristics of the disease to assess treatment effectiveness. Future translational research on the topic has been hindered by the lack of an adequate fibrotic model of endometriosis emphasizing the necessity of etiological exploration. This review article’s goal is to examine recent developments in the field and pinpoint knowledge gaps that exist with a focus on the development of novel fibrotic mouse models for the early diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis and how this knowledge aids in the development of novel anti-fibrotic treatments which opens fresh avenues for a thorough investigation and extended research in the field of endometriosis.

                Stępkowski et al. describe alterations of the proteome of nascently translated proteins in response to transient mitochondrial stress. These alterations are driven by stress-induced global translation attenuation and are reversible, rapidly recovering upon the relief of stress and with a temporal dis-synchrony between the recovery of cytosolic and of mitochondrial translation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88670">I-Spin live, an open-source software based on blind-source separation for real-time decoding of motor unit activity in humans</a></h4>

              
                Decoding the activity of individual neural cells during natural behaviours allows neuroscientists to study how the nervous system generates and controls movements. Contrary to other neural cells, the activity of spinal motor neurons can be determined non-invasively (or minimally invasively) from the decomposition of electromyographic (EMG) signals into motor unit firing activities. For some interfacing and neuro-feedback investigations, EMG decomposition needs to be performed in real time. Here, we introduce an open-source software that performs real-time decoding of motor neurons using a blind-source separation approach for multichannel EMG signal processing. Separation vectors (motor unit filters) are optimised for each motor unit from baseline contractions and then re-applied in real time during test contractions. In this way, the firing activity of multiple motor neurons can be provided through different forms of visual feedback. We provide a complete framework with guidelines and examples of recordings to guide researchers who aim to study movement control at the motor neuron level. We first validated the software with synthetic EMG signals generated during a range of isometric contraction patterns. We then tested the software on data collected using either surface or intramuscular electrode arrays from five lower limb muscles (gastrocnemius lateralis and medialis, vastus lateralis and medialis, and tibialis anterior). We assessed how the muscle or variation of contraction intensity between the baseline contraction and the test contraction impacted the accuracy of the real-time decomposition. This open-source software provides a set of tools for neuroscientists to design experimental paradigms where participants can receive real-time feedback on the output of the spinal cord circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98665">Formation of multinucleated osteoclasts depends on an oxidized species of cell surface-associated La protein</a></h4>

              
                The bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts plays a critical role in the life-long remodeling of our bones that is perturbed in many bone loss diseases. Multinucleated osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of precursor cells, and larger cells – generated by an increased number of cell fusion events – have higher resorptive activity. We find that osteoclast fusion and bone resorption are promoted by reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and by an unconventional low molecular weight species of La protein, located at the osteoclast surface. Here, we develop the hypothesis that La’s unique regulatory role in osteoclast multinucleation and function is controlled by an ROS switch in La trafficking. Using antibodies that recognize reduced or oxidized species of La, we find that differentiating osteoclasts enrich an oxidized species of La at the cell surface, which is distinct from the reduced La species conventionally localized within cell nuclei. ROS signaling triggers the shift from reduced to oxidized La species, its dephosphorylation and delivery to the surface of osteoclasts, where La promotes multinucleation and resorptive activity. Moreover, intracellular ROS signaling in differentiating osteoclasts oxidizes critical cysteine residues in the C-terminal half of La, producing this unconventional La species that promotes osteoclast fusion. Our findings suggest that redox signaling induces changes in the location and function of La and may represent a promising target for novel skeletal therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89705">An anciently diverged family of RNA binding proteins maintain correct splicing of a class of ultra-long exons through cryptic splice site repression</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed that the germ cell-specific nuclear protein RBMXL2 represses cryptic splicing patterns during meiosis and is required for male fertility (Ehrmann et al., 2019). Here, we show that in somatic cells the similar yet ubiquitously expressed RBMX protein has similar functions. RBMX regulates a distinct class of exons that exceed the median human exon size. RBMX protein-RNA interactions are enriched within ultra-long exons, particularly within genes involved in genome stability, and repress the selection of cryptic splice sites that would compromise gene function. The <i>RBMX</i> gene is silenced during male meiosis due to sex chromosome inactivation. To test whether RBMXL2 might replace the function of RBMX during meiosis we induced expression of RBMXL2 and the more distantly related RBMY protein in somatic cells, finding each could rescue aberrant patterns of RNA processing caused by RBMX depletion. The C-terminal disordered domain of RBMXL2 is sufficient to rescue proper splicing control after RBMX depletion. Our data indicate that RBMX and RBMXL2 have parallel roles in somatic tissues and the germline that must have been conserved for at least 200 million years of mammalian evolution. We propose RBMX family proteins are particularly important for the splicing inclusion of some ultra-long exons with increased intrinsic susceptibility to cryptic splice site selection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73832">Temporal transcriptional response of Candida glabrata during macrophage infection reveals a multifaceted transcriptional regulator CgXbp1 important for macrophage response and fluconazole resistance</a></h4>

              
                <i>Candida glabrata</i> can thrive inside macrophages and tolerate high levels of azole antifungals. These innate abilities render infections by this human pathogen a clinical challenge. How <i>C. glabrata</i> reacts inside macrophages and what is the molecular basis of its drug tolerance are not well understood. Here, we mapped genome-wide RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupancy in <i>C. glabrata</i> to delineate its transcriptional responses during macrophage infection in high temporal resolution. RNAPII profiles revealed dynamic <i>C. glabrata</i> responses to macrophages with genes of specialized pathways activated chronologically at different times of infection. We identified an uncharacterized transcription factor (CgXbp1) important for the chronological macrophage response, survival in macrophages, and virulence. Genome-wide mapping of CgXbp1 direct targets further revealed its multi-faceted functions, regulating not only virulence-related genes but also genes associated with drug resistance. Finally, we showed that CgXbp1 indeed also affects fluconazole resistance. Overall, this work presents a powerful approach for examining host-pathogen interaction and uncovers a novel transcription factor important for <i>C. glabrata</i>'s survival in macrophages and drug tolerance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93113">Multiple origins of dorsal ecdysial sutures in trilobites and their relatives</a></h4>

              
                Euarthropods are an extremely diverse phylum in the modern, and have been since their origination in the early Palaeozoic. They grow through moulting the exoskeleton (ecdysis) facilitated by breaking along lines of weakness (sutures). Artiopodans, a group that includes trilobites and their non-biomineralizing relatives, dominated arthropod diversity in benthic communities during the Palaeozoic. Most trilobites – a hyperdiverse group of tens of thousands of species - moult by breaking the exoskeleton along cephalic sutures, a strategy that has contributed to their high diversity during the Palaeozoic. However, the recent description of similar sutures in early diverging non-trilobite artiopodans means that it is unclear whether these sutures evolved deep within Artiopoda, or convergently appeared multiple times within the group. Here, we describe new well-preserved material of <i>Acanthomeridion</i>, a putative early diverging artiopodan, including hitherto unknown details of its ventral anatomy and appendages revealed through CT scanning, highlighting additional possible homologous features between the ventral plates of this taxon and trilobite free cheeks. We used three coding strategies treating ventral plates as homologous to trilobite-free cheeks, to trilobite cephalic doublure, or independently derived. If ventral plates are considered homologous to free cheeks, <i>Acanthomeridion</i> is recovered sister to trilobites, however, dorsal ecdysial sutures are still recovered at many places within Artiopoda. If ventral plates are considered homologous to doublure or non-homologous, then <i>Acanthomeridion</i> is not recovered as sister to trilobites, and thus the ventral plates represent a distinct feature to trilobite doublure/free cheeks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95599">Cardiac afferent signals can facilitate visual dominance in binocular rivalry</a></h4>

              
                Sensory signals from the body’s visceral organs (e.g. the heart) can robustly influence the perception of exteroceptive sensations. This interoceptive–exteroceptive interaction has been argued to underlie self-awareness by situating one’s perceptual awareness of exteroceptive stimuli in the context of one’s internal state, but studies probing cardiac influences on visual awareness have yielded conflicting findings. In this study, we presented separate grating stimuli to each of subjects’ eyes as in a classic binocular rivalry paradigm – measuring the duration for which each stimulus dominates in perception. However, we caused the gratings to ‘pulse’ at specific times relative to subjects’ real-time electrocardiogram, manipulating whether pulses occurred during cardiac systole, when baroreceptors signal to the brain that the heart has contracted, or in diastole when baroreceptors are silent. The influential ‘Baroreceptor Hypothesis’ predicts the effect of baroreceptive input on visual perception should be uniformly suppressive. In contrast, we observed that dominance durations increased for systole-entrained stimuli, inconsistent with the Baroreceptor Hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that this cardiac-dependent rivalry effect is preserved in subjects who are at-chance discriminating between systole-entrained and diastole-presented stimuli in a separate interoceptive awareness task, suggesting that our results are not dependent on conscious access to heartbeat sensations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90766">The zinc-finger transcription factor Sfp1 imprints specific classes of mRNAs and links their synthesis to cytoplasmic decay</a></h4>

              
                To function effectively as an integrated system, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate through mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Here, we focus on the zinc-finger Sfp1, known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes. We show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription either by binding to promoters, like most known transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions (gene bodies), probably via RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We further studied the first mode of Sfp1 activity and found that, following promoter binding, Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration, manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. Surprisingly, Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1’s dissociation from chromatin. Intriguingly, Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II. We propose that, following promoter recruitment, Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1’s relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability. Thus, Sfp1’s co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs, and a paradigm for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between Sfp1’s two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined.

">Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) overexpression in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus alters motivated and affective behavior in female rats</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has been found to be involved in a wide range of motivated and affective behaviors. While the PACAP-38 isoform is more densely expressed than PACAP-27 in most of the brain, PACAP-27 is more highly expressed in the rodent paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), where females also have greater expression than males. Notably, the role of PACAP-27 expression in cells of the PVT has not been explored. Methods: Adult, female Long-Evans rats were injected in the PVT with an AAV to increase expression of PACAP or a control AAV. They were then investigated for subsequent gene and peptide levels of PACAP in the PVT; ethanol drinking and preference; sucrose drinking and preference; or locomotor activity in a novel chamber, behavior in a light-dark box, behavior in a novelty suppression of feeding test, locomotor activity in a familiar activity chamber, and behavior in a forced swim test. Results: Gene expression of PACAP was significantly increased in the PVT by four weeks after injection with the PACAP AAV, and this resulted in a specific increase in levels of PACAP-27. Rats injected with the PACAP AAV demonstrated reduced drinking and preference for ethanol under the intermittent-access procedure compared to those injected with the control AAV. In contrast, rats injected with the PACAP AAV showed no significant difference in drinking or preference for sucrose, or in any affective behavior tested, except that they spent less time swimming in the forced swim test. Conclusions: In light of the low overall level of expression of PACAP-27 in the brain, the ability of PACAP-27 in the PVT to control ethanol drinking, with minimal effects on other motivated or affective behaviors, supports the idea that compounds related to PACAP-27 should be investigated as potential therapeutics for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.

">Striatal modulation supports policy-specific reinforcement and not action selection</a></h4>

              
                Two contrasting models dominate our understanding of basal ganglia function: action selection and reinforcement learning. Prolonged, indiscriminate stimulation of direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons produces effects consistent with the action selection; however this approach ignores the transient, movement-specific dynamics that characterize these cells. To determine how striatal subpopulations contribute to mouse behavior, we applied brief closed-loop optogenetic stimulation to modulate ongoing activity in a manner that directly dissociates the contrasting models: upon the detection of locomotor arrest or leftward turns. While action selection models predict that increased direct pathway stimulation should induce locomotion and turning contralaterally to the side of stimulation, selective stimulation biased behavioral policies towards more frequent locomotor arrest and leftward turns, regardless of the side of stimulation. Indirect pathway stimulation had the opposite effect. Behavior followed the policy associated with the change in striatal activity, providing a mechanism to enable the reinforcement a wide range of behavioral features to shape performance.

">Intellectual disability-causing mutations in KIF11 impair microtubule dynamics and dendritic arborization</a></h4>

              
                Precise control of axonal and dendritic architecture is vital for proper brain function, with microtubule (MT) dynamics playing a central role in this process. Here, we uncover a previously unrecognized function of the molecular motor protein KIF11, which acts as a MT dynamics rheostat in hippocampal neurons to modulate dendritic branching. Known for its role in mitotic spindle bipolarity, KIF11 is also implicated in Microcephaly with or without chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or intellectual disabilities (MCLID). However, the specific neuronal functions of KIF11 and the impact of its mutations in MCLID have remained largely unexplored. Our studies, using quantitative imaging of MT dynamics following KIF11 inhibition, indicate that KIF11 preferentially binds to parallel MTs in mature neurons. This binding is associated with a marked increase in minus-end-out MT dynamics in both axons and dendrites upon KIF11 loss of function, coupled with enhanced MT flux and extended growth in tertiary dendrites. These changes suggest a novel role for KIF11 in orchestrating dendritic branching. Moreover, introducing MCLID-associated KIF11 mutations, KIF11Y82F, and KIF11{Delta}Cterm, which cause minor microcephaly but severe intellectual disabilities, leads to significantly reduced MT dynamics and impaired dendritic arborization. In a microtubule sliding assay, KIF11Y82F significantly reduced KIF11 velocity while KIF11{Delta}Cterm increased it. Temporal inhibition of KIF11 using a photo-inhibitable KIF11, show increased MT dynamics and dendritic growth, while activation results in kinked and twisted branches. Together, these data reveal that KIF11 is MT dynamics rheostat and regulator of dendritic arborization in mature neurons and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving MCLID.

">Susceptibility to auditory feedback manipulations and individual variability</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring auditory feedback from hearing one's own voice is important for fluent speech production as it enables detection and correction of speech errors. The influence of auditory feedback is best illustrated by manipulating it during speech production. A common temporal manipulation technique, delaying auditory feedback (DAF), leads to disruptions in speech fluency, while a common spectral manipulation technique, perturbing the pitch of auditory feedback (PAF), results in vocal alterations. Previous research involving clinical populations has revealed diverse susceptibility profiles to auditory feedback manipulations, yet the extent of such diversity within the neurotypical population remains unclear. Furthermore, different types of manipulations elicit distinct speech errors (i.e. fluency/coordination versus acoustic errors), which may be processed by distinct error correction mechanisms. It is yet to be understood whether individuals affected by one manipulation are similarly impacted by the other. Lastly, based on evidence from clinical studies, which demonstrated that visual feedback can improve impaired speech production, it is an open question whether visual feedback can alleviate the disruptive effects of altered auditory feedback. We recorded voice samples from 40 neurotypical participants during both a DAF and a PAF task. DAF significantly prolonged articulation duration and increased voice pitch and intensity. In some trials, participants received immediate visual feedback, however visual feedback did not alleviate but rather strengthened the disruptive effects of DAF. During the PAF task, participants adjusted their voice pitch in the opposite direction of the perturbation in majority of the trials to compensate for the perturbation. We assessed susceptibility of the participants to the effects of DAF and PAF by examining articulation duration and compensatory vocal response magnitude, respectively. Susceptibility varied widely among participants for both manipulations, but individuals susceptible to one manipulation did not consistently exhibit susceptibility to the other, indicating distinct processing mechanisms for these different types of auditory feedback manipulations.

">Neural dynamics of spontaneous memory recall and future thinking in the continuous flow of thoughts</a></h4>

              
                The human brain constantly recalls past experiences and anticipates future events, generating a continuous flow of thoughts. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the natural transitions and trajectories of thoughts during spontaneous memory recall and future thinking remain underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using a think-aloud paradigm, where participants verbalize their uninterrupted stream of thoughts during rest. We found that transitions between thoughts, particularly those involving significant shifts in semantic content, activate the brain's default and control networks. These neural responses to internally generated thought boundaries produce activation patterns resembling those triggered by external event boundaries. Moreover, interactions within and between these networks shape the overall semantic structure of thought trajectories: stronger functional connectivity within the medial temporal subsystem of the default network predicts greater variability in thoughts, while stronger connectivity between the control and core default networks is associated with reduced variability. Together, our findings highlight how the default and control networks guide the dynamic transitions and structure of naturally arising memory and future thinking.

                Attention can be deployed in anticipation of visual stimuli based on features such as their color or direction of motion. This anticipatory feature-based attention involves top-down neural control signals from a frontoparietal network that bias visual cortex to enhance the processing of attended information and suppress distraction. So, for example, anticipatory attention control can enable effective selection based on stimulus color while ignoring distracting information about stimulus motion. But as well, anticipatory attention can be focused more narrowly, for example, to select specific colors or motion directions. One important question that remains open is whether anticipatory attention control first biases broad feature dimensions such as color versus motion before biasing the specific feature attributes (e.g., blue vs. green). To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity during a task where participants were cued to either attend to a color (blue or green) or a motion direction (up or down) on a trial-by-trial basis. Applying multivariate decoding approaches to the EEG alpha band (8-12 Hz) activity during the attention control period (cue-target interval), we observed significant decoding for both the attended dimensions (color vs. motion) and specific feature attributes (blue vs. green; up vs. down). Importantly, the temporal onset of the dimension-level biasing (color vs. motion) preceded that of the attribute-level biasing (e.g., blue vs. green). These findings demonstrate that the top-down control of feature-based attention proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first selecting the broad feature dimension, and then narrowing selection to the specific feature attribute.

">Computational modelling reveals neurobiological contributions to static and dynamic functional connectivity patterns</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) is a widely used indicator of brain function in health and disease, yet its neurobiological underpinnings still need to be firmly established. Recent advances in computational modelling allow us to investigate the relationship between FC and neurobiology non-invasively. These techniques allow for targeted manipulations to study the effect of network disturbances on FC. Most modelling research has concentrated on replicating empirical static FC (sFC). However, FC changes over time, and its dynamic properties are closely linked to behaviour and symptomatology. In this study, we adapted computational models to reflect both sFC and dynamic FC (dFC) of individuals, allowing for a more comprehensive characterisation of the neurobiological origins of FC. We modelled the brain activity of 200 healthy individuals based on empirical resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Simulations were conducted using a group-averaged structural connectome and four parameters guiding regional brain activity: i) G, a global coupling scaling parameter; ii) J_i, the local inhibitory current; iii) J_NMDA, the excitatory NMDA synaptic coupling parameter; and iv) w_p, the excitatory population recurrence weight. We evaluated the models based on four metrics: a) the sFC, b) the FC variance, c) the temporal correlation (TC), and d) the node cohesion (NC). The optimal model for each subject was identified by the fit to both sFC and TC. We analysed associations between brain-wide sFC and TC features with optimal model parameters and fits with a univariate correlation approach and multivariate prediction models. In addition, we used a group-average perturbation approach to investigate the effect of coupling in each region on overall network connectivity. Our models could replicate empirical sFC and TC but not the FC variance and NC. Both fits and parameters exhibited strong associations with brain connectivity. G correlated positively and J_NMDA negatively with a range of static and dynamic FC features (|r| > 0.2, p(FDR) < 0.05). TC fit correlated negatively, and sFC fit positively with static and dynamic FC features. TC features were predictive of TC fit, sFC features of sFC fit (R^2 > 0.5). Perturbation analysis revealed that the sFC fit was most impacted by coupling changes in the left paracentral gyrus ({Delta}r = 0.07). In contrast, the left pars triangularis impacted the TC fit most strongly ({Delta}r = 0.24). Our findings indicate that neurobiological characteristics are associated with individual variability in sFC and dFC, and that sFC and dFC are shaped by small sets of distinct regions. In addition, we show that brain network modelling can replicate some, but not all, properties of dFC, and model fits are strongly influenced by specific FC patterns. By modelling both sFC and dFC, we could produce new insights into neurobiological mechanisms of brain network configurations.

">Verifying the concordance between motion corrected and conventional MPRAGE for pediatric morphometric analysis</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To validate a retrospective motion correction technique, Distributed and Incoherent Sample Orders for Reconstruction Deblurring using Encoding Redundancy (DISORDER), for pediatric brain morphometry. Methods: Two T1-weighted MPRAGE 3D datasets were acquired at 3T in thirty-seven children, median age 7.75 years; one with conventional linear phase encoding and one using DISORDER. MPRAGE images were scored as motion-free or motion-corrupt. Cortical morphometry and regional brain volumes were measured with FreeSurfer, subcortical grey matter (GM) with FSL-FIRST, and hippocampal volumes with HippUnfold. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determine agreement between the 2 MPRAGE acquisitions. Mann-Whitney U was used to test the difference between measures obtained using DISORDER and (i) motion-free and (ii) motion-corrupt conventional MPRAGE data. Results: ICC measures were good/excellent for most subcortical GM (motion-free, 0.75-0.96; motion-corrupt, 0.62-0.98) and regional brain volumes (motion-free 0.47-0.99; motion-corrupt, 0.54-0.99) between conventional MPRAGE and DISORDER data, except for the amygdala and nucleus accumbens (motion-free, 0.38-0.65; motion-corrupt, 0.1-0.42). However, these values were less consistent for motion-corrupt conventional MPRAGE data for hippocampal volumes (motion-free 0.65-0.99; motion-corrupt, 0.11-0.91) and cortical measures (motion-free 0.76-0.98; motion-corrupt, 0.09-0.74). Mann-Whitney U showed percentage differences in measures obtained with motion-corrupt conventional MPRAGE compared to DISORDER data were significantly greater than in those obtained using motion-free conventional MPRAGE data in 22/58 structures. Conclusion: In the absence of motion, morphometric measures obtained using DISORDER are largely consistent with those from conventional MPRAGE data, whereas improved reliability is obtained by DISORDER for motion-degraded scans. This study validates DISORDER for brain morphometric studies in children.

">Diverse calcium dynamics underlie place field formation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells</a></h4>

              
                Every explored environment is represented in the hippocampus by the activity of distinct populations of pyramidal cells (PCs) that typically fire at specific locations called their place fields (PFs). PFs are constantly born even in familiar surroundings (during representational drift), and many rapidly emerge when the animal explores a new or altered environment (during global or partial remapping). Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), a plasticity mechanism based on prolonged somatic bursts induced by dendritic Ca2+ plateau potentials, was recently proposed as the main cellular mechanism underlying new PF formations (PFF), but it is unknown whether burst-associated large somatic [Ca2+] transients are necessary and/or sufficient for PFF. To address this issue, here we performed in vivo two-photon [Ca2+] imaging of hippocampal CA1 PCs in head-restrained mice to investigate somatic [Ca2+] dynamics underlying PFFs in familiar and novel virtual environments. Our results demonstrate that although many PFs are formed by BTSP-like events, PFs also frequently emerge with initial [Ca2+] dynamics that do not match any of the characteristics of BTSP. BTSP and non-BTSP-like new PFFs occur spontaneously in familiar environments, during neuronal representational switches and instantaneously in new environments. Our data also reveal that solitary [Ca2+] transients that exceed in amplitude those evoking BTSP-like PFFs frequently occur without inducing PFs, demonstrating that large [Ca2+] transients per se are not sufficient for PFF.

">Robust Detection of Brain Stimulation Artifacts in iEEG Using Autoencoder-Generated Signals and ResNet Classification</a></h4>

              
                Background: Intracranial EEG (iEEG) is crucial for understanding brain function, but stimulation-induced noise complicates data interpretation. Traditional artifact detection methods require manual user input or struggle with noise variability, especially with limited labeled data. Objective: We developed a supervised method to automatically detect stimulation-induced noise in human iEEG recordings using synthetic data generated by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to train a ResNet-18 classifier. Methods: Multi-lead iEEG data were collected, preprocessed, and used to train VAEs for generating synthetic clean and noisy signals. The ResNet-18 model was trained on images of spectra generated from these synthetic signals and validated on real iEEG data from five participants. Results: The classifier, trained exclusively on synthetic data, demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and recall when applied to real iEEG recordings, with AUC values greater than 0.99 across all participants. Conclusion: We present a novel approach to effectively detect stimulation-induced noise in iEEG, offering a robust solution for improving data interpretation in scenarios with limited labeled data. Additionally, the pre-trained ResNet-18 model is available for the community to use, facilitating further research and application in similar datasets.

">Estimating descending activation patterns from EMG in fast and slow movements using a model of the stretch reflex</a></h4>

              
                Due to spinal reflex loops, descending activation from the brain is not the only source of muscle activation that ultimately generates movement. This study directly estimates descending activation patterns from measured patterns of muscle activation (EMG) during human arm movements. A simple model of the spinal stretch reflex is calibrated in a postural unloading task and then used to estimate descending activation patterns from muscle EMG patterns and kinematics during voluntary arm motion performed at different speeds. We observed three key features of the estimated descending activation patterns: (1) Within about the first 15% of movement duration, descending and muscle activations are temporally aligned. Thereafter, they diverge and develop qualitatively different temporal profiles. (2) The time course of descending activation is monotonic for slow movements, non-monotonic for fast movements. (3) Varying model parameters like the spinal reflex gain or the level of co-contraction does not qualitatively change the temporal pattern of estimated descending activation. Our findings highlight the substantial contribution of spinal reflex loops to movement generation, while at the same time providing evidence that the brain must generate qualitatively different descending activation patterns for movements that vary in their mechanical dynamics.

">History bias and its perturbation of the stimulus representation in the macaque prefrontal cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Multiple history biases affect our representation of magnitudes, such as time, distance, and size. It is not clear whether the previous stimuli interfere with the discrimination process from the moment of stimulus presentation, during working memory retention, or even later during the decision-making phase. We used a spatial discrimination task involving two stimuli of different magnitudes, presented sequentially at various distances from the center. The monkey's task was to select the farthest of them. We showed that the previous stimulus magnitude generated a contraction bias effect, but only when its stimulus features differed from those of the current stimulus. In this case, at the neural level we also observed that the decoding of the stimulus magnitude achieved the highest accuracy when it matched the magnitude of the preceding stimulus for which the decoder was trained. This indicates that past stimuli can affect magnitude processing already during the stimulus presentation, even before the decision process. Interestingly, this effect manifested when the trace of the previous stimulus magnitude reactivated in the second part of the stimulus presentation after an activity-silent period.

">STARTS: A self-adapted spatio-temporal framework for automatic E/MEG source imaging</a></h4>

              
                To obtain accurate brain source activities, the highly ill posed source imaging of electro and magneto encephalography (E/MEG) requires proficiency in incorporation of biophysiological constraints and signalprocessing techniques. Here, we propose a spatiotemporal-constrainted E/MEG source imaging framework-STARTS that can reconstruct the source in a fully automatic way. Specifically, a block diagonal covariance was adopted to reconstruct the source extents while maintain spatial homogeneity. Temporal basis functions (TBFs) of both sources and noises were estimated and updated in a data-driven fashion to alleviate the influence of noises and further improve source localization accuracy. The performance of the proposed STARTS was quantitatively assessed through a series of simulation experiments,wherein superior results were obtained in comparison with the benchmark ESI algorithms (including LORETA, EBIConvex,& SISTBF). Additional validations on epileptic and resting state EEG data further indicate that the STARTS can produce neurophysiologically plausible results. Moreover,a computationally efficient version of STARTS: smooth STARTS was also introduced with an elementary spatial constraint, which exhibited comparable performance and reduced execution cost. In sum, the proposed STARTS, with its advanced spatio-temporal constraints and self-adapted update operation, provides an effective and efficient approach for E/MEG source imaging.

">A Drosophila screen of schizophrenia-related genes highlights the requirement of neural and glial matrix metalloproteinases for neuronal remodeling</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a multifactorial neuropsychiatric disorder of complex and mostly unknown etiology, affected by genetic, developmental and environmental factors. Neuroanatomical abnormalities, such as loss of grey matter, are apparent prior to the onset of symptoms, suggesting neurodevelopmental origin. Indeed, it has been hypothesized, and recently experimentally supported, that SCZ is associated with dysregulation of developmental synaptic pruning. Here, we explore the molecular link between SCZ-associated genes and developmental neuronal remodeling, focusing on the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), which undergoes stereotypic remodeling during metamorphosis. We conducted a loss-of-function screen in which we knocked down Drosophila homologs of human genes that genomic studies have associated with SCZ. Out of our positive hits, we focused on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), mostly known for their role in remodeling of the extracellular matrix. We found that both Mmp1 and Mmp2, which are closely-related to mammalian MMPs, are required in neurons and in glia for the pruning of MB axons. Our combinatorial loss-of-function experiments suggest that Mmp2 secretion from glia is the most important promoter of axon pruning. Our results shed new light on potential molecular players underlying neurodevelopmental defects in SCZ and highlight the advantage of genetically tractable model organisms in the study of human neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Mapping grey and white matter activity in the human brain with isotropic ADC-fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Functional MRI (fMRI) using the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal provides valuable insight into grey matter activity. However, uncertainty surrounds the white matter BOLD signal. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) offers an alternative fMRI contrast sensitive to transient cellular deformations during neural activity, facilitating detection of both grey and white matter activity. Further, through minimising vascular contamination, ADC-fMRI has the potential to overcome the limited temporal specificity of the BOLD signal. However, the use of linear diffusion encoding introduces sensitivity to fibre directionality, while averaging over multiple directions comes at great cost to temporal resolution. In this study, we used spherical b-tensor encoding to impart diffusion sensitisation in all directions per shot, providing an ADC-fMRI contrast capable of detecting activity independently of fibre directionality. We provide evidence from two task-based experiments on a clinical scanner that isotropic ADC-fMRI is more temporally specific than BOLD-fMRI, and offers more balanced mapping of grey and white matter activity. We further demonstrate that isotropic ADC-fMRI detects white matter activity independently of fibre direction, while linear ADC-fMRI preferentially detects activity in voxels containing fibres perpendicular to the diffusion encoding direction. Thus, isotropic ADC-fMRI opens avenues for investigation into whole-brain grey and white matter functional connectivity.

">Attenuated ectopic action potential firing in parvalbumin expressing interneurons in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Dravet syndrome is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in SCN1A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1. Our recent work suggests that a primary pathogenic mechanism of Dravet syndrome is impaired action potential propagation along axons of cortical parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons (PVINs). Ectopic action potentials (EAPs) are action potentials that initiate distal to the axon initial segment. We recently demonstrated that a large proportion of PVINs fire EAPs during periods of increased excitation. Although their function remains unknown, EAPs may play a role in amplifying (when occurring in excitatory cells) and/or preventing seizures (when occurring in interneurons). Regardless of function, their generation in distal axons suggests that EAP frequency could be a useful proxy for distal axonal excitability. We hypothesized that EAPs are attenuated in PVINs from Dravet syndrome (Scn1a+/-) mice due to dysfunction of the distal axon. We induced EAPs in PVINs in acute brain slices prepared from male and female wildtype (WT) and Scn1a+/- mice at P18-21 and P35-56, when we have previously identified axonal conduction deficits in Scn1a+/- PVINs. We elicited EAPs in 17/22 (77%) of WT PVINs, including 6 (22%) that exhibited barrages of EAPs. In contrast, Scn1a+/- PVINs never fired barrages (0%), and only 8/23 (34%) exhibited even single EAPs. This finding adds to the body of evidence supporting impaired action potential propagation in Dravet syndrome PVINs, and is the first evidence of impaired EAP firing in a disease model, suggesting that dysregulation of EAPs could be involved in the pathophysiology of human disease.

">Spatiotemporal patterns of theta-band activity during rapid-eye movement sleep: a magnetoencephalography analysis</a></h4>

              
                Theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) in frontal cortical regions are present to different degrees across states of consciousness. In sleep, theta is prominent in periods of rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep. Theta has been linked to processes of memory consolidation; however, its mechanistic contribution specifically during REM sleep is not well understood. Interestingly, in the wake state, frontal theta activity increases during effortful cognitive tasks involving executive functions such as working memory, hinting at similarities in circuitry, and potentially, function. The aim of the present work is to create a spatially resolved, whole-brain characterisation of REM oscillatory activity in healthy human subjects, distinguishing theta from neighbouring frequency bands, differentiating substages of REM sleep (phasic and tonic REM), and comparing REM theta to that which is evoked during a working memory task. To that end, we analysed magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) data recorded during overnight sleep in 10 healthy subjects, and similar data from 17 healthy subjects who performed a working memory task, using a novel whole-brain, source-localised MEG approach. Our results show that (i) theta activity has a frontal midline topography that is distinct from those of other prominent frequency bands in REM (delta, alpha, beta), (ii) theta activity in frontal midline regions is best observed within a focused 5-7 Hz range, separating it from occipital alpha activity, (iii) REM theta is dominant over the frontal midline but is also observed in several sub-cortical areas, (iv) theta is more widespread in tonic than phasic REM sleep, and (v) the focused frontal midline theta pattern observed in REM phasic sleep is the most similar of all observed sleep substages to theta evoked by a working memory task. These results enhance our understanding of theta physiology in REM sleep and suggest future targets for research into REM's role in learning and memory.

">Generalizable gesture recognition usingmagnetomyography</a></h4>

              
                The progression of human-computer interfaces into immersive and touchless realities requires new ways of interacting with machines that are correspondingly intuitive and seamless. Among these are gesture-based systems that use natural hand movements to interact with and control digital devices. Today, these systems are most commonly implemented through the use of cameras or inertial sensors, which have drawbacks in environments that are poorly lit, in conditions where the hands are obscured, or for applications that require fine motor control. More recent studies have advocated for the use of surface electromyography (sEMG) to capture gesture information by sensing electrical activity generated by muscle contraction. While promising demonstrations have been shown, studies have also outlined limitations in sEMG when it comes to generalization across a population, largely due to physiological differences between individuals. Magnetomyography (MMG) is an alternative modality for measuring the same motor signals at the muscle, but is impervious to distortions caused by tissue, hair, and moisture; this indicates potential for lower variability caused by physiological differences and changes in skin conductivity, making MMG a promising generalizable solution for gesture control. To test this theory, we developed wristbands with magnetic sensors and implemented a signal processing pipeline for gesture classification. Using this system, we measured MMG across 30 participants performing a gesture task consisting of nine discrete gestures. We demonstrate average single-participant classification accuracy of 95.4%, rivaling state-of-the-art accuracy with sEMG. In addition, we achieved higher cross-session and cross-participant accuracy compared to sEMG studies. Given that these results were obtained with a non-ideal recording system, we anticipate significantly better results with better sensors. Together, these findings suggest that MMG can provide higher performance for control systems based on gesture recognition by overcoming limitations of existing techniques.

">Computational Modeling of Proactive, Reactive, and Attentional Dynamics in Cognitive Control</a></h4>

              
                We developed a novel Proactive Reactive and Attentional Dynamics (PRAD) computational model designed to dissect the latent mechanisms of inhibitory control in human cognition. Leveraging data from over 7,500 participants in the NIH Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, we demonstrate that PRAD surpasses traditional models by integrating proactive, reactive, and attentional components of inhibitory control. Employing a hierarchical Bayesian framework, PRAD offers a granular view of the dynamics underpinning action execution and inhibition, provides debiased estimates of stop-signal reaction times, and elucidates individual and temporal variability in cognitive control processes. Our findings reveal significant intra-individual variability, challenging conventional assumptions of random variability across trials. By addressing nonergodicity and systematically accounting for the multi-componential nature of cognitive control, PRAD advances our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms driving individual differences in cognitive control and provides a sophisticated computational framework for dissecting dynamic cognitive processes across diverse populations.

">Age-related increases in PDE11A4 protein expression trigger liquid:liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the enzyme that can be reversed by PDE11A4 small molecules inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                PDE11A is a little-studied phosphodiesterase sub-family that breaks down cAMP/cGMP, with the PDE11A4 isoform being enriched in the memory-related brain region called the hippocampus. Age-related increases in PDE11A expression occur in human and rodent hippocampus and cause age-related cognitive decline of social memories. Interestingly, the age-related increase in PDE11A4 protein ectopically accumulates in spherical clusters that group together in the brain to form linear filamentous patterns termed ghost axons. The biophysical/physiochemical mechanisms underlying this age-related clustering of PDE11A4 are not yet known. As such, we determine here if age-related clustering of PDE11A4 may reflect liquid:liquid phase separation (LLPS), and if PDE11A inhibitors being developed for age-related cognitive decline can reverse this biomolecular condensation. We found that human and mouse PDE11A4 exhibit several LLPS-promoting sequence features including intrinsically disordered regions, non-covalent pi-pi interactions, and prion-like domains, with multiple bioinformatic tools predicting PDE11A4 undergoes LLPS. Consistent with these predictions, age-related PDE11A4 clusters were non-membrane bound spherical droplets that progressively fuse over time in a concentration-dependent manner. 5 different PDE11 inhibitors (tadalafil, BC11-38, SMQ-02-57, SMQ-03-30 and SMQ-03-20) across 3 scaffolds reversed PDE11A4 LLPS (a.k.a. remixing) in hippocampal HT22 cells, with PDE11A4 droplets reforming (a.k.a. de-mixing) following a 5-hour washout of low but not high concentrations of these compounds. Strikingly, a single oral administration of 30 mg/kg SMQ-03-20 substantially reduced the presence of PDE11A4 ghost axon in the aged mouse brain. Thus, PDE11A4 exhibits 4 defining criteria of LLPS, and PDE11A small molecule inhibitors reverse this age-related phenotype both in vitro and in vivo.

">Posterior Parietal Cortex Regulates Intrinsic Neural Timescales and Attentional Processing in Frontal Eye Field</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic neural timescales characterize the dynamics of endogenous fluctuations in neural activity. We measured the intrinsic timescales of frontal eye field (FEF) neurons and examined changes during posterior parietal cortex (PPC) inactivation. FEF neurons exhibit a bimodal distribution of intrinsic timescales, with shorter timescale neurons processing rapid visual information and longer timescale neurons more involved in sustained attentional modulation. PPC inactivation significantly increased intrinsic timescales in both neuron types, with a 15-fold greater increase in shorter timescale neurons. Additionally, PPC inactivation reduced visual and attentional responses, with a stronger effect on attention in longer timescale neurons. This disruption eliminated the correlation between timescales and attentional responses observed in the control condition. Our results provide the first causal evidence that FEF intrinsic timescales depend on long-range projections from PPC, suggesting the presence of at least two network motifs with different timescales that contribute to neuronal dynamics and functional computations within FEF.

">Heartbeat related activity in the anterior thalamus differs between phasic and tonic REM sleep periods</a></h4>

              
                Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a fundamental sleep state associated with diverse functions from elemental physiological processes to higher order neurocognitive functions. A growing body of research indicates that REM sleep with eye movements (phasic REM) differs from REM periods without ocular activity (tonic) in terms of spontaneous and evoked neural responses. Studies using auditory stimulation consistently observed enhanced evoked responses in tonic versus phasic REM, indicating that the external processing is largely diminished when the eyes move during REM sleep. Whereas exteroceptive processing during sleep is widely studies, investigation on interoception (the processing of bodily signals) during sleep is scarce, and limited to scalp electroencephalographic recordings. Here we studied interoceptive processing in a group of epileptic patients (N = 11) by measuring their heartbeat-related neural activity in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) during phasic and tonic REM sleep and resting wakefulness. Evoked potentials and beta-low gamma spectral power locked to the heartbeat were significantly different in phasic REM compared to tonic REM and wakefulness. Heartbeat-related neural signals exhibited pronounced inter-trial phase synchronization at lower (7-20 Hz) oscillatory activity in all vigilance states, but reduced gamma synchronization at later time points in phasic REM only. Tonic REM and wakefulness did not show significant differences in heartbeat-related activity in the ANT. Our findings indicate that heartbeat-related neural activity is detectable at the level of the ANT, showing distinct signatures of interoceptive processing in phasic REM compared to tonic REM and wakefulness.

">Neuronal loss of Galnt2 Impairs O-glycosylation and Leads to Neurobehavioral Deficits Mimicking GALNT2-CDG</a></h4>

              
                GALNT2-CDG is a multi-system genetic disorder due to biallelic pathogenic mutations in GALNT2, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed Golgi-localized glycosyltransferase that initiates mucin-type O-glycosylation. Affected individuals exhibit dysmorphic facial features, short stature, decreased HDL-C, and notable impairments in brain function. GALNT2-CDG patients show global developmental delay without speech development, childhood epilepsy, autistic-like features, and white-matter brain abnormalities. The extent of O-glycosylation in brain development and function remains poorly understood. To address this question, we selectively ablated Galnt2 from pan-neuronal cells in the brain and found that conditional knockout mice exhibit deficits across numerous behavioral domains, including locomotion, motor coordination, sociability, learning, and memory, as well as experience spontaneous seizures, recapitulating characteristic neurological manifestations of GALNT2-CDG. Given the catalytic activity of GALNT2 to initiate mucin-type O-glycosylation, we used glycoproteomics to identify disrupted O-glycosylation in synaptosomes purified from cortical tissues. We ascertained a non-redundant, isoform-specific contribution of GALNT2 to the cortical synaptosomal O-glycoproteome, identifying candidate glycoproteins and disrupted O-glycosites that accompany behavioral abnormalities in knockout mice. These findings demonstrate functional impact of O-glycosylation in neurons, implicating roles of O-glycosylation in diverse molecular and cellular pathways related to neuronal function and provide new opportunities to gain insights into the neurological pathophysiology of GALNT2-CDG.

">Loss of SARM1 protects against retinal ganglion cell degeneration in Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (ADOA), the most prevalent inherited optic neuropathy, leads to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration and vision loss. ADOA is primarily caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene, which encodes a conserved GTPase important for mitochondrial inner membrane dynamics. To date, the disease mechanism remains unclear, and no therapies are available. Here, we present a novel mouse model carrying the pathogenic Opa1R290Q/+ allele that recapitulates key features of human ADOA, including mitochondrial defects, age-related RGC loss, optic nerve degeneration, and reduced RGC functions. We identify SARM1, a neurodegeneration switch, as a key driver of RGC degeneration in these mice. Sarm1 knockout nearly completely suppresses all the degeneration phenotypes. Additionally, we show that SARM1 is located within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). These findings indicate that SARM1 is activated downstream of mitochondrial dysfunction in ADOA, highlighting it as a promising therapeutic target.

                Microglia, the brain immune cells, are highly responsive to their local environment. Given that circulatory proteins can enter the brain, we asked whether microglia are responsive to such proteins. Here, we identify a stable population of microglia specialized to take up circulatory proteins in a region-specific manner under physiological conditions; human hematopoietic stem cell-derived microglia replacing endogenous microglia in chimeric mice show similar regional specialization. Plasma-positive microglia are characterized by prominent expression of genes related to innate immunity and antigen presentation and exhibit high metabolic and phagocytic activity. This activity is dependent, in part, on microglial uptake and accumulation of circulatory Apolipoprotein AI (ApoA-I). Our findings thus identify a new model of communication between brain and periphery through specialized microglia.

">Autophagic enhancer rescues Tau accumulation in a stem cell model of frontotemporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                Tau degradation is disrupted in neurodegenerative tauopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which may contribute to Tau aggregation. The prevailing hypothesis has been that Tau degradation is stymied due to an imbalance in proteostasis that occurs with age. Here, we used Airyscan super resolution imaging to illustrate that a pathogenic FTD mutation in the MAPT gene, which encodes Tau, is sufficient to alter multiple steps of the autophagy lysosomal pathway and impair Tau degradation. We discovered lysosomes clogged with both Tau and phosphorylated Tau, stalled lysosome motility, disrupted molecular motors, enhanced autophagic flux, and slowed cargo degradation in mutant Tau neurons. Treatment of mutant Tau neurons with a small molecule autophagy enhancer drug increases autophagic flux and cargo degradation, reduces phospho-Tau levels, and reduces Tau accumulation in lysosomes without restoring defects in lysosomal motility. This study reveals novel effects of mutant Tau and provides a window through which therapeutic treatments targeting autophagy may promote Tau homeostasis.

">Age dependency of neurometabolite T1 relaxation times</a></h4>

              
                Purpose To measure T1 relaxation times of metabolites at 3T in a healthy aging population and investigate age dependence. Methods A cohort of 101 healthy adults were recruited with approximately 10 male and 10 female participants in each decade band: 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60+ years old. Inversion-recovery PRESS data (TE/TR: 30/2000 ms) were acquired at 8 inversion times (TIs) (300, 400, 511, 637, 780, 947, 1148 and 1400 ms) from voxels in white-matter-rich centrum semiovale (CSO) and gray-matter-rich posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Modeling of TI-series spectra was performed in Osprey 2.5.0. Quantified metabolite amplitudes for total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA2.0), total creatine at 3.0 ppm (tCr3.0) and 3.9 ppm (tCr3.9), total choline (tCho), myo-inositol (mI), and the sum of glutamine and glutamate (Glx) were modeled to calculate T1 relaxation times of metabolites. Results T1 relaxation times of tNAA2.0 in CSO and tNAA2.0, tCr3.0, mI and Glx in PCC decreased with age. These correlations remained significant when controlling for cortical atrophy. T1 relaxation times were significantly different between PCC and CSO for all metabolites except tCr3.0. We also propose linear models for predicting metabolite T1s at 3T to be used in future aging studies. Conclusion Metabolite T1 relaxation times change significantly with age, an effect that will be important to consider for accurate quantitative MRS, particularly in studies of aging.

">Remote activation of place codes by gaze in a highly visual animal</a></h4>

              
                Vision enables many animals to perform spatial reasoning from remote locations. By viewing distant landmarks, animals recall spatial memories and plan future trajectories. Although these spatial functions depend on hippocampal place cells, the relationship between place cells and active visual behavior is unknown. Here, we studied a highly visual animal, the chickadee, in a behavior that required alternating between remote visual search and spatial navigation. We leveraged the unique head-directed nature of avian vision to track gaze in freely moving animals. We discovered a profound link between place coding and gaze. Place cells activated not only when the chickadee was in a specific location, but also when it simply gazed at that location from a distance. Gaze coding was precisely timed by fast, ballistic head movements called "head saccades". On each saccadic cycle, the hippocampus switched between encoding a prediction of what the bird was about to see and a reaction to what it actually saw. The temporal structure of these responses was coordinated by subclasses of interneurons that fired at different phases of the saccade. We suggest that place and gaze coding are components of a unified process by which the hippocampus represents the location that an animal is currently attending to. This process allows the hippocampus to implement both local and remote spatial functions.

">Reduced Synaptic Heterogeneity in a Tetanus ToxinModel of Epilepsy: Insights from ComputationalModeling</a></h4>

              
                A neural mass model was used to assess connectivity strength across diverse populations by fitting the model to background EEG data obtained from a Tetanus Toxin rat model of epilepsy. Our findings reveal a notable decline in the variability of estimated parameters when using EEG data recorded from rats in the Tetanus Toxin group compared with the control group. A detailed comparison of standard deviations in estimated parameters between day 1 and day 20 recordings, coinciding with a heightened number of seizures, underscores the impact of Tetanus Toxin on diminishing synaptic strength variability across recordings. This study supports electrophysiological studies suggesting that epileptogenesis induces a reduction in biophysical heterogeneity, potentially leading to an increase in network synchrony associated with epilepsy. Furthermore, our computational model establishes a foundation for future explorations of the implications of this diminished variability.

">Experience shapes the transformation of olfactory representations along the cortico-hippocampal pathway</a></h4>

              
                Perception relies on the neural representation of sensory stimuli. Primary sensory cortical representations have been extensively studied, but how sensory information propagates to memory-related multisensory areas has not been well described. We studied this question in the olfactory cortico-hippocampal pathway in mice. We recorded single units in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the anterior piriform cortex (aPCx), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), the hippocampal CA1 subfield, and the subiculum (SUB) while animals performed a non-associative learning paradigm involving novel and familiar stimuli. Novel stimuli evoked larger responses than familiar stimuli in the AON, whereas in hippocampal areas, novelty was reflected by the number of responsive neurons. In parallel, odorant selectivity increased along the pathway. While both stimulus identity and experience were thus reflected in all regions, their neural representations gradually separated. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for how sensory representations are transformed to support stimulus identification and implicit memories.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Degenerative cerebellar ataxias (DCA) present a group of complex neurological disorders primarily affecting the cerebellum and its pathways. Classic manifestations include motor symptoms of cerebellar ataxia. However, emerging evidence suggests that the cerebellum also plays a crucial role in various cognitive and emotional processes. The objective was to assess the psychiatric profile of a heterogeneous group of patients with degenerative cerebellar ataxia. Methods: Our sample comprised 107 participants diagnosed with cerebellar degenerative ataxia. All patients were clinically evaluated using SARA, INAS, and different neuropsychiatric scales (ACE-R, HAMA, HAMD, AS, and GAF). Results: The majority of patients had autosomal dominant ataxia (38.3%) followed by sporadic ataxia (32.7%) with an average age at the moment of diagnosis of 35.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.23 years, while the mean duration of disease at the study beginning was 12.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 9.9 years. Psychiatric disorders were present in 40 patients (37.4%), with dysthymia (14.2%), major depressive disorder (9.4%), and MDD with melancholic features (7.6%). The presence of MDD with melancholic features was statistically significantly correlated with a lower ACE-R total score (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.223; p = 0.022), while dysthymia was statistically significantly associated with a shorter duration of the disease (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.226; p = 0.020) and older age (r = 0.197; p = 0.043). Statistically significant differences were observed between MSA-C patients and those with sporadic ataxia (HDRS p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, HARS p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, Apathy Scale p = 0.003, and GAF p = 0.004). Conclusions: Based on our findings, we can conclude that the degree of motor deficit has a significant impact on the development of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and apathy. However, it is not the only factor, and the impact also depends on the type of DCA.</p>

	<p>Background: Immersive virtual reality has the potential to motivate and challenge patients who need and want to relearn movements in the process of neurorehabilitation. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and user acceptance of an innovative immersive virtual reality system (head-mounted display) used in combination with robot-assisted gait training in subjects suffering from neurological diseases. Methods: Fifteen participants suffering from cerebrovascular accident or spinal cord injury completed a single session of immersive virtual reality using a head-mounted display during a Lokomat&amp;amp;reg; gait session. Training parameters and safety indicators were collected, and acceptance was investigated among participants and therapists. Results: The results suggest that an immersive virtual reality system is feasible in terms of safety and tolerance. Furthermore, the very positive overall acceptance of the system suggests that it has the potential to be included in a robot-assisted gait training session using Lokomat&amp;amp;reg;. Conclusion: Overall, this study demonstrates that a fully immersive virtual reality system based on a head-mounted display is both feasible and well received by cerebrovascular accident and spinal cord injury patients and their therapists during robot-assisted gait training. This study suggests that such a virtual reality system could be a viable alternative to the screen-based training games currently used in neurorehabilitation. It may be especially suitable for enhancing patient motivation and adherence to training, particularly if the application is enjoyable and not mentally taxing.</p>

                Background: Technology serves as a potent tool that enhances the quality of teaching and learning experiences. However, when educators lack proficiency in utilizing technology, it leads to obstacles in providing effective education, resulting in emotions of frustration, diminished self-assurance, and uncertainty regarding their teaching abilities. This study aims to investigate the experiences of university faculty members in relation to the impact of technology on their mental well-being. Methods: For this qualitative study, ten professionals engaged in university-level teaching, encompassing research domains, were selected for interviews. Inclusion criteria were based on teaching experience, tenure, specific courses or subjects taught, and active involvement during the research phase. The guiding question for the study was framed as follows: "What are the experiences and perceptions of university faculty members concerning techno-stress?" Additionally, the study identified four subcategories: work overload, social and emotional interaction, adaption to new technologies, and expectations and teaching quality. Results: Techno-stress is a composite of emotional and physical reactions triggered by the improper use of technology. Faculty members’ encounters with techno-stress have substantial implications for their quality of life. The subcategories shed light on different aspects of the faculty’s experiences, including the burden of excessive workload, the influence of social and emotional interactions, the process of adapting to evolving technologies, and the connection between expectations and the quality of their teaching. Conclusions: This research underscores the significance of technology in higher education, highlighting its potential to positively impact teaching and learning. Nevertheless, faculty members’ struggles with techno-stress indicate a pressing need for effective training and support. Establishing limits on connectivity with technology and others emerges as a crucial step in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Ultimately, addressing techno-stress and providing appropriate guidance are essential for safeguarding the well-being of university faculty members and, consequently, enhancing the overall educational experience.

                <p>This study aims to explore the correlation of serum thyroid hormone levels to cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. In this retrospective study, 106 Chinese patients without cognitive impairments and 94 patients with cognitive impairments, including 55 with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 39 with PD dementia (PDD), were analyzed. Clinical data regarding the PD assessments, including disease duration, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 3 scores, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&ndash;Y) staging, were analyzed. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score. Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3), were measured using ELISA. Significantly altered H&ndash;Y staging, disease duration, and UPDRS Part 3 scores were observed in PD patients with cognitive impairment compared with those without. Serum levels of FT3 were significantly decreased, while FT4 and TSH levels were significantly elevated in PD patients with cognitive impairment compared with those without. Combined detection of TSH, FT3, and FT4 showed value in distinguishing PD patients with and without cognitive impairment. Furthermore, a comparison of serum levels between PD-MCI and PDD patients revealed significant association between thyroid hormone levels and the degree of cognitive impairment in PD patients. Our findings suggest a relationship between changes in serum thyroid hormone levels and cognitive impairments in PD patients. Thyroid hormone levels, particularly FT3, may serve as potential markers for cognitive dysfunction in PD.</p>

                Global suicide rates owing to disaster impacts have been confusing because of varied and unclear results. This study aimed to investigate how suicides have occurred worldwide during disasters. The methodology used included a systematic literature review and comparative analysis. The disaster exacerbation (X, bad human nature, or suicide rate rise) perspective was compared with the disaster resilience (Y, good human nature, or suicide rate fall) perspective to extract disaster ecology (Z, neutral human nature, or suicide rate fluctuation) perspective from international leaders, government officials, researchers, and disaster victims. A major theme was that the four stakeholders would adopt the Z perspective based on the fusion of X and Y perspectives (leading to X+Y=Z), while embracing heterogeneous research, proactive and long-term strategies, education, and so on. This study relied heavily on the large-scale dynamics of suicide rates than previous studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1111/v1?src=rss">The efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of influenza A infection: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The WHO recommendation against the use of macrolides reflects the little low-quality evidence about the effect of azithromycin (AZ) on influenza A infection. Considering recent reports about AZ use despite the WHO’s unfavorable recommendations, we aimed to test the evidence for the usage of AZ in the treatment of influenza A infection. Methods Various online databases were searched till August 2023 and thorough text and evidence evaluation resulted in selecting 7 studies. Results The selected reports included randomized control trials (two), cohort (three), case/control (one) studies, and one case report. Pooling of the results was unattainable due to the variability among studies in patient criteria, study outcomes, and study designs. Based on the limited reports with insufficient evidence, a recommendation for the use of AZ in the treatment regimen was not possible despite the associated reduction in inflammatory cytokines by AZ administration and the absence of significant adverse effects or mortality in hospital-admitted or ICU patients. While these findings support the current guidelines for the treatment of influenza A infection, the evidence behind these guidelines and treatment characteristics were illustrated. Conclusion AZ shows a potential symptom improvement and pro-inflammatory laboratory indices in influenza A patients. Another positive aspect is the absence of complications associated with AZ administration to critically ill patients and acceptable prognosis. However, it is crucial to have more quality research on this matter that focuses on the indication of the use of AZ, and the timing of initiation, dosage, and duration of treatment while monitoring adverse events.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-974/v4?src=rss">Predictors of mortality for blunt trauma patients in intensive care: A retrospective cohort study [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Major trauma places substantial demand on critical care services, is a leading cause of death in under 40-year-olds and causes significant morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Various factors influence patient outcome and predefining these could allow prognostication. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from major trauma in intensive care. Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult trauma patients admitted to general intensive care between January 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the impact on mortality of patient demographics, patterns of injury, injury scores (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Probability of Survival Score (Ps19)), number of surgeries and mechanism of injury using logistic regression. Results: A total of 414 patients were included with a median age of 54 years (IQR 34–72). Overall mortality was 18.6%. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic collision (46%). Non-survivors were older, had higher ISS scores with lower GCS on admission and probability of survival scores. Factors independently predictive of mortality were increasing age (OR 1.06, p <0.001) and GCS <15 on admission (OR 7.21, p <0.001). Ps19 was the best predictor of mortality (p <0.001 for each score category), with an AUROC of 0.90. Conclusions: The significant mortality predictors were age, fall from <2 metres, injury of head or limbs, GCS <15 and Ps19. Contrary to previous studies CCI and APACHE II did not significantly predict mortality. Although Ps19 was found to be the best current prognostic score, trauma prognostication would benefit from a single validated scoring system incorporating both physiological variables and injury patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1110/v1?src=rss">Hierarchical Genomic Analysis of Susceptibility to Schizophrenia in Sudanese multi-case families [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Schizophrenia, with its diverse and complex presentation, is a prime candidate for genetic investigation. Its heritability in both familial and sporadic cases, clinical overlap with other psychiatric conditions, and individual variations in response to treatment contribute to its complexity. Numerous genes and associated biochemical pathways show significant differences at the population, familial, and individual levels. Additionally, schizophrenia may represent an evolutionary trade-off for human brain development, creativity, and intellectual performance. Material and Methods This case pseudo-control study analyzed the whole genomes/exomes of seven Sudanese families with multiple siblings affected by schizophrenia. We examined shared variants among family members, including both cases and controls, and unique variants shared between patients but not controls. These variants were filtered based on their impact on protein function, expression levels, allele frequencies, ACMG classification for rare variants, and disease associations. Networks were created to identify central genes and common biological pathways. Results and Discussion The examination of this complex disorder in Sudanese families revealed numerous variants, both common and rare, showing differences between families and between our population and those reported in the literature. This highlights the challenge of accounting for the known heritability of the disease. Our hierarchical approach demonstrates that schizophrenia’s etiology involves the cumulative effect of various interacting variants in an ascending order of influence. Common variants are shared among all samples, while rare variants are shared among two or three families, most of which are associated with schizophrenia. In conclusion The significance lies not merely in the number of detected variants but in understanding their interactive roles, step by step, to reveal the complete picture of the disease’s phenotype.

B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is required for the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas. While proximal BCR signaling is well studied, little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways, and a comprehensive quantitative network analysis of BCR signaling is missing. Here, we semi-quantitatively modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. Compared to the starting network, the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells. Moreover, the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling (HBL-1, OCI-LY3), indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring.

                <p>by Elin K. Falla, Nik J. Cunniffe</p>

Plant viruses threaten food security and are often transmitted by insect vectors. Non-persistently transmitted (NPT) plant viruses are transmitted almost exclusively by aphids. Because virions attach to the aphid’s stylet (mouthparts) and are acquired and inoculated via brief epidermal probes, the aphid–virus interaction is highly transient, with a very short aphid virus retention time. Many NPT viruses manipulate their host plant’s phenotype to change aphid behaviour to optimise virus transmission. Epidemiological models of this have overlooked a key feature of aphid NPT virus retention: probing or feeding on a plant causes aphids to lose the virus. Furthermore, experimental studies suggest aphids could possibly inoculate multiple healthy plants within one infective period if they do not feed. Consequences of this for virus manipulation of host plant phenotype have not been explored. Our new compartmental epidemiological model includes both behaviour-based aphid dispersal and infectivity loss rates, and the ability of infective aphids to probe multiple plants before virus loss. We use our model to explore how NPT virus-induced host phenotypes affect epidemic outcomes, comparing these results to representative previous models. We find that previous models behave fundamentally differently and underestimate the benefit of an ‘attract-and-deter’ phenotype, where the virus induces increased aphid attraction to infected plants but deters them from prolonged feeding. Our results also highlight the importance of characterising NPT virus retention upon the aphid during probing. Allowing for multiple infective probes increases disease incidence and the effectiveness of virus manipulation, with implications for epidemic prediction and control.

                <p>by Safiye Celik, Jan-Christian Hütter, Sandra Melo Carlos, Nathan H. Lazar, Rahul Mohan, Conor Tillinghast, Tommaso Biancalani, Marta M. Fay, Berton A. Earnshaw, Imran S. Haque</p>

The continued scaling of genetic perturbation technologies combined with high-dimensional assays such as cellular microscopy and RNA-sequencing has enabled genome-scale reverse-genetics experiments that go beyond single-endpoint measurements of growth or lethality. Datasets emerging from these experiments can be combined to construct perturbative “maps of biology”, in which readouts from various manipulations (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 knockout, CRISPRi knockdown, compound treatment) are placed in unified, relatable embedding spaces allowing for the generation of genome-scale sets of pairwise comparisons. These maps of biology capture known biological relationships and uncover new associations which can be used for downstream discovery tasks. Construction of these maps involves many technical choices in both experimental and computational protocols, motivating the design of benchmark procedures to evaluate map quality in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here, we (1) establish a standardized terminology for the steps involved in perturbative map building, (2) introduce key classes of benchmarks to assess the quality of such maps, (3) construct 18 maps from four genome-scale datasets employing different cell types, perturbation technologies, and data readout modalities, (4) generate benchmark metrics for the constructed maps and investigate the reasons for performance variations, and (5) demonstrate utility of these maps to discover new biology by suggesting roles for two largely uncharacterized genes.

                <p>by Marie-Cécile Dupas, Francesco Pinotti, Chaitanya Joshi, Madhvi Joshi, Weerapong Thanapongtharm, Madhur Dhingra, Damer Blake, Fiona Tomley, Marius Gilbert, Guillaume Fournié</p>

The distribution of farm locations and sizes is paramount to characterize patterns of disease spread. With some regions undergoing rapid intensification of livestock production, resulting in increased clustering of farms in peri-urban areas, measuring changes in the spatial distribution of farms is crucial to design effective interventions. However, those data are not available in many countries, their generation being resource-intensive. Here, we develop a farm distribution model (FDM), which allows the prediction of locations and sizes of poultry farms in countries with scarce data. The model combines (i) a Log-Gaussian Cox process model to simulate the farm distribution as a spatial Poisson point process, and (ii) a random forest model to simulate farm sizes (i.e. the number of animals per farm). Spatial predictors were used to calibrate the FDM on intensive broiler and layer farm distributions in Bangladesh, Gujarat (Indian state) and Thailand. The FDM yielded realistic farm distributions in terms of spatial clustering, farm locations and sizes, while providing insights on the factors influencing these distributions. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of modelling realistic farm distributions in the context of epidemic spread by simulating pathogen transmission on an array of spatial distributions of farms. We found that farm distributions generated from the FDM yielded spreading patterns consistent with simulations using observed data, while random point patterns underestimated the probability of large outbreaks. Indeed, spatial clustering increases vulnerability to epidemics, highlighting the need to account for it in epidemiological modelling studies. As the FDM maintains a realistic distribution of farm location and sizes, its use to inform mathematical models of disease transmission is particularly relevant for regions where these data are not available.

                <p>by Vanessa Kay Miller, Kendal Broadie</p>

The optimization of brain circuit connectivity based on initial environmental input occurs during critical periods characterized by sensory experience-dependent, temporally restricted, and transiently reversible synapse elimination. This precise, targeted synaptic pruning mechanism is mediated by glial phagocytosis. Serotonin signaling has prominent, foundational roles in the brain, but functions in glia, or in experience-dependent brain circuit synaptic connectivity remodeling, have been relatively unknown. Here, we discover that serotonergic signaling between glia is essential for olfactory experience-dependent synaptic glomerulus pruning restricted to a well-defined <i>Drosophila</i> critical period. We find that experience-dependent serotonin signaling is restricted to the critical period, with both (1) serotonin production and (2) 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors specifically in glia, but not neurons, absolutely required for targeted synaptic glomerulus pruning. We discover that glial 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor signaling limits the experience-dependent synaptic connectivity pruning in the critical period and that conditional reexpression of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors within adult glia reestablishes “critical period-like” experience-dependent synaptic glomerulus pruning at maturity. These results reveal an essential requirement for glial serotonergic signaling mediated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors for experience-dependent synapse elimination.

                <p>by Eloïse C. Déaux, Théophane Piette, Florence Gaunet, Thierry Legou, Luc Arnal, Anne-Lise Giraud</p>

Within species, vocal and auditory systems presumably coevolved to converge on a critical temporal acoustic structure that can be best produced and perceived. While dogs cannot produce articulated sounds, they respond to speech, raising the question as to whether this heterospecific receptive ability could be shaped by exposure to speech or remains bounded by their own sensorimotor capacity. Using acoustic analyses of dog vocalisations, we show that their main production rhythm is slower than the dominant (syllabic) speech rate, and that human–dog-directed speech falls halfway in between. Comparative exploration of neural (electroencephalography) and behavioural responses to speech reveals that comprehension in dogs relies on a slower speech rhythm tracking (delta) than humans’ (theta), even though dogs are equally sensitive to speech content and prosody. Thus, the dog audio-motor tuning differs from humans’, and we hypothesise that humans may adjust their speech rate to this shared temporal channel as means to improve communication efficacy.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study aims to compare the efficacy of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) on anxiety and depression between long-term and short-term treatment followed by withdrawal in <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose (Dgal)–induced senescent male rats. Thirty-two, 8-week-old, male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control rats and Dgal-treated rats (150 mg/kg/day; subcutaneously) for 18 weeks. At week 13, Dgal-treated rats were subdivided into three subgroups: (1) vehicle (DgV), (2) long-term treatment with 5ARIs, Finasteride 5 mg/kg/day, per oral for 6 weeks (DgF), (3) short-term treatment with 5ARIs, Finasteride 5 mg/kg/day, per oral for 2 weeks followed by a 4-week withdrawal period (DgW). Anxiety and depression were assessed using the elevated-plus maze (EPM) and splash test (ST). Blood was collected for biochemical analysis. After euthanasia, the brains were removed to examine brain inflammation, oxidative stress, neuroactive steroids, brain metabolites, and brain senescent markers. We found that DgV rats exhibited metabolic disturbance with a reduced preference index of the EPM, and grooming duration in ST. Increased brain neurotoxic metabolites, along with increased brain inflammation/oxidative stress, and reduced microglia complexity were observed in the DgV rats. Both therapeutic approaches improved metabolic parameters and preference index in the open arm of EPM in Dgal-treated rats, while grooming duration and microglia complexity were increased only in DgF rats. Our results indicate that Fin reduces depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors by reducing brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and brain senescent. In conclusion, long-term treatment with 5ARIs is more effective in alleviating depression than short-term treatment followed by withdrawal in Dgal-induced early senescent male rats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27078?af=R">Pro‐Ictal EEG Scheduling Improves the Yield of Epilepsy Monitoring: Validating the Use of Multiday Seizure Cycles to Optimize Video‐EEG Timing</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A significant challenge of video-electroencephalography (vEEG) in epilepsy diagnosis is timing monitoring sessions to capture epileptiform activity. In this study, we introduce and validate “pro-ictal EEG scheduling”, a method to schedule vEEG monitoring to coincide with periods of increased seizure likelihood as a low-risk approach to enhance the diagnostic yield.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A database of long-term ambulatory vEEG monitoring sessions (n = 5,038) of adults and children was examined. Data from linked electronic seizure diaries were extracted (minimum 10 self-reported events) to generate cycle-based estimates of seizure risk. In adults, vEEG monitoring sessions coinciding with periods of estimated high-risk were allocated to the high-risk group (n = 305) and compared to remaining studies (baseline: n = 3,586). Test of proportions and risk-ratios (RR) were applied to index differences in proportions and likelihood of capturing outcome measures (abnormal report, confirmed seizure, and diary event) during monitoring. The impact of clinical and demographic factors (age, sex, epilepsy-type, and medication) was also explored.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During vEEG monitoring, the high-risk group was significantly more likely to have an abnormal vEEG report (190/305:62% vs 1,790/3,586:50% [%change = 12%], RR = 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.137–1.370], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), present with a confirmed seizure (56/305:18% vs 424/3,586:11% [%change = 7%], RR = 1.63, 95% CI = [1.265–2.101], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and report an event (153/305:50% vs 1,267/3,586:35% (%change = 15%), RR = 1.420, 95% CI = [1.259:1.602], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Similar effects were observed across clinical and demographic features.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides the first large-scale validation of pro-ictal EEG scheduling in improving the yield of vEEG. This innovative approach offers a pragmatic and low-risk strategy to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of vEEG monitoring, significantly impacting epilepsy management.

                Background Postoperative complications are an integral part of valve surgery. Common complications include hematomas, bleeding, valve dehiscence, paravalvular leak, and acute PV thrombosis. With the available data from published articles, the rate of all valve-related complications is 0.7 to 3.5% per patient annually. [1] The pathology involved is multifactorial, often blood vessel injury leading to bleeding and hematoma. Although postoperative complications are evident, incidental diagnosis of a cardiac mass in an asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable patient postoperatively is crucial, requiring non-invasive imaging for immediate surgical action. Case presentation A woman in her 50s presented with chief complaints of worsening dyspnoea with suddenonset and chest pain. Clinical findings showed apex shifted downward and outward, wide split S2, and a mid systolic murmur radiating to the mid axillary line. Twelve-lead ECG showed LA enlargement, that aligned with X-ray findings. 2D Echocardiography revealed MVP with severe MR and a dilated LV. The patient underwent successful mitral valve replacement as per ACC/AHA class I recommendation. However, postoperative TTE showed a remarkably large mass measuring 5.6 cm*4.6 cm in the RA. Reexploration was performed, followed by mass excision. Plenty of organized clots were seen compressing the RA. TEE showed no evidence of mass. Following stabilization,the patient was discharged considering optimal INR values and prosthetic valve function assessed by echocardiography. The patient’s symptoms improved during the first follow-up. Conclusion Although postoperative cardiac complications are common, appropriate diagnosis with TTE and TEE has benefited surgeons. TEE-guided reexploration aids surgeons in decision-making and strategic approaches. Failure to diagnose such complications in asymptomatic patients can ultimately complicate the procedure. Henceforth, sonographers must be skilled in the detection and identification of unusual complications to guide redo interventions. Such an approach minimizes mortality, redo procedures, and avoids CPB hence reducing long-term prognosis and outcomes with valve replacement.

                We have developed an in vitro model for the evaluation of potential anticoccidial properties of novel compounds aimed to control chicken coccidiosis, a costly disease for the poultry industry. This disease is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria (Apicomplexa), and it is mainly controlled by chemoprophylaxis with ionophores and chemical anticoccidials; however, there is an overall agreement about the limitation of these traditional drugs and the need to improve current methods of control. Anticoccidial activities of novel compounds is currently evaluated by expensive experiments that involve large numbers of chickens. The use of our in vitro model for the pre-screening of essential oils led to a reduction of 67% of the chickens used in the in vivo trials for validation. Eimeria parasites can only complete their life cycle in their animal host, therefore chickens are required for their propagation as they cannot be propagated in vitro. In this study, we describe how further optimisation of this in vitro model by miniaturisation can have an additional impact in reduction of the number of chickens used for the generation of parasite stocks for provision of the in vitro model. We have estimated that the use of one chicken could support the evaluation of 10 compounds with a 96-well plate format versus only two compounds with a 24-well plate format, which means an 80% reduction in chicken use. In this study we have proved that the miniaturisation into a 96-well plate format perfectly mimics the invasion and replication observed before in the 24-well plate format. In addition, the 96-well plate format has allowed the simultaneous pre-screening of higher numbers of anticoccidial drugs at different concentrations following streamlined protocols in a more cost-effective way, factors that are beneficial for a wider uptake of the model by other researchers investigating anticoccidial compounds.

                The Gram-negative bacterium <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i> glides on solid surfaces. Dynamic bacterial focal adhesion complexes (bFACs) convert proton motive force from the inner membrane into mechanical propulsion on the cell surface. It is unclear how the mechanical force transmits across the rigid peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall. Here, we show that AgmT<i>,</i> a highly abundant lytic PG transglycosylase homologous to <i>Escherichia coli</i> MltG, couples bFACs to PG. Coprecipitation assay and single-particle microscopy reveal that the gliding motors fail to connect to PG and thus are unable to assemble into bFACs in the absence of an active AgmT. Heterologous expression of <i>E. coli</i> MltG restores the connection between PG and bFACs and thus rescues gliding motility in the <i>M. xanthus</i> cells that lack AgmT. Our results indicate that bFACs anchor to AgmT-modified PG to transmit mechanical force across the PG cell wall.

                The prevailing opinion emphasizes fronto-parietal network (FPN) is key in mediating general fluid intelligence (gF). Meanwhile, recent studies show that human MT complex (hMT+), located at the occipito-temporal border and involved in 3D perception processing, also plays a key role in gF. However, the underlying mechanism is not clear, yet. To investigate this issue, our study targets visuo-spatial intelligence, which is considered to have high loading on gF. We use ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA/Glu concentrations in hMT+ combining resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC), behavioral examinations including hMT+ perception suppression test and gF subtest in visuo-spatial component. Our findings show that both GABA in hMT+ and frontal-hMT+ functional connectivity significantly correlate with the performance of visuo-spatial intelligence. Further, serial mediation model demonstrates that the effect of hMT+ GABA on visuo-spatial gF is fully mediated by the hMT+ frontal FC. Together our findings highlight the importance in integrating sensory and frontal cortices in mediating the visuo-spatial component of general fluid intelligence.

                Microbial secondary metabolites are a rich source for pharmaceutical discoveries and play crucial ecological functions. While tools exist to identify secondary metabolite clusters in genomes, precise sequence-to-function mapping remains challenging because neither function nor substrate specificity of biosynthesis enzymes can accurately be predicted. Here, we developed a knowledge-guided bioinformatic pipeline to solve these issues. We analyzed 1928 genomes of <i>Pseudomonas</i> bacteria and focused on iron-scavenging pyoverdines as model metabolites. Our pipeline predicted 188 chemically different pyoverdines with nearly 100% structural accuracy and the presence of 94 distinct receptor groups required for the uptake of iron-loaded pyoverdines. Our pipeline unveils an enormous yet overlooked diversity of siderophores (151 new structures) and receptors (91 new groups). Our approach, combining feature sequence with phylogenetic approaches, is extendable to other metabolites and microbial genera, and thus emerges as powerful tool to reconstruct bacterial secondary metabolism pathways based on sequence data.

                Background Children’s use of social media has increased significantly over the past decade. As a result, they are susceptible to smartphone addiction. In particular, parents' and children's well-being and behaviors are negatively affected by smartphone addiction. Such addiction likely affects both physical performance and lifestyle. Adolescents utilize their smartphones while performing other tasks. The secondary task might divert attention away from the primary task. Reaction time is the combination of brain processing and muscular movement. Texting or communicating on a smartphone while performing another task may affect reaction time. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the influence of smartphone use on reaction time in undergraduate students who were addicted to smartphones. Methods The Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) was used to assign 64 undergraduate students to the smartphone addiction group (n = 32) and the control group (n = 32). The reaction time (RT) of an organism is used to determine how rapidly it responds to stimuli. All participants were examined on the RT test under three conditions: no smartphone use (control), texting, and chatting on a smartphone. Participants were questioned by smartphone through text message or chat with the support of a researcher during the texting and conversation conditions. While responding to the questions, the participant was administered an RT test. Results The results showed that smartphone addiction tends to have a reduced influence on reaction time when compared to the control group. Also, texting or conversing on a smartphone while doing other work had a substantial impact on reaction time in the undergraduates. Conclusions Combining smartphone use with other activities tends to reduce undergraduate students' reaction time.

                Background Human activity recognition poses a complex challenge in predicting individuals’ movements from raw sensor data using machine learning models. This paper explores the application of six prominent machine learning techniques – decision tree, random forest, linear regression, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks – to enhance the accuracy of human activity detection for e-health systems. Despite previous research efforts employing data mining and machine learning, there remains room for improvement in performance. The study focuses on predicting activities such as walking, standing, laying, sitting, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. Methods The research employs six machine learning algorithms to recognize human activities, including decision tree, random forest, linear regression, Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, and neural networks. Results Evaluation of the human activity recognition dataset reveals that the random forest classifier, CNN, GRN and neural network yield promising results, achieving high accuracy. However, Naïve Bayes falls short of satisfying outcomes. Conclusions The study successfully classifies activities like SITTING, STANDING, LAYING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, and WALKING_UPSTAIRS with a remarkable accuracy of 98%. The contribution lies in the thorough exploration of machine learning techniques, with neural networks emerging as the most effective in enhancing human activity recognition. The findings showcase the potential for advanced applications in e-health systems and beyond.

                Background Early-life food consumption patterns may affect children’s health by increasing susceptibility to developing non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) in adulthood. Aims To evaluate Jordanian children and adolescents’ energy and macronutrient intake and how closely they adhere to dietary recommendations. Methods This cross-sectional study used data from Jordan’s Population-based Food Consumption Survey, a household population-based study conducted in Jordan between 2021 and 2022 (561 children and adolescents 8-19 years). Dietary intake was assessed using the two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recall methods (24-h DR). The estimated food group and nutrient intakes were compared to nutritional recommendations, including MyPlate dietary guidelines. Results The prevalence of overweight/obese individuals based on body mass index (BMI) was 44%, and the average waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was 24.7%. Compared to MyPlate dietary guidelines, children and adolescents had a higher added sugar intake (57g/day). Also, consuming vegetables, fruits, and dairy fell short of MyPlate dietary guidelines. The total discretionary calorie intake in children and adolescents was approximately one-third of the total energy intake. Conclusion The food consumption of Jordanian children and adolescents includes high intakes of discretionary calories, with a low intake of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was elevated compared to international norms.

                Background: Widespread adoption of a westernized diet represents a major lifestyle change characterized by substantially higher sodium consumption and lower potassium intake, which is related to cardiovascular morbidity. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis over published studies in accordance with quantifying the dietary intake of sodium and potassium of the universal population across the world. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases were used to find research that pronounced 24-hour urinary sodium or potassium excretion (reference period: 2014–2021). The effect size was estimated using the fixed-effect model; sub-group analysis become accomplished to determine urinary sodium and potassium excretion disaggregated by geographical location. Publication bias became evaluated the usage of graphical funnel plot. Data analysis was performed using STATA 16. Results: Forty-three studies (n= 62,940) qualified the selection criteria. The mean urinary excretion of sodium and potassium was 156.73 mmol/24h [95% confidence interval (CI), 148.98–164.47] and 48.89 mmol/24 h (95% CI, 43.61–54.17), respectively; the mean urinary sodium/potassium ratio was 3.68 (95% CI, 2.96–4.40). Conclusions: This updated systematic review highlights excessively high dietary intake of sodium and low intake of potassium at the community level in most parts of the world. The urinary Na/K ratio exceeded the level recommended by the WHO guidelines.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic stress is a significant factor affecting students’ psychological well-being, particularly in higher education. Understanding the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy can provide insights into how these factors influence students’ psychological well-being in public and private universities. Methods The study examined the mediating roles of social support and self-efficacy in the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being among university students in Mogadishu, Somalia. Utilizing a stratified sampling technique, data were collected from 663 students across public (52.6%) and private (47.4%) universities through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using path analysis to assess direct and indirect effects. Structural equation modeling technique was used for data analysis. Results The analysis revealed a significant direct effect of academic stress on psychological well-being (β = 0.133, p = 0.000). Academic stress was not significantly related to social support (β = 0.128, p = 0.066) and self-efficacy (β = 0.075, p = 0.099). However, both social support (β = 0.059, p = 0.000) and self-efficacy (β = 0.838, p = 0.000) were significantly related to psychological well-being. The mediating analysis showed that social support partially mediated the relationship between academic stress and psychological well-being (Indirect effect = 0.070, CI [-0.036, 0.197], p = 0.000), while self-efficacy did not mediate this relationship (Indirect effect = 0.063, CI [0.054, 0.218], p = 0.097). Conclusions The findings suggest a significant positive impact of academic stress on psychological well-being, while social support partially mediates this relationship, highlighting its buffering role. Conversely, self-efficacy, although positively contributing to psychological well-being, does not mediate the effect of academic stress. These results underscore the importance of robust social support systems and targeted interventions to enhance students’ coping mechanisms and overall psychological well-being. Study limitations and implication are discussed.

                Maintaining short-term planning aligned with the ultimate long-term plan is challenging. This requires many details to be modelled on a daily or weekly basis to reach this target. Short-term planning is more challenging than medium- and long-term planning because it deals with uncertainties, which increases the gap between medium- and long-term plans. Short-term mine planning teams are expected to identify and manage potential risks to mitigate them, and eventually achieve the long-term objective of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV). Very few studies have identified the problems that exist in short-term mine planning and provided technical solutions to overcome them for open-pit mines. One of the complexities associated with short-term planning is the creation of polygons or mining cuts by clustering before optimizing and scheduling the plan to reduce the computational expense of mine planning models. The primary objective of this study is to review the latest papers describing short-term mine planning challenges and technical solutions proposed to optimize mine planning for open-pit mines.

                Background The success of the theories of special and general relativity in describing localised phenomena, such as objects undergoing high speed motion or located in gravitational fields, needs no further elaboration. However, when applied to the evolution of the universe several problems arise which can require an additional model, e.g., inflation during the early expansion, and adjustments to parameters to account for phenomena such as the late-time acceleration of the universe. Methods Focusing on the difference between the ways in which space and time are measured, this paper shows that there are two paths which allow the equations of special relativity to be produced from the same basic postulates. Results Both the standard theory and the energy/momentum, or dynamic model, utilise the Minkowski metric, but with different coordinate systems. The dynamic model transforms Cartesian coordinates into an Euclidean form by multiplying the coordinates by functions of γ (=(1–ν 2)c 2)-1⁄2). When utilising these coordinates, the relativistic equations are unchanged for local phenomena such as the Lorentz coordinate transformation and the energy/momentum equation for high-velocity objects. Conclusions However, the derived coordinates alter the perceived overall structure of the universe in a manner that, for the simplest model under this system, allows the reproduction of observed cosmological features, such as the intrinsic flatness of the universe and the apparent late-time acceleration of its expansion, without the need of additional models or changes in parameter values.

                Background Outpatient services were a major aspect of hospital healthcare, primarily due to the prevalent inclination of individuals to seek efficient and expedient treatment options that could be provided within a single day. In this context, the experience of head nurses played a crucial role in providing optimum nursing care under supervision. This study aimed to explore the experience of head nurses in supervising nursing staff in the outpatient department. Method this study used a qualitative hermeneutic phenomenology design, and the participants were selected using the purposive sampling method. Result This study recruited a total of 20 head nurses in public and private hospitals in West Sumatra province. The FGD data were analyzed and coded using a total of 102 nodes, which were then used to generate 5 themes and 16 subthemes. The five major themes included the knowledge of head nurses about supervision, the performance appraisal method, the feeling of head nurses when supervising, the supervisor support for supervision, and the expectations of head nurses. Conclusion Clinical supervision in the outpatient department was crucial for the success of nurses in delivering healthcare services. The study revealed that while supervision was essential, head nurses observed that it was often perceived as fault-finding by nursing staff, which could affect individual assessment scores and sometimes led to indifference towards the process.

                Background: Disparity in the esthetic perceptions between a patient and clinician could result in patient dissatisfaction with orthodontic treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the perceptions of a group of orthodontists, general dentists, and laypersons about the attractiveness of Indian facial profiles. Methods: In this study, a male and a female participants’ photographs and lateral cephalograms were digitally manipulated by inserting them into Dolphin software; we considered four soft tissue parameters at a nasolabial angle, upper lip E-line, lower lip E-line, and pg-pg’, so that 20 profiles were created for each model. A visual analog scale (VAS) along with a question about surgical correction opinion was given to 18 orthodontists, 18 general dentists, and 18 laypersons to score (1-5) from least to most attractive. Spearman’s rank correlation was computed to assess correlation, as well as ANOVA, followed by post hoc Tukey analysis to compare the mean scores, and Chi-square test to determine the opinion about surgical treatment. Results: There was an overall weak and negative correlation between the three groups, indicating that orthodontists attributed lower pleasantness scores to almost all the altered female and male facial profiles. Additionally, statistically significantly lower mean scores were attributed by orthodontists to many females and few male facial profiles. More orthodontists identified the need for surgical correction for a few severely distorted profiles but there was a statistically non-significant difference among the groups for most of the profiles. Conclusions: It was concluded that participants in the three groups had diverse concepts of facial attractiveness in all the parameters considered. Compared to general dentists and laypersons, orthodontists were much more precise, firmer, and meticulous in identifying a favorable or good-looking profile.

Solid tumors are characterized by complex interactions between the tumor, the immune system and the microenvironment. These interactions and intra-tumor variations have both diagnostic and prognostic significance and implications. However, quantifying the underlying processes in patient samples requires expensive and complicated molecular experiments. In contrast, H&E staining is typically performed as part of the routine standard process, and is very cheap. Here we present HIPI (H&E Image Interpretation and Protein Expression Inference) for predicting cell marker expression from tumor H&E images. We process paired H&E and CyCIF images taken from serial sections of colorectal cancers to train our model. We show that our model accurately predicts the spatial distribution of several important cell markers, on both held-out tumor regions as well as new tumor samples taken from different patients. Moreover, using only the tissue image morphology, HIPI is able to colocalize the interactions between different cell types, further demonstrating its potential clinical significance.

                <p>by Biao Tang, Kexin Ma, Yan Liu, Xia Wang, Sanyi Tang, Yanni Xiao, Robert A. Cheke</p>

Accurate prediction of epidemics is pivotal for making well-informed decisions for the control of infectious diseases, but addressing heterogeneity in the system poses a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel modeling framework integrating the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models, by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (UDE) model. Simultaneously, we pre-set a specific form for the recruitment rate and develop a mechanistic model. Data from a COVID Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the UDE model using deep learning methods and to calibrate the mechanistic model using MCMC methods. Subsequently, we project the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared with the homogeneous model’s projections of 99.97% and 32.78%, thus providing an 18.6% improvement in the prediction accuracy based on the actual data. Our simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37.36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days, also aligning with the real case. We consider that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models and new insights for modelling heterogeneity.

                <p>by Kevin Tsai, Zhen Zhou, Jiadong Yang, Zhiliang Xu, Shixin Xu, Roya Zandi, Nan Hao, Weitao Chen, Mark Alber</p>

Understanding the mechanisms of the cellular aging processes is crucial for attempting to extend organismal lifespan and for studying age-related degenerative diseases. Yeast cells divide through budding, providing a classical biological model for studying cellular aging. With their powerful genetics, relatively short cell cycle, and well-established signaling pathways also found in animals, yeast cells offer valuable insights into the aging process. Recent experiments suggested the existence of two aging modes in yeast characterized by nucleolar and mitochondrial declines, respectively. By analyzing experimental data, this study shows that cells evolving into those two aging modes behave differently when they are young. While buds grow linearly in both modes, cells that consistently generate spherical buds throughout their lifespan demonstrate greater efficacy in controlling bud size and growth rate at young ages. A three-dimensional multiscale chemical-mechanical model was developed and used to suggest and test hypothesized impacts of aging on bud morphogenesis. Experimentally calibrated model simulations showed that during the early stage of budding, tubular bud shape in one aging mode could be generated by locally inserting new materials at the bud tip, a process guided by the polarized Cdc42 signal. Furthermore, the aspect ratio of the tubular bud could be stabilized during the late stage as observed in experiments in this work. The model simulation results suggest that the localization of new cell surface material insertion, regulated by chemical signal polarization, could be weakened due to cellular aging in yeast and other cell types, leading to the change and stabilization of the bud aspect ratio.

                <p>by Helder V. Ribeiro-Filho, Gabriel E. Jara, João V. S. Guerra, Melyssa Cheung, Nathaniel R. Felbinger, José G. C. Pereira, Brian G. Pierce, Paulo S. Lopes-de-Oliveira</p>

Deep learning methods, trained on the increasing set of available protein 3D structures and sequences, have substantially impacted the protein modeling and design field. These advancements have facilitated the creation of novel proteins, or the optimization of existing ones designed for specific functions, such as binding a target protein. Despite the demonstrated potential of such approaches in designing general protein binders, their application in designing immunotherapeutics remains relatively underexplored. A relevant application is the design of T cell receptors (TCRs). Given the crucial role of T cells in mediating immune responses, redirecting these cells to tumor or infected target cells through the engineering of TCRs has shown promising results in treating diseases, especially cancer. However, the computational design of TCR interactions presents challenges for current physics-based methods, particularly due to the unique natural characteristics of these interfaces, such as low affinity and cross-reactivity. For this reason, in this study, we explored the potential of two structure-based deep learning protein design methods, ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF1, in designing fixed-backbone TCRs for binding target antigenic peptides presented by the MHC through different design scenarios. To evaluate TCR designs, we employed a comprehensive set of sequence- and structure-based metrics, highlighting the benefits of these methods in comparison to classical physics-based design methods and identifying deficiencies for improvement.

                <p>by Yutaro Kumagai</p>

Recent advances in measurement technologies, particularly single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have revolutionized our ability to acquire large amounts of omics-level data on cellular states. As measurement techniques evolve, there has been an increasing need for data analysis methodologies, especially those focused on cell-type identification and inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We have developed a new method named BootCellNet, which employs smoothing and resampling to infer GRNs. Using the inferred GRNs, BootCellNet further infers the minimum dominating set (MDS), a set of genes that determines the dynamics of the entire network. We have demonstrated that BootCellNet robustly infers GRNs and their MDSs from scRNA-seq data and facilitates unsupervised identification of cell clusters using scRNA-seq datasets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and hematopoiesis. It has also identified COVID-19 patient-specific cells and their potential regulatory transcription factors. BootCellNet not only identifies cell types in an unsupervised and explainable way but also provides insights into the characteristics of identified cell types through the inference of GRNs and MDS.

An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of “health benefits packages” (HBPs), which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations. In this work, we propose the individual-based <i>Thanzi La Onse</i> (TLO) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modelling—and calibrating to extensive, country-specific data—the incidence of disease, health-seeking behaviour, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available, we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country. We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis (LCOA) achieved the largest health gain—∼8% reduction in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics, rather than service type. Unlike the LCOA-based HBP, this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis, and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period, which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future.

<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) releases the unusual terpene nucleoside 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd) to block lysosomal function and promote survival in human macrophages. Using conventional approaches, we found that genes <i>Rv3377c</i> and <i>Rv3378c</i>, but not <i>Rv3376</i>, were necessary for 1-TbAd biosynthesis. Here, we introduce linear models for mass spectrometry <i>(limms)</i> software as a next-generation lipidomics tool to study the essential functions of lipid biosynthetic enzymes on a whole-cell basis. Using <i>limms</i>, whole-cell lipid profiles deepened the phenotypic landscape of comparative mass spectrometry experiments and identified a large family of approximately 100 terpene nucleoside metabolites downstream of <i>Rv3378c</i>. We validated the identity of previously unknown adenine-, adenosine-, and lipid-modified tuberculosinol-containing molecules using synthetic chemistry and collisional mass spectrometry, including comprehensive profiling of bacterial lipids that fragment to adenine. We tracked terpene nucleoside genotypes and lipid phenotypes among <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> complex (MTC) species that did or did not evolve to productively infect either human or nonhuman mammals. Although 1-TbAd biosynthesis genes were thought to be restricted to the MTC, we identified the locus in unexpected species outside the MTC. Sequence analysis of the locus showed nucleotide usage characteristic of plasmids from plant-associated bacteria, clarifying the origin and timing of horizontal gene transfer to a pre-MTC progenitor. The data demonstrated correlation between high level terpene nucleoside biosynthesis and mycobacterial competence for human infection, and 2 mechanisms of 1-TbAd biosynthesis loss. Overall, the selective gain and evolutionary retention of tuberculosinyl metabolites in modern species that cause human TB suggest a role in human TB disease, and the newly discovered molecules represent candidate disease-specific biomarkers.

                Research data management (RDM) is central to the implementation of the FAIR (Findable Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and Open Science principles. Recognising the importance of RDM, ELIXIR Platforms and Nodes have invested in RDM and launched various projects and initiatives to ensure good data management practices for scientific excellence. These projects have resulted in a rich set of tools and resources highly valuable for FAIR data management. However, these resources remain scattered across projects and ELIXIR structures, making their dissemination and application challenging. Therefore, it becomes imminent to coordinate these efforts for sustainable and harmonised RDM practices with dedicated forums for RDM professionals to exchange knowledge and share resources. The proposed ELIXIR RDM Community will bring together RDM experts to develop ELIXIR’s vision and coordinate its activities, taking advantage of the available assets. It aims to coordinate RDM best practices and illustrate how to use the existing ELIXIR RDM services. The Community will be built around three integral pillars, namely, a network of RDM professionals, RDM knowledge management and RDM training expertise and resources. It will also engage with external stakeholders to leverage benefits and provide a forum to RDM professionals for regular knowledge exchange, capacity building and development of harmonised RDM practices, keeping in line with the overall scope of the RDM Community. In the short term, the Community aims to build upon the existing resources and ensure that the content of these remain up to date and fit for purpose. In the long run, the Community will aim to strengthen the skills and knowledge of its RDM professionals to support the emerging needs of the scientific community. The Community will also devise an effective strategy to engage with other ELIXIR structures and international stakeholders to influence and align with developments and solutions in the RDM field.

                We describe the case report of an Osteosarcoma patient, with a Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, presenting with a pathological femoral fracture. The patient was treated with a multidisciplinary approach associating neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy with excisional surgery. The femoral reconstruction consisted of a ``Capasquelet'' reconstruction combining an induced membrane and a vascularized fibula allograft allowing a good functional result with an early weight-bearing. We managed to complete our histological analysis in this patient, in order to evaluate the tumor vascularization. Indeed, using the syngeneic osteosarcoma MOS-J mouse model, we highlighted previously that CD31+/\ensuremath{\alpha}-SMA+ vessels may be indicators of vasculature normalization and therefore may be used as specific markers of a good therapeutic response. Thus, we search for its interest in this specific case as preliminary work. The aim was to assess the feasibility and technical validity of the vascularization analysis of a human osteosarcoma tumor specimen. Therefore, we propose an immunohistochemistry methodology  with multiplexed immunofluorescence to assess the vascularization as a promising marker in human osteosarcoma tissue.

<p>To determine the prevalence and distribution of intracranial vessel occlusion identified on computed tomography (CT) or magnet resonance (MR) angiography and to explore its association with functional outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter cohort study enrolling consecutive patients with AF with imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who underwent CT- or MR-angiography on admission (2014–2022). Multivariable regression was used to explore the association between intracranial vessel occlusion and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3–6) at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 10,164 patients (median age 81.5 years, 47.8% female, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission 6; 14.7% on a vitamin K antagonist [VKA], 27.5% on a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC], 57.8% not receiving oral anticoagulation). Angiography showed intracranial vessel occlusion in 5,190 patients (51.1%), affecting the anterior cerebral circulation in 87.4%. Overall, 29.2% and 29.4% of patients received thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, respectively. The proportion of patients with poor functional outcome at 90 days was 60.6% and 42.7% in those with and without vessel occlusion, respectively. In multivariable analyses, vessel occlusion was associated with poor functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71–2.22) with consistent results in subgroups according to oral anticoagulation use (VKA, aOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.40–2.80; DOAC, aOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.83–3.03; none, aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.49–2.09).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Intracranial vessel occlusion is common in patients with AF with ischemic stroke, mainly affects the anterior circulation and is associated with poor functional outcome. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The gross domestic product (GDP) of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states can be used to determine their overall economic growth. In order to increase GDP, all emerging nations in Southeast Asia are stating to depend on foreign direct investment (FDI), the tourism industry, international visitors visiting ASEAN member nations banking credit, and low inflation rates. High inflation is a problem that developed and developing countries will definitely face. One of the problems faced by ASEAN member countries is that most of the member countries are in the developing country category. For ASEAN member countries, high inflation levels will encourage economic instability. GDP is less than optimal because of these classic problems in developing countries so that economic growth is not as planned. The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which ASEAN established, is seen as a way to reduce unemployment, alleviate poverty by boosting the travel and tourism industry and increasing investment, as well as to offer or distribute credit to businesses at low interest rates in order to boost GDP. The purpose of this study is to investigate and analyze how the GDP of ASEAN member nations is affected by FDI, foreign visitors, bank credit, and inflation. s: We analyzed panel data for seven ASEAN members from 2002 to 2020. FDI, foreign tourists, banking credit, and inflation are the research factors examined as independent variables that have an impact on GDP, the dependent variable. Results The study’s findings indicate that while inflation has a large negative impact on GDP, FDI, foreign tourism, and bank credit have a considerable positive impact on GDP. Conclusions FDI, foreign tourists, bank credit, and inflation have a significant influence on GDP in ASEAN member countries.

                The cerebral cortex displays a bewildering diversity of shapes and sizes across and within species. Despite this diversity, we present a universal multi-scale description of primate cortices. We show that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As neighbouring folds are gradually merged, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, that also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species. Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the <i>same</i> archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of <i>d</i><sub><i>f</i></sub> = 2.5. Importantly, this new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding, we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size (from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses. Our new understanding may, therefore, generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94898">An arms race between 5’ppp-RNA virus and its alternative recognition receptor MDA5 in RIG-I-lost teleost fish</a></h4>

              
                The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life’s evolution. During this process, the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest since viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, <i>Miichthys miiuy</i>. Firstly, the frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of <i>M. miiuy and Gallus gallus</i>, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. Secondly, as an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m<sup>6</sup>A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96028">Transcription factor condensates, 3D clustering, and gene expression enhancement of the MET regulon</a></h4>

              
                Some transcription factors (TFs) can form liquid–liquid phase separated (LLPS) condensates. However, the functions of these TF condensates in 3-Dimentional (3D) genome organization and gene regulation remain elusive. In response to methionine (met) starvation, budding yeast TF Met4 and a few co-activators, including Met32, induce a set of genes involved in met biosynthesis. Here, we show that the endogenous Met4 and Met32 form co-localized puncta-like structures in yeast nuclei upon met depletion. Recombinant Met4 and Met32 form mixed droplets with LLPS properties in vitro. In relation to chromatin, Met4 puncta co-localize with target genes, and at least a subset of these target genes is clustered in 3D in a Met4-dependent manner. A <i>MET3pr</i>-GFP reporter inserted near several native Met4-binding sites becomes co-localized with Met4 puncta and displays enhanced transcriptional activity. A Met4 variant with a partial truncation of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) shows less puncta formation, and this mutant selectively reduces the reporter activity near Met4-binding sites to the basal level. Overall, these results support a model where Met4 and co-activators form condensates to bring multiple target genes into a vicinity with higher local TF concentrations, which facilitates a strong response to methionine depletion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84662">Variation in thermal physiology can drive the temperature-dependence of microbial community richness</a></h4>

              
                Predicting how species diversity changes along environmental gradients is an enduring problem in ecology. In microbes current theories tend to invoke energy availability and enzyme kinetics as the main drivers of temperature-richness relationships. Here we derive a general empirically-grounded theory that can explain this phenomenon by linking microbial species richness in competitive communities to variation in the temperature-dependence of their interaction and growth rates. Specifically, the shape of the microbial community temperature-richness relationship depends on how rapidly the strength of effective competition between species pairs changes with temperature relative to the variance of their growth rates. Furthermore, it predicts that a thermal specialist-generalist tradeoff in growth rates alters coexistence by shifting this balance, causing richness to peak at relatively higher temperatures. Finally, we show that the observed patterns of variation in thermal performance curves of metabolic traits across extant bacterial taxa is indeed sufficient to generate the variety of community-level temperature-richness responses observed in the real world. Our results provide a new and general mechanism that can help explain temperature-diversity gradients in microbial communities, and provide a quantitative framework for interlinking variation in the thermal physiology of microbial species to their community-level diversity.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have emerged in recent years as a strong candidate for the treatment of a range of difficulties faced by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including cognitive, emotional, and social aspects. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a review that systematically examined the efficacy of MBIs for individuals with ASD and their caregivers. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Our literature search was conducted within the MEDLINE database. We included in the review only longitudinal or intervention studies focusing mainly on mindfulness principles, while we excluded mixed intervention studies. We only included studies that explicitly utilized quantitative methodologies for evaluating the outcomes of the interventions, including mental health indices (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) and assessments of cognitive and social skills (e.g., attention, prosociality). We conducted also a risk of bias assessment through the method of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for intervention studies ROBINS-I. Results: Thirty-seven studies were included in the review, and we grouped the studies by the targets of the interventions, i.e., adults (n = 12), children and adolescents (n = 9), caregivers and medical staff (n = 13), and combined intervention for both children/adolescents and their parents/caregivers (n 5). The reviewed papers seem to support the feasibility and utility of mindfulness interventions for persons with ASD and their caregivers, but any recommendations based on this body of evidence should be made with caution due to the overall low quality of the studies conducted so far. Conclusions: The review reveals a positive outcome, including the alleviation of psychological distress, reduced behavioral problems, and enhanced cognitive and social skills in individuals with ASD. Despite such promising results, the review notes a limitation in the scarcity of MBIs for young patients, emphasizing caution in universally endorsing the existing literature. Moreover, the results underline the urgency of the exploration of tailored interventions for different ASD subgroups, considering varying levels of autism, and expanding support to teachers in educational settings.</p>

	<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of movement disorders that impair posture and mobility, often leading to spasticity and joint contractures. Interventions like serial casting are commonly used to improve joint mobility and manage spasticity in children with CP. However, its effects on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of serial casting and ankle&amp;amp;ndash;foot orthoses (AFOs) on ANS responses during a virtual reality (VR) standing task, comparing these interventions with a barefoot condition. Thirty children with CP were randomized into three groups (n = 10 per group): serial casting, AFOs, and barefoot. Heart rate variability (HRV) was used to assess ANS responses across three phases: seated rest, VR task, and recovery. The results showed that the serial casting group exhibited higher sympathetic activity during rest compared to the other groups, but had a reduced sympathetic response during the VR task. Additionally, the serial casting group displayed a more pronounced parasympathetic rebound during recovery, similar to the orthoses and barefoot groups. While serial casting provides essential joint stability, it alters ANS response patterns, leading to heightened sympathetic activation at rest, without providing significant improvements in ANS behavior during physical activity.</p>

	<p>Background: Post-treatment side effects of chemotherapy can include cognitive deficits commonly known as Chemo-brain. The treatment of patients with Doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of cancer, can induce depression, anxiety, and impaired cognitive function. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa that has been identified as a possible therapeutic agent against many neurodegenerative disorders, including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Tau-protein-induced neurodegeneration, and neuropathic pain. Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether oral CBD administration could reduce DOX-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors and alter the expression of mRNA associated with neuroinflammation. Methods: Female Long Evans Hooded rats received intraperitoneal injections of DOX (6 mg/kg) or the vehicle (0.9% saline) once a week for four weeks, followed by oral administration of CBD (10 mg/kg) three times a week for the same period. Results: CBD was significantly protective against DOX-induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, as measured by several behavioral tests. Furthermore, CBD improved DOX-induced alterations in the gene expression of biomarkers of neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: This provides insights into future studies on possible mechanisms by which DOX-induced cognitive dysfunction could be alleviated by CBD.</p>

	<p>Background: Decision-making is a highly complex process that depends on numerous cognitive functions, such as episodic memory. It is also influenced by aging. However, how changes in episodic memory with age contribute to changes in decision-making is not clear yet. Objective: This work aimed to examine the role of two memory processes, recollection and familiarity, in decision-making in ageing. Method: Thirty young adults and 30 older adults performed two episodic memory tasks: recognition, which allowed for the measurement of recollection and familiarity, and recall, which allowed for the measurement of recollection. In both tasks, they first viewed a series of pictures and then were asked to recognise or recall them respectively. They also performed an original scenario task based on situations inspired by everyday life, evaluating decision-making under conditions of either risk or ambiguity. In this task, participants were presented with short descriptions of situations requiring a decision and had to choose between two given options. Results: Lower performances was observed in recall and recognition tasks in older than in young adults. In the scenarios task, young adults sought significantly more risk and ambiguity than older adults. In both young and older adults, recollection and familiarity processes were involved differently in decision-making. The former is more involved in decision-making under ambiguity, and the latter in decision-making under risk. Conclusions: The results suggest that decision-making changes with age, but that the involvement of the episodic memory, familiarity and recollection processes, does not appear to vary with age.</p>

	<p>Background: Visual perceptual learning plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of how the human brain integrates visual cues to construct coherent perceptual experiences. The visual system is continually challenged to integrate a multitude of visual cues, including form and motion, to create a unified representation of the surrounding visual scene. This process involves both the processing of local signals and their integration into a coherent global percept. Over the past several decades, researchers have explored the mechanisms underlying this integration, focusing on concepts such as internal noise and sampling efficiency, which pertain to local and global processing, respectively. Objectives and Methods: In this study, we investigated the influence of visual perceptual learning on non-directional motion processing using dynamic Glass patterns (GPs) and modified Random-Dot Kinematograms (mRDKs). We also explored the mechanisms of learning transfer to different stimuli and tasks. Specifically, we aimed to assess whether visual perceptual learning based on illusory directional motion, triggered by form and motion cues (dynamic GPs), transfers to stimuli that elicit comparable illusory motion, such as mRDKs. Additionally, we examined whether training on form and motion coherence thresholds improves internal noise filtering and sampling efficiency. Results: Our results revealed significant learning effects on the trained task, enhancing the perception of dynamic GPs. Furthermore, there was a substantial learning transfer to the non-trained stimulus (mRDKs) and partial transfer to a different task. The data also showed differences in coherence thresholds between dynamic GPs and mRDKs, with GPs showing lower coherence thresholds than mRDKs. Finally, an interaction between visual stimulus type and session for sampling efficiency revealed that the effect of training session on participants&amp;amp;rsquo; performance varied depending on the type of visual stimulus, with dynamic GPs being influenced differently than mRDKs. Conclusion: These findings highlight the complexity of perceptual learning and suggest that the transfer of learning effects may be influenced by the specific characteristics of both the training stimuli and tasks, providing valuable insights for future research in visual processing.</p>

	<p>Victims of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women (IPVAW) experience neuropsychological and cerebral changes, which have been linked to several tentative causal mechanisms, including elevated cortisol levels, psychopathological disorders, traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypoxic/ischemic brain damage, and medical conditions related to IPVAW. While these mechanisms and their effects on brain function and neuropsychological health are well-documented in other clinical populations, they manifest with unique characteristics in women affected by IPVAW. Specifically, IPVAW is chronic and repeated in nature, and mechanisms are often cumulative and may interact with other comorbid conditions. Thus, in light of existing literature on neuropsychological alterations in other populations, and recognizing the distinct features in women who experience IPVAW, we propose a new theoretical model&amp;amp;mdash;the Neuro-IPVAW model. This framework aims to explain the complex interplay between these mechanisms and their impact on cognitive and brain health in IPVAW victims. We anticipate that this theoretical model will be valuable for enhancing our understanding of neuropsychological and brain changes related to intimate partner violence, identifying research gaps in these mechanisms, and guiding future research directions in this area.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by a complex interplay of genetic, developmental, and environmental factors that significantly increase the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SAs). This systematic review synthesizes current research on the developmental predictors of SI in individuals with SZ, aiming to delineate the multifactorial etiology of suicide within this population. Methods: A comprehensive search across Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases identified 23 eligible studies, emphasizing the varied methodological approaches and the global distribution of research efforts. Results: These studies demonstrate a robust association between early life adversities, particularly childhood trauma such as physical neglect, emotional abuse, and sexual abuse, and the increased prevalence of SI and SAs in SZ. This review also highlights the significant genetic factors associated with the development of suicidality in SZ, raising the possibility that polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes and neurodevelopmental abnormalities may influence susceptibility to SI. Notably, family history of psychiatric conditions may exacerbate the risk of SI through both hereditary and environmental mechanisms. Environmental factors, including socioeconomic status and social support, are also implicated, underscoring the role of broader socio-environmental conditions influencing outcomes. Conclusions: This review supports the integration of biopsychosocial models in understanding SI in SZ, advocating for interventions addressing the complex interplay of risk factors and the need for longitudinal studies to elucidate the dynamic interactions between risk factors over time. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for developing targeted preventive strategies and enhancing the clinical management of SZ, aiming to reduce suicidality in this vulnerable population.</p>

	<p>Background: In the oddball paradigm, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is often associated with active cognitive responses, such as maintaining information in working memory or adapting response strategies. While some evidence points to the DLPFC&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in passive auditory deviance perception, a detailed understanding of the spatiotemporal neurodynamics involved remains unclear. Methods: In this study, event-related optical signals (EROS) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were simultaneously recorded for the first time over the prefrontal cortex using a 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system, during passive auditory deviance perception in 12 right-handed young adults (7 women and 5 men). In this oddball paradigm, deviant stimuli (a 1500 Hz pure tone) elicited a negative shift in the N1 ERP component, related to mismatch negativity (MMN), and a significant positive deflection associated with the P300, compared to standard stimuli (a 1000 Hz tone). Results: We hypothesize that the DLPFC not only participates in active tasks but also plays a critical role in processing deviant stimuli in passive conditions, shifting from pre-attentive to attentive processing. We detected enhanced neural activity in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), at the same timing of the MMN component, followed by later activation at the timing of the P3a ERP component in the right MFG. Conclusions: Understanding these dynamics will provide deeper insights into the DLPFC&amp;amp;rsquo;s role in evaluating the novelty or unexpectedness of the deviant stimulus, updating its cognitive value, and adjusting future predictions accordingly. However, the small number of subjects could limit the generalizability of the observations, in particular with respect to the effect of handedness, and additional studies with larger and more diverse samples are necessary to validate our conclusions.</p>

	<p>Purpose: To assess spatial contrast sensitivity (CS) in suspected primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. Methods: CS was measured using sinusoidal gratings of 4 cycles/degree. First, foveal and peripheral CS were assessed in 34 suspected POAG patients and compared with 71 and 28 age-matched healthy individuals for foveal and peripheral conditions, respectively. Second, foveal CS was assessed in 34 early POAG patients age-matched with suspected POAG patients. Analyses were performed considering two age ranges: Under and Over 50 y.o. Correlations were evaluated between CS and clinical parameters. Diagnostic accuracy was also analyzed. Results: Peripheral CS was lower in older suspected POAG patients (23.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 16.1) than the control group (39.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 28.2) (p = 0.040). Foveal CS was reduced in suspected POAG participants (Under 50: 146.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 63.3; p = 0.004. Over 50: 110.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 65.0; p = 0.044) and in early POAG patients (Under 50: 141.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 72.6; p = 0.002. Over 50: 80.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 54.5 p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), both compared to the control group (Under 50: 213.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 66.2. Over 50: 138.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 71.7). CS was lower in early POAG than in POAG suspected in older patients (p = 0.042). Foveal CS was correlated with age (Early: p = 0.001. Suspect: p = 0.002) and with the cup&amp;amp;ndash;disc ratio only in early POAG patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Foveal CS had fair (AUC = 0.74) diagnostic accuracy for early POAG patients. Conclusions: CS in suspected POAG patients is lower than in healthy individuals. Our findings evidence the spatial vision loss before the onset of POAG.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Although the involvement of progressive brain alterations in epilepsy was recently suggested, individual patients&amp;amp;rsquo; trajectories of white matter (WM) disruption are not known. Methods: We investigated the disease progression patterns of WM damage and its associations with clinical metrics. We examined the cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data of 155 patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 270 age/gender-matched healthy controls, and we then calculated the average fractional anisotropy (FA) values within 20 WM tracts of the whole brain. We used the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) program to detect the progression trajectory of FA changes and investigated its association with clinical parameters including onset age, disease duration, drug-responsiveness, and the number of anti-seizure medications (ASMs). Results: The SuStaIn algorithm identified a single subtype model in which the initial damage occurs in the ipsilateral uncinate fasciculus (UF), followed by damage in the forceps, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and anterior thalamic radiation (ATR). This pattern was replicated when analyzing TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (n = 50) and TLE with no lesions (n = 105) separately. Further-progressed stages were associated with longer disease duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and a greater number of ASMs (p = 0.001). Conclusions: the disease progression model based on WM tracts may be useful as a novel individual-level biomarker.</p>

	<p>The acute levodopa challenge is widely used to distinguish Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) from atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APSs) such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In APSs, very few patients present a clinically relevant response to levodopa. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with atypical parkinsonism benefit from levodopa in any aspect of their multiple motor deficits despite the generally poor response. This retrospective study analyzed individual motor responses to the acute levodopa challenge using the MDS-UPDRS III in 47 PSP, 26 MSA, and 71 PD patients at Hannover Medical School. Despite the generally poor levodopa response in both PSP and MSA patients, bradykinesia and rigidity were the symptoms most notably affected by levodopa in PSP patients, while MSA patients experienced significant improvements in bradykinesia and action tremor. These findings underscore the variability in levodopa response among PSP and MSA patients and highlight the need for personalized treatment approaches in atypical parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>The landscape of pharmacological treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) has undergone significant transformations with the advent of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) targeting &amp;amp;beta;-Amyloid (A&amp;amp;beta;) accumulation, one of the hallmark pathologies of AD. The approval and market introduction of monoclonal antibodies mark the dawn of a new era in AD therapeutics as well. Furthermore, considerable progress has also been made in the development of new drugs targeting non-A&amp;amp;beta; and non-Tau protein pathways. These advancements are key in tackling the root causes of AD, offering hope for treatments that both relieve symptoms and slow disease progression, improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the advances in drug development and application for AD, including those currently in clinical trials and those already approved for the market to treat patients.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neural decoding methods are often limited by the performance of brain encoders, which map complex brain signals into a latent representation space of perception information. These brain encoders are constrained by the limited amount of paired brain and stimuli data available for training, making it challenging to learn rich neural representations. Methods: To address this limitation, we present a novel multimodal training approach using paired image and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to establish a brain masked autoencoder that learns the interactions between images and brain activities. Subsequently, we employ a diffusion model conditioned on brain data to decode realistic images. Results: Our method achieves high-quality decoding results in semantic contents and low-level visual attributes, outperforming previous methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, our method is applied to decode artificial patterns across region of interests (ROIs) to explore their functional properties. We not only validate existing knowledge concerning ROIs but also unveil new insights, such as the synergy between early visual cortex and higher-level scene ROIs, as well as the competition within the higher-level scene ROIs. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights for future directions in the field of neural decoding.</p>

	<p>Background: Mental health issues are increasingly prominent worldwide, posing significant threats to patients and deeply affecting their families and social relationships. Traditional diagnostic methods are subjective and delayed, indicating the need for an objective and effective early diagnosis method. Methods: To this end, this paper proposes a lightweight detection method for multi-mental disorders with fewer data sources, aiming to improve diagnostic procedures and enable early patient detection. First, the proposed method takes Electroencephalography (EEG) signals as sources, acquires brain rhythms through Discrete Wavelet Decomposition (DWT), and extracts their approximate entropy, fuzzy entropy, permutation entropy, and sample entropy to establish the entropy-based matrix. Then, six kinds of conventional machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Decision Tree (DT), are adopted for the entropy-based matrix to achieve the detection task. Their performances are assessed by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Concerning these experiments, three public datasets of schizophrenia, epilepsy, and depression are utilized for method validation. Results: The analysis of the results from these datasets identifies the representative single-channel signals (schizophrenia: O1, epilepsy: F3, depression: O2), satisfying classification accuracies (88.10%, 75.47%, and 89.92%, respectively) with minimal input. Conclusions: Such performances are impressive when considering fewer data sources as a concern, which also improves the interpretability of the entropy features in EEG, providing a reliable detection approach for multi-mental disorders and advancing insights into their underlying mechanisms and pathological states.</p>

	<p>Background: Intravenous thrombolysis is one of the most effective therapies for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), with urokinase offering a cost-effective alternative to newer agents like alteplase and tenecteplase, especially in resource-limited settings. Methods: This review provides a comprehensive overview of the application of intravenous thrombolysis with urokinase for AIS in the clinical practice of stroke management, including the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of urokinase compared to other thrombolytic agents. Results: Urokinase, a first-generation thrombolytic drug, is a non-specific plasminogen activator that offers a cost-effective alternative. It has been used in clinical practice for over two decades to improve neurological outcomes in patients with AIS if administered within 6 h of ictus. Numerous studies have indicated that urokinase remains a viable option for patients who cannot access alteplase or tenecteplase because of economic constraints, time window limitations, availability, or other reasons. Conclusions: In low- and middle-income countries, urokinase is a cost-effective alternative thrombolytic drug. High-level evidence-based medical research is therefore urgently needed to confirm that urokinase is not inferior to new-generation thrombolytic drugs, and to assess whether it may even be superior in some patient populations.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive deficits following ischemic stroke significantly impair quality of life, highlighting the need for effective interventions. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of extended N-Pep-12 dietary supplementation in enhancing cognitive recovery post-stroke. Methods: In this randomized, open-label, controlled study, 106 patients with supratentorial ischemic stroke were enrolled to receive either 90mg N-Pep-12 or no supplementation daily for 360 days and were followed-up for 360 days. Cognitive function and emotional well-being were assessed using established neuropsychological scales at baseline, 90 days, and 360 days post-stroke. Safety was monitored through adverse events and mortality rates. Results: Significant improvements were observed in the N-Pep-12 group compared to controls, particularly in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores at both 90 and 360 days, and in the Digit Symbol Coding scores at 360 days, suggesting enhanced cognitive recovery with extended N-Pep-12 supplementation. A linear regression for a composite outcome analysis at day 360 further confirmed the efficacy of N-Pep-12 in contributing to cognitive improvement. Safety profiles were favorable, with no significant adverse effects attributed to N-Pep-12. Conclusions: Extended dietary supplementation with N-Pep-12 appears to offer a safe and effective approach to support cognitive recovery in ischemic stroke survivors. These findings underscore the potential of the supplement as an add-on intervention for managing post-stroke cognitive impairments.</p>

	<p>Objectives. There is a significant correlation between EEG microstate and the neurophysiological basis of mental illness, brain state, and cognitive function. Given that the unclear relationship between network dynamics and different microstates, this paper utilized microstate, brain network, and control theories to understand the microstate characteristics of short-term memory task, aiming to mechanistically explain the most influential microstates and brain regions driving the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. We identified each microstate and analyzed the microstate abnormalities in schizophrenia patients during short-term memory tasks. Subsequently, the network dynamics underlying the primary microstates were studied to reveal the relationships between network dynamics and microstates. Finally, using control theory, we confirmed that the abnormal changes in brain state transitions in schizophrenia patients are driven by specific microstates and brain regions. Results. The frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly, but the left frontal lobe of microstate B increased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the easy-to-reach states. However, the frontal-occipital lobes activity of microstate D decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when the brain was moving toward the hard-to-reach states. Microstate D showed that the right-frontal activity had a higher priority than the left-frontal, but microstate B showed that the left-frontal priority decreased significantly in schizophrenia, when changes occur in the synchronization state of the brain. Conclusions. In conclusion, microstate D may be a biomarker candidate of brain abnormal activity during the states transitions in schizophrenia, and microstate B may represent a compensatory mechanism that maintains brain function and exchanges information with other brain regions. Microstate and brain network provide complementary perspectives on the neurodynamics, offering potential insights into brain function in health and disease.</p>

	<p>Background: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the evaluation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic traits in prison populations and offenders. Due to misleading headlines and highly publicized criminal cases, the belief that autistic individuals are more prone to commit crimes has spread among the general population, also leading to increasing research on this matter. Aims: In this context, this narrative review aimed to analyze the available scientific literature on the bi-directional link between ASD and criminal behaviors and to assess the key characteristics of eventual ASD offenders, including sociodemographic data, comorbidities, crime-related features, and interactions with the criminal justice system. Results: Our review highlighted that the available studies lack methodological rigor and present controversial results. Overall, the current state of research does not support any definitive correlation between ASD or autistic traits and the predisposition to engage in criminal conduct. Further studies are needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.</p>

	<p>The delivery of nutrients to the brain is provided by a 600 km network of capillaries and microvessels. Indeed, the brain is highly energy demanding and, among a total amount of 100 billion neurons, each neuron is located just 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 &amp;amp;mu;m from a capillary. This vascular network also forms part of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), which maintains the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s stable environment by regulating chemical balance, immune cell transport, and blocking toxins. Typically, brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) have low turnover, indicating a stable cerebrovascular structure. However, this structure can adapt significantly due to development, aging, injury, or disease. Temporary neural activity changes are managed by the expansion or contraction of arterioles and capillaries. Hypoxia leads to significant remodeling of the cerebrovascular architecture and pathological changes have been documented in aging and in vascular and neurodegenerative conditions. These changes often involve BMEC proliferation and the remodeling of capillary segments, often linked with local neuronal changes and cognitive function. Cerebrovascular plasticity, especially in arterioles, capillaries, and venules, varies over different time scales in development, health, aging, and diseases. Rapid changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) occur within seconds due to increased neural activity. Prolonged changes in vascular structure, influenced by consistent environmental factors, take weeks. Development and aging bring changes over months to years, with aging-associated plasticity often improved by exercise. Injuries cause rapid damage but can be repaired over weeks to months, while neurodegenerative diseases cause slow, varied changes over months to years. In addition, if animal models may provide useful and dynamic in vivo information about vascular plasticity, humans are more complex to investigate and the hypothesis of glymphatic system together with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques could provide useful clues in the future.</p>

	<p>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) has gained attention owing to its involvement in various physiological functions, such as sleep&amp;amp;ndash;awake, feeding, and emotion, with its analgesic role being particularly significant. It is described as the &amp;amp;ldquo;pain inhibitory nucleus&amp;amp;rdquo; in the brain. The DRN has diverse projections from hypothalamus, midbrain, and pons. In turn, the DRN is a major source of projections to diverse cortex, limbic forebrain thalamus, and the midbrain and contains highly heterogeneous neuronal subtypes. The activation of DRN neurons in mice prevents the establishment of neuropathic, chronic pain symptoms. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition neurons in the DRN are sufficient to establish pain phenotypes, including long-lasting tactile allodynia, that scale with the extent of stimulation, thereby promoting nociplastic pain. Recent progress has been made in identifying the neural circuits and cellular mechanisms in the DRN that are responsible for sensory modulation. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive review addressing the specific neuron types in the DRN involved in pain modulation. This review summarizes the function of specific cell types within DRN in the pain regulation, and aims to improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain regulation in the DRN, ultimately offering insights for further exploration.</p>

                Background Cogan’s syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular inflammation, vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and systemic vasculitis. Case Presentation We report a 28-year-old female who experienced decreased visual acuity and ocular redness one month after a COVID-19 infection, with ophthalmological signs linked to keratitis, uveitis and retinal vascularitis. Two weeks later, she developed vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden hearing loss, leading to a diagnosis of Cogan’s disease. The patient received corticosteroid therapy, resulting in regression of ophthalmological signs, but progressed to complete deafness. One month later, she presented with lymphocytic meningitis and high intracranial pressure, which improved under treatment. The patient later received cochlear implants. Objective This case report aims to highlight an atypical presentation of Cogan’s syndrome with neurological involvement following a COVID-19 infection. This case contributes to the limited literature on such presentations. Conclusion Our case is one of only two reported instances of Cogan’s syndrome presenting with neurological signs post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the rarity and complexity of this condition.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Backround/Objectives We investigated a technique that facilitates the coiling of a regular straight catheter (with integral stylet) behind the sciatic nerve in an ultrasound (US) regional anaesthesia simulator, and then applied our findings to a series of orthopedic-trauma patients. Methods We conducted a randomized study of two methods of perineural catheter advancement in a sciatic nerve block Blue Phantom simulator. Two groups of twenty catheters each (method A and method B) were evaluated under real-time ultrasound imaging. The needle in-plane/nerve in-short-axis technique was applied. In method A the catheter was advanced beyond the needle tip with the integral stylet extending along its entire length; in method B the catheter was advanced after its integral stylet was retracted by 6 cm, thus providing flexibility to the catheter’s distal end. Additionally, to assess the procedural effectiveness of method B coiling technique, a pilot study was conducted examining 25 perineural catheters coiled underneath the sciatic nerve in trauma-orthopaedic patients to document any displacement of catheters’ tip from their initial position (for 36 hours postoperatively). Results In the simulation study, method B led to a significantly higher percentage (18/20:90%) of coiled catheters than method A (3/20:15%). Two coiled catheters of method B were found kinked/obstructed. In our patients, after catheter insertion, the distal end of 2/25 (8%) coiled catheters was obstructed. One perineural catheter was dislodged. For the remaining 22 (88%) catheters, ultrasound imaging demonstrated that local anaesthetic infusion made contact with the sciatic nerve, indicating no displacement of the catheter’s distal end postoperatively. Conclusion Regular straight perineural catheters can be easily coiled if their integral stylet is partially retracted. This coiling method offers extra catheter length adjacent to the nerve structure which potentially mitigates catheter tip displacement.

                Background The Wheat Crop ontology was created to annotate phenotypic experimental data (i.e. field and greenhouse measurements standardized and integrated in databases). The Wheat Trait and Phenotype ontology was created to annotate information on wheat traits from the literature (i.e. text found in the abstract, results and discussion of scholarly articles). To enable seamless data retrieval on wheat traits from these complementary sources, the classes in the two ontologies have been aligned. Methods All pairs of ontology classes were examined and categorized in nine groups based on the nature of their relationships (e.g. equivalence, subsumption). General principles emerged from this process which were formalized into rules. The Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) representation was chosen to represent the mappings in RDF (Resource Description Framework), including their metadata such as creators, reviewers, and justification (including rules). Results The mapping dataset is publicly available. It covers 77% of the ontology classes. Most labels of the aligned classes differed significantly and required domain expertise for decisions, especially for traits related to biotic stress. Consequently, most mappings are close mappings rather than exact equivalents. Conclusions We present the end-to-end manual process used to select and represent mappings in SSSOM within the specific domain of wheat traits. We derive general lessons from the complex alignment process that extend beyond the specific case of these two ontologies and more generally apply to alignments of specialized ontologies for information retrieval purposes. This work demonstrates the relevance of SSSOM for representing these mappings.

                Background Over the past three decades, Portugal has invested significantly in doctoral training. However, there is a lack of up-to-date information on the success of scholarship holders in obtaining the degree or on their subsequent career paths. Methods This study analysed four cohorts of scholarship holders funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology between 1995 and 2012. The professional situation at different points in time after the Ph.D. (5, 10, 15 and 20 years) was studied. Results The success rate for obtaining the degree was 88%, which is comparable to other European countries for doctorates completed with funding over a period of 3-4 years. The average time to obtain the degree was 5.06 years. The time to degree was influenced by the scientific field, the nationality of the scholarship holder, and the location of the institution awarding the degree (in Portugal or abroad). The gender or age range of the scholarship recipients did not influence the time required for graduation. The analysis of the career and sector of activity of these graduates at different points in time after obtaining the Ph.D. revealed that approximately 60% percent of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities at some point in their career paths, but this percentage diminished from the oldest to the most recent cohorts, suggesting difficulties in retaining recent graduates in academia and in the private sector. In 2020, 63% of the graduates were engaged in R&D activities, and almost half were employed in higher education as teachers, researchers, or scholarship holders. Conclusions This study confirmed the challenges faced by doctoral graduates in integrating into non-academic job markets. On the other hand, it has demonstrated an efficient use of public funds, with high success rates and a time to degree that is within the average of other European countries.

Aedes mosquitoes, known as vectors of mosquito-borne diseases, pose significant risks to public health and safety. Modeling the population dynamics of Aedes mosquitoes requires comprehensive approaches due to the complex interplay between biological mechanisms and environmental factors. This study developed a model that couples differential equations with a neural network to simulate the dynamics of mosquito population, and explore the relationships between oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation. Data from nine cities in Guangdong Province spanning four years were used for model training and parameter estimation, while data from the remaining three cities were reserved for model validation. The trained model successfully simulated the mosquito population dynamics across all twelve cities using the same set of parameters. Correlation coefficients between simulated results and observed data exceeded 0.7 across all cities, with some cities surpassing 0.85, demonstrating high model performance. The coupled neural network in the model effectively revealed the relationships among oviposition rate, temperature, and precipitation, aligning with biological patterns. Furthermore, symbolic regression was used to identify the optimal functional expression for these relationships. By integrating the traditional dynamic model with machine learning, our model can adhere to specific biological mechanisms while extracting patterns from data, thus enhancing its interpretability in biology. Our approach provides both accurate modeling and an avenue for uncovering potential unknown biological mechanisms. Our conclusions can provide valuable insights into designing strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases and developing related prediction and early warning systems.

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the human microbiome. Despite this progress, challenges persist in comprehending the microbiome’s influence on disease, hindered by technical complexities in species classification, abundance estimation, and data compositionality. At the same time, the existence of macroecological laws describing the variation and diversity in microbial communities irrespective of their environment has been recently proposed using 16s data and explained by a simple phenomenological model of population dynamics. We here investigate the relationship between dysbiosis, i.e. in unhealthy individuals there are deviations from the “regular” composition of the gut microbial community, and the existence of macro-ecological emergent law in microbial communities. We first quantitatively reconstruct these patterns at the species level using shotgun data, and addressing the consequences of sampling effects and statistical errors on ecological patterns. We then ask if such patterns can discriminate between healthy and unhealthy cohorts. Concomitantly, we evaluate the efficacy of different statistical generative models, which incorporate sampling and population dynamics, to describe such patterns and distinguish which are expected by chance, versus those that are potentially informative about disease states or other biological drivers. A critical aspect of our analysis is understanding the relationship between model parameters, which have clear ecological interpretations, and the state of the gut microbiome, thereby enabling the generation of synthetic compositional data that distinctively represent healthy and unhealthy individuals. Our approach, grounded in theoretical ecology and statistical physics, allows for a robust comparison of these models with empirical data, enhancing our understanding of the strengths and limitations of simple microbial models of population dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012471">The role of training variability for model-based and model-free learning of an arbitrary visuomotor mapping</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Carlos A. Velázquez-Vargas, Nathaniel D. Daw, Jordan A. Taylor</p>

A fundamental feature of the human brain is its capacity to learn novel motor skills. This capacity requires the formation of vastly different visuomotor mappings. Using a grid navigation task, we investigated whether training variability would enhance the flexible use of a visuomotor mapping (key-to-direction rule), leading to better generalization performance. Experiments 1 and 2 show that participants trained to move between multiple start-target pairs exhibited greater generalization to both distal and proximal targets compared to participants trained to move between a single pair. This finding suggests that limited variability can impair decisions even in simple tasks without planning. In addition, during the training phase, participants exposed to higher variability were more inclined to choose options that, counterintuitively, moved the cursor away from the target while minimizing its actual distance under the constrained mapping, suggesting a greater engagement in model-based computations. In Experiments 3 and 4, we showed that the limited generalization performance in participants trained with a single pair can be enhanced by a short period of variability introduced early in learning or by incorporating stochasticity into the visuomotor mapping. Our computational modeling analyses revealed that a hybrid model between model-free and model-based computations with different mixing weights for the training and generalization phases, best described participants’ data. Importantly, the differences in the model-based weights between our experimental groups, paralleled the behavioral findings during training and generalization. Taken together, our results suggest that training variability enables the flexible use of the visuomotor mapping, potentially by preventing the consolidation of habits due to the continuous demand to change responses.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012412">Effect of aberrant fructose metabolism following SARS-CoV-2 infection on colorectal cancer patients’ poor prognosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jiaxin Jiang, Xiaona Meng, Yibo Wang, Ziqian Zhuang, Ting Du, Jing Yan</p>

Most COVID-19 patients have a positive prognosis, but patients with additional underlying diseases are more likely to have severe illness and increased fatality rates. Numerous studies indicate that cancer patients are more prone to contract SARS-CoV-2 and develop severe COVID-19 or even dying. In the recent transcriptome investigations, it is demonstrated that the fructose metabolism is altered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, cancer cells can use fructose as an extra source of energy for growth and metastasis. Furthermore, enhanced living conditions have resulted in a notable rise in fructose consumption in individuals’ daily dietary habits. We therefore hypothesize that the poor prognosis of cancer patients caused by SARS-CoV-2 may therefore be mediated through fructose metabolism. Using CRC cases from four distinct cohorts, we built and validated a predictive model based on SARS-CoV-2 producing fructose metabolic anomalies by coupling Cox univariate regression and lasso regression feature selection algorithms to identify hallmark genes in colorectal cancer. We also developed a composite prognostic nomogram to improve clinical practice by integrating the characteristics of aberrant fructose metabolism produced by this novel coronavirus with age and tumor stage. To obtain the genes with the greatest potential prognostic values, LASSO regression analysis was performed, In the TCGA training cohort, patients were randomly separated into training and validation sets in the ratio of 4: 1, and the best risk score value for each sample was acquired by lasso regression analysis for further analysis, and the fifteen genes <i>CLEC4A</i>, <i>FDFT1</i>, <i>CTNNB1</i>, <i>GPI</i>, <i>PMM2</i>, <i>PTPRD</i>, <i>IL7</i>, <i>ALDH3B1</i>, <i>AASS</i>, <i>AOC3</i>, <i>SEPINE1</i>, <i>PFKFB1</i>, <i>FTCD</i>, <i>TIMP1</i> and <i>GATM</i> were finally selected. In order to validate the model’s accuracy, ROC curve analysis was performed on an external dataset, and the results indicated that the model had a high predictive power for the prognosis prediction of patients. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the future targeted regulation of fructose metabolism in colorectal cancer patients, while simultaneously optimizing dietary guidance and therapeutic care for colorectal cancer patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
