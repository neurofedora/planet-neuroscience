              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00982">The Dynamics of Triple Interactions in Resting fMRI: Insights into Psychotic Disorders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain dynamically integrated and configured information to adapt to the environment. To capture these changes over time, dynamic second-order functional connectivity was typically used to capture transient brain patterns. However, dynamic second-order functional connectivity typically ignored interactions beyond pairwise relationships. To address this limitation, we utilized dynamic triple interactions to investigate multiscale network interactions in the brain. In this study, we evaluated a resting-state fMRI dataset that included individuals with psychotic disorders (PD). We first estimated dynamic triple interactions using resting-state fMRI. After clustering, we estimated cohort-specific and cohort-common states for controls (CN), schizophrenia (SZ), and schizoaffective disorder (SAD). From the cohort-specific states, we observed significant triple interactions, particularly among visual, subcortical, and somatomotor networks, as well as temporal and higher cognitive networks in SZ. In SAD, key interactions involved temporal networks in the initial state and somatomotor networks in subsequent states. From the cohort-common states, we observed that high-cognitive networks were primarily involved in SZ and SAD compared to CN. Furthermore, the most significant differences between SZ and SAD also existed in high-cognitive networks. In summary, we studied PD using dynamic triple interaction, the first time such an approach has been used to study PD. Our findings highlighted the significant potential of dynamic high-order functional connectivity, paving the way for new avenues in the study of the healthy and disordered human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00992">Correlation of Correlation Networks: High-Order Interactions in the Topology of Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand collective network behavior in the complex human brain, pairwise correlation networks alone are insufficient for capturing the high-order interactions that extend beyond pairwise interactions and play a crucial role in brain network dynamics. These interactions often reveal intricate relationships among multiple brain networks, significantly influencing cognitive processes. In this study, we explored the correlation of correlation networks and topological network analysis with resting-state fMRI to gain deeper insights into these higher-order interactions and their impact on the topology of brain networks, ultimately enhancing our understanding of brain function. We observed that the correlation of correlation networks highlighted network connections while preserving the topological structure of correlation networks. Our findings suggested that the correlation of correlation networks surpassed traditional correlation networks, showcasing considerable potential for applications in various areas of network science. Moreover, after applying topological network analysis to the correlation of correlation networks, we observed that some high-order interaction hubs predominantly occurred in primary and high-level cognitive areas, such as the visual and fronto-parietal regions. These high-order hubs played a crucial role in information integration within the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01164">Why Does the Cortex Have Such a Vast Storage Capacity?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.01164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity of long-term memory seems to be extremely large, capable of storing information spanning almost a lifetime. Why does it have such a vast capacity? Why are some memories so enduring? What is the actual physical form of long-term memory? In the movie Inside Out, it is depicted as individual orbs containing information. Is that really the case? Simply explaining this by saying that the cortex has many neurons, numerous neural connections, and complex electrochemical activity between them is not sufficient to answer these fundamental questions. We need to uncover the theory hidden behind these phenomena.In essence, a neural network is equivalent to a very large directed graph, with a massive number of nodes and directed connections. This paper posits that the physical form of long-term memory is a connected subgraph within this complex directed graph. This subgraph is capable of linking together the disparate fragments of the same event, spread across different sensory cortices, to form associations. This provides a physical realization of the engram theory. The robustness of the connected subgraph and the resources it consumes can explain various memory behaviors.Based on anatomical, brain imaging and electrophysiological evidence, this paper constructs a probabilistic connectivity model and uses theorems from graph theory to prove the ease of constructing connected subgraphs. Finally, it explains why the potential capacity for memory is immense.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01522">Are EEG functional networks really describing the brain? A comparison with other information-processing complex systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional networks representing human brain dynamics have become a standard tool in neuroscience, providing an accessible way of depicting the computation performed by the brain in healthy and pathological conditions. Yet, these networks share multiple characteristics with those representing other natural and man-made complex systems, leading to the question of whether they are actually capturing the uniqueness of the human brain. By resorting to a large set of data representing multiple financial, technological, social, and natural complex systems, and by relying on Deep Learning classification models, we show how they are highly similar. We specifically reach the conclusion that, under some general reconstruction methodological choices, it is as difficult to understand whether a network represents a human brain or a financial market, as to diagnose a major pathology. This suggests that functional networks are describing information processing mechanisms that are common across complex systems; but that are not currently defining the uniqueness of the human mind. We discuss the consequence of these findings for neuroscience and complexity science in general, and suggest future avenues for exploring this interesting topic.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00888">Topology-Aware Graph Augmentation for Predicting Clinical Trajectories in Neurocognitive Disorders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain networks/graphs derived from resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) help study underlying pathophysiology of neurocognitive disorders by measuring neuronal activities in the brain. Some studies utilize learning-based methods for brain network analysis, but typically suffer from low model generalizability caused by scarce labeled fMRI data. As a notable self-supervised strategy, graph contrastive learning helps leverage auxiliary unlabeled data. But existing methods generally arbitrarily perturb graph nodes/edges to generate augmented graphs, without considering essential topology information of brain networks. To this end, we propose a topology-aware graph augmentation (TGA) framework, comprising a pretext model to train a generalizable encoder on large-scale unlabeled fMRI cohorts and a task-specific model to perform downstream tasks on a small target dataset. In the pretext model, we design two novel topology-aware graph augmentation strategies: (1) hub-preserving node dropping that prioritizes preserving brain hub regions according to node importance, and (2) weight-dependent edge removing that focuses on keeping important functional connectivities based on edge weights. Experiments on 1, 688 fMRI scans suggest that TGA outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00986">Taking AI Welfare Seriously</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we argue that there is a realistic possibility that some AI systems will be conscious and/or robustly agentic in the near future. That means that the prospect of AI welfare and moral patienthood, i.e. of AI systems with their own interests and moral significance, is no longer an issue only for sci-fi or the distant future. It is an issue for the near future, and AI companies and other actors have a responsibility to start taking it seriously. We also recommend three early steps that AI companies and other actors can take: They can (1) acknowledge that AI welfare is an important and difficult issue (and ensure that language model outputs do the same), (2) start assessing AI systems for evidence of consciousness and robust agency, and (3) prepare policies and procedures for treating AI systems with an appropriate level of moral concern. To be clear, our argument in this report is not that AI systems definitely are, or will be, conscious, robustly agentic, or otherwise morally significant. Instead, our argument is that there is substantial uncertainty about these possibilities, and so we need to improve our understanding of AI welfare and our ability to make wise decisions about this issue. Otherwise there is a significant risk that we will mishandle decisions about AI welfare, mistakenly harming AI systems that matter morally and/or mistakenly caring for AI systems that do not.

                arXiv:2411.01092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether and how we can improve the cost efficiency of neuroimaging studies with well-tailored fMRI tasks. The comparative study is conducted using a novel network science-driven Bayesian connectome-based predictive method, which incorporates network theories in model building and substantially improves precision and robustness in imaging biomarker detection. The robustness of the method lays the foundation for identifying predictive power differential across fMRI task conditions if such difference exists. When applied to a clinically heterogeneous transdiagnostic cohort, we found shared and distinct functional fingerprints of neuropsychological outcomes across seven fMRI conditions. For example, emotional N-back memory task was found to be less optimal for negative emotion outcomes, and gradual-onset continuous performance task was found to have stronger links with sensitivity and sociability outcomes than with cognitive control outcomes. Together, our results show that there are unique optimal pairings of task-based fMRI conditions and neuropsychological outcomes that should not be ignored when designing well-powered neuroimaging studies.

                arXiv:2309.08916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between brain structure and function is critical for revealing the pathogenesis of brain disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is a great challenge to map brain structure-function connections due to various reasons. In this work, a bidirectional graph generative adversarial networks (BG-GAN) is proposed to represent brain structure-function connections. Specifically, by designing a module incorporating inner graph convolution network (InnerGCN), the generators of BG-GAN can employ features of direct and indirect brain regions to learn the mapping function between structural domain and functional domain. Besides, a new module named Balancer is designed to counterpoise the optimization between generators and discriminators. By introducing the Balancer into BG-GAN, both the structural generator and functional generator can not only alleviate the issue of mode collapse but also learn complementarity of structural and functional features. Experimental results using ADNI datasets show that the both the generated structure connections and generated function connections can improve the identification accuracy of AD. More importantly, based the proposed model, it is found that the relationship between brain structure and function is not a complete one-to-one correspondence. Brain structure is the basis of brain function. The strong structural connections are almost accompanied by strong functional connections.

Presenting these models with the same text as the participants allows to identify brain areas where there is a significant correlation between the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series and the ones predicted by the models' artificial neurons. One intriguing finding from these studies is that they have revealed highly symmetric bilateral activation patterns, somewhat at odds with the well-known left lateralization of language processing. Here, we report analyses of an fMRI dataset where we manipulate the complexity of large language models, testing 28 pretrained models from 8 different families, ranging from 124M to 14.2B parameters. First, we observe that the performance of models in predicting brain responses follows a scaling law, where the fit with brain activity increases linearly with the logarithm of the number of parameters of the model (and its performance on natural language processing tasks). Second, although this effect is present in both hemispheres, it is stronger in the left than in the right hemisphere. Specifically, the left-right difference in brain correlation follows a scaling law with the number of parameters. This finding reconciles computational analyses of brain activity using large language models with the classic observation from aphasic patients showing left hemisphere dominance for language.

                arXiv:2406.16749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed variability.

Abstract: In this paper, we utilize a dataset composed of one-dimensional powder diffraction patterns to train Convolutional Neural Networks for predicting space groups. We used a new strategy to design the dataset, the diffraction pattern was calculated based the lattice parameters and the Extinction Laws, instead of the traditional strategy that generating it from the crystallographic database. This paper demonstrated that the new strategy is more reasonable than the traditional one. As a result, the model trained on the cubic and tetragonal training set from the newly designed dataset achieves prediction accuracy that matches the theoretical maximums calculated based on Extinction Laws. This result demonstrates that the machine learning based prediction can be physically reasonable and reliable. Additionally, the model trained on our new designed dataset shows better generalization capability than the one trained on a traditionally designed dataset.

                arXiv:2411.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained enormous popularity in the field of artificial intelligence due to their low power consumption. However, the majority of SNN methods directly inherit the structure of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), usually leading to sub-optimal model performance in SNNs. To alleviate this problem, we integrate Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method and propose Multi-Attention Differentiable Architecture Search (MA-DARTS) to directly automate the search for the optimal network structure of SNNs. Initially, we defined a differentiable two-level search space and conducted experiments within micro architecture under a fixed layer. Then, we incorporated a multi-dimensional attention mechanism and implemented the MA-DARTS algorithm in this search space. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification compared to other methods under the same parameters with 94.40% accuracy on CIFAR10 dataset and 76.52% accuracy on CIFAR100 dataset. Additionally, we monitored and assessed the number of spikes (NoS) in each cell during the whole experiment. Notably, the number of spikes of the whole model stabilized at approximately 110K in validation and 100k in training on datasets.

                arXiv:2411.01922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memetic algorithms are techniques that orchestrate the interplay between population-based and trajectory-based algorithmic components. In particular, some memetic models can be regarded under this broad interpretation as a group of autonomous basic optimization algorithms that interact among them in a cooperative way in order to deal with a specific optimization problem, aiming to obtain better results than the algorithms that constitute it separately. Going one step beyond this traditional view of cooperative optimization algorithms, this work tackles deep meta-cooperation, namely the use of cooperative optimization algorithms in which some components can in turn be cooperative methods themselves, thus exhibiting a deep algorithmic architecture. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that such models can be considered as an efficient alternative to other traditional forms of cooperative algorithms. To validate this claim, different structural parameters, such as the communication topology between the agents, or the parameter that influences the depth of the cooperative effort (the depth of meta-cooperation), have been analyzed. To do this, a comparison with the state-of-the-art cooperative methods to solve a specific combinatorial problem, the Tool Switching Problem, has been performed. Results show that deep models are effective to solve this problem, outperforming metaheuristics proposed in the literature.

                arXiv:2411.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) problem is a difficult combinatorial problem with a large number of symmetries, which add complexity to its resolution. In this paper, we propose a dual (integer) problem representation that serves as an alternative to the classical binary formulation of the problem. We attack this problem incrementally: firstly, we propose basic algorithms (i.e. local search techniques and genetic algorithms) intended to work separately on the two different search spaces (i.e. binary and integer); secondly, we propose two hybrid schemes: an integrative approach (i.e. a memetic algorithm) and a collaborative model in which the previous methods work in parallel, occasionally exchanging information. Three distinct two-dimensional structures are proposed as communication topology among the algorithms involved in the collaborative model, as well as a number of migration and acceptance criteria for sending and receiving data. An empirical analysis comparing a large number of instances of our schemes (with algorithms possibly working on different search spaces and with/without symmetry breaking methods) shows that some of these algorithms can be considered the state of the art of the metaheuristic methods applied to finding BIBDs. Moreover, our cooperative proposal is a general scheme from which distinct algorithmic variants can be instantiated to handle symmetrical optimisation problems. For this reason, we have also analysed its key parameters, thereby providing general guidelines for the design of efficient/robust cooperative algorithms devised from our proposal.

Abstract: Rational design of next-generation functional materials relied on quantitative predictions of their electronic structures beyond single building blocks. First-principles quantum mechanical (QM) modeling became infeasible as the size of a material grew beyond hundreds of atoms. In this study, we developed a new computational tool integrating fragment-based graph neural networks (FBGNN) into the fragment-based many-body expansion (MBE) theory, referred to as FBGNN-MBE, and demonstrated its capacity to reproduce full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (FD-PES) for hierarchic chemical systems with manageable accuracy, complexity, and interpretability. In particular, we divided the entire system into basic building blocks (fragments), evaluated their single-fragment energies using a first-principles QM model and attacked many-fragment interactions using the structure-property relationships trained by FBGNNs. Our development of FBGNN-MBE demonstrated the potential of a new framework integrating deep learning models into fragment-based QM methods, and marked a significant step towards computationally aided design of large functional materials.

Abstract: Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has become a growing field in on-device processing for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, capitalizing on AI algorithms that are optimized for their low complexity and energy efficiency. These algorithms are designed to minimize power and memory footprints, making them ideal for the constraints of IoT devices. Within this domain, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) stand out as a cutting-edge solution for TinyML, owning to their event-driven processing paradigm which offers an efficient method of handling dataflow. This paper presents a novel SNN architecture based on the 1st Order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model to efficiently deploy vision-based ML algorithms on TinyML systems. A hardware-friendly LIF design is also proposed, and implemented on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. To evaluate the proposed model, a collision avoidance dataset is considered as a case study. The proposed SNN model is compared to the state-of-the-art works and Binarized Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) as a baseline. The results show the proposed approach is 86% more energy efficient than the baseline.

                arXiv:2411.02001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local learning, which trains a network through layer-wise local targets and losses, has been studied as an alternative to backpropagation (BP) in neural computation. However, its algorithms often become more complex or require additional hyperparameters because of the locality, making it challenging to identify desirable settings in which the algorithm progresses in a stable manner. To provide theoretical and quantitative insights, we introduce the maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) in the infinite-width limit for two representative designs of local targets: predictive coding (PC) and target propagation (TP). We verified that $\mu$P enables hyperparameter transfer across models of different widths. Furthermore, our analysis revealed unique and intriguing properties of $\mu$P that are not present in conventional BP. By analyzing deep linear networks, we found that PC's gradients interpolate between first-order and Gauss-Newton-like gradients, depending on the parameterization. We demonstrate that, in specific standard settings, PC in the infinite-width limit behaves more similarly to the first-order gradient. For TP, even with the standard scaling of the last layer, which differs from classical $\mu$P, its local loss optimization favors the feature learning regime over the kernel regime.

Abstract: Time-variant standard Sylvester-conjugate matrix equations are presented as early time-variant versions of the complex conjugate matrix equations. Current solving methods include Con-CZND1 and Con-CZND2 models, both of which use ode45 for continuous model. Given practical computational considerations, discrete these models is also important. Based on Euler-forward formula discretion, Con-DZND1-2i model and Con-DZND2-2i model are proposed. Numerical experiments using step sizes of 0.1 and 0.001. The above experiments show that Con-DZND1-2i model and Con-DZND2-2i model exhibit different neural dynamics compared to their continuous counterparts, such as trajectory correction in Con-DZND2-2i model and the swallowing phenomenon in Con-DZND1-2i model, with convergence affected by step size. These experiments highlight the differences between optimizing sampling discretion errors and space compressive approximation errors in neural dynamics.

                arXiv:2303.09935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All machine learning algorithms use a loss, cost, utility or reward function to encode the learning objective and oversee the learning process. This function that supervises learning is a frequently unrecognized hyperparameter that determines how incorrect outputs are penalized and can be tuned to improve performance. This paper shows that training speed and final accuracy of neural networks can significantly depend on the loss function used to train neural networks. In particular derivative values can be significantly different with different loss functions leading to significantly different performance after gradient descent based Backpropagation (BP) training. This paper explores the effect on performance of using new loss functions that are also convex but penalize errors differently compared to the popular Cross-entropy loss. Two new classification loss functions that significantly improve performance on a wide variety of benchmark tasks are proposed. A new loss function call smooth absolute error that outperforms the Squared error, Huber and Log-Cosh losses on datasets with significantly many outliers is proposed. This smooth absolute error loss function is infinitely differentiable and more closely approximates the absolute error loss compared to the Huber and Log-Cosh losses used for robust regression.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02901">Efficient Vectorized Backpropagation Algorithms for Training Feedforward Networks Composed of Quadratic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2310.02901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher order artificial neurons whose outputs are computed by applying an activation function to a higher order multinomial function of the inputs have been considered in the past, but did not gain acceptance due to the extra parameters and computational cost. However, higher order neurons have significantly greater learning capabilities since the decision boundaries of higher order neurons can be complex surfaces instead of just hyperplanes. The boundary of a single quadratic neuron can be a general hyper-quadric surface allowing it to learn many nonlinearly separable datasets. Since quadratic forms can be represented by symmetric matrices, only $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ additional parameters are needed instead of $n^2$. A quadratic Logistic regression model is first presented. Solutions to the XOR problem with a single quadratic neuron are considered. The complete vectorized equations for both forward and backward propagation in feedforward networks composed of quadratic neurons are derived. A reduced parameter quadratic neural network model with just $ n $ additional parameters per neuron that provides a compromise between learning ability and computational cost is presented. Comparison on benchmark classification datasets are used to demonstrate that a final layer of quadratic neurons enables networks to achieve higher accuracy with significantly fewer hidden layer neurons. In particular this paper shows that any dataset composed of $\mathcal{C}$ bounded clusters can be separated with only a single layer of $\mathcal{C}$ quadratic neurons.

                arXiv:2409.09210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meta-heuristic algorithmic development has been a thrust area of research since its inception. In this paper, a novel meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Olive Ridley Survival (ORS), is proposed which is inspired from survival challenges faced by hatchlings of Olive Ridley sea turtle. A major fact about survival of Olive Ridley reveals that out of one thousand Olive Ridley hatchlings which emerge from nest, only one survive at sea due to various environmental and other factors. This fact acts as the backbone for developing the proposed algorithm. The algorithm has two major phases: hatchlings survival through environmental factors and impact of movement trajectory on its survival. The phases are mathematically modelled and implemented along with suitable input representation and fitness function. The algorithm is analysed theoretically. To validate the algorithm, fourteen mathematical benchmark functions from standard CEC test suites are evaluated and statistically tested. Also, to study the efficacy of ORS on recent complex benchmark functions, ten benchmark functions of CEC-06-2019 are evaluated. Further, three well-known engineering problems are solved by ORS and compared with other state-of-the-art meta-heuristics. Simulation results show that in many cases, the proposed ORS algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The sub-optimal behavior of ORS in some recent benchmark functions is also observed.

                <p>Adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) serotypes vary in how effectively they express genes across different cell types and brain regions. Here we report a systematic comparison of the AAV serotypes 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, and the directed evolution derived AAVrg, in the inferior colliculus (IC) and cerebellum. The AAVs were identical apart from their different serotypes, each having a synapsin promotor and expressing GFP (AAV-hSyn-GFP). Identical titers and volumes were injected into the IC and cerebellum of adult male and female mice, and brains were sectioned and imaged 2&nbsp;weeks later. Transduction efficacy, anterograde labeling of axonal projections, and retrograde labeling of somata were characterized and compared across serotypes. Cell-type tropism was assessed by analyzing the morphology of the GFP-labeled neurons in the cerebellar cortex. In both the cerebellum and IC, AAV1 expressed GFP in more cells, labeled a larger volume, and produced significantly brighter labeling than all other serotypes, indicating superior transgene expression. AAV1 labeled more Purkinje cells, unipolar brush cells, and molecular layer interneurons than the other serotypes, while AAV2 labeled a greater number of granule cells. These results provide guidelines for the use of AAVs as gene delivery tools in these regions.</p>

                Background Physical activity plays a crucial role in the health and well-being of older adults, positively influencing various aspects of their quality of life. This study aims to explore the relationship between physical activity and body segments, as well as the risk indices of non-communicable chronic diseases in healthy elderly individuals. Methods The analyzed variables include weekly physical activity, the Postural Correction Index (PCI), measured using the system developed by Portland State University (PSU), and predictors of non-communicable chronic diseases assessed through body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio. Results The results reveal a moderate positive relationship between physical activity and the PCI (r=0.45; p≤0.05), with significant correlations in specific components of the PCI, such as thoracic depression (r=0.51; p<0.01), anteroposterior shoulder alignment (r=0.51; p<0.01), and upper back (r=0.53; p<0.001). Conclusions It is concluded that physical activity has a significant positive impact on the posture of older adults, particularly in the trunk, contributing 40% to the improvement of PCI components. The PCI values obtained, exceeding 84.67 in men and 82.67 in women according to the PSU evaluation, underscore the effectiveness of physical activity in postural correction and the prevention of issues associated with chronic diseases.

                The health crisis caused by COVID-19 impacted the dynamics of the work of health professionals, specifically in nursing professionals who were aware of the essential need for care and a safe environment to reduce in-hospital risks and mortality indicators. The study aimed to analyze the scientific evidence on the lessons learned during the health crisis in the work of the nursing professional, and the analysis of scientific articles published between 2020 and 2023 in the Scopus databases, obtaining a total of 30 articles. The findings show that there is a need to adopt health contingency policies to respond to health crises, as well as to establish and apply coping strategies in health professionals to avoid the impact on their mental health. Additionally, it is important to recognize their role in society. In conclusion, contingency policies and coping strategies must be developed to ensure the safety and well-being of nursing professionals and prevent the impact on their mental health during health crises like the one caused by COVID-19. Furthermore, it is important to recognize and value the fundamental role of nursing professionals in disease prevention and care in society and continue to work on developing policies and support strategies for health professionals to ensure their safety and well-being during health crises.

                Background Glioblastoma is a highly infiltrative, currently incurable brain cancer. To date, translation of novel therapies for glioblastoma from the laboratory into clinical trials has relied heavily on in vitro cell culture and murine (subcutaneous and orthotopic) xenograft models using cells derived from the main bulk of patient tumours. However, it is the residual cells left-behind after surgery that are responsible for disease progression and death in the clinic. A lack of substantial improvements in patient survival for decades suggests commonly used murine xenograft models, a key step before clinical trials, do not reflect the biology of residual disease in patients. Methods To address this, we have developed the ‘Sheffield Protocol’ to generate ex vivo models that reflect both resected, and post-surgical residual disease from the same patient. The protocol leverages parallel derivation of inherently treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) from ‘core’ and distant ‘edge’ regions through careful macrodissection of a large en bloc specimen, such as from a partial lobectomy for tumour, followed by tissue dissociation and propagation in serum-free media. Opportunistic en bloc specimen use can liberate the most distant infiltrative cells feasibly accessible from living patients. Results We provide an example illustrating that resected and residual disease models represent spatially divergent tumour subpopulations harbouring distinct transcriptomic and cancer stem cell marker expression profiles. We also introduce the ‘Sheffield Living Biobank’ of glioma models (SLB) that incorporates over 150 GSC lines from 60+ patients, including 44+ resected and residual models, which are available for academic use via MTA. Conclusions These models provide a novel tool to reduce animal xenograft usage by improving candidate drug triage in early preclinical studies and directly replacing animal studies for some therapies that are post-Phase 1+ clinical trial for other cancers/conditions to, ultimately, deliver more effective treatments for post-surgical residual disease in glioblastoma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-6/v2?src=rss">An international, cross-sectional survey of preprint attitudes among biomedical researchers [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Preprints are scientific manuscripts that are made available on open-access servers but are not yet peer-reviewed. Although preprints are becoming more prevalent, uptake is not optimal. Understanding researchers’ opinions and attitudes toward preprints is valuable to optimize their use. Understanding knowledge gaps and researchers’ attitudes toward preprinting can assist stakeholders, such as journals, funding agencies, and universities, to use preprints more effectively. Here, we aimed to collect perceptions and behaviours regarding preprints across an international sample of biomedical researchers. Methods Corresponding authors of articles published in biomedical research journals were identified from a random sample of journals from the MEDLINE database. Their names and email addresses were extracted to invite them to our anonymous, cross-sectional survey, which asked participants questions about their knowledge, attitudes, and opinions regarding preprinting. Results The survey was completed by 730 respondents providing a response rate of 3.20% and demonstrated a wide range of attitudes and opinions about preprints with authors from various disciplines and career stages worldwide. Most respondents were familiar with the concept of preprints but most had not previously posted one. The lead author of the project and journal policy had the greatest impact on decisions to post a preprint, whereas employers/research institutes had the least impact. Supporting open science practices was the highest ranked incentive, while increasing authors’ visibility was the highest ranked motivation for publishing preprints. Conclusions Although many biomedical researchers recognize the benefits of preprints, there is still hesitation among others to engage in this practice. This may be due to the general lack of peer review of preprints and little enthusiasm from external organizations such as journals, funding agencies, and universities. Future work is needed to determine optimal ways to improve researchers’ attitudes through modifications to current preprint systems and policies.

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hemodialysis patients are frequently colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to severe infections with high mortality rates. However, little is known about transition from non-colonization to colonization or bacteremia over time. The aim was to analyze the behavior of S. aureus colonization, identifying the probability of transition from non-colonized to colonized state or bacteremia, and the influence of specific covariates. Methods The study was conducted in a dialysis unit associated with a tertiary care hospital in Medellín between October 2017 and October 2019. An initial measurement was taken to evaluate S. aureus colonization, and follow-up measurements were performed 2 and 6 months later. Bacteremia evolution was monitored for 12 months. A two-state recurrent continuous-time Markov model was constructed to model transition dynamics from non-colonization to S. aureus colonization in hemodialysis patients. Subsequently, the model was applied to a third state of bacteremia. Results Of 178 patients on hemodialysis, 30.3% were colonized by S. aureus. Transition intensity from non-colonization to colonization was three times higher (0.21; CI: 0.14-0.29) than from colonization to non-colonization (0.07; CI: 0.05-0.11). The colonization risk increased in patients with previous infections (HR: 2.28; CI: 0.78-6.68), hospitalization (HR: 1.29; CI: 0.56-2.99) and antibiotics consumption (HR: 1.17; CI: 0.53-2.58). Mean non-colonized state duration was 10.9 months, while in the colonized state was 5.2 months. In the 3-state model, it was found that patients colonized were more likely to develop S. aureus infection (13.9%). Conclusion A more likely transition from non-colonization to colonization was found, which increases with factors such as previous infection. In addition, the development of bacteremia was more likely in colonized than in non-colonized patients. These results underline the importance of surveillance and proper management of S. aureus colonization to prevent serious complications, such as bacteremia, and improve prognosis in this vulnerable population.

                Background This paper discusses the lack of references that comprehensively describe the changes in universities owing to the ideology of neoliberalism. This research also discusses how a university maintains its function and identity when the great wave of neoliberalism massively erodes collegiality as the original philosophy of the university through a case study of the neoliberalism ideology on higher education. This study also provides a comprehensive framework for higher education management and governance changes. Methods We selected all retrieved sources based on the keywords and analyzed all the documents we obtained. This study obtained data from Scopus retrieved on October 27, 2023, using the following keywords: (TITLE-ABS-KEY ("collegiality") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("change management") OR TITLE-ABS-KEY ("neolibelism")) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY ("higher education"). This study utilized bibliometric analysis to ensure a structured review of the literature on collegiality, change management, and neoliberalism in higher education. Results The findings show that organizational management, leadership, education, technology, curriculum, innovation, organizational change, decision-making, and human beings are significant trajectories of neoliberalism in higher education. Conclusions This study offers other constructs for accelerating leadership success in higher education. This relates to how change leadership can navigate changes resulting from neoliberal ideology.

The increasing availability of enzyme turnover number measurements from experiments and of turnover number predictions from deep learning models prompts the use of these enzyme parameters in precise metabolic engineering. Yet, there is no computational approach that allows the prediction of metabolic engineering strategies that rely on the modification of turnover numbers. It is also unclear if modifications of turnover numbers without alterations in the host’s transcriptional regulatory machinery suffice to increase the production of chemicals of interest. Here, we present a constraint-based modeling approach, termed Overcoming Kinetic rate Obstacles (OKO), that uses enzyme-constrained metabolic models to predict <i>in silico</i> strategies to increase the production of a given chemical, while ensuring specified cell growth. We demonstrate that the application of OKO to enzyme-constrained metabolic models of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> results in strategies that can at least double the production of over 40 compounds with little penalty to growth. Interestingly, we show that the overproduction of compounds of interest does not entail only an increase in the values of turnover numbers. Lastly, we demonstrate that a refinement of OKO, allowing also for manipulation of enzyme abundance, facilitates the usage of the available compendia and deep learning models of turnover numbers in the design of precise metabolic engineering strategies. Our results expand the usage of genome-scale metabolic models toward the identification of targets for protein engineering, allowing their direct usage in the generation of innovative metabolic engineering designs for various biotechnological applications.

                <p>by Alireza Rezvani-Sharif, Hadi Lioe, Steven K. Dower, Matthias Pelzing, Con Panousis, Dalton J. E. Harvie, Ineke L. Muir</p>
Background <p>The kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) is a complex biochemical pathway that plays a crucial role in regulating several physiological processes, including inflammation, coagulation, and blood pressure. Dysregulation of the KKS has been associated with several pathological conditions such as hereditary angioedema (HAE), hypertension, and stroke. Developing an accurate quantitative model of the KKS may provide a better understanding of its role in health and disease and facilitate the rapid and targeted development of effective therapies for KKS-related disorders.</p> Objectives <p>Here, we present a novel, detailed mechanistic model of the plasma KKS, elucidating the processes of Factor XII (FXII) activation, the kallikrein feedback loop, cleavage of high molecular weight kininogen leading to bradykinin (BK) production, and the impact of inhibitors.</p> Methods <p>The model incorporates both surface and solution-phase reactions of all proteins in the KKS, describing how binding site concentration affects the rate of surface reactions. The model was calibrated and validated using a variety of published and in-house experimental datasets, which encompass a range of dextran sulphate (DXS) concentrations to initiate contact activation and various KKS inhibitors to block bradykinin production.</p> Results <p>Our mathematical model showed that a trace amount of activated FXII is required for subsequent FXII activation. The model also reveals a bell-shaped curve relationship between the activation of the KKS and the number of DXS surface binding sites. Simulations of BK generation in healthy and HAE plasma demonstrated the impact of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1inh) deficiency via increased peak BK levels and accelerated formation in HAE plasma. The efficacy of KKS inhibitors, such as CSL312, ecallantide, and C1inh, was also evaluated, with CSL312 showing the most potent inhibition of BK generation.</p> Conclusions <p>The present model represents a valuable framework for studying the intricate interactions within the plasma KKS and provides a better understanding of the mechanism of action of various KKS-targeted therapies.</p>

                <p>by David Kappel, Christian Tetzlaff</p>

Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. To show this, we developed a mathematical framework, in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule, which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. In addition, this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.

                <p>by Robert A. Barber, Jingyi Yang, Chenyue Yang, Oonagh Barker, Tim Janicke, Joseph A. Tobias</p>

Sexual selection, one of the central pillars of evolutionary theory, has powerful effects on organismal morphology, behaviour, and population dynamics. However, current knowledge about geographical variation in this evolutionary mechanism and its underlying drivers remains highly incomplete, in part because standardised data on the strength of sexual selection is sparse even for well-studied organisms. Here, we use information on mating systems—including the incidence of polygamy and extra-pair paternity—to estimate the intensity of sexual selection in 10,671 (>99.9%) bird species distributed worldwide. We show that avian sexual selection varies latitudinally, peaking at higher latitudes, although the gradient is reversed in the world’s most sexually selected birds—specialist frugivores—which are strongly associated with tropical forests. Phylogenetic models further reveal that the strength of sexual selection is explained by temperature seasonality coupled with a suite of climate-associated factors, including migration, diet, and territoriality. Overall, these analyses suggest that climatic conditions leading to short, intense breeding seasons, or highly abundant and patchy food resources, increase the potential for polygamy in birds, driving latitudinal gradients in sexual selection. Our findings help to resolve longstanding debates about spatial variation in evolutionary mechanisms linked to reproductive biology and also provide a comprehensive species-level data set for further studies of selection and phenotypic evolution in the context of global climatic change.

                <p>by Safia A. Essien, Ivanshi Ahuja, George T. Eisenhoffer</p>

Apoptotic cells can signal to neighboring cells to stimulate proliferation and compensate for cell loss to maintain tissue homeostasis. While apoptotic cell-derived extracellular vesicles (AEVs) can transmit instructional cues to mediate communication with neighboring cells, the molecular mechanisms that induce cell division are not well understood. Here, we show that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (Mif)-containing AEVs regulate compensatory proliferation via ERK signaling in epithelial stem cells of larval zebrafish. Time-lapse imaging showed efferocytosis of AEVs from dying epithelial stem cells by healthy neighboring stem cells. Proteomic and ultrastructure analysis of purified AEVs identified Mif localization on the AEV surface. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic mutation of Mif, or its cognate receptor CD74, decreased levels of phosphorylated ERK and compensatory proliferation in the neighboring epithelial stem cells. Disruption of Mif activity also caused decreased numbers of macrophages patrolling near AEVs, while depletion of the macrophage lineage resulted in a reduced proliferative response by the epithelial stem cells. We propose that AEVs carrying Mif directly stimulate epithelial stem cell repopulation and guide macrophages to cell non-autonomously induce localized proliferation to sustain overall cell numbers during tissue maintenance.

                Background Interrupted time-series (ITS) studies are commonly used to examine the effects of interventions targeted at populations. Suppression of ITS studies or results within these studies, known as reporting bias, has the potential to bias the evidence-base on a particular topic, with potential consequences for healthcare decision-making. Therefore, we aim to determine whether there is evidence of reporting bias among ITS studies. Methods We will conduct a search for published protocols of ITS studies and reports of their results in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase up to December 31, 2022. We contact the authors of the ITS studies to seek information about their study, including submission status, data for unpublished results, and reasons for non-publication or non-reporting of certain outcomes. We will examine if there is evidence of publication bias by examining whether time-to-publication is influenced by the statistical significance of the study’s results for the primary research question using Cox proportional hazards regression. We will examine whether there is evidence of discrepancies in outcomes by comparing those specified in the protocols with those in the reports of results, and we will examine whether the statistical significance of an outcome’s result is associated with how completely that result is reported using multivariable logistic regression. Finally, we will examine discrepancies between protocols and reports of results in the methods by examining the data collection processes, model characteristics, and statistical analysis methods. Discrepancies will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Discussion These findings will inform systematic reviewers and policymakers about the extent of reporting biases and may inform the development of mechanisms to reduce such biases.

                Background While a laminectomy is often mandated for spinal canal stenosis, foraminal stenosis may account for pain and functional limitations instead of central canal issues. Targeted treatment directed at this specific region may enhance patient outcomes. Methods Retrospective observational study of a total of 30 patients with previous decompression laminectomies for lumbar spinal canal stenosis were operated upon for foraminotomies from November 2012 to November 2018. The surgeries were clinically done, and EMG-confirmed nerve root compressions were treated with exact decompression techniques according to the anatomy and pathology in each case. Additionally, a systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines was conducted, utilizing Scopus and PubMed databases to identify studies on reoperation rates after decompression with or without fusion in lumbar spinal stenosis. Results The results were fearsome post-operatively, trying significant improvement in pain, functional status, and walking distance. Pain reduction was achieved in 80% of patients by an increase in the Carnovsky rating scale with evidence of improved pain reduction and walking endurance; this points to minimal resulting complications of one complete case of foot drop and three infective cases managed conservatively. It was shown in the systematic review that fusion surgeries lowered the rates of reoperations at the index level but increased those for adjacent segment reoperations, while decompression alone had higher index-level reoperation rates due to recurrent stenosis. Conclusion Most of the emphasis on foraminal stenosis, rather than traditional laminectomies, significantly reduces postoperative pain and improves functional outcomes. This strategy brings a promising alternative to the management of recurrent symptoms in patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98524">Nuclear translocation of SIRT4 mediates deacetylation of U2AF2 to modulate renal fibrosis through alternative splicing-mediated upregulation of CCN2</a></h4>

              
                TGF-β stimulates CCN2 expression which in turn amplifies TGF-β signaling. This process promotes extracellular matrix production and accelerates the pathological progression of fibrotic diseases. Alternative splicing plays an important role in multiple disease development, while U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 2 (U2AF2) is an essential factor in the early steps of pre-mRNA splicing. However, the molecular mechanism underlying abnormal <i>CCN2</i> expression upon TGF-β stimulation remains unclear. This study elucidates that SIRT4 acts as a master regulator for CCN2 expression in response to TGF-β by modulating U2AF2-mediated alternative splicing. Analyses of renal biopsy specimens from patients with CKD and mouse fibrotic kidney tissues revealed marked nuclear accumulation of SIRT4. The tubulointerstitial fibrosis was alleviated by global deletion or tubular epithelial cell (TEC)-specific knockout of <i>Sirt4</i>, and aggravated by adeno-associated virus-mediated SIRT4 overexpression in TECs. Furthermore, SIRT4 was found to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm through the BAX/BAK pore under TGF-β stimulation. In the cytoplasm, TGF-β activated the ERK pathway and induced the phosphorylation of SIRT4 at Ser36, which further promoted its interaction with importin α1 and subsequent nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, SIRT4 was found to deacetylate U2AF2 at K413, facilitating the splicing of CCN2 pre-mRNA to promote CCN2 protein expression. Importantly, exosomes containing anti-SIRT4 antibodies were found to effectively mitigate the UUO-induced kidney fibrosis in mice. Collectively, these findings indicated that SIRT4 plays a role in kidney fibrosis by regulating CCN2 expression via the pre-mRNA splicing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98458">Cryo-electron tomographic investigation of native hippocampal glutamatergic synapses</a></h4>

              
                Chemical synapses are the major sites of communication between neurons in the nervous system and mediate either excitatory or inhibitory signaling. At excitatory synapses, glutamate is the primary neurotransmitter and upon release from presynaptic vesicles, is detected by postsynaptic glutamate receptors, which include ionotropic AMPA and NMDA receptors. Here, we have developed methods to identify glutamatergic synapses in brain tissue slices, label AMPA receptors with small gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and prepare lamella for cryo-electron tomography studies. The targeted imaging of glutamatergic synapses in the lamella is facilitated by fluorescent pre- and postsynaptic signatures, and the subsequent tomograms allow for the identification of key features of chemical synapses, including synaptic vesicles, the synaptic cleft, and AuNP-labeled AMPA receptors. These methods pave the way for imaging brain regions at high resolution, using unstained, unfixed samples preserved under near-native conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93673">Reassessing the substrate specificities of the major Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan hydrolases lysostaphin and LytM</a></h4>

              
                Orchestrated action of peptidoglycan (PG) synthetases and hydrolases is vital for bacterial growth and viability. Although the function of several PG synthetases and hydrolases is well understood, the function, regulation, and mechanism of action of PG hydrolases characterised as lysostaphin-like endopeptidases have remained elusive. Many of these M23 family members can hydrolyse glycyl-glycine peptide bonds and show lytic activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> whose PG contains a pentaglycine bridge, but their exact substrate specificity and hydrolysed bonds are still vaguely determined. In this work, we have employed NMR spectroscopy to study both the substrate specificity and the bond cleavage of the bactericide lysostaphin and the <i>S. aureus</i> PG hydrolase LytM. Yet, we provide substrate-level evidence for the functional role of these enzymes. Indeed, our results show that the substrate specificities of these structurally highly homologous enzymes are similar, but unlike observed earlier both LytM and lysostaphin prefer the <span class="small-caps">D</span>-Ala-Gly cross-linked part of mature peptidoglycan. However, we show that while lysostaphin is genuinely a glycyl-glycine hydrolase, LytM can also act as a D-alanyl-glycine endopeptidase.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92737">Cell-autonomous targeting of arabinogalactan by host immune factors inhibits mycobacterial growth</a></h4>

              
                Deeper understanding of the crosstalk between host cells and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) provides crucial guidelines for the rational design of novel intervention strategies against tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacteria possess a unique complex cell wall with arabinogalactan (AG) as a critical component. AG has been identified as a virulence factor of Mtb which is recognized by host galectin-9. Here, we demonstrate that galectin-9 directly inhibited mycobacterial growth through AG-binding property of carbohydrate-recognition domain 2. Furthermore, IgG antibodies with AG specificity were detected in the serum of TB patients. Based on the interaction between galectin-9 and AG, we developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) screening assay and identified AG-specific mAbs which profoundly inhibit Mtb growth. Mechanistically, proteomic profiling and morphological characterizations revealed that AG-specific mAbs regulate AG biosynthesis, thereby inducing cell wall swelling. Thus, direct AG-binding by galectin-9 or antibodies contributes to protection against TB. Our findings pave the way for the rational design of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for TB control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96155">Age-related decline in blood-brain barrier function is more pronounced in males than females in parietal and temporal regions</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a pivotal role in protecting the central nervous system (CNS), and shielding it from potential harmful entities. A natural decline of BBB function with aging has been reported in both animal and human studies, which may contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders. Limited data also suggest that being female may be associated with protective effects on BBB function. Here, we investigated age and sex-dependent trajectories of perfusion and BBB water exchange rate (kw) across the lifespan in 186 cognitively normal participants spanning the ages of 8–92 years old, using a non-invasive diffusion-prepared pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DP-pCASL) MRI technique. We found that the pattern of BBB kw decline with aging varies across brain regions. Moreover, results from our DP-pCASL technique revealed a remarkable decline in BBB kw beginning in the early 60 s, which was more pronounced in males. In addition, we observed sex differences in parietal and temporal regions. Our findings provide in vivo results demonstrating sex differences in the decline of BBB function with aging, which may serve as a foundation for future investigations into perfusion and BBB function in neurodegenerative and other brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96957">TMEM16 and OSCA/TMEM63 proteins share a conserved potential to permeate ions and phospholipids</a></h4>

              
                The calcium-activated TMEM16 proteins and the mechanosensitive/osmolarity-activated OSCA/TMEM63 proteins belong to the Transmembrane Channel/Scramblase (TCS) superfamily. Within the superfamily, OSCA/TMEM63 proteins, as well as TMEM16A and TMEM16B, are thought to function solely as ion channels. However, most TMEM16 members, including TMEM16F, maintain an additional function as scramblases, rapidly exchanging phospholipids between leaflets of the membrane. Although recent studies have advanced our understanding of TCS structure–function relationships, the molecular determinants of TCS ion and lipid permeation remain unclear. Here, we show that single mutations along the transmembrane helix (TM) 4/6 interface allow non-scrambling TCS members to permeate phospholipids. In particular, this study highlights the key role of TM 4 in controlling TCS ion and lipid permeation and offers novel insights into the evolution of the TCS superfamily, suggesting that, like TMEM16s, the OSCA/TMEM63 family maintains a conserved potential to permeate ions and phospholipids.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90930">Difficulty in artificial word learning impacts targeted memory reactivation and its underlying neural signatures</a></h4>

              
                Sleep associated memory consolidation and reactivation play an important role in language acquisition and learning of new words. However, it is unclear to what extent properties of word learning difficulty impact sleep associated memory reactivation. To address this gap, we investigated in 22 young healthy adults the effectiveness of auditory targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during non-rapid eye movement sleep of artificial words with easy and difficult to learn phonotactical properties. Here, we found that TMR of the easy words improved their overnight memory performance, whereas TMR of the difficult words had no effect. By comparing EEG activities after TMR presentations, we found an increase in slow wave density independent of word difficulty, whereas the spindle-band power nested during the slow wave up-states – as an assumed underlying activity of memory reactivation – was significantly higher in the easy/effective compared to the difficult/ineffective condition. Our findings indicate that word learning difficulty by phonotactics impacts the effectiveness of TMR and further emphasize the critical role of prior encoding depth in sleep associated memory reactivation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97883">Coupling of saccade plans to endogenous attention during urgent choices</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms that willfully direct attention to specific locations in space are closely related to those for generating targeting eye movements (saccades). However, the degree to which the voluntary deployment of attention to a location necessarily activates a corresponding saccade plan remains unclear. One problem is that attention and saccades are both automatically driven by salient sensory events; another is that the underlying processes unfold within tens of milliseconds only. Here, we use an urgent task design to resolve the evolution of a visuomotor choice on a moment-by-moment basis while independently controlling the endogenous (goal-driven) and exogenous (salience-driven) contributions to performance. Human participants saw a peripheral cue and, depending on its color, either looked at it (prosaccade) or looked at a diametrically opposite, uninformative non-cue (antisaccade). By varying the luminance of the stimuli, the exogenous contributions could be cleanly dissociated from the endogenous process guiding the choice over time. According to the measured time courses, generating a correct antisaccade requires about 30 ms more processing time than generating a correct prosaccade based on the same perceptual signal. The results indicate that saccade plans elaborated during fixation are biased toward the location where attention is endogenously deployed, but the coupling is weak and can be willfully overridden very rapidly.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95846">Perturbations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry alter expression of ribosomal proteins and key components of the MAPK signaling pathways</a></h4>

              
                Protein synthesis plays a major role in homeostasis and when dysregulated leads to various pathologies including cancer. To this end, imbalanced expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) is not only a consequence but also a driver of neoplastic growth. eIF3 is the largest, multi-subunit translation initiation complex with a modular assembly, where aberrant expression of one subunit generates only partially functional subcomplexes. To comprehensively study the effects of eIF3 remodeling, we contrasted the impact of eIF3d, eIF3e or eIF3h depletion on the translatome of HeLa cells using Ribo-seq. Depletion of eIF3d or eIF3e, but not eIF3h reduced the levels of multiple components of the MAPK signaling pathways. Surprisingly, however, depletion of all three eIF3 subunits increased MAPK/ERK pathway activity. Depletion of eIF3e and partially eIF3d also increased translation of TOP mRNAs that encode mainly ribosomal proteins and other components of the translational machinery. Moreover, alterations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry were often associated with changes in translation of mRNAs containing short uORFs, as in the case of the proto-oncogene MDM2 and the transcription factor ATF4. Collectively, perturbations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry exert specific effect on the translatome comprising signaling and stress-related transcripts with complex 5’ UTRs that are implicated in homeostatic adaptation to stress and cancer.

">Antigen-Specific T Cell Receptor Discovery for Treating Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Background: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a frequently fatal disease of the central nervous system caused by JC virus (JCV). Survival is dependent on early diagnosis and ability to re-establish anti-viral T cell immunity. Adoptive transfer of polyomavirus-specific T cells has shown promise; however, there are no readily available HLA-matched anti-viral T cells to facilitate rapid treatment. Objective: Identify epitopes of the JCV major capsid protein VP1 that elicit an immune response in the context of human leukocyte antigen allele A*02:01 (HLA-A2) and isolate cognate T cell receptors (TCRs) from healthy donors. Evaluate individual VP1-specific TCRs for their capacity to be expressed in T cells and clear JCV in vitro. Methods: PBMCs from HLA-A2+ healthy donors were stimulated with peptide libraries tiled across the JCV VP1 protein. Multiple rounds of stimulation were performed to identify the antigens that induced the largest expansion and CD8+ T cell response (measured as INFg;, TNFa;, CD137, and CD69 expression). High-affinity, antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were isolated based on intensity of tetramer binding for downstream single-cell TCR sequencing. Candidate TCRs were selected based on tetramer binding affinity and activation assays. Promising TCRs were introduced into the T cell genome via viral transduction for in vitro validation including peptide-pulsed K562 cells and astrocyte cells, and JCV-infected astrocytes. Results: Four conserved JCV VP1 epitopes (amino acids 100-108, 251-259, 253-262, and 274-283) presented by HLA-A2 were identified. VP1(100-108) consistently elicited the highest level of IFNg; production from multiple donors and this peptide is in a highly conserved region of VP1. We next identified fourteen high avidity TCRs specific for VP1(100-108). When virally transduced into primary human T cells, seven of these TCRs demonstrated specific binding to VP1(100-108):HLA-A2 tetramers, and four showed increased IFNg; response when incubated with peptide. Primary CD8+ T cells expressing two of these TCRs cleared both HLA-A2 positive K562 cells and HLA-A2 positive SVG astrocyte cell line presenting exogenously added VP1 peptide at a range of E:T ratios. In addition, both TCR-transduced T cell populations effectively lysed JCV-infected astrocytes. Conclusions: We identified JCV VP1 epitopes that are immunogenic in the context of HLA-A2 MHC-I, including epitopes that have not been previously described. The VP1(100-108) epitope was used to isolate HLA-A2-restricted TCRs. When cloned into primary human CD8+ T cells, these TCRs recognized VP1 (100-108)-presenting targets, and the transduced T cells conferred cytotoxic activity and eliminated K562 and astrocyte cells displaying the VP1(100-108) peptide and not sham peptide, as well as JCV-infected astrocytes. Taken together, these data suggest that JCV VP1-specific TCRs could be appealing therapeutics for HLA-A2+ individuals with PML in whom intrinsic T cell immunity cannot be rescued.

">Suppression of Huntington's Disease Somatic Instability by Transcriptional Repression and Direct CAG Repeat Binding</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) arises from a CAG expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene beyond a critical threshold. A major thrust of current HD therapeutic development is lowering levels of mutant HTT mRNA (mHTT) and protein (mHTT) with the aim of reducing the toxicity of these product(s). Human genetic data also support a key role for somatic instability (SI) in HTT's CAG repeat -- whereby it lengthens with age in specific somatic cell types -- as a key driver of age of motor dysfunction onset. Thus, an attractive HD therapy would address both mHTT toxicity and SI, but to date the relationship between SI and HTT lowering remains unexplored. Here, we investigated multiple therapeutically-relevant HTT-lowering modalities to establish the relationship between HTT lowering and SI in HD knock-in mice. We find that repressing transcription of mutant Htt (mHtt) provides robust protection from SI, using diverse genetic and pharmacological approaches (antisense oligonucleotides, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, the Lac repressor, and virally delivered zinc finger transcriptional repressor proteins, ZFPs). However, we find that small interfering RNA (siRNA), a potent HTT-lowering treatment, lowers HTT levels without influencing SI and that SI is also normal in mice lacking 50% of total HTT levels, suggesting HTT levels, per se, do not modulate SI in trans. Remarkably, modified ZFPs that bind the mHtt locus, but lack a repressive domain, robustly protect from SI, despite not reducing HTT mRNA or protein levels. These results have important therapeutic implications in HD, as they suggest that DNA-targeted HTT-lowering treatments may have significant advantages compared to other HTT-lowering approaches, and that interaction of a DNA-binding protein and HTT's CAG repeats may provide protection from SI while sparing HTT expression.

">Chimeric music reveals an interaction of pitch and time in electrophysiological signatures of music encoding</a></h4>

              
                Pitch and time are the essential dimensions defining musical melody. Recent electrophysiological studies have explored the neural encoding of musical pitch and time by leveraging probabilistic models of their sequences, but few have studied how the features might interact. This study examines these interactions by introducing "chimeric music," which pairs two distinct melodies, and exchanges their pitch contours and note onset-times to create two new melodies, thereby distorting musical pattern while maintaining the marginal statistics of the original pieces' pitch and temporal sequences. Through this manipulation, we aimed to dissect the music processing and the interaction between pitch and time. Employing the temporal response function (TRF) framework, we analyzed the neural encoding of melodic expectation and musical downbeats in participants with varying levels of musical training. Our findings revealed differences in the encoding of melodic expectation between original and chimeric stimuli in both dimensions, with a significant impact of musical experience. This suggests that the structural violation due to decoupling the pitch and temporal structure affect expectation processing. In our analysis of downbeat encoding, we found an enhanced neural response when participants heard a note that aligned with the downbeat during music listening. In chimeric music, responses to downbeats were larger when the note was also a downbeat in the original music that provided the pitch sequence, indicating an effect of pitch structure on beat perception. This study advances our understanding of the neural underpinnings of music, emphasizing the significance of pitch-time interaction in the neural encoding of music.

">dArc1 controls sugar reward valuation in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                The Arc genes, which include Drosophila Arc1 and Arc2 (dArc), evolved from Ty3 retrotransposons and encode proteins that form virus-like capsids. These capsids enable a novel form of intercellular communication by transferring RNAs between cells. However, the specific neuronal circuits and brain processes Arc intercellular signaling regulates remain unknown. Here, we show that loss of both dArc genes in Drosophila melanogaster enhances associative learning in an appetitive conditioning paradigm, where flies associate an odor with sugar rewards. This increased learning performance arises from an increased valuation of sugar rewards: unlike wild-type flies, dArc-/- flies form abnormally strong associations even when the sugar reward is small or has no caloric value. We found that the gamma5-dopaminergic neurons of the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster, which encode the positive valence of sugar rewards, show heightened activity in response to sucrose in dArc-/- flies. We further show that the learning phenotype of dArc-/- flies depends on the formation of capsids, underscoring a direct role for capsid-mediated Arc signaling in sugar valuation. Our findings establish dArc genes as critical regulators of reward valuation in D. melanogaster, acting through a non-cell autonomous mechanism that relies on capsid-mediated communication between cells.

">Modulating Neurotoxic Effects of Prenatal Chlorpyrifos Exposure Through Probiotic and Vitamin D Gestational Supplementation: Unexpected Effects on Neurodevelopment and Sociability</a></h4>

              
                Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in sociability and communication. Prenatal exposure to Chlorpyrifos has been associated with autism-like behaviors in preclinical models. Interest has grown in the gut-brain axis and the role of microbiota modulation through dietetic supplementation to reduce this ASD-like phenotype. This study examines the effects of prenatal CPF exposure in Wistar Rats and assesses the potential of gestational probiotic and vitamin D supplementation to mitigate these effects in offspring. CPF exposure significantly impaired sociability in adolescence, and supplementation did not reverse these deficits. However, in control animals, supplementation induced neurodevelopmental changes, including alterations in metabolic status, the pattern of expression of ASD-related genes, the regulation of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors, and the GABAergic system in the brain. Additionally, supplementation accelerated overall development, increased ultrasonic vocalization emission and modified the typical responses to social novelty. CPF exposure blocked most of these effects at both behavioral and molecular levels. While supplementation did not block CPF-induced impairments, CPF exposure altered the observed effects of supplementation in controls, possibly indicating shared molecular mechanisms. These findings highlight the need for further research into the safety of probiotic and vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.

">Multi-omics analysis in mouse primary cortical neurons reveals complex positive and negative biological interactions between constituent compounds in Centella asiatica</a></h4>

              
                Background: A water extract of the Ayurvedic plant Centella asiatica (CAW) improves cognitive function in mouse models of aging and Alzheimers disease, and affects dendritic arborization, mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress in mouse primary neurons. Triterpenes (TT) and caffeoylquinic acids (CQA) are constituents associated with these bioactivities of CAW although little is known about how interactions between these compounds contribute to the plants therapeutic benefit. Methods: Mouse primary cortical neurons were treated with CAW, or equivalent concentrations of four TT combined, eight CQA combined, or these twelve compounds combined (TTCQA). Treatment effects on the cell transcriptome (18,491 genes) and metabolome (192 metabolites) relative to vehicle control were evaluated using RNAseq and metabolomic analyses respectively. Results: Extensive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were seen with all treatments, as well as evidence of interactions between compounds. Notably many DEGs seen with TT treatment were not observed in the TTCQA condition, possibly suggesting CQA reduced the effects of TT. Moreover, additional gene activity seen with CAW as compared to TTCQA indicate the presence of additional compounds in CAW that further modulate TTCQA interactions. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified 4 gene co-expression modules altered by treatments that were associated with extracellular matrix organization, fatty acid metabolism, cellular response to stress and stimuli, and immune function. Compound interaction patterns were seen at the eigengene level in these modules. Interestingly, in metabolomics analysis, the TTCQA treatment saw the highest number of changes in individual metabolites (20), followed by CQA (15), then TT (8) and finally CAW (3). WGCNA analysis found two metabolomics modules with significant eigenmetabolite differences for TT and CQA, and possible compound interactions at this level. Conclusions: Four gene expression modules and two metabolite modules were altered by the four types of treatments applied. This methodology demonstrated the existence of both negative and positive interactions between TT, CQA and additional compounds found in CAW on the transcriptome and metabolome of mouse primary cortical neurons.

">Predicting neuronal firing from calcium imaging using a control theoretic approach</a></h4>

              
                Two-photon calcium imaging has become a powerful tool to explore the functions of neurons and the connectivity of their circuitry. Frequently, fluorescent calcium indicators are taken as a direct measure of neuronal activity. These indicators, however, are slow relative to behavior, obscuring functional relationships between an animal's movements and the true neuronal activity. As a consequence, the firing rate of a neuron is a more meaningful metric. Converting calcium imaging data to the firing of a neuron is nontrivial. State of the art methods depend largely on neural networks or non-mechanistic processes, which may yield acceptable correlations between calcium dynamics and the frequency at which a neuron fires, but do not illuminate the underlying chemical exchanges within the neuron or require significant data to be trained on. Leveraging modeling frameworks from chemical reaction networks (CRN) coupled with modern control architectures, a new algorithm is presented based off of fully deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This framework utilizes model predictive control to challenge state of the art correlation scores while retaining the interpretability that comes inherent with a model. Moreover, these computations can be done in real time, thus enabling online experimentation informed by neuronal firing rates. To demonstrate the use cases of this architecture, it is tested on a ground truth dataset courtesy of the spikefinder challenge. Finally, the predictive power of the methodology put forward here is underscored by demonstrating its ability to aid in the creation of novel indicators utilized in two-photon imaging.

">Systematic effects of retinotopic biases and category selectivity across human occipitotemporal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The organization of human visual cortex has traditionally been studied using two different methods: retinotopic mapping and category-selectivity mapping. Retinotopic mapping has identified a large number of systematic maps of the visual field, while category-selectivity mapping has identified clusters of neural populations that reliably respond more strongly to specific image categories such as objects, faces, scenes and body parts compared to other categories. While early investigations seemed to suggest that these two organizing principles were largely separated in the brain, with retinotopic maps in posterior visual cortex and category-selective regions in anterior visual cortex, recent work shows that category-selective regions overlap with retinotopic maps, giving rise to spatial visual field biases within these regions. Here, we collected fMRI responses whilst performing both retinotopic and category mapping within the same participants, allowing detailed comparison of neural tuning for space and category at the single voxel level. We use these data to evaluate two previous proposals of how retinotopic biases relate to category-selectivity: 1) complementary quadrant biases (upper vs. lower contralateral visual field) inherited from early visual cortex explain the presence of paired regions selective for the same category across lateral and ventral occipitotemporal cortex (lOTC, vOTC); and 2) eccentricity biases (center vs. periphery of the visual field) explain the presence of selectivity for different categories, specifically differentiating face- versus scene-selectivity within the ventral surface. Confirming and extending previous findings for a comprehensive set of face-, scene-, object, and place-selective regions of interest, we provide robust evidence that category-selective regions do not sample visual space uniformly, exhibiting systematic biases towards either the upper or lower field (all category regions) and center vs. periphery (face vs. place regions). Consistent with 1), we find that quadrant biases differ systematically between lateral and ventral OTC, with lateral regions showing systematic lower field biases and ventral regions showing upper field biases, differentiating regions selective for the same category in terms of their spatial bias. However, contrary to 2), we find that eccentricity tuning does not strongly predict the strength of face- or scene category-selectivity in a given voxel. Specifically, highly face-selective voxels are not solely confined to the fovea, and while most scene-selective voxels show peripheral tuning, highly scene-selective voxels actually show strong foveal tuning, particularly in anterior medial-ventral cortex. Collectively, these results demonstrate that spatial biases in category-selective cortex are widespread and robust, whilst also suggesting there is no simple relation between spatial tuning and category-selectivity.

">Mechanical load conditions the spectrin network to `run-on' proteolysis and promotes early onset neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                The correct homeostasis of the neuronal cytoskeleton and its dynamics is important for health and disease. Forces constantly act on the neurons in our body, leading to subtle axonal deformations and length changes. The spectrin cytoskeleton is known as a key player that protects neurons against mechanical damage. How the spectrin cytoskeleton changes with age and how it influences mechanoprotection in aging animals is not well understood. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we show that age causes a loss of proprioception during the first few days of adulthood in Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans via spectrin unfolding, loss of mechanical tension and degradation of the spectrin cytoskeleton. Guided by a proteomic screen to identify potential spectrin binding partners, we found that this early-onset neurodegeneration can be suppressed in clp-1 Calpain mutants and by targeted expression of an engineered chaperone derived from human alphaB-crystallin. Our data suggest that the spectrin cytoskeleton is sensitized to proteolytic damage by calcium-sensitive proteases when mechanical stresses conspires with high-calcium concentrations as in proprioceptive signaling. These results may have implications for the etiology of diseases in which high calcium dynamics and mechanical stress coincide.

">Perisomatic Synaptic Targeting by Cholecystokinin-Basket Interneurons through NrCAM and Ankyrin B</a></h4>

              
                The perisomatic region of cortical pyramidal neurons (PNs) integrates local and long-range inputs and regulates firing.This domain receives GABAergic inputs from cholecystokinin (CCK)- and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing basket cells (BCs) but how synaptic contacts are established is unclear. Neuron-glial related cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM) is a homophilic transmembrane protein that binds the scaffold protein Ankyrin B. Here we show that NrCAM and Ankyrin B mediate perisomatic synaptic contact between CCK-BCs and PNs in mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC). Immunolabeling of CCK-BC terminals for vesicular glutamate transporter-3 (VGlut3) or vesicular glutamate transporter (VGAT) revealed a significant decrease in CCK-BC synaptic puncta on PN soma in NrCAM-null mice, however no decrease in PV-BC puncta, or cell loss. VGlut3+ CCK-BC puncta were also decreased by Ankyrin B deletion from PNs in Nex1Cre-ERT2:Ank2flox/flox:EGFP mice. A novel CCK-BC reporter mouse expressing tdTomato (tdT) at the Synuclein-{gamma} (Sncg) locus showed NCAM localized to presynaptic Sncg+ CCK-BCs, as well as to postsynaptic PN soma of WT mice. Results implicate NrCAM homophilic interactions and Ankyrin B binding with development of inhibitory connectivity between CCK-BCs and excitatory neurons of the PFC.

">Flow parsing as causal source separation: A computational model for concurrent retrieval of object and self-motion information from optic flow</a></h4>

              
                Optic flow, the retinal pattern of motion that is experience during self-motion contains information about one's direction of heading. If the visual scene contains other moving objects optic flow becomes a combination of self-motion and independent object motion. The global pattern due to self-motion is locally confounded, and the locally restricted object flow is the sum of components due to these different causal sources of motion. Nonetheless, humans are able to retrieve information from such flow accurately, including the direction of heading and the scene-relative motion of an object. One way to handle such complex flow is flow parsing, a process speculated to allow the brain's sensitivity to optic flow to separate the causal sources of retinal motion in information due to self-motion and information due to object motion. In a computational model that retrieves object and self-motion information from optic flow, we implemented such a process of causal separation based on heading likelihood maps, whose distributions indicate the consistency of parts of the flow with self-motion alone. The flow parsing allows for concurrent estimation of heading, the detection and localization of and independently moving object, and the estimation of scene-relative motion of that object. We developed a paradigm that allows the model to perform all the different estimations while systematically varying how the object contributes to the flow field. Simulations of that paradigm showed that the model replicates many aspects of human performance, including the dependence of heading estimation on object speed and how different object movements bias that estimation. Regarding object detection and motion estimation, the model's results fit human behavioral data, the latter even for flow of reduced quality.

">Brain-wide population activity during reaching integrates action-mediated goal expectation</a></h4>

              
                Large scale recordings have revealed that neurons encoding motor and non-motor variables are highly distributed across the brain. While these neurons generate population level dynamics during spontaneous behavior, it remains unclear how these latent subspaces relate to the simultaneous motor and cognitive demands during ongoing goal-directed behavior. Here, we show that continuously anticipated action outcome, in addition to movement, drives ubiquitous latent dynamics during goal-directed movements. We used multiple Neuropixels probes to simultaneously record spiking activity from cortical and subcortical regions during a reaching task in head-fixed mice. Task-related population dynamics covaried within a common latent subspace across regions and was conserved across recording days and animals. These latent dynamics preceded movement onset and were modulated by reach distance and reward availability. Furthermore, their temporal progression continuously scaled with the timing of reward consumption and their activity decreased afterwards, despite ongoing stereotypical re-reaches. Our findings thus provide evidence for a brain-wide latent subspace for continuous representation of action-mediated proximity to goal, which could provide the basis for ubiquitous temporal difference learning based on predicted action outcome.

">A modiolar-pillar gradient in auditory-nerve dendritic length: a novel post-synaptic contribution to dynamic range?</a></h4>

              
                Auditory-nerve fibers (ANFs) from a given cochlear region can vary in threshold sensitivity by up to 60 dB, corresponding to a 1000-fold difference in stimulus level, although each fiber innervates a single inner hair cell (IHC) via a single synapse. ANFs with high-thresholds also have low spontaneous rates (SRs) and synapse on the side of the IHC closer to the modiolus, whereas the low-threshold, high-SR fibers synapse on the side closer to the pillar cells. Prior biophysical work has identified modiolar-pillar differences in both pre- and post-synaptic properties, but a comprehensive explanation for the wide range of sensitivities remains elusive. Here, in guinea pigs, we used immunostaining for several neuronal markers, including Caspr, a key protein in nodes of Ranvier, to reveal a novel modiolar-pillar gradient in the location of the first ANF heminodes, presumed to be the site of the spike generator, just outside the sensory epithelium. Along the cochlea, from apex to base, the unmyelinated terminal dendrites of modiolar ANFs were 2 - 4 times longer than those of pillar ANFs. This modiolar-pillar gradient in dendritic length, coupled with the 2 - 4 fold smaller caliber of modiolar dendrites seen in prior single-fiber labeling studies, suggests there could be a large difference in the number of length constants between the synapse and the spike initiation zone for low- vs high-SR fibers. The resultant differences in attenuation of post-synaptic potentials propagating along these unmyelinated dendrites could be a key contributor to the observed range of threshold sensitivities among ANFs.

                The recent development of small, wearable, magnetic field sensors allow for the investigation of biomagnetic fields with a flexibility previously unavailable. We test models to describe how current flow in the spinal cord and thorax gives rise to measurable magnetic fields outside the torso. We compare various open-access volume conductor models, in order to select the most parsimonious and accurate descriptor of the magnetic fields due to source current in the spinal cord. We find that fields produced due to current flow along the superior-inferior axis of the cord are relatively insensitive to the choice of volume conductor model. However, fields produced by current flow in predominantly left-right or anterior-posterior direction are significantly attenuated by the presence of bone in the forward model. Furthermore, volume conductors with bone demonstrate larger differences in field topographies for nearby sources compared to bone-free models. These findings suggest that precise modelling of spinal cord location and surrounding vertebrae will be important a-priori knowledge going forward.

">F2,6BP restores mitochondrial genome integrity in Huntingtons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Several reports have indicated that impaired mitochondrial function contributes to the development and progression of Huntingtons disease (HD). Mitochondrial genome damage, particularly DNA strand breaks (SBs), is a potential cause for its compromised functionality. We have recently demonstrated that the activity of polynucleotide kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP), a critical DNA end-processing enzyme, is significantly reduced in the nuclear extract of HD patients due to lower level of a metabolite fructose-2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP), a biosynthetic product of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), leading to persistent DNA SBs with 3-phosphate termini, refractory to subsequent steps for repair completion. PNKP also plays a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity. In this report, we provide evidence that both PFKFB3 and F2,6BP, an allosteric modulator of glycolysis, are also present in the mitochondria. Notably, the level of F2,6BP, a cofactor of PNKP, is significantly decreased due to the degradation of PFKFB3 in the mitochondrial extract of HD patients brain. PNKP activity is thus severely decreased in the mitochondrial extract; however, addition of F2,6BP restored PNKP activity. Moreover, supplementation of F2,6BP in HD mouse striatal neuronal cells restored mitochondrial genome integrity and partially restored mitochondrial membrane potential and prevented pathogenic aggregate formation. We observed similar restoration of mitochondrial genome integrity in HD drosophila supplemented with F2,6BP. Our findings, therefore, suggest that F2,6BP or its structural analog hold promise as a therapeutic for restoring both nuclear and mitochondrial genome integrity and thereby of organismal health.

">Repetitive magnetic stimulation induces plasticity of excitatory synapses through cooperative pre- and postsynaptic activity.</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a widely used non-invasive technique in research and clinical settings. Despite its success, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying TMS-induced changes in the brain remain incompletely understood. Current protocols are largely heuristic, based on system-level observations. This study employed in vitro repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS) in mouse brain tissue cultures, combined with computational modeling to develop an experimentally validated approach for predicting TMS effects. Unlike electrical or optogenetic stimulation, rTMS uniquely enhances plasticity by activating both pre- and postsynaptic neurons, with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) playing a crucial role. Our simulations accurately predicted the frequency-dependent effects of rTMS, providing a critical step towards developing robust, validated tools that will enhance the precision and effectiveness of TMS applications across both research and clinical settings.

">MINT: a toolbox for the analysis of multivariate neural information coding and transmission</a></h4>

              
                Information theory has deeply influenced the conceptualization of brain information processing and is a mainstream framework for analyzing how neural networks in the brain process information to generate behavior. Information theory tools have been initially conceived and used to study how information about sensory variables is encoded by the activity of small neural populations. However, recent multivariate information theoretic advances have enabled addressing how information is exchanged across areas and used to inform behavior. Moreover, its integration with dimensionality-reduction techniques has enabled addressing information encoding and communication by the activity of large neural populations or many brain areas, as recorded by multichannel activity measurements in functional imaging and electrophysiology. Here, we provide a Multivariate Information in Neuroscience Toolbox (MINT) that combines these new methods with statistical tools for robust estimation from limited-size empirical datasets. We demonstrate the capabilities of MINT by applying it to both simulated and real neural data recorded with electrophysiology or calcium imaging, but all MINT functions are equally applicable to other brain-activity measurement modalities. We highlight the synergistic opportunities that combining its methods afford for reverse engineering of specific information processing and flow between neural populations or areas, and for discovering how information processing functions emerge from interactions between neurons or areas. MINT works on Linux, Windows and macOS operating systems, is written in MATLAB (requires MATLAB version 2018b or newer) and depends on 5 native MATLAB toolboxes. The calculation of one possible way to compute information redundancy requires the installation and compilation of C files (made available by us also as pre-compiled files). MINT is freely available at https://github.com/panzerilab/MINT with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.13998526 and operates under a GNU GPLv3 license.

">A global dopaminergic learning rate enables adaptive foraging across many options</a></h4>

              
                In natural environments, animals must efficiently allocate their choices across multiple concurrently available resources when foraging, a complex decision-making process not fully captured by existing models. To understand how rodents learn to navigate this challenge we developed a novel paradigm in which untrained, water-restricted mice were free to sample from six options rewarded at a range of deterministic intervals and positioned around the walls of a large (~2m) arena. Mice exhibited rapid learning, matching their choices to integrated reward ratios across six options within the first session. A reinforcement learning model with separate states for staying or leaving an option and a dynamic, global learning rate was able to accurately reproduce mouse learning and decision-making. Fiber photometry recordings revealed that dopamine in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC), but not dorsomedial striatum (DMS), more closely reflected the global learning rate than local error-based updating. Altogether, our results provide insight into the neural substrate of a learning algorithm that allows mice to rapidly exploit multiple options when foraging in large spatial environments.

">Pharmacological depletion of microglia protects against alcohol-induced corticolimbic neurodegeneration during intoxication in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Excessive alcohol use damages the brain, especially corticolimbic regions such as the hippocampus and rhinal cortices, leading to learning and memory problems. While neuroimmune reactivity is hypothesized to underly alcohol-induced damage, direct evidence of the causative role of microglia, brain-resident immune cells, in this process is lacking. Here, we depleted microglia using PLX5622 (PLX), a CSF1R inhibitor commonly used in mice, but rarely in rats, and assessed cell death following binge-like alcohol exposure in male rats. Eleven days of PLX treatment depleted microglia >90%. Further, PLX treatment prevented alcohol-induced neuronal death in the hippocampus and rhinal cortices, as the number of FluoroJade-B-positive cells (dying neurons) was reduced to control diet levels. This study provides direct evidence that alcohol-induced microglial reactivity is neurotoxic in male rats. Improved understanding of alcohol-microglia interactions is essential for developing therapeutics that suppress pro-cytotoxic and/or amplify protective microglia activity to relieve alcohol-related damage.

">Nucleus accumbens D2-expressing neurons: Balancing reward and licking disruption through rhythmic optogenetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine D1 receptor-expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are known to be critical for processing reward and regulating food intake. However, the role of D2-expressing neurons in this region remains less understood. This study employed optogenetic manipulations to investigate the role of NAc D2-expressing neurons in reward processing and sucrose consumption. Optogenetic activation of these neurons decreased sucrose preference (at 20 Hz), disrupted licking patterns (particularly at 8 and 20 Hz), and increased self-stimulation. Conversely, synchronizing stimulation with the animal's licking rhythm mitigated licking disruption and even increased sucrose intake, suggesting a rewarding effect. Furthermore, 20 Hz stimulation (but not 8 Hz) induced place preference in a real-time place preference (RTPP) test, establishing a long-lasting spatial reward memory. In contrast, inhibiting D2 neurons produced a negative hedonic state, although not reaching a complete aversion, influencing food choices in specific contexts. For instance, while the RTPP test per se was not sensitive enough to observe place aversion when mice could choose between consuming a high-fat diet (HFD) pellet in a context associated with or without inhibition of D2 neurons, they preferred to consume HFD on the non-inhibited side. This suggests that the palatability of HFD can unmask (but also overshadow) the negative hedonic state associated with D2 neuron inhibition. A negative reinforcement paradigm further confirmed the active avoidance behavior induced by D2 neuron inhibition. In conclusion, NAc D2 neuron inhibition induces a negative hedonic state, while activation has a dual effect; it is rewarding yet disrupts licking behavior, highlighting its complex role in reward and consummatory behavior. Importantly, self-paced stimulation entrained to licking rhythms offers a more physiologically relevant approach to brain activation

">ASD-ASSOCIATED CNTNAP2 VARIANTS DISRUPT NEURONAL ARBORIZATION THROUGH IMPAIRED REGULATION BY ECTODOMAIN SHEDDING</a></h4>

              
                Ectodomain shedding (ES) is a process by which a protease cleaves the extracellular portion of membrane-bound proteins, releasing soluble fragments that influence diverse cellular functions. ES is critical in neurodevelopment, plasticity, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, and has recently been implicated in neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is an adhesion molecule regulated by ES, releasing a soluble ectodomain (sCNTNAP2) that enhances neuronal synchrony. CNTNAP2 is implicated in ASD, schizophrenia, and cortical dysplasia focal epilepsy syndrome (CDFE) and it is known to regulate neuronal arborization, as well as dendritic spine maturation and maintenance. However, little is known about how neuroplasticity impacts ES or the role of CNTNAP2 ES in dendritic arborization. Here, we show that the brain sheddome is enriched in shed ectodomains that regulate neuronal projections, and that its molecular and functional composition is modulated by sensory deprivation in a sex dependent manner, with a decrease in sCNTNAP2 levels observed only in male mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sCNTNAP2 promotes dendritic arborization, while ASD-associated CNTNAP2 variants present reduced sCNTNAP2 levels in culture and decreased neuronal branching. Together, these findings underscore the role of ES in neuroplasticity and ASD and reveal how CNTNAP2 genetic variations disrupt its regulation by ES, leading to altered dendritic branching.

">Consolidation of sequential experience into a deep generative network explains human memory, prediction and planning</a></h4>

              
                The consolidation of sequential experience is thought to enable efficient schema-based reconstruction of the past and prediction of the future, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we present a computational model in which sequences are rapidly encoded in the hippocampus and replayed to train a neocortical deep generative network to predict the next item in each sequence. This is simulated using generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), a variety of large language model. As well as capturing the gist of specific episodes, the neocortical network extracts statistical patterns that generalise to new situations. This model explains human performance on statistical learning and structural inference tasks, and accounts for gist or schema-based distortions in memories of narratives. It also shows how recent memory can contribute to inference and planning, capturing hippocampal and neocortical interactions as 'retrieval-augmented generation', in which specific memories retrieved from the hippocampus provide the context in working memory for prediction using the 'general knowledge' of the neocortical network. Furthermore, it shows how hippocampal traces could combine gist and detail for efficient encoding. The model suggests how episodic, semantic and working memory interact in the consolidation, (re)construction and planning of sequential experience.

">Visually-guided compensation of deafening-induced song deterioration</a></h4>

              
                Human language learning and maintenance depend primarily on auditory feedback but are also shaped by other sensory modalities. Individuals who become deaf after learning to speak (post-lingual deafness) experience a gradual decline in their language abilities. A similar process occurs in songbirds, where deafness leads to progressive song deterioration. However, songbirds can modify their songs using non-auditory cues, challenging the prevailing assumption that auditory feedback is essential for vocal control. In this study, we investigated whether deafened birds could use visual cues to prevent or limit song deterioration. We developed a new metric for assessing syllable deterioration called the spectrogram divergence score. We then trained deafened birds in a behavioral task where the spectrogram divergence score of a target syllable was computed in real-time, triggering a contingent visual stimulus based on the score. Birds exposed to the contingent visual stimulus - a brief light extinction - showed more stable song syllables than birds that received either no light extinction or randomly triggered light extinction. Notably, this effect was specific to the targeted syllable and did not influence other syllables. This study demonstrates that deafness-induced song deterioration in birds can be partially mitigated with visual cues.

">Molecular Signatures of Resilience to Alzheimer's Disease in Neocortical Layer 4 Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell omics is advancing our understanding of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealing specific subtypes that are either susceptible or resilient to neurodegeneration. Using single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics to compare neocortical regions affected early (prefrontal cortex and precuneus) or late (primary visual cortex) in AD, we identified a resilient excitatory population in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex expressing RORB, CUX2, and EYA4. Layer 4 neurons in association neocortex also remained relatively preserved as AD progressed and shared overlapping molecular signatures of resilience. Early in the disease, resilient neurons upregulated genes associated with synapse maintenance, synaptic plasticity, calcium homeostasis, and neuroprotective factors, including GRIN2A, RORA, NRXN1, NLGN1, NCAM2, FGF14, NRG3, NEGR1, and CSMD1. We also identified KCNIP4, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel-interacting protein that interacts with Kv4.2 channels and presenilins, as a key factor linked to resilience. KCNIP4 was consistently upregulated in the early stages of pathology. Furthermore, AAV-mediated overexpression of Kcnip4 in a humanized AD mouse model reduced the expression of the activity-dependent genes Arc and c-Fos, suggesting compensatory mechanisms against neuronal hyperexcitability. Our dataset provides a valuable resource for investigating mechanisms underlying resilience to neurodegeneration.

">Association between loneliness and hippocampal responses to dynamic social stimuli in psychotic disorders</a></h4>

              
                Background: The incidence of loneliness has increased over the past several decades worldwide and is particularly common among people with serious mental illnesses. However, this public health problem has been difficult to address, in part because the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying loneliness are poorly understood. Methods: To investigate these mechanisms, a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted which accounted for known cognitive biases associated with loneliness. Participants with (n = 40) and without (n = 60) psychotic disorders (PD) viewed images of faces that appeared to approach or withdraw from the participants, while fMRI data were collected. Following the scanning, participants rated the trustworthiness of the faces, and these ratings were included as weights in the fMRI analyses. Neural responses to approaching versus withdrawing faces were measured, and whole brain regression analyses, with loneliness as the regressor, were performed. Results: In the PD and full samples, a higher level of loneliness was significantly associated with greater responses of the hippocampus and areas of the basal ganglia to withdrawing (versus approaching) face stimuli. Moreover, the effects in the hippocampus, but not the basal ganglia, remained significant after controlling for potential confounds such as social activity levels, depression and social anhedonia. Lastly, in a subset of the sample (n = 66), greater hippocampal responses to withdrawing faces predicted greater loneliness one year later. Conclusions: Heightened responses of the hippocampus to withdrawing faces may represent a candidate objective marker of loneliness that could be modified by interventions targeting loneliness.

                Our study advances the application of dynamic time warping (DTW) as a functional connectivity measure by introducing a normalization technique which enhances the detection of schizophrenia effects in comparison to both standard DTW and traditional correlation methods. By rigorously examining the statistical validity of DTW and our proposed normalized DTW measure, we show that it effectively captures interdependencies between fMRI signals beyond linear correlation, offering a more robust, complementary and informative approach to functional connectivity analysis. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that normalized DTW is more sensitive to differences in functional brain network connections between schizophrenia and controls, highlighting its potential to provide deeper insights into clinical research.

">Intelligence and Cognitive Flexibility Selectively Modulate Working Memory Functioning</a></h4>

              
                Working memory is a key component of intelligence, which can be underpinned by task connectome, while cognitive flexibility plays a role in adaptive and executive function that supports working memory processes. However, it remains unknown how intelligence and cognitive flexibility modulate working memory functioning, in terms of behavioural performance and task-related brain hierarchy. Current study investigated the working memory task-related behaviour and brain connectomic gradient in healthy adults together with their intelligence and cognitive flexibility measures. Results showed cognitive flexibility and intelligence were not significantly correlated with each other but with working memory function. Principal component and partial least square analysis revealed that nearly half of variance was explained by their overlap component, which linked with task gradient values of frontoparietal and ventral attention network representing executive, control and cognitive functioning. Individuals with higher intelligence and cognitive flexibility showed less distance between frontoparietal/ventral attention network and unimodal regions in gradient axis during working memory performance. Further analyses demonstrated that task gradient of frontoparietal and ventral attention network was significantly associated with working memory function, and selectively mediated by cognitive flexibility and intelligence, which may suggest partly convergent neural mechanisms for higher order functions that are involved in working memory functioning. In conclusion, current study provides new insight into the relationship among task connectomic gradient, working memory, intelligence, and cognitive flexibility, which helps understand the multi-component model of working memory and underlying task gradient principle.

">Meta-atlas of Juvenile and Adult Enteric Neuron scRNA-seq for Dataset Comparisons and Consensus on Transcriptomic Definitions of Enteric Neuron Subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Background The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a complex network of interconnected ganglia within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Among its diverse functions, the ENS detects bowel luminal contents and coordinates the passing of stool. ENS defects predispose to GI motility disorders. Previously, distinct enteric neuron types were cataloged by dye-filling techniques, immunohistochemistry, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology. Recent technical advances in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled transcriptional profiling of hundreds to millions of individual cells from the intestine. These data allow cell types to be resolved and compared to using their transcriptional profiles (clusters) rather than relying on antibody labeling. As a result, greater diversity of enteric neuron types has been appreciated. Because each scRNA-seq study has relied on different methods for cell isolation and library generation, numbers of neuron clusters and cell types detected differs between analyses. Cell counts in each dataset are particularly important for characterization of rare cell types since small numbers of profiled cells may not sample rare cell types. Importantly, each dataset, depending on the isolation methods, may contain different proportions of cells that are not detected in other datasets. Aggregation of datasets can effectively increase the total number of cells being analyzed and can be helpful for confirming the presence of low-abundance neuron types that might be absent or observed infrequently in any single dataset. Results Here we briefly systematically review each Mus musculus single cell or single nucleus RNA-sequencing enteric nervous system dataset. We then reprocess and computationally integrate these select independent scRNA-seq enteric neuron datasets with the aim to identify new cell types, shared marker genes across juvenile to adult ages, dataset differences, and achieve some consensus on transcriptomic definitions of enteric neuronal subtypes. Conclusions Data aggregation generates a consensus view of enteric neuron types and improves resolution of rare neuron classes. This meta-atlas offers a deeper understanding of enteric neuron diversity and may prove useful to investigators aiming to define alterations among enteric neurons in disease states. Future studies face the challenge of connecting these deep transcriptional profiles for enteric neurons with historical classification systems.

	<p>Background: Accounting for dementia risk factors is essential in identifying people who would benefit most from intervention programs. The CAIDE dementia risk score is commonly applied, but its link to brain function remains unclear. This study aims to determine whether the variation in this score is associated with neurophysiological changes and cognitive measures in normative individuals. Methods: The sample comprised 38 participants aged between 54 and 79 (M = 67.05; SD = 6.02). Data were collected using paper-and-pencil tests and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in the resting state, channels FP1 and FP2. The EEG signals were analyzed using Power Spectral Density (PSD)-based features. Results: The CAIDE score is positively correlated with the relative power activation of the &amp;amp;theta; band and negatively correlated with the MMSE cognitive test score, and MMSE variations align with those found in distributions of EEG-extracted PSD-based features. Conclusions: The findings suggest that CAIDE scores can identify individuals without noticeable cognitive changes who already exhibit brain activity similar to that seen in people with dementia. They also contribute to the convergent validity between CAIDE and the risk of cognitive decline. This underscores the importance of early monitoring of these factors to reduce the incidence of dementia.</p>

	<p>Background: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) represents one of the most common and debilitating effects in patients surviving after cancer treatments. Neurocognitive deficits are important causes of disability and burden in cancer survivors. The true magnitude of CRCI is difficult to define due to significant heterogeneity of literature data. At present, there is no agreement on the gold standard for detection and grading of CRCI in clinical trials, and there is a lack of clear knowledge of its pathophysiology. Objectives: In this review, we aim to discuss some perspectives for future research to pursue in order to cover the gaps in knowledge in the CRCI field. Methods: We focused our literature research on the following relevant issues: neuroradiological correlates of CRCI; objective neuropsychological evaluation and subjective complaint assessment and their correlation with objective measures; timing of assessment; and possible treatments. Results: The correct methodology for evaluating cognitive deficits induced by anti-tumor treatments still requires a definition based on quality scientific evidence, and literature data are currently scarce. Conclusions: This review highlights the need for further research to understand the causes and consequences of cancer-related cognitive impairment using standardized and sensitive measures of cognitive functions and the long-term effects of chemotherapy on cognitive functions and to develop effective interventions.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively studied asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers, identifying those developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 56 asymptomatic family members (AFM) with a <i>C9orf72</i> mutation (AFM C9+), 132 non-carriers (AFM C9−), and 359 population-based controls. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we measured cortical thickness, gyrification, and subcortical volumes longitudinally. Linear mixed-effects models on non-converting AFM C9+ scans (n = 107) created a reference for these measurements, establishing individual atrophy patterns. Atrophy patterns from presymptomatic phenoconverters (n = 10 scans) served as a template for group comparisons and similarity assessments. Similarity with phenoconverters was quantified using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for cortical and Kullback–Leibler similarity (KLS) for subcortical measures. Using longitudinal similarity assessments, we predicted when participants would reach the average similarity level of phenoconverters at their first post-onset scan.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five AFM C9+ converted to ALS or ALS-FTD. Up to 6 years before symptoms, these phenoconverters exhibited significant atrophy in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortex, along with smaller thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala compared to other AFM C9+. Some non-converted AFM C9+ had high DSC and KLS, approaching values of phenoconverters, whereas others, along with AFM C9− and controls, had lower values. At age 80, we predicted 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 13.2–40.1%) of AFM C9+ and no AFM C9− would reach the same DSC as phenoconverters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Distinctive atrophy patterns are visible years before symptom onset on presymptomatic scans of phenoconverters. Combining baseline and follow-up similarity measures may serve as a promising imaging biomarker for identifying those at risk of ALS or ALS-FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Extensive research has been focused in the past century on structural, physiological, and molecular attributes of the hippocampus. This interest was created by the unique involvement of the hippocampus in cognitive and affective functions of the brain. Functional analysis revealed that the hippocampus has divergent properties along its axial dimension to the extent that the dorsal sector (dorsal hippocampus, DH) has different connections with the rest of the brain than those of the ventral sector (VH). Still, longitudinal pathways connect the DH with the VH and dampen the functional differences between the sectors. To be able to identify the intrinsic functional difference between the DH and VH, we produced dissociated monolayer cultures from prenatal DH and VH and examined their properties at 10–20 days after plating by imaging the spontaneous activity of the network using Fluo-2 AM, a calcium indicator. Surprisingly, while DH and VH sectors produced dissociated cultures with similar morphological attributes, VH cultures were more active spontaneously than DH cultures. Furthermore, when stimulated to produce action potentials, VH neurons triggered network bursts in postsynaptic neurons more often than DH cultures. Finally, in both DH and VH cultures, electrical stimulation of single cells produced network bursts in response to a burst of action potentials rather than to single spikes. These experiments indicate that even in dissociated cultures, neurons of the VH are more excitable and sensitive to electrical stimulation than DH; hence, they are more likely to generate network bursts and epileptic seizures, as suggested for in vivo brains.</p>

                Background The response of heart rate to changes in exercise intensity is comprised of several dynamic modes with differing magnitudes and temporal characteristics. Investigations of empirical identification of dynamic models of heart rate showed that second-order models gave substantially and significantly better model fidelity compared to the first order case. In the present work, we aimed to reanalyse data from previous studies to more closely consider the effect of including a zero and a pure delay in the model. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 22 treadmill (TM) and 54 cycle ergometer (CE) data sets from a total of 38 healthy participants. A linear, time-invariant plant model structure with up to two poles, a zero and a dead time is considered. Empirical estimation of the free parameters was performed using least-squares optimisation. The primary outcome measure is model fit, which is a normalised root-mean-square model error. Results A model comprising parallel connection of two first-order transfer functions, one with a dead time and one without, was found to give the highest fit (56.7 % for TM, 54.3 % for CE), whereby the non-delayed component appeared to merely capture initial transients in the data and the part with dead time likely represented the true dynamic response of heart rate to the excitation. In comparison, a simple first-order model without dead time gave substantially lower fit than the parallel model (50.2 % for TM, 47.9 % for CE). Conclusions This preliminary analysis points to a linear first-order system with dead time as being an appropriate model for heart rate response to exercise using treadmill and cycle ergometer modalities. In order to avoid biased estimates, it is vitally important that, prior to parameter estimation and validation, careful attention is paid to data preprocessing in order to eliminate transients and trends.

                Background We analysed the prevalence of depression under among pregnant women both in the immigrant and native populations in a Health Region of Spain, and evaluated the maternal factors associated with it. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study in pregnant women in the Health Region of Lleida between 2012 and 2018. We analysed the following variables: age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, country of origin, and antidepressant drug prescribed. We performed a multivariate analysis and obtained the linear regression coefficients and their 95% confidence interval (CI). Results In a sample of 17177 pregnant women, 2.5% had a diagnosis of depression. The patients with depression had an average age of 32 years (SD 5.56) compared to the rest of the women who had an average age of 30 (SD 5.85) years of age. Obesity was present in 17.7% of patients with depression compared to 14.3% in the rest. A high percentage of women from Western Europe presented depression (2.9%); followed by women from Latin America (2.6%) and Eastern Europe (2.3%). The values for Africa, (0.8%) and Asia and the Middle East (0.5%) were significantly lower. We did not observe any relationship between depression and hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Conclusions In our study, we found a prevalence of depression similar to the one found in other publications. As main risk factors, we identified age, weight, and geographical origin.

                Background of the study This study intends to contribute to the continuing discussion about green economic growth by objectively investigating the consequences of clean energy generation, cutting-edge green practices, and ethical business on global sustainability. This study also examines how green finance laws effectively handle the financial limitations that companies face when pursuing green innovation. Green finance enables the development and implementation of sustainable business models, investments, trade, economic, environmental, and social projects through the effective utilization of financial resources. Methods This article offers a complete evaluation of the current state and advancements in green finance research using a mixed-methods approach, which includes bibliometric and qualitative analysis. We analysed a big dataset of research papers after entering the keywords into the Scopus database. Results This study found that green bank products include green securities, investments, climate financing, carbon finance, insurance, credit, and infrastructure bonds. Sustainability, sustainable development, investments, environmental economics, sustainable finance, green bonds, and the green economy dominate as a most prevalent theme. China has the strongest bibliometric linkages to other nations, followed by the US and UK. This study also examines whether green finance policies address firm financial restrictions while pursuing green innovation. VOS-viewer generates co-authorship-based keyword occurrence links and network maps. Conclusion Green finance strives to increase funding flows to sustainable development goals while mitigating environmental and social hazards. “Going green,” pricing, forecasting, modelling, picking the most efficient tool, and influencing investor behaviour toward environmentally friendly operations are all challenges. Environmental policies, interest rates, religion, risks, social inclusion, and banking laws all have an impact on bank green financing initiatives. The study’s main contribution is an overview of green finance breakthroughs for sustainability, which may help scholars and practitioners understand the trend and future research directions.

                Background Surgeons are highly exposed to Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). Assessing the prevalence of these disorders, both overall and by body area, has become a focus of interest, and numerous articles have been published on the subject. Methods Journal articles and reviews focused on WMSDs published until today and referenced in PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, Science.gov, Mendeley and Google Scholar were analysed. VOSviewer version 1.6.20 and Microsoft Excel were used to perform a bibliometric and visualization analyses. Overall distribution of publications by year, sources with country and related indicators, research areas, authors with their affiliations, references and keywords were studied. Results Of the total 2338 items identified, 184 articles (174 articles and 10 reviews) published between 1991 and 2024 were included. Results showed an increase in the number of publications over the years, with a significant increase from 2016 onwards (R2 = 0.8693). The United States is the leader in the field, with 89 publications (37.6%) and 2,631 citations. Hallbeck MS (USA) is the most prolific author (11 publications and 601 citations). World Neurosurgery and Work were the journals with the highest number of publications (n=7). Applied ergonomics has the highest number of citations. Medicine is the research area most present. Epstein’s work has the most citations worldwide, while Park et al’s work is the most cited of the 184 studies considered. “Ergonomics”, “musculoskeletal disorders”, “surgeons”, and “work-related musculoskeletal disorders” are the keywords most used by authors. Their use increased significantly since 2016, with an average year of publication around 2020. Conclusions The study of WMSDs in surgeons is a young research topic that is evolving significantly. North America, Europe and Asia have been the main contributors, with the USA in the lead. Subjective prevalence analysis based on questionnaires and ergonomic assessment using quantitative tools are the two main lines of research.

                Cortical activity is constantly fluctuating between distinct spatiotemporal activity patterns denoted by changes in brain state. States of cortical desynchronization arise during motor generation, increased attention, and high cognitive load. Synchronized brain states comprise spatially widespread, coordinated low-frequency neural activity during rest and sleep when disengaged from the external environment or ‘offline’. The claustrum is a small subcortical structure with dense reciprocal connections with the cortex suggesting modulation by, or participation in, brain state regulation. Here, we highlight recent work suggesting that neural activity in the claustrum supports cognitive processes associated with synchronized brain states characterized by increased low-frequency network activity. As an example, we outline how claustrum activity could support episodic memory consolidation during sleep.

                How does the brain represent the structure of a visual scene (the relations among items, e.g., the cardinality) independent of scene contents (the objects in the scene, e.g., item identity)? Thompson et al. propose a dual-stream neural network model based on the parallel pathways of the primate visual system.

                Zhang et al. discover that VezA, a vezatin homolog in Aspergillus nidulans, is important for the assembly of the dynactin complex. The results suggest that VezA associates with the Arp1 mini-filament and its pointed end, and without VezA, Arp1 mini-filament assembly and stability of the p150-p50 proteins are significantly compromised.

                piRNAs protect germline genomes by repressing transposons. Daedalus and Gasz bind to each other and form a mitochondrial scaffold for Armitage, a factor required for endonuclease Zucchini-dependent piRNA maturation. Their roles are distinct: Daedalus interacts with Armitage, while Gasz supports Daedalus. Daedalus binds to Armitage through an extended coiled-coil domain, which tethers it to mitochondria, and a SAM domain, which controls piRNA length. Without the Daedalus SAM domain, piRNAs cannot fully silence transposons. Daedalus is Dipteran specific, unlike other species, where exonucleases regulate piRNA length.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89572">Calcineurin inhibition enhances Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan by defecation defects-mediated calorie restriction and nuclear hormone signaling</a></h4>

              
                Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> through multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in <i>C. elegans</i>. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the <i>C. elegans</i> DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92914">A scenario for an evolutionary selection of ageing</a></h4>

              
                Signs of ageing become apparent only late in life, after organismal development is finalized. Ageing, most notably, decreases an individual’s fitness. As such, it is most commonly perceived as a non-adaptive force of evolution and considered a by-product of natural selection. Building upon the evolutionarily conserved age-related Smurf phenotype, we propose a simple mathematical life-history trait model in which an organism is characterized by two core abilities: reproduction and homeostasis. Through the simulation of this model, we observe (1) the convergence of fertility’s end with the onset of senescence, (2) the relative success of ageing populations, as compared to non-ageing populations, and (3) the enhanced evolvability (i.e. the generation of genetic variability) of ageing populations. In addition, we formally demonstrate the mathematical convergence observed in (1). We thus theorize that mechanisms that link the timing of fertility and ageing have been selected and fixed over evolutionary history, which, in turn, explains why ageing populations are more evolvable and therefore more successful. Broadly speaking, our work suggests that ageing is an adaptive force of evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88322">Evidence for a role of human blood-borne factors in mediating age-associated changes in molecular circadian rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with a number of physiologic changes including perturbed circadian rhythms; however, mechanisms by which rhythms are altered remain unknown. To test the idea that circulating factors mediate age-dependent changes in peripheral rhythms, we compared the ability of human serum from young and old individuals to synchronize circadian rhythms in culture. We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25–30) and old (age 70–76) individuals at 14:00 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts. We found that young and old sera are equally competent at initiating robust ~24 hr oscillations of a luciferase reporter driven by clock gene promoter. However, cyclic gene expression is affected, such that young and old sera promote cycling of different sets of genes. Genes that lose rhythmicity with old serum entrainment are associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer’s Disease as identified by STRING and IPA analyses. Conversely, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increased in the cells entrained with old serum. Genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions. We did not observe a global difference in the distribution of phase between groups, but found that peak expression of several clock-controlled genes (<i>PER3, NR1D1, NR1D2, CRY1, CRY2,</i> and <i>TEF</i>) lagged in the cells synchronized ex vivo with old serum. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that age-dependent blood-borne factors affect circadian rhythms in peripheral cells and have the potential to impact health and disease via maintaining or disrupting rhythms respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92854">Synaptic interactions between stellate cells and parvalbumin interneurons in layer 2 of the medial entorhinal cortex are organized at the scale of grid cell clusters</a></h4>

              
                Interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons are critical to computations in cortical circuits but their organization is difficult to assess with standard electrophysiological approaches. Within the medial entorhinal cortex, representation of location by grid and other spatial cells involves circuits in layer 2 in which excitatory stellate cells interact with each other via inhibitory parvalbumin expressing interneurons. Whether this connectivity is structured to support local circuit computations is unclear. Here, we introduce strategies to address the functional organization of excitatory-inhibitory interactions using crossed Cre- and Flp-driver mouse lines to direct targeted presynaptic optogenetic activation and postsynaptic cell identification. We then use simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from postsynaptic neurons to assess their shared input from optically activated presynaptic populations. We find that extensive axonal projections support spatially organized connectivity between stellate cells and parvalbumin interneurons, such that direct connections are often, but not always, shared by nearby neurons, whereas multisynaptic interactions coordinate inputs to neurons with greater spatial separation. We suggest that direct excitatory-inhibitory synaptic interactions may operate at the scale of grid cell clusters, with local modules defined by excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, while indirect interactions may coordinate activity at the scale of grid cell modules.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98096">FGF8-mediated gene regulation affects regional identity in human cerebral organoids</a></h4>

              
                The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses <i>via</i> modulation of early target genes. The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development. We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an <i>in vitro </i>platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic domains, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Moreover, FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94811">Human DCP1 is crucial for mRNA decapping and possesses paralog-specific gene regulating functions</a></h4>

              
                The mRNA 5'-cap structure removal by the decapping enzyme DCP2 is a critical step in gene regulation. While DCP2 is the catalytic subunit in the decapping complex, its activity is strongly enhanced by multiple factors, particularly DCP1, which is the major activator in yeast. However, the precise role of DCP1 in metazoans has yet to be fully elucidated. Moreover, in humans, the specific biological functions of the two DCP1 paralogs, DCP1a and DCP1b, remain largely unknown. To investigate the role of human DCP1, we generated cell lines that were deficient in DCP1a, DCP1b, or both to evaluate the importance of DCP1 in the decapping machinery. Our results highlight the importance of human DCP1 in decapping process and show that the EVH1 domain of DCP1 enhances the mRNA-binding affinity of DCP2. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses outline the distinct functions of DCP1a and DCP1b in human cells, regulating specific endogenous mRNA targets and biological processes. Overall, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of human DCP1 in mRNA decapping and shed light on the distinct functions of its paralogs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103035">Distinct functions of three Wnt proteins control mirror-symmetric organogenesis in the C. elegans gonad</a></h4>

              
                Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs; Z1 and Z4). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins (CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1(RNAi) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

Structures available for all subtypes of TRP channels reveal that the transmembrane domains are closely related despite their unique sensitivity to activating stimuli. Here, we use computational and electrophysiological approaches to explore the conservation of the cooling agent binding pocket identified within the S1–S4 domain of the Melastatin subfamily member TRPM8, the mammalian sensor of noxious cold, with other TRPM channel subtypes. We find that a subset of TRPM channels, including TRPM2, TRPM4, and TRPM5, contain pockets very similar to the cooling agent binding pocket in TRPM8. We then show how the cooling agent icilin modulates activation of mouse TRPM4 to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, enhancing the sensitivity of the channel to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diminishing outward-rectification to promote opening at negative voltages. Mutations known to promote or diminish activation of TRPM8 by cooling agents similarly alter activation of TRPM4 by icilin, suggesting that icilin binds to the cooling agent binding pocket to promote opening of the channel. These findings demonstrate that TRPM4 and TRPM8 channels share related ligand binding pockets that are allosterically coupled to opening of the pore.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90422">Large-scale characterization of cocaine addiction-like behaviors reveals that escalation of intake, aversion-resistant responding, and breaking-points are highly correlated measures of the same construct</a></h4>

              
                Addiction is commonly characterized by escalation of drug intake, compulsive drug seeking, and continued use despite harmful consequences. However, the factors contributing to the transition from moderate drug use to these problematic patterns remain unclear, particularly regarding the role of sex. Many preclinical studies have been limited by small sample sizes, low genetic diversity, and restricted drug access, making it challenging to model significant levels of intoxication or dependence and translate findings to humans. To address these limitations, we characterized addiction-like behaviors in a large sample of &gt;500 outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats using an extended cocaine self-administration paradigm (6 hr/daily). We analyzed individual differences in escalation of intake, progressive ratio (PR) responding, continued use despite adverse consequences (contingent foot shocks), and irritability-like behavior during withdrawal. Principal component analysis showed that escalation of intake, progressive ratio responding, and continued use despite adverse consequences loaded onto a single factor that was distinct from irritability-like behaviors. Categorizing rats into resilient, mild, moderate, and severe addiction-like phenotypes showed that females exhibited higher addiction-like behaviors, with a lower proportion of resilient individuals compared to males. These findings suggest that, in genetically diverse rats with extended drug access, escalation of intake, continued use despite adverse consequences, and PR responding are highly correlated measures of a shared underlying construct. Furthermore, our results highlight sex differences in resilience to addiction-like behaviors.

	<p>Background: In this systematic review, conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we aimed to assess differences in the cognitive processes associated with social cognition&amp;amp;mdash;namely language, theory of mind (ToM), and executive functions (EFs)&amp;amp;mdash;between ADHD and control groups. Methods: The review included studies indexed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO up until May 2024. Eligible original peer-reviewed articles met the following criteria: they were written in English, included a clinical group with a current primary ADHD diagnosis, were empirical, included quantitative data, and utilized standardized and validated measures with adequate psychometric properties to assess social cognitive processes. Results and Discussion: A total of 1215 individuals with ADHD participated in the selected studies. Out of the 22 articles reviewed, 17 reported significant differences between ADHD and the controls across several cognitive processes related to language and EF rather than ToM. These processes included pragmatic skills, verbal and nonverbal communication, emotional prosody, interaction skills, sarcasm, paradoxical sarcasm recognition, ambiguous situations, emotion recognition, false belief, social problem solving, social behaviors, and gesture codification. We also discuss the limitations of the research and the implications of our findings. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42023474681.</p>

	<p>Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) impacts not only diagnosed individuals, but also significantly affects the quality of life of both primary and secondary caregivers. These effects are particularly pronounced when compared to caregivers of individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders. The emotional and physical demands of caring for someone with ASD can profoundly alter family dynamics and interpersonal relationships, creating challenges that require a comprehensive approach to be understood and addressed. Methods: The methodological design is a narrative review study, based on a search conducted during May, June, July, and August 2024 in the Scopus, Dialnet, and WoS databases concerning the object of study. As a result, a total of 197 articles were qualitatively analyzed. Of these, 36 articles were selected for a more detailed qualitative analysis, leading to a final sample of 14 documents. The selected studies were examined through qualitative content analysis. The inclusion criteria for this selection were as follows: empirical studies or research published in English or Spanish; open access via the Internet; categories limited to &amp;amp;ldquo;education/educational research&amp;amp;rdquo; relevant to the proposed objectives; and specific documents related to students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Results: The care of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has a significant and multifaceted impact on family life, deeply affecting the mental health of caregivers. These effects manifest in the form of chronic stress, anxiety, and interpersonal difficulties, altering family dynamics. The quality of life of caregivers varies depending on the coping strategies they employ, which are crucial for their emotional well-being. Conclusions: Understanding and optimizing these strategies is essential to mitigate the negative effects of caregiving and improving the overall well-being of families living with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Research is lacking about the development of personality disorders (PDs) from adolescence to early adulthood. This study aimed to characterize the profile of high-risk adolescents compared to adolescents with full-blown PDs and adolescents with other psychiatric disorders and to identify clinical markers that constitute a risk profile. Methods: We evaluated 99 adolescents (12&amp;amp;ndash;17 years old) through DSM-5-based semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, cognitive tasks, and scales regarding functioning and disorder severity. We divided patients into three groups: 22 adolescents with full-blown personality disorder (FBPD), 57 adolescents at high risk for personality disorders (HPD), and 20 adolescents with other DSM-5 psychiatric disorders (OTH). At follow-up, 56 patients completed the assessment. Possible developmental trajectories of FBPD and HPD patients were remission (total or partial) of PD-related symptoms, stability of symptoms, or transition from HPD to FBPD. Results: FBPD adolescents had more impaired family backgrounds. At baseline, the HPD group was mainly composed of female patients, younger than the FBPD ones. Externalizing symptoms may represent prodromal symptoms of FBPD. High-risk patients who made the transition were younger than those who did not, and their mothers reported higher internalizing symptoms at baseline. None of the FBPD patients remitted. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of a PD &amp;amp;ldquo;at-risk mental state&amp;amp;rdquo; and the importance of the implementation of PD early detection and treatment in adolescents, regardless of patient age.</p>

	<p>Background: LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy is a social development protocol that uses LEGO&amp;amp;reg; activities to support the development of a wide range of interaction skills, enhancing prosocial behaviors and mitigating the challenges associated with mental health difficulties and behavioral issues commonly observed in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives: This study aimed to explore the effects of LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy on the social behavior and mental health of children with ASD, comparing stimulation mediated by expert and stimulation mediated by non-autistic peers. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee at Mackenzie Presbyterian University, ensuring adherence to ethical standards throughout the research process. Methods: This study involved 18 children with ASD, levels 1 or 2, with an intelligence quotient (IQ) above 70, and three typically developing peers, intelligence quotient (IQ) above 80, aged between 5 and 8 years old, of both sexes. Participants were randomized into three groups for stimulation (stimulation mediated by expert, by a non-autistic peer and control group). The measures were the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (parent and teacher versions), the Inventory of Difficulties in Executive Functions, Regulation, and Aversion to Delay&amp;amp;mdash;Child Version, the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, the Autism Behavior Checklist, and the Autistic Behavior Inventory. Results: After 14 sessions of 45 min in school settings, the participants of both groups (mediated by experts and non-autistic children) showed significant gains on social behavior. A statistically significant difference was observed between baseline sessions and probes (&amp;amp;chi;2 (5) = 25.905, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These gains were maintained in both follow-up points, 30 and 90 days after the completion of the stimulation sessions. Additionally, maladaptive behavior showed a significant decline when compared pre- and post-intervention. These improvements were sustained during follow-up assessments at 30 and 90 days. Conclusions: The results suggest that a structured intervention combined with peer-mediated stimulation may be an effective method for promoting adaptive and prosocial behaviors in children with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Elder abuse, and more specifically financial exploitation, is expected to be a major problem in modern societies as the worldwide population is getting older. Neuropsychological protocols regarding financial capacity assessment are the only available window allowing us to view the cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;emotional&amp;amp;ndash;behavioral strengths/deficits and vulnerabilities of individuals. Given the paucity of relevant research in Greece in the most vulnerable individuals such as older adults suffering from neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), this systematic review attempts to investigate whether NCDs impair financial capacity and to highlight the most important factors that can predict financial incapacity in Greek older patients and the likelihood of financial abuse. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Results: The search identified n = 21 relevant research articles. The synthesis of available evidence supports that financial incapacity is clearly demonstrated in the group of Greek older adults suffering from NCDs of different severity and etiology; thus, such changes can assist diagnosis, treatment, and care of these individuals, but the implications for elder abuse in the Greek cultural context have not been examined in detail so far. Conclusions: Given the unique source of information that neuropsychological assessments represent by revealing the importance of factors such as arithmetic cognition and relevant brain volume changes in the left angular gyrus, depressive mood, apathy, frailty, vascular risk factors, and financial illiteracy, forensic neuropsychology can play a vital role in protecting older individuals from financial abuse.</p>

	<p>Background: Our understanding of the relationship between neural activity and psychological states has advanced greatly in recent decades. But we are still unable to explain conscious experience in terms of physical processes occurring in our brains. Methods: This paper introduces a conceptual framework that may contribute to an explanation. All physical processes entail the transfer, transduction, and transformation of energy between portions of matter as work is performed in material systems. If the production of consciousness in nervous systems is a physical process, then it must entail the same. Here the nervous system, and the brain in particular, is considered as a material system that transfers, transduces, and transforms energy as it performs biophysical work. Conclusions: Evidence from neuroscience suggests that conscious experience is produced in the organic matter of nervous systems when they perform biophysical work at classical and quantum scales with a certain level of dynamic complexity or organization. An empirically grounded, falsifiable, and testable hypothesis is offered to explain how energy processing in nervous systems may produce conscious experience at a fundamental physical level.</p>

                Background This study examined the effect of thermocycling on the flexural strength properties of four CAD/CAM ceramic materials at different thicknesses. Methods Four CAD/CAM ceramics of different types: advanced lithium disilicate (ALD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) lithium disilicate (LD), and leucite reinforced (LE), and at three varying thicknesses 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were examined. After subjecting all specimens to 5000 thermomechanical cycles, flexural strength was determined using a universal testing apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed for analysis. Two factorial ANOVA models assessed the association of different factors (ceramic type and thickness) with flexural strength and elastic modulus. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted means were computed. A p-value < 0.05 was designated significant. Results ZLS exhibited the highest flexural strength at 1.5 mm thickness, while LD showed the highest Young’s modulus of elasticity. The lowest flexural strength was observed in the 0.5 mm thickness group. There were notable variations in flexural strength across all ceramic materials, with the highest adjusted mean strength in the ZLS group, ALD, LD, and LE, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were noted in ceramic thickness, with 1.5 mm thickness showing the highest strength and 0.5 mm thickness the lowest. Conclusions Ceramic material thickness significantly impacts flexural strength, with 1.5 mm thickness deemed suitable for posterior restorations. Ceramic materials with zirconia fillers or matrix demonstrated higher flexural strength than other ceramics.

                Background Different usage scenarios and design guidelines were considered when planning a factory building and its ventilation system. Accordingly, it often makes sense to analyze the actual operating conditions again during subsequent operations in order to optimally adapt the air supply to the respective conditions in terms of demand-responsive ventilation. The aim is to ensure good indoor air quality and thermal comfort while significantly reducing energy consumption. Methods For this purpose, in addition to the sensors in the building management system, approximately 120 wireless sensors were installed in the occupied areas to measure the air temperature, operating temperature, humidity, and CO2. In this way the spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, humidity, and CO2 in the hall were visualized and evaluated to reduce the volume flows of the ventilation systems. The recorded data and findings were used to optimize ventilation systems by gaining a deeper understanding of indoor air flow. Results As part of the investigation, a considerable reduction in the air volume flows and thus the required energy consumption of the air handling units was achieved while maintaining the same thermal comfort. It was shown that the temperature field and indoor air quality were not negatively affected by the change in the air volume flow over a wide range. Conclusions This was made possible by the well-designed ventilation system, which achieves a low-pulse, slightly stratified indoor airflow, and a structural envelope with very good thermal insulation.

                Background Global environmental degradation is increasingly driving poor health outcomes worldwide. Healthcare systems and services are often not environmentally sustainable and compound the problem, while healthcare professionals are also recognised as key leaders in advancing sustainable healthcare. To adopt this leadership position, healthcare professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding environmental sustainability in healthcare must be established. This article reports the development and validation of a new instrument for this purpose that corresponds to the specificities of the Southern African context. Methods Questionnaire development followed a seven-stage process. Information was obtained from a 2021 study titled ‘South African Healthcare Professionals’ Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Environmental Sustainability in Healthcare: A Mixed-Methods Study’ to develop the instrument. Information was also sourced from the literature regarding environmental sustainability and healthcare to generate the first questionnaire with 29 items. The following stages included two rounds of expert input, separated by a pilot study with the target population to receive feedback regarding the instrument’s structure, relevance, and length. Content validity was determined through statistical analysis. Results Feedback was received from nine experts in stage two and 13 pilot-study participants in stage four and incorporated to improve the questionnaire. In stage six, the questionnaire was rated by seven experts. The content validity index of the questionnaire was calculated at two different stages, after which the indices were compared. Following a final edit, the questionnaire has 24 questionnaire items. The closing analysis calculated the scale content validity index average (S-CVI/Ave) of 0,922; this indicates that the final questionnaire has excellent content validity. Conclusion A questionnaire that assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals regarding environmental sustainability in Southern Africa has been developed and validated. This questionnaire can now be used for further studies in Southern Africa.

                Background Concerns regarding academic efficiency at the postgraduate level in university programs require attention from those responsible for making university administrative decisions. This study aimed to determine the terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students enrolled in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years. Methods This cross-sectional study considered all records of documents submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty in the programs offered by a dental school, published in its institutional repository between 2017 and 2023. The study variable was terminal efficiency (TE), considered both as a quantitative and qualitative variable. Additionally, some covariates were included, such as the year of formal document submission, the mode of document preparation, the second professional specialty in dentistry, and sex. Descriptive analysis was conducted to obtain absolute and relative frequencies. Bivariate analysis was performed using Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results From the evaluation of TE between 2017 and 2023, it was observed that 72.09% (n=186) of students with a document submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty and published in the repository had a TE categorized of “Up to 1 year”. Likewise, the mean TE was 0.95 years (SD=1.25), with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) between medians when evaluated based on the year of formal document submission and the dental specialty program. Conclusion The mean terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years was 0.95 years.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                Background The discoveries of Mulatu’s numbers, better known as Mulatu’s sequence, represent revolutionary contributions to the mathematical world. His best-known work is Mulatu’s sequence, in which each new number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. When various operations and manipulations are performed on the numbers in this sequence, beautiful and incredible patterns begin to emerge. This study aimed to identify novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Methods This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Mathematical proof techniques such as principle of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction and direct proof were utilized to substantiate findings. GNU Octave (version 9, (1)) software was applied to verify the existence, classify, and conduct computational investigations of findings prior to formal proofs. Results In this study, we provided several characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. We also investigated the properties and patterns of these fascinating numbers. Moreover, we have also shown that, similar to Fibonacci’s numbers, Mulatu’s numbers also give the so-called golden ratio, which is most applicable in numerical optimization. Furthermore, we formulated a relation among Mulatu’s numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and Lucas numbers. Finally, we provided a generating function for the Mulatu numbers. Conclusions In this study, we uncovered novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers and introduced a generating function for them. We investigated relationship between Mulatu’s numbers and the golden ratio. The results discussed offer valuable insights and enhance our understanding of their properties. Furthermore, these findings play a vital role in the boarder context of mathematical sequences, contributing significantly to the field.

                <p>by Gabriel A. A. Silva, Avril M. Harder, Kenneth B. Kirksey, Samarth Mathur, Janna R. Willoughby</p>

Wild populations are increasingly threatened by human-mediated climate change and land use changes. As populations decline, the probability of inbreeding increases, along with the potential for negative effects on individual fitness. Detecting and characterizing runs of homozygosity (ROHs) is a popular strategy for assessing the extent of individual inbreeding present in a population and can also shed light on the genetic mechanisms contributing to inbreeding depression. Here, we analyze simulated and empirical datasets to demonstrate the downstream effects of program selection and long-term demographic history on ROH inference, leading to context-dependent biases in the results. Through a sensitivity analysis we evaluate how various parameter values impact on ROH-calling results, highlighting its utility as a tool for parameter exploration. Our results indicate that ROH inferences are sensitive to factors such as sequencing depth and ROH length distribution, and with bias direction and magnitude varying with demographic history and the programs used. Estimation biases are particularly pronounced at lower sequencing depths, potentially leading to either underestimation or overestimation of inbreeding. These results are particularly important for the management of endangered species, as underestimating inbreeding signals in the genome can substantially undermine conservation initiatives. We also found that small true ROHs can be incorrectly lumped together and called as longer ROHs, leading to erroneous inference of recent inbreeding. To address these challenges, we suggest using a combination of ROH detection tools and ROH length-specific inferences, along with sensitivity analysis, to generate robust and context-appropriate population inferences regarding inbreeding history. We outline these recommendations for ROH estimation at multiple levels of sequencing effort, which are typical of conservation genomics studies.

                <p>by Lingxia Qiao, Michael Getz, Ben Gross, Brian Tenner, Jin Zhang, Padmini Rangamani</p>

The nanoscale organization of enzymes associated with the dynamics of second messengers is critical for ensuring compartmentation and localization of signaling molecules in cells. Specifically, the spatiotemporal orchestration of cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations is critical for many cellular functions. Previous experimental studies have shown that the formation of nanodomains of A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP150) and adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8) on the surface of pancreatic MIN6 β cells modulates the phase of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP oscillations from out-of-phase to in-phase. In this work, we develop computational models of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP pathway and AKAP/AC nanodomain formation that give rise to the two important predictions: instead of an arbitrary phase difference, the out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation reaches Ca<sup>2+</sup> trough and cAMP peak simultaneously, which is defined as inversely out-of-phase; the in-phase and inversely out-of-phase oscillations associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP dynamics on and away from the nanodomains can be explained by an incoherent feedforward loop. Factors such as cellular surface-to-volume ratio, compartment size, and distance between nanodomains do not affect the existence of in-phase or inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation, but cellular surface-to-volume ratio and compartment size can affect the time delay for the inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation while the distance between two nanodomains does not. Finally, we predict that both the Turing pattern-generated nanodomains and experimentally measured nanodomains demonstrate the existence of in-phase and inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation when the AC8 is at a low level, consistent with the behavior of an incoherent feedforward loop. These findings unveil the key circuit motif that governs cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and advance our understanding of how nanodomains can lead to spatial compartmentation of second messengers.

                <p>by Emmanouil Giannakakis, Oleg Vinogradov, Victor Buendía, Anna Levina</p>

Cortical neurons are versatile and efficient coding units that develop strong preferences for specific stimulus characteristics. The sharpness of tuning and coding efficiency is hypothesized to be controlled by delicately balanced excitation and inhibition. These observations suggest a need for detailed co-tuning of excitatory and inhibitory populations. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that a combination of plasticity rules can lead to the emergence of excitation/inhibition (E/I) co-tuning in neurons driven by independent, low-noise signals. However, cortical signals are typically noisy and originate from highly recurrent networks, generating correlations in the inputs. This raises questions about the ability of plasticity mechanisms to self-organize co-tuned connectivity in neurons receiving noisy, correlated inputs. Here, we study the emergence of input selectivity and weight co-tuning in a neuron receiving input from a recurrent network via plastic feedforward connections. We demonstrate that while strong noise levels destroy the emergence of co-tuning in the readout neuron, introducing specific structures in the non-plastic pre-synaptic connectivity can re-establish it by generating a favourable correlation structure in the population activity. We further show that structured recurrent connectivity can impact the statistics in fully plastic recurrent networks, driving the formation of co-tuning in neurons that do not receive direct input from other areas. Our findings indicate that the network dynamics created by simple, biologically plausible structural connectivity patterns can enhance the ability of synaptic plasticity to learn input-output relationships in higher brain areas.

In 2008–2011 Forsyth County, North Carolina experienced a four-fold increase in syphilis rising to over 35 cases per 100,000 mirroring the 2021 state syphilis rate. Our methodology extends current models with: 1) donut geomasking to enhance resolution while protecting patient privacy; 2) a moving window uniform grid to control the modifiable area unit problem, edge effect and remove kriging islands; and 3) mitigating the “small number problem” with Uniform Model Bayesian Maximum Entropy. Data is 2008–2011 early syphilis cases reported to the NC Department of Health and Human Services for Forsyth County. Results were assessed using latent rate theory cross validation. We show combining a moving window and a UMBME analysis with geomasked data effectively predicted the true or latent syphilis rate 5% to 26% more accurate than the traditional, geopolitical boundary method. It removed kriging islands, reduced background incidence rate to 0, relocated nine outbreak hotspots to more realistic locations, and elucidated hotspot connectivity producing more realistic geographical patterns for targeted insights. Using the Forsyth outbreak as a case study showed how the outbreak emerged from endemic areas spreading through sexual core transmitters and contextualizing the outbreak to current and past outbreaks. As the dynamics of sexually transmitted infections spread have changed to online partnership selection and demographically to include more women, partnership selection continues to remain highly localized. Furthermore, it is important to present methods to increase interpretability and accuracy of visual representations of data.

Curiosity-driven exploration involves actively engaging with the environment to learn from it. Here, we hypothesize that the cognitive mechanisms underlying exploratory behavior may differ across individuals depending on personal characteristics such as autistic traits. In turn, this variability might influence successful exploration. To investigate this, we collected self- and other-reports of autistic traits from university students, and tested them in an exploration task in which participants could learn the hiding patterns of multiple characters. Participants’ prediction errors and learning progress (i.e., the decrease in prediction error) on the task were tracked with a hierarchical delta-rule model. Crucially, participants could freely decide when to disengage from a character and what to explore next. We examined whether autistic traits modulated the relation of prediction errors and learning progress with exploration. We found that participants with lower scores on other-reports of insistence-on-sameness and general autistic traits were less persistent, primarily relying on learning progress during the initial stages of exploration. Conversely, participants with higher scores were more persistent and relied on learning progress in later phases of exploration, resulting in better performance in the task. This research advances our understanding of the interplay between autistic traits and exploration drives, emphasizing the importance of individual traits in learning processes and highlighting the need for personalized learning approaches.

                <p>by Malin Ramne, Jon Sensinger</p>

Pain perception is influenced not only by sensory input from afferent neurons but also by cognitive factors such as prior expectations. It has been suggested that overly precise priors may be a key contributing factor to chronic pain states such as neuropathic pain. However, it remains an open question how overly precise priors in favor of pain might arise. Here, we first verify that a Bayesian approach can describe how statistical integration of prior expectations and sensory input results in pain phenomena such as placebo hypoalgesia, nocebo hyperalgesia, chronic pain, and spontaneous neuropathic pain. Our results indicate that the value of the prior, which is determined by the internal model parameters, may be a key contributor to these phenomena. Next, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian approach to update the parameters of the internal model based on the difference between the predicted and the perceived pain, to reflect that people integrate prior experiences in their future expectations. In contrast with simpler approaches, this hierarchical model structure is able to show for placebo hypoalgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia how these phenomena can arise from prior experiences in the form of a classical conditioning procedure. We also demonstrate the phenomenon of offset analgesia, in which a disproportionally large pain decrease is obtained following a minor reduction in noxious stimulus intensity. Finally, we turn to simulations of neuropathic pain, where our hierarchical model corroborates that persistent non-neuropathic pain is a risk factor for developing neuropathic pain following denervation, and additionally offers an interesting prediction that complete absence of informative painful experiences could be a similar risk factor. Taken together, these results provide insight to how prior experiences may contribute to pain perception, in both experimental and neuropathic pain, which in turn might be informative for improving strategies of pain prevention and relief.

                <p>by Tamjid A. Chowdhury, David A. Luy, Garrett Scapellato, Dorian Farache, Amy S. Y. Lee, Christopher C. Quinn</p>

Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be a key component of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, intellectual disability, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that protect against mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodevelopment. Here, we address this question through the investigation of <i>rbm-26</i>, the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> ortholog of the <i>RBM27</i> autism candidate gene, which encodes an RNA-binding protein whose role in neurons is unknown. We report that RBM-26 (RBM26/27) protects against axonal defects by negatively regulating expression of the MALS-1 (MALSU1) mitoribosomal assembly factor. Autism-associated missense variants in RBM-26 cause a sharp decrease in RBM-26 protein expression along with defects in axon overlap and axon degeneration that occurs during larval development. Using a biochemical screen, we identified the mRNA for the MALS-1 mitoribosomal assembly factor as a binding partner for RBM-26. Loss of RBM-26 function causes a dramatic overexpression of <i>mals-1</i> mRNA and MALS-1 protein. Moreover, genetic analysis indicates that this overexpression of MALS-1 is responsible for the mitochondrial and axon degeneration defects in <i>rbm-26</i> mutants. These observations reveal a mechanism that regulates expression of a mitoribosomal assembly factor to protect against axon degeneration during neurodevelopment.

                <p>by F. Chris Bennett, Mariko L. Bennett</p>

Clearance of dying neurons by microglia is critical to healthy neurodevelopment, but what else do microglia eat? A new study in PLOS Biology demonstrates that microglia not only eat neurons but each other, and that this “microglia cannibalism” causes necroptotic cell death.

During brain development, neurons are selectively cleared by microglia to sculpt neural circuits. This primer discusses a recent study in PLOS Biology showing that microglia also clear away debris from other microglia, which is followed by microglial necroptosis.

The spinal cord is of fundamental importance for integrative processing in brain–body communication, yet routine noninvasive recordings in humans are hindered by vast methodological challenges. Here, we overcome these challenges by developing an easy-to-use electrophysiological approach based on high-density multichannel spinal recordings combined with multivariate spatial-filtering analyses. These advances enable a spatiotemporal characterization of spinal cord responses and demonstrate a sensitivity that permits assessing even single-trial responses. To furthermore enable the study of integrative processing along the neural processing hierarchy in somatosensation, we expand this approach by simultaneous peripheral, spinal, and cortical recordings and provide direct evidence that bottom-up integrative processing occurs already within the spinal cord and thus after the first synaptic relay in the central nervous system. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by providing noninvasive recordings of nociceptive spinal cord responses during heat-pain stimulation. Beyond establishing a new window on human spinal cord function at millisecond timescale, this work provides the foundation to study brain–body communication in its entirety in health and disease.

                <p>by Philipp Huettemann, Pavithra Mahadevan, Justine Lempart, Eric Tse, Budheswar Dehury, Brian F. P. Edwards, Daniel R. Southworth, Bikash R. Sahoo, Ursula Jakob</p>

Aberrant aggregation of α-Synuclein is the pathological hallmark of a set of neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have led to the structural determination of the first synucleinopathy-derived α-Synuclein fibrils, which contain a non-proteinaceous, “mystery density” at the core of the protofilaments, hypothesized to be highly negatively charged. Guided by previous studies that demonstrated that polyphosphate (polyP), a universally conserved polyanion, significantly accelerates α-Synuclein fibril formation, we conducted blind docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments to model the polyP binding site in α-Synuclein fibrils. Here, we demonstrate that our models uniformly place polyP into the lysine-rich pocket, which coordinates the mystery density in patient-derived fibrils. Subsequent in vitro studies and experiments in cells revealed that substitution of the 2 critical lysine residues K43 and K45 with alanine residues leads to a loss of all previously reported effects of polyP binding on α-Synuclein, including stimulation of fibril formation, change in filament conformation and stability as well as alleviation of cytotoxicity. In summary, our study demonstrates that polyP fits the unknown electron density present in in vivo α-Synuclein fibrils and suggests that polyP exerts its functions by neutralizing charge repulsion between neighboring lysine residues.

                Reproducibility is a basis of scientific integrity, yet it remains a significant challenge across disciplines in computational science. This reproducibility crisis is now being met with an Open Science movement, which has risen to prominence within the scientific community and academic libraries especially. To address the need for reproducible computational research and promote Open Science within the community, members of the Open Science and Data Collaborations Program at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries organized a single-day hackathon centered around reproducibility. Partnering with a faculty researcher in English and Digital Humanities, this event allowed several students an opportunity to interact with real research outputs, test the reproducibility of data analyses with code, and offer feedback for improvements. With Python code and data shared by the researcher in an open repository, we revealed that students could successfully reproduce most of the data visualizations, but they required completing some manual setup and modifications to address depreciated libraries to successfully rerun the code. During the event, we also investigated the option of using ChatGPT to debug and troubleshoot rerunning this code. By interacting with a ChatGPT API in the code, we found and addressed the same roadblocks and successfully reproduced the same figures as the participating students. Assessing a second option, we also collaborated with the researcher to publish a compute capsule in Code Ocean. This option presented an alternative to manual setup and modifications, an accessible option for more limited devices like tablets, and a simple solution for outside researchers to modify or build on existing research code.

                Background Coffee-growing communities in Yayu, Southwestern Ethiopia, are perceived to be food secure due to income from coffee production. However, while income ensures caloric sufficiency, it does not necessarily translate into complete food security, especially in terms of nutrient intake. Our study assessed the food and nutrition security of smallholder farm households in Yayu, with a particular focus on dietary diversity and hidden hunger. We found significant gaps in nutritional intake, especially for vulnerable groups such as women and children under five. Policy and Implications Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) targets food-insecure areas based on economic status, assuming that income ensures food security. However, our findings suggest that this approach may be flawed, as households in coffee-growing regions are often labeled food secure despite significant deficiencies in essential nutrients such as heme iron. This calls for a re-evaluation of food security policies in cash-crop-dominated areas to address not only income but also access to diverse and nutrient-rich foods. Recommendations 1. Enhance Nutritional Education: Implement targeted educational programs focusing on the importance of dietary diversity, particularly in coffee-producing areas. 2. Diversify Agriculture: Encourage smallholder farmers to diversify crops, integrating nutrient-dense foods alongside coffee cultivation. 3. Improve Market Access: Strengthen local markets to ensure that nutrient-rich foods are available and affordable during both surplus and shortage seasons. 4. Revise PSNP Criteria: Use localized food and nutrition data rather than income alone to identify food insecurity in cash-crop regions. Conclusion Income from coffee production in Yayu improves caloric sufficiency but does not guarantee nutritional adequacy. To combat hidden hunger, policies must move beyond income-based indicators of food security and prioritize access to diverse, nutrient-rich foods. This will ensure a more comprehensive approach to food and nutrition security in Ethiopia’s coffee-growing regions.

                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Whereas highly cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with small infarcts, whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains cost-effective in patients with extensive ischemic injury is uncertain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the United States, Australian, and Spanish societal perspectives, using a 7-state Markov model, with each state defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Initial probabilities at 3 months were derived from the SELECT2 trial. All other model inputs, including transition probabilities, health care and non-health care costs, and utility weights, were sourced from published literature and government websites. Our analysis included extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EVT in patients with large ischemic stroke improved health outcomes and was associated with lower costs from a societal viewpoint. EVT was cost-effective with a mean between-group difference of 1.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a cost-saving of $23,409 in the United States, $10,691 in Australia, and $30,036 in Spain, in addition to uncosted benefits in productivity for patients and carers. Subgroup analyses were directionally consistent with the overall population, notably with preserved cost-effectiveness in older patients (≥ 70 years) and those with more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 20). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the base-case results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EVT demonstrated cost-effectiveness in patients with large core across different settings in the United States, Australia, and Spain, including older patients and those with more severe strokes. These results further support adaptation of systems of care to accommodate the expansion of thrombectomy eligibility to patients with large cores and maximize EVT benefits.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses high mortality and morbidity rates with limited evidence-based therapeutic approaches. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in the management of ICH.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This systematic review and meta-analysis followed recommended guidelines and protocols. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception up to April 12, 2024. The inclusion was restricted to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of high quality, ensuring they were not deemed to have a high risk of bias in any of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) domains. Primary outcomes were good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0–3) and mortality beyond 90 days. Secondary outcomes were early mortality within 30 days and rebleeding rates. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fourteen high-quality RCTs were included. There were 3,027 patients with ICH (1,475 randomized to MIS, and 1,452 randomized to medical management or craniotomy). Of included patients, 1,899 (62.7%) were males. MIS resulted in higher odds of achieving long-term good functional outcome (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.25–1.82]), lower odds of long-term mortality (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.90]) and lower odds of early mortality (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.95]). Rebleeding rates were similar (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.55–2.19]). The treatment effect of MIS was consistent across multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including individuals with deep ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This meta-analysis provides high-quality clinical trial evidence supporting the use of MIS as a primary treatment strategy in the management of ICH. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background During pregnancy, the placenta is an extremely important organ as it secretes its own hormones, e.g. insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), to ensure proper intrauterine fetal growth and development. Ethanol, an addictive and widely used drug, has numerous adverse effects during pregnancy, including fetal growth restriction (FGR). To date, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol triggers its toxic effects during pregnancy, particularly in the placenta, are not entirely known. For this reason, a murine model of partial IGF-1 deficiency was used to determine ethanol alterations in placental morphology and aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase (AAH) expression. Methods Wild type (WT, Igf1 +/+) and heterozygous (HZ, Igf1 +/-) female mice were given 10% ethanol in water during 14 days as an acclimation period and throughout pregnancy. WT and HZ female mice given water were used as controls. At gestational day 19, pregnant dams were sacrificed, placentas were collected and genotyped for subsequent studies. Results IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption during pregnancy altered placental morphology, and decreased placental efficiency and AAH expression in placentas from all genotypes. No differences were found in Igf1, Igf2, Igf1r and Igf2r mRNA expression in placentas from all groups. Conclusions IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption throughout gestation altered placental development, suggesting the crucial role of IGF-1 in the establishment of an adequate intrauterine environment that allows fetal growth. However, more studies are needed to study the precise mechanism to stablish the relation between both insults.

                Background Disregulation of coagulation is a common phenomenon in patients with high-grade glioma, a primary malignant brain tumor. Objective Identify if there is an alteration in the coagulation profile in patients with high-grade glioma compared to other patients with benign brain tumors. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) preformance status at admission, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and blood panel results of 21 high-grade glioma patients (cases) and 42 meningioma patients (controls) from northern Peru were reviewed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were performed to determine which factors are associated with glioma. Results Both groups had high proportions of high blood pressure (29%) and diabetes mellitus (14%). According to multivariate analysis, altered values for prothrombin time, platelet count, and ECOG score were associated with glioma (p=0.01). Furthermore, alterations in the blood panel were observed in both cases and controls but failed to reach statistical significance. We also observe that some glioma patients have increased prothrombin time compared to reference values. Conclusion Patients with high-grade glioma seem to suffer more from altered coagulation states than other patients with benign brain tumors, suggesting careful vigilance, measurement, and treatment of abnormal coagulation.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background People need critical thinking skills to make well-informed health choices and avoid waste and unnecessary suffering. However, educational interventions can have adverse effects, which is often overlooked. We created a framework of potential harms of interventions to improve critical thinking about health choices. The objective was to identify potential effects and articulate potential mechanisms. We intended to use the framework to inform the development and evaluation of an intervention in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Methods We created an initial framework drawing on two earlier frameworks. We surveyed external experts using Likert-scale and open-ended items, including researchers, educators, and others, in a variety of relevant fields. We emailed the survey to an international advisory network, and all other experts recommended by respondents. We analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We revised the framework based on those results. To identify any effects missing from the revised framework, we individually interviewed a convenience sample of one teacher from each of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Results We received responses from 38 of 70 external experts (54%). The quantitative survey data suggested respondents agreed with the initial framework overall. However, the qualitative data led to substantial revisions. The revised framework consists of categories of adverse outcomes; outcomes within each category; sub-outcomes; individuals, groups, and populations that might experience each adverse outcome; beneficial outcomes corresponding with adverse outcomes; and potential mechanisms of adverse effects. There are six categories: decision-making harms, psychological harms, equity harms, group and social harms, waste, and other harms. In the interviews with teachers, we did not identify any effects missing from the revised framework. Conclusions As far as we know, the framework is the first tool of its kind for education research. It can be improved upon and adapted.
