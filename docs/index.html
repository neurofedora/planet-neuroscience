              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12809">Cerebral microbleeds: Association with cognitive decline and pathology build-up</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral microbleeds, markers of brain damage from vascular and amyloid pathologies, are linked to cognitive decline in aging, but their role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and progression remains unclear. This study aimed to explore whether the presence and location of lobar microbleeds are associated with amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)-PET, tau tangle formation (tau-PET), and longitudinal cognitive decline. We analyzed 1,573 ADNI participants with MR imaging data and information on the number and location of microbleeds. Associations between lobar microbleeds and pathology, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetics, and cognition were examined, focusing on regional microbleeds and domain-specific cognitive decline using ordinary least-squares regression while adjusting for covariates. Cognitive decline was assessed with ADAS-Cog11 and its domain-specific sub-scores. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing at least twice, with a minimum two-year interval between assessments. Among the 1,573 participants (692 women, mean age 71.23 years), 373 participants had microbleeds. The presence of microbleeds was linked to cognitive decline, particularly in the semantic, language, and praxis domains for those with temporal lobe microbleeds. Microbleeds in the overall cortex were associated with language decline. Pathologically, temporal lobe microbleeds were associated with increased tau in the overall cortex, while cortical microbleeds were linked to elevated A$\beta$ in the temporal, parietal, and frontal regions. In this mixed population, microbleeds were connected to longitudinal cognitive decline, especially in semantic and language domains, and were associated with higher baseline A$\beta$ and tau pathology. These findings suggest that lobar microbleeds should be included in AD diagnostic and prognostic evaluations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13034">Synthesis and Perceptual Scaling of High Resolution Natural Images Using Stable Diffusion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.13034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural scenes are of key interest for visual perception. Previous work on natural scenes has frequently focused on collections of discrete images with considerable physical differences from stimulus to stimulus. For many purposes it would, however, be desirable to have sets of natural images that vary smoothly along a continuum (for example in order to measure quantitative properties such as thresholds or precisions). This problem has typically been addressed by morphing a source into a target image. However, this approach yields transitions between images that primarily follow their low-level physical features and that can be semantically unclear or ambiguous. Here, in contrast, we used a different approach (Stable Diffusion XL) to synthesise a custom stimulus set of photorealistic images that are characterized by gradual transitions where each image is a clearly interpretable but unique exemplar from the same category. We developed natural scene stimulus sets from six categories with 18 objects each. For each object we generated 10 graded variants that are ordered along a perceptual continuum. We validated the image set psychophysically in a large sample of participants, ensuring that stimuli for each exemplar have varying levels of perceptual confusability. This image set is of interest for studies on visual perception, attention and short- and long-term memory.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13466">Seizure Onset Zone Localisation Algorithms with Intracranial EEG: Evaluating Methodological Variations and Targeted Features</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During clinical treatment for epilepsy, the area of the brain thought to be responsible for pathological activity - known as the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is identified. This is typically performed through visual assessment of EEG recordings; however, this is time consuming and prone to subjective inconsistency. Automated SOZ localisation algorithms provide objective identification of the SOZ by highlighting changes in signal features associated with seizure onset. In this work we investigate how methodological differences in such algorithms can result in different SOZ localisations.
  We analysed ictal intracranial EEG (icEEG) recordings in 16 subjects (100 seizures) with drug-resistant epilepsy from the SWEZ-ETHZ public database. Through our analysis, we identified a series of key methodological differences that must be considered when designing or selecting a SOZ localisation algorithm. These differences were demonstrated using three distinct algorithms that capture different, but complementary, seizure onset features: Imprint, Epileptogenicity Index (EI), and Low Entropy Map (LEM). We assessed methodological differences at each Decision Point, comparing the resultant SOZ localisations.
  Our independent application of all three algorithms to the same ictal icEEG dataset revealed low agreement between algorithms: 27-60% of seizure onsets were as minimally or non-overlapping (<25% overlap). Therefore, we investigated the effect of three key methodological differences (or Decision Points). Changes at each Decision Point were found to result in significantly different SOZ localisations (p<0.05).
  Our results demonstrate how seemingly small methodological changes can result in large differences in SOZ localisations. We propose that key Decision Points must be considered when using or designing a SOZ localisation algorithm.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13669">Theta and/or alpha? Neural oscillational substrates for dynamic inter-brain synchrony during mother-child cooperation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mother-child interaction is a highly dynamic process neurally characterized by inter-brain synchrony (IBS) at {\theta} and/or {\alpha} rhythms. However, their establishment, dynamic changes, and roles in mother-child interactions remain unknown. Through dynamic analysis of dual-EEG from 40 mother-child dyads during turn-taking cooperation, we uncover that {\theta}-IBS and {\alpha}-IBS alternated with interactive behaviors, with EEG frequency-shift as a prerequisite for IBS transitions. When mothers attempt to track their children's attention and/or predict their intentions, they will adjust their EEG frequencies to align with their children's {\theta} oscillations, leading to a higher occurrence of the {\theta}-IBS state. Conversely, the {\alpha}-IBS state, accompanied by the EEG frequency-shift to the {\alpha} range, is more prominent during mother-led interactions. Further exploratory analysis reveals greater presence and stability of the {\theta}-IBS state during cooperative than non-cooperative conditions, particularly in dyads with stronger emotional attachments and more frequent interactions in their daily lives. Our findings shed light on the neural oscillational substrates underlying the IBS dynamics during mother-child interactions.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, an increasing array of control-theoretic methods have been used to study the brain as a complex dynamical system and better understand its structure-function relationship. This article provides an overview on one such family of methods, based on the linear-threshold rate (LTR) dynamics, which arises when modeling the spiking activity of neuronal populations and their impact on each other. LTR dynamics exhibit a wide range of behaviors based on network topologies and inputs, including mono- and multi-stability, limit cycles, and chaos, allowing it to be used to model many complex brain processes involving fast and slow inhibition, multiple time and spatial scales, different types of neural behavior, and higher-order interactions. Here we investigate how the versatility of LTR dynamics paired with concepts and tools from systems and control can provide a computational theory for explaining the dynamical mechanisms enabling different brain processes. Specifically, we illustrate stability and stabilization properties of LTR dynamics and how they are related to goal-driven selective attention, multistability and its relationship with declarative memory, and bifurcations and oscillations and their role in modeling seizure dynamics in epilepsy. We conclude with a discussion on additional properties of LTR dynamics and an outlook on other brain processess that for which they might be play a similar role.

                arXiv:2410.12866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have enabled the decoding of lexical tones from intracranial recordings, offering the potential to restore the communication abilities of speech-impaired tonal language speakers. However, data heterogeneity induced by both physiological and instrumental factors poses a significant challenge for unified invasive brain tone decoding. Traditional subject-specific models, which operate under a heterogeneous decoding paradigm, fail to capture generalized neural representations and cannot effectively leverage data across subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce Homogeneity-Heterogeneity Disentangled Learning for neural Representations (H2DiLR), a novel framework that disentangles and learns both the homogeneity and heterogeneity from intracranial recordings across multiple subjects. To evaluate H2DiLR, we collected stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple participants reading Mandarin materials comprising 407 syllables, representing nearly all Mandarin characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H2DiLR, as a unified decoding paradigm, significantly outperforms the conventional heterogeneous decoding approach. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that H2DiLR effectively captures both homogeneity and heterogeneity during neural representation learning.

Abstract: We propose a new method of independent component analysis (ICA) in order to extract appropriate features from high-dimensional data. In general, matrix factorization methods including ICA have a problem regarding the interpretability of extracted features. For the improvement of interpretability, it is considered that sparse constraint on a factorized matrix is helpful. With this background, we construct a new ICA method with sparsity. In our method, the L1-regularization term is added to the cost function of ICA, and minimization of the cost function is performed by difference of convex functions algorithm. For the validity of our proposed method, we apply it to synthetic data and real functional magnetic resonance imaging data.

Abstract: A different method of discovering how neurons are connected to process information is presented here: Design a simple logic circuit that can perform a single, biologically advantageous function. Engineering concepts can be helpful in choosing the function and in designing the logic circuit. Several implementations of the method are reviewed to demonstrate how a biologically advantageous function can be chosen, how one simple network can generate major phenomena that are widely considered unrelated, and how one network design can lead to others that explain entirely different aspects of the brain. These results show that the method can benefit neuromorphic engineering as well as neuroscience, and that some brain functions can be carried out remarkably simply, at least in principle if not in the details.

                arXiv:2408.15982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of cognition requires a framework that bridges evolutionary principles with neurocomputational mechanisms. This paper introduces the novel "thoughtseed" framework, proposing that cognition arises from the dynamic interaction of self-organizing units of embodied knowledge called "thoughtseeds" within the Global Workspace of consciousness. Leveraging foundational concepts from evolutionary theory, neuronal packets, and free energy principle, we propose a hierarchical model of cognitive states, comprising Neuronal Packet Domains (NPDs), Knowledge Domains (KDs), the thoughtseed network, and meta-cognition. This hierarchical interplay, mediated by nested Markov blankets and reciprocal message passing, facilitates the emergence of thoughtseeds as coherent patterns of activity that guide perception, action, and learning. Thoughtseeds, posited as fundamental units of thought, compete for dominance within the Global Workspace, with the dominant thoughtseed shaping conscious experience and guiding behavior. We present a mathematical framework grounded in active inference and dynamical systems theory to model thoughtseed dynamics and their contribution to the unitary nature of consciousness. The thoughtseed framework offers a promising step towards a novel, biologically-grounded model for understanding the organizing principles and emergence of embodied cognition, offering a unified account of cognitive phenomena, with potential applications in understanding consciousness, attention, and decision-making.

                arXiv:2406.03380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the complex connectivity structure of the brain shapes its information-processing capabilities is a long-standing question. By focusing on a paradigmatic architecture, we study how the neural activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations encodes information on external signals. We show that at long times information is maximized at the edge of stability, where inhibition balances excitation, both in linear and nonlinear regimes. In the presence of multiple external signals, this maximum corresponds to the entropy of the input dynamics. By analyzing the case of a prolonged stimulus, we find that stronger inhibition is instead needed to maximize the instantaneous sensitivity, revealing an intrinsic trade-off between short-time responses and long-time accuracy. In agreement with recent experimental findings, our results pave the way for a deeper information-theoretic understanding of how the balance between excitation and inhibitions controls optimal information-processing in neural populations.

                arXiv:2408.05834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unexpected stimuli induce "error" or "surprise" signals in the brain. The theory of predictive coding promises to explain these observations in terms of Bayesian inference by suggesting that the cortex implements variational inference in a probabilistic graphical model. However, when applied to machine learning tasks, this family of algorithms has yet to perform on par with other variational approaches in high-dimensional, structured inference problems. To address this, we introduce a novel predictive coding algorithm for structured generative models, that we call divide-and-conquer predictive coding (DCPC). DCPC differs from other formulations of predictive coding, as it respects the correlation structure of the generative model and provably performs maximum-likelihood updates of model parameters, all without sacrificing biological plausibility. Empirically, DCPC achieves better numerical performance than competing algorithms and provides accurate inference in a number of problems not previously addressed with predictive coding. We provide an open implementation of DCPC in Pyro on Github.

                arXiv:2402.00300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Children learn powerful internal models of the world around them from a few years of egocentric visual experience. Can such internal models be learned from a child's visual experience with highly generic learning algorithms or do they require strong inductive biases? Recent advances in collecting large-scale, longitudinal, developmentally realistic video datasets and generic self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms are allowing us to begin to tackle this nature vs. nurture question. However, existing work typically focuses on image-based SSL algorithms and visual capabilities that can be learned from static images (e.g. object recognition), thus ignoring temporal aspects of the world. To close this gap, here we train self-supervised video models on longitudinal, egocentric headcam recordings collected from a child over a two year period in their early development (6-31 months). The resulting models are highly effective at facilitating the learning of action concepts from a small number of labeled examples; they have favorable data size scaling properties; and they display emergent video interpolation capabilities. Video models also learn more accurate and more robust object representations than image-based models trained with the exact same data. These results suggest that important temporal aspects of a child's internal model of the world may be learnable from their visual experience using highly generic learning algorithms and without strong inductive biases.

                arXiv:2410.11164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of initial connectivity on learning has been extensively studied in the context of backpropagation-based gradient descent, but it remains largely underexplored in biologically plausible learning settings. Focusing on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we found that the initial weight magnitude significantly influences the learning performance of biologically plausible learning rules in a similar manner to its previously observed effect on training via backpropagation through time (BPTT). By examining the maximum Lyapunov exponent before and after training, we uncovered the greater demands that certain initialization schemes place on training to achieve desired information propagation properties. Consequently, we extended the recently proposed gradient flossing method, which regularizes the Lyapunov exponents, to biologically plausible learning and observed an improvement in learning performance. To our knowledge, we are the first to examine the impact of initialization on biologically plausible learning rules for RNNs and to subsequently propose a biologically plausible remedy. Such an investigation could lead to predictions about the influence of initial connectivity on learning dynamics and performance, as well as guide neuromorphic design.

Abstract: This work addresses the critical challenge of optimal filter selection for a novel trace gas measurement device. This device uses photonic crystal filters to retrieve trace gas concentrations prone to photon and read noise. The filter selection directly influences accuracy and precision of the gas retrieval and therefore is a crucial performance driver. We formulate the problem as a stochastic combinatorial optimization problem and develop a simulator mimicking gas retrieval with noise. The objective function for selecting filters reducing retrieval error is minimized by the employed metaheuristics, that represent various families of optimizers. We aim to improve the found top-performing algorithms using our novel distance-driven extensions, that employ metrics on the space of filter selections. This leads to a novel adaptation of the UMDA algorithm, we call UMDA-U-PLS-Dist, equipped with one of the proposed distance metrics as the most efficient and robust solver among the considered ones. Analysis of filter sets produced by this method reveals that filters with relatively smooth transmission profiles but containing high contrast improve the device performance. Moreover, the top-performing obtained solution shows significant improvement compared to the baseline.

                arXiv:2410.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers serve as the backbone architectures of Foundational Models, where a domain-specific tokenizer helps them adapt to various domains. Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently emerged as a leading model in geometric deep learning, outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various graph learning tasks. However, the development of tokenizers for graphs has lagged behind other modalities, with existing approaches relying on heuristics or GNNs co-trained with Transformers. To address this, we introduce GQT (\textbf{G}raph \textbf{Q}uantized \textbf{T}okenizer), which decouples tokenizer training from Transformer training by leveraging multi-task graph self-supervised learning, yielding robust and generalizable graph tokens. Furthermore, the GQT utilizes Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to learn hierarchical discrete tokens, resulting in significantly reduced memory requirements and improved generalization capabilities. By combining the GQT with token modulation, a Transformer encoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on 16 out of 18 benchmarks, including large-scale homophilic and heterophilic datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12984">Double-Bayesian Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary machine learning methods will try to approach the Bayes error, as it is the lowest possible error any model can achieve. This paper postulates that any decision is composed of not one but two Bayesian decisions and that decision-making is, therefore, a double-Bayesian process. The paper shows how this duality implies intrinsic uncertainty in decisions and how it incorporates explainability. The proposed approach understands that Bayesian learning is tantamount to finding a base for a logarithmic function measuring uncertainty, with solutions being fixed points. Furthermore, following this approach, the golden ratio describes possible solutions satisfying Bayes' theorem. The double-Bayesian framework suggests using a learning rate and momentum weight with values similar to those used in the literature to train neural networks with stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: We consider the problem of team formation within multiagent adversarial games. We propose BERTeam, a novel algorithm that uses a transformer-based deep neural network with Masked Language Model training to select the best team of players from a trained population. We integrate this with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning, which trains a diverse set of individual players to choose teams from. We test our algorithm in the multiagent adversarial game Marine Capture-The-Flag, and we find that BERTeam learns non-trivial team compositions that perform well against unseen opponents. For this game, we find that BERTeam outperforms MCAA, an algorithm that similarly optimizes team formation.

Abstract: We explored the mathematical foundations of Recurrent Neural Networks ($\mathtt{RNN}$s) and three fundamental procedures: temporal rescaling, discretisation and linearisation. These techniques provide essential tools for characterizing $\mathtt{RNN}$s behaviour, enabling insights into temporal dynamics, practical computational implementation, and linear approximations for analysis. We discuss the flexible order of application of these procedures, emphasizing their significance in modelling and analyzing $\mathtt{RNN}$s for neuroscience and machine learning applications. We explicitly describe here under what conditions these procedures can be interchangeable.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07811">Evolutionary Computation and Explainable AI: A Roadmap to Understandable Intelligent Systems</a></h4>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence methods are being increasingly applied across various domains, but their often opaque nature has raised concerns about accountability and trust. In response, the field of explainable AI (XAI) has emerged to address the need for human-understandable AI systems. Evolutionary computation (EC), a family of powerful optimization and learning algorithms, offers significant potential to contribute to XAI, and vice versa. This paper provides an introduction to XAI and reviews current techniques for explaining machine learning models. We then explore how EC can be leveraged in XAI and examine existing XAI approaches that incorporate EC techniques. Furthermore, we discuss the application of XAI principles within EC itself, investigating how these principles can illuminate the behavior and outcomes of EC algorithms, their (automatic) configuration, and the underlying problem landscapes they optimize. Finally, we discuss open challenges in XAI and highlight opportunities for future research at the intersection of XAI and EC. Our goal is to demonstrate EC's suitability for addressing current explainability challenges and to encourage further exploration of these methods, ultimately contributing to the development of more understandable and trustworthy ML models and EC algorithms.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Co-occurring mental health conditions affect autistic individuals at high rates, impacting their well-being and quality of life. Mental health conditions are often appropriate treatment targets that can improve the lives of autistic individuals. Because of this, there is growing interest in predictors of mental health and behavioral outcomes. Given the rapidly evolving evidence base and growing literature using longitudinal cohorts, it is unclear which predictors of symptoms of anxiety and depression are consistent, and which are not. Additionally, it is difficult to deduce which predictors of mental health symptoms at a given time also predict change over time. This can be partially due to the different statistical approaches that are implemented, including trajectory vs. non-trajectory methodologies. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate how non-trajectory and trajectory analyses inform our knowledge of how symptoms of anxiety and depression change over time. Additionally, we aimed to identify important predictors of change and later anxiety and depressive symptoms in autistic individuals. Results: There is variability in symptoms of anxiety and depression in autistic individuals. Adaptive skills arose as significant predictors of change and of later symptoms of both anxiety and depression. Peer relationships in school age seem to be particularly important in predicting later symptoms of depression. Conclusions: This review provides evidence that there are different trajectories and different patterns of mental health symptoms over the lifespan, providing further evidence that autism is a developmental condition that changes over time in different ways for different people. Implications and future directions are further discussed.</p>

                Background Individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), particularly those with the rigid-akinetic with postural instability (RA) subtype, often experience motor symptoms that impair functionality and postural control. Physiotherapy interventions, including both dry land and aquatic therapies, can help manage PD treatment. This study aimed to develop and assess the effects of two exercise protocols emphasizing the extensor musculature of the vertebral column (dry land and shallow water) on functional capacity in individuals with and without RA-type PD. Methods The study utilized a protocol study followed by a randomized clinical trial, with the registry number NCT04863118, involving ten RA-type PD (intervention group) and ten individuals without PD (reference group). Participants underwent exercise protocols of varying intensity levels, and their pre and post-intervention functional capacity were evaluated using standardized tests. The applicability and safety of these protocols were assessed through a self-perception questionnaire. Results Significant improvements were observed in functional capacity parameters following both dry land and aquatic physiotherapy interventions among PD individuals, including increased repetitions in the Sit-to-Stand test and reduced completion time in the Timed Up and Go test. Similar positive outcomes were observed in individuals without PD, indicating the efficacy of these interventions irrespective of PD status. Conclusion A single session of physiotherapy, whether on dry land or in shallow water, focusing on the extensor musculature of the vertebral column, enhances functional capacity in PD and non-PD individuals alike. Furthermore, the protocols demonstrated safety, comfort, and acceptability, promoting treatment adherence and future recommendations. These findings support the implementation of these protocols in clinical practice, aiding therapists in enhancing rehabilitation outcomes while ensuring individual safety.

                Abstract Background Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant global health threat, with increasing prevalence worldwide, including in Indonesia. Despite the public health impact, comprehensive data on the burden of CRE in Indonesia remains fragmented. This protocol outlines a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to estimate the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia, summarize trends over time, and identify key resistance mechanisms. Methods We will conduct a systematic search across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and local Indonesian databases, for studies reporting the prevalence of CRE in Indonesia from 2008 to 2024. Eligibility criteria include observational studies (cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control) and surveillance reports. Data extraction will focus on CRE prevalence, bacterial species, sample types, resistance mechanisms, and study settings (hospital vs. community). Quality assessment of studies will be performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analysis will be conducted using a random-effects model to estimate pooled prevalence, and subgroup analysis will explore variations by geographical region, period, and healthcare setting. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide the first comprehensive overview of CRE prevalence in Indonesia, contributing to an improved understanding of the national burden and resistance patterns. The findings will guide public health policies and inform antimicrobial stewardship efforts in Indonesia. Registration PROSPERO CRD42024580177

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/10/ENEURO.0192-24.2024?rss=1">Distinct Roles of Medial Prefrontal Cortex Subregions in the Consolidation and Recall of Remote Spatial Memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is a common belief that memories, over time, become progressively independent of the hippocampus and are gradually stored in cortical areas. This view is mainly based on evidence showing that prefrontal cortex (PFC) manipulations impair the retrieval of remote memories, while hippocampal inhibition does not. More controversial is whether activity in the medial PFC is required immediately after learning to initiate consolidation. Another question concerns functional differences among PFC subregions in forming and storing remote memories. To address these issues, we directly contrasted the effects of loss-of-function manipulations of the anterior cingulate cortex (aCC) and the ventromedial PFC, which includes the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices, before testing and immediately after training on the ability of CD1 mice to recall the hidden platform location in the Morris water maze. We injected an AAV carrying the hM4Di receptor into the PL&ndash;IL or aCC. Interestingly, pretest administrations of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 3&nbsp;mg/kg) revealed that the aCC, but not the PL&ndash;IL, was necessary to recall remote spatial information. Furthermore, systemic post-training administration of CNO impaired memory recall at remote, but not recent, time points in both groups. These findings revealed a functional dissociation between the two prefrontal areas, demonstrating that both the PL&ndash;IL and the aCC are involved in early consolidation of remote spatial memories, but only the aCC is engaged in their recall.</p>

                <p>The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway is vital in neural progenitor cell proliferation, specification, and differentiation. The BMP signaling antagonist Gremlin 2 (Grem2) is the most potent natural inhibitor of BMP expressed in the adult brain; however its function remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we have analyzed mice lacking Grem2 via homologous recombination (<I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I>). Histological analysis of brain sections revealed significant scattering of CA3 pyramidal cells within the dentate hilus in the hippocampus of <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice. Furthermore, the number of proliferating neural stem cells and neuroblasts was significantly decreased in the subgranular zone of <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice compared with that of wild-type (WT) controls. Due to the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in neurological disorders, we tested mice on a battery of neurobehavioral tests. <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice exhibited increased anxiety on the elevated zero maze in response to acute and chronic stress. Specifically, male <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice showed increased anxiogenesis following chronic stress, and this was correlated with higher levels of BMP signaling and decreased proliferation in the dentate gyrus. Additionally, when chemically challenged with kainic acid, <I>Grem2<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice displayed a higher susceptibility to and increased severity of seizures compared with WTs. Together, our data indicate that Grem2 regulates BMP signaling and is vital in maintaining homeostasis in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and structure. Furthermore, the lack of Grem2 contributes to the development and progression of neurogenesis-related disorders such as anxiety and epilepsy.</p>

                Background Globally, neonatal deaths are significantly attributed to hypothermia. This is mostly because of its co-morbidity with asphyxia, premature birth and severe neonatal infections. Worldwide, neonatal hypothermia case fatality rates (CFRs) range from 8.5% to 52%. This study aimed to assess how well a video-based training intervention on mothers’ knowledge and practices in preventing neonatal hypothermia worked. Methods The knowledge and practices of two groups of primi-para mothers—one control group and one intervention group—were compared in order to achieve this. A total of 124 primipara mothers took part in the research. Using a video based tool, the intervention group was educated about preventing hypothermia in newborns. Both control and intervention group mothers were interviewed to compare the knowledge and practices. Results Sixty-one of the sixty-two mothers in the control group were unsure of which body area to cover in order to preserve the baby’s body heat. Following the intervention, 61 out of 62 mothers in the group recognised which body part to cover to protect the baby’s body heat. In the post-intervention group, 98.4% of moms wore a cap over their baby’s head, compared to just 35.5% in the control group. Conclusion The results of this study demonstrate the significant improvement in mothers’ knowledge and actions about the prevention of neonatal hypothermia resulting from the use of a video-based training tool.

                Salivary gland cancers (SGC) are rare neoplasms that exhibit a wide array of histological heterogeneities. Most patients presenting with SGCs are asymptomatic, as they are typically slow-growing and localized. Primary surgical resection is the cornerstone treatment for SGCs and radiotherapy is performed in selected cases. There is no consensus on concrete standard post-operative guidelines. Patients are followed-up for years, however an agreed duration of follow-up is less elucidated in the literature present on the subject. Distant metastases are the primary cause of treatment failure. Post-operative diagnostic evidence of disease recurrence or distant metastases is heavily guided by radiological examinations. Patients with SGCs have better outcomes with a well-structured and lengthy follow-up plan. This review aims to suggest an appropriate follow-up duration and radiological modalities used post-operatively for SGC patients.

                Abstract Background Large Language Models (LLMs), as in the case of OpenAITM ChatGPT-4TM Turbo, are revolutionizing several industries, including higher education. In this context, LLMs can be personalised through customization process to meet the student demands on every particular subject, like statistics. Recently, OpenAI launched the possibility of customizing their model with a natural language web interface, enabling the creation of customised GPT versions deliberately conditioned to meet the demands of a specific task. Methods This preliminary research aims to assess the potential of the customised GPTs. After developing a Business Statistics Virtual Professor (BSVP), tailored for students at the Universidad Pontificia Comillas, its behaviour was evaluated and compared with that of ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Firstly, each professor collected 15-30 genuine student questions from “Statistics and Probability” and “Business Statistics” courses across seven degrees, primarily from second-year courses. These questions, often ambiguous and imprecise, were posed to ChatGPT-4 Turbo and BSVP, with their initial responses recorded without follow-ups. In the third stage, professors blindly evaluated the responses on a 0-10 scale, considering quality, depth, and personalization. Finally, a statistical comparison of the systems’ performance was conducted. Results The results lead to several conclusions. Firstly, a substantial modification in the style of communication was observed. Following the instructions it was trained with, BSVP responded in a more relatable and friendly tone, even incorporating a few minor jokes. Secondly, when explicitly asked for something like, “I would like to practice a programming exercise similar to those in R practice 4,” BSVP could provide a far superior response. Lastly, regarding overall performance, quality, depth, and alignment with the specific content of the course, no statistically significant differences were observed in the responses between BSVP and ChatGPT-4 Turbo. Conclusions It appears that customised assistants trained with prompts present advantages as virtual aids for students, yet they do not constitute a substantial improvement over ChatGPT-4 Turbo.

                Lutein, a plant-derived xanthophyl-carotenoid, is an exceptional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituent found in food. High dietary intake of lutein is beneficial against eye disease, improves cardiometabolic health, protects from neurodegenerative diseases, and is beneficial for liver, kidney, and respiratory health. Lutein protects against oxidative and nitrosative stress, both of which play a major role in long COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Lutein is an important natural agent for therapeutic use against oxidative and nitrosative stress in chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. It can also potentially inhibit spike protein-induced inflammation. Rich dietary supplementation of lutein, naturally derived in non-biodegradable Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), can most optimally be used against oxidative and nitrosative stress during post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Due to its high oleic acid (OA) content, EVOO supports optimal absorption of dietary lutein. The main molecular pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces pathology, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activated B cells (NF-κB) and activated protein (AP)-1, can be suppressed by lutein. Synergy with other natural compounds for spike protein detoxification is likely.

                Long-read sequencing technologies have transformed the field of epigenetics by enabling direct, single-base resolution detection of DNA modifications, such as methylation. This produces novel opportunities for studying the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation, imprinting, and disease. However, the unique characteristics of long-read data, including the modBAM format and extended read lengths, necessitate the development of specialised software tools for effective analysis. The NanoMethViz package provides a suite of tools for loading in long-read methylation data, visualising data at various data resolutions. It can convert the data for use with other Bioconductor software such as bsseq, DSS, dmrseq and edgeR to discover differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In this workflow article, we demonstrate the process of converting modBAM files into formats suitable for comprehensive downstream analysis. We leverage NanoMethViz to conduct an exploratory analysis, visually summarizing differences between samples, examining aggregate methylation profiles across gene and CpG islands, and investigating methylation patterns within specific regions at the single-read level. Additionally, we illustrate the use of dmrseq for identifying DMRs and show how to integrate these findings into gene-level visualization plots. Our analysis is applied to a triplicate dataset of haplotyped long-read methylation data from mouse neural stem cells, allowing us to visualize and compare the characteristics of the parental alleles on chromosome 7. By applying DMR analysis, we recover DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualise the methylation patterns of these genes summarised at single-read resolution. Through DMR analysis, we identify DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and visualize their methylation patterns at single-read resolution. This streamlined workflow is adaptable to common experimental designs and offers flexibility in the choice of upstream data sources and downstream statistical analysis tools.

The efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations. Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified, comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking. Here, we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model (mmGEM) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB). Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates (OLRs) increased, along with a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs (L-OLRs) and adaptation to high OLRs (H-OLRs). The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide (S) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance. Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance. This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.

                <p>by Yujie Zhang, Mark Mao, Robert Zhang, Yen-Te Liao, Vivian C. H. Wu</p>

Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria and can be classified into two different lifecycles. Virulent phages (or lytic phages) have a lytic cycle that can lyse the bacteria host after their infection. Temperate phages (or lysogenic phages) can integrate their phage genomes into bacterial chromosomes and replicate with bacterial hosts via the lysogenic cycle. Identifying phage lifecycles is a crucial step in developing suitable applications for phages. Compared to the complicated traditional biological experiments, several tools have been designed for predicting phage lifecycle using different algorithms, such as random forest (RF), linear support-vector classifier (SVC), and convolutional neural network (CNN). In this study, we developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based tool—DeepPL—for predicting phage lifecycles via nucleotide sequences. The test results showed that our DeepPL had an accuracy of 94.65% with a sensitivity of 92.24% and a specificity of 95.91%. Moreover, DeepPL had 100% accuracy in lifecycle prediction on the phages we isolated and biologically verified previously in the lab. Additionally, a mock phage community metagenomic dataset was used to test the potential usage of DeepPL in viral metagenomic research. DeepPL displayed a 100% accuracy for individual phage complete genomes and high accuracies ranging from 71.14% to 100% on phage contigs produced by various next-generation sequencing technologies. Overall, our study indicates that DeepPL has a reliable performance on phage lifecycle prediction using the most fundamental nucleotide sequences and can be applied to future phage and metagenomic research.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease influenced by well-established environmental exposures (most notably, cigarette smoking) and incompletely defined genetic factors. The chromosome 4q region harbors multiple genetic risk loci for COPD, including signals near <i>HHIP</i>, <i>FAM13A</i>, <i>GSTCD</i>, <i>TET2</i>, and <i>BTC</i>. Leveraging RNA-Seq data from lung tissue in COPD cases and controls, we estimated the co-expression network for genes in the 4q region bounded by <i>HHIP</i> and <i>BTC</i> (~70MB), through partial correlations informed by protein-protein interactions. We identified several co-expressed gene pairs based on partial correlations, including <i>NPNT-HHIP</i>, <i>BTC</i>-<i>NPNT</i> and <i>FAM13A</i>-<i>TET2</i>, which were replicated in independent lung tissue cohorts. Upon clustering the co-expression network, we observed that four genes previously associated to COPD: <i>BTC</i>, <i>HHIP</i>, <i>NPNT</i> and <i>PPM1K</i> appeared in the same network community. Finally, we discovered a sub-network of genes differentially co-expressed between COPD vs controls (including <i>FAM13A</i>, <i>PPA2</i>, <i>PPM1K</i> and <i>TET2)</i>. Many of these genes were previously implicated in cell-based knock-out experiments, including the knocking out of <i>SPP1</i> which belongs to the same genomic region and could be a potential local key regulatory gene. These analyses identify chromosome 4q as a region enriched for COPD genetic susceptibility and differential co-expression.

Neurocristopathies such as CHARGE syndrome result from aberrant neural crest development. A large proportion of CHARGE cases are attributed to pathogenic variants in the gene encoding CHD7, chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7, which remodels chromatin. While the role for CHD7 in neural crest development is well documented, how this factor is specifically up-regulated in neural crest cells is not understood. Here, we use epigenomic profiling of chick and human neural crest to identify a cohort of enhancers regulating <i>Chd7</i> expression in neural crest cells and other tissues. We functionally validate upstream transcription factor binding at candidate enhancers, revealing novel epistatic relationships between neural crest master regulators and Chd7, showing tissue-specific regulation of a globally acting chromatin remodeller. Furthermore, we find conserved enhancer features in human embryonic epigenomic data and validate the activity of the human equivalent <i>CHD7</i> enhancers in the chick embryo. Our findings embed <i>Chd7</i> in the neural crest gene regulatory network and offer potentially clinically relevant elements for interpreting CHARGE syndrome cases without causative allocation.

                Introduction Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease affecting quality of life and causing pruritus. The factors influencing itch and its impact on the quality of life in Thai psoriasis patients are unknown. We aimed to identify these factors and their effect on quality of life. Methods In this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study, we included patients with psoriasis who received treatment at Chulabhorn Hospital in Thailand from January 2019 to July 2021. Interviewer is the non-dermatologist practician. The patient’s information was collected, including demographic data, Itch Numeric Rating Scale (Itch NRS) score, factors affecting itch, and score on the Thai version of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). We performed descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results Of 100 participants, most (99%) experienced itching, with a moderate degree of pruritus (mean Itch NRS score 6.5 ± 2.6) and a moderate effect on quality of life (mean DLQI score 9.4 ± 6.2). Factors associated with itch aggravation were dry skin (p-value = 0.003) and heat and humidity (p-value = 0.042). The results of binary logistic regression revealed that factors associated with moderate-to-extremely large DLQI scores were itch intensity (no-to-mild vs. moderate-to-severe itch: odds ratio [OR] = 13.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.72–65.32, p < 0.001; and adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 31.17; 95% CI = 4.55–213.36; p < 0.001. Conclusions Our findings revealed that the quality of life among patients with psoriasis is their greatest concern. Eliminating the itch intensity that affects their quality of life is crucial but remains challenging in Thailand.

Hence, this study considered the rationale for vaccine hesitancy in Pakistani university students and support staff, and the impact of gender, age, and education on vaccination hesitancy. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with randomly selected university students and supportive staff. An anonymous questionnaire collected data covering socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination status, current beliefs, and past vaccination history. Responses were assessed using descriptive analysis (p-value estimation and correlation/regression) and machine learning models applied to classify individuals based on their acceptance or vaccine hesitancy behavior and then used to predict the important variables associated with vaccine hesitancy. Results The survey of 847 participants revealed that 43% were vaccinated and 57% were vaccine hesitant; of which 37%, 38%, and 25% had safety and efficacy concerns, were afraid of side effects, or exhibited other complacency behavior regarding vaccination, respectively. Non-university educated people were significantly more hesitant than university-educated people (p = 0.033). Vaccine refusal was significantly higher in students than in supportive staff (p = 0.01). Correlation analysis revealed a strong association between key independent variables (the fear of side effects, mistrusted information, and low perceived disease risk without vaccination) and vaccine acceptance (dependent variable), as revealed by linear regression and a Structure Model Equation. Machine learning classified vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-acceptant individuals with commutative accuracy of 96% and 97%, respectively, using random forest and logistic regression. Logistic regression identified five predictors for vaccine hesitancy: low perceived disease risk without vaccination, mistrusted information, the fear of side effects, occupation, and education. Conclusion Education campaigns that cover the safety, efficacy, and importance of vaccination are needed to increase vaccination take-up to protect from COVID-19 disease.

     alt="A Neuropeptide Signaling Network That Regulates Developmental Timing and Systemic Growth in Drosophila"/>
<p>Anatomical as well as genetic analyses were performed to elucidate the role of neurons that produce neuropeptides called Hugin peptides in the larval central nervous system of the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Results suggest that Hugin peptides regulate developmental timing and body size via neurons that produce prothoracicotropic hormone.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals sense chemical cues such as nutritious and noxious stimuli through the chemosensory system and adapt their behavior, physiology, and developmental schedule to the environment. In the <i>Drosophila</i> central nervous system, chemosensory interneurons that produce neuropeptides called Hugin (Hug) peptides receive signals from gustatory receptor neurons and regulate feeding behavior. Because Hug neurons project their axons to the higher brain region within the protocerebrum where dendrites of multiple neurons producing developmentally important neuropeptides are extended, it has been postulated that Hug neurons regulate development through the neuroendocrine system. In this study, we show that Hug neurons interact with a subset of protocerebrum neurons that produce prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and regulate the onset of metamorphosis and systemic growth. Loss of the <i>hug</i> gene and silencing of Hug neurons caused a delay in larval-to-prepupal transition and an increase in final body size. Furthermore, deletion of Hug receptor-encoding genes also caused developmental delay and body size increase, and the phenotype was restored by expressing Hug receptors in PTTH-producing neurons. These results indicate that Hug neurons regulate developmental timing and body size via PTTH-producing neurons. This study provides a basis for understanding how chemosensation is converted into neuroendocrine signaling to control insect growth and development.</p>

                Xiao et al. show that PD-L1 on dendritic cells (DCs) plays a crucial role in enhancing the antitumor immune response during immunogenic chemotherapy by preventing DC ferroptosis. The absence of PD-L1 increases DC susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity, leading to reduced T cell priming and poorer patient prognosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96575">Expression of most retrotransposons in human blood correlates with biological aging</a></h4>

              
                Retrotransposons (RTEs) have been postulated to reactivate with age and contribute to aging through activated innate immune response and inflammation. Here, we analyzed the relationship between RTE expression and aging using published transcriptomic and methylomic datasets of human blood. Despite no observed correlation between RTE activity and chronological age, the expression of most RTE classes and families except short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) correlated with biological age-associated gene signature scores. Strikingly, we found that the expression of SINEs was linked to upregulated DNA repair pathways in multiple cohorts. We also observed DNA hypomethylation with aging and the significant increase in RTE expression level in hypomethylated RTEs except for SINEs. Additionally, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis suggested a role for plasma cells in aging mediated by RTEs. Altogether, our multi-omics analysis of large human cohorts highlights the role of RTEs in biological aging and suggests possible mechanisms and cell populations for future investigations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94558">A metabolic modeling-based framework for predicting trophic dependencies in native rhizobiomes of crop plants</a></h4>

              
                The exchange of metabolites (i.e., metabolic interactions) between bacteria in the rhizosphere determines various plant-associated functions. Systematically understanding the metabolic interactions in the rhizosphere, as well as in other types of microbial communities, would open the door to the optimization of specific predefined functions of interest, and therefore to the harnessing of the functionality of various types of microbiomes. However, mechanistic knowledge regarding the gathering and interpretation of these interactions is limited. Here, we present a framework utilizing genomics and constraint-based modeling approaches, aiming to interpret the hierarchical trophic interactions in the soil environment. 243 genome scale metabolic models of bacteria associated with a specific disease-suppressive vs disease-conducive apple rhizospheres were drafted based on genome-resolved metagenomes, comprising an in silico native microbial community. Iteratively simulating microbial community members’ growth in a metabolomics-based apple root-like environment produced novel data on potential trophic successions, used to form a network of communal trophic dependencies. Network-based analyses have characterized interactions associated with beneficial vs non-beneficial microbiome functioning, pinpointing specific compounds and microbial species as potential disease supporting and suppressing agents. This framework provides a means for capturing trophic interactions and formulating a range of testable hypotheses regarding the metabolic capabilities of microbial communities within their natural environment. Essentially, it can be applied to different environments and biological landscapes, elucidating the conditions for the targeted manipulation of various microbiomes, and the execution of countless predefined functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87455">Extreme positive epistasis for fitness in monosomic yeast strains</a></h4>

              
                The loss of a single chromosome in a diploid organism halves the dosage of many genes and is usually accompanied by a substantial decrease in fitness. We asked whether this decrease simply reflects the joint damage caused by individual gene dosage deficiencies. We measured the fitness effects of single heterozygous gene deletions in yeast and combined them for each chromosome. This predicted a negative growth rate, that is, lethality, for multiple monosomies. However, monosomic strains remained alive and grew as if much (often most) of the damage caused by single mutations had disappeared, revealing an exceptionally large and positive epistatic component of fitness. We looked for functional explanations by analyzing the transcriptomes. There was no evidence of increased (compensatory) gene expression on the monosomic chromosomes. Nor were there signs of the cellular stress response that would be expected if monosomy led to protein destabilization and thus cytotoxicity. Instead, all monosomic strains showed extensive upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, but in an indiscriminate manner that did not correspond to their altered dosage. This response did not restore the stoichiometry required for efficient biosynthesis, which probably became growth limiting, making all other mutation-induced metabolic defects much less important. In general, the modular structure of the cell leads to an effective fragmentation of the total mutational load. Defects outside the module(s) currently defining fitness lose at least some of their relevance, producing the epiphenomenon of positive interactions between individually negative effects.

">Uncovering locomotor learning dynamics in people with Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Locomotor learning is important for improving gait and balance impairments in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). While PD disrupts neural networks involved in motor learning, there is a limited understanding of how PD influences the time course of locomotor learning and retention. Here, we used a virtual obstacle negotiation task to investigate whether the early stages of PD affect the acquisition and retention of locomotor skills. On Day 1, 15 participants with PD and 20 age-matched controls were instructed to achieve a specified level of foot clearance while repeatedly stepping over two different virtual obstacles on a treadmill. We assessed online performance improvement on Day 1 and overnight retention after at least 24 hours on Day 2. We used a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model to estimate the learning rate and the degree of interference between the two obstacles. There was a 93% probability that people with PD learned the locomotor skill faster than controls, but there was limited evidence of group differences in interference between the two heights of obstacles. Both groups improved their performance to a similar magnitude during skill acquisition and performed similarly during retention on Day 2. Notably, a slower learning rate was associated with greater online performance improvement, while lower interference was linked to better overnight retention, and this effect was strongest for the control group. These results highlight that people with early-stage PD retain the ability to use multisensory information to acquire and retain locomotor skills. In particular, our finding that people with early-stage PD learned faster than age-matched controls may reflect the emergence of compensatory motor learning strategies used to offset early motor impairments in people with PD.

">Stereotype of mouse social competency and status revealed by a novel competition paradigm in combination with available paradigms</a></h4>

              
                With the acceleration of urbanization process, psychological, behavioral and biological studies on social organization and competition are boosting. The mouse has been recognized as valuable and economic model animal for biomedical research in social behaviors, but the application of reliable, valid and easily executable social competition paradigm for mouse is still limited. Moreover, discrepant paradigms containing different competitive factors such as muscular confrontation, threatening level, boldness or timidity tendency might lead to task-specific win-or-lose outcomes and confusing rankings. Here, we developed a mouse competition behavioral paradigm in which contenders were a pair of mice eager to take over the same food pellet hidden under a movable block in the middle of a narrow chamber where they were separated to the either right or left side. Our design mentality of this food pellet competition test (FPCT) allows experimenter to operate conveniently, avoids the direct violent competition between mice and facilitates to expose the psychological motivation of the contenders. Application of FPCT in combination with typically available paradigms, tube test and warm spot test (WST), discovered a stereotypic property of mouse social organization and competitivity in a given society of either males or females that were raised in an either 2- or 3-member cage, indicating that hierarchical sense of animals might be part of a comprehensive identify of self-recognition of individuals in an established society. More importantly, FPCT may largely facilitate the researches regarding the social organization and competition due to its reliability, validity and easy operability.

">The Role of Predictive Processing and Perceptual Load in Selective Visual Attention: An Examination with Semantically Salient and Less Salient Distractors</a></h4>

              
                Our attentional resources are allocated to the various aspects of the environment based on the context, and predictive coding has been used as a model to explain the interaction between sensory-based information and top-down expectations in visual attention (Spratling, 2008; Rauss et al., 2011). On the other hand, the saliency of the environmental stimuli is also hypothesized to be capturing the attentional resources of the individuals involuntarily, and thus, it is thought to be playing a crucial role in attentional resource allocation. The current study investigates the role of predictive processing of task difficulty in selective visual attention in the presence of various distractors. Utilizing a letter search task, we provided brief cues about the upcoming task's difficulty, and participants were asked to detect the target letters. We investigated whether predictive processing about task demands may cause a difference in behavioral measures in the presence of semantically less salient distractors in Experiment 1 (Gabor patches) and semantically more salient distractors in Experiment 2 (faces). Results showed that unmet expectations about the task demands caused longer reaction times in both studies. We observed that all independent variables, which are task difficulty, cue congruency, and distractor presence, affected reaction times in both experiments, but cue congruency interacted with distractor presence only in Experiment 2. Here, we argue that though predictive processing plays a role in attentional resource allocation and, distractors' characteristics are also crucial as the saliency level interacts with the cue congruency.

">Outdoor Air Pollution Relates to Amygdala Subregion Volume and Apportionment in Early Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Outdoor air pollution is associated with an increased risk for psychopathology. Although the neural mechanisms remain unclear, air pollutants may impact mental health by altering limbic brain regions, such as the amygdala. Here, we examine the association between ambient air pollution exposure and amygdala subregion volumes in 9-10-year-olds. Methods: Cross-sectional Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD)(R) Study data from 4,473 participants (55.4% male) were leveraged. Air pollution was estimated for each participant's primary residential address. Using the probabilistic CIT168 atlas, we quantified total amygdala and 9 distinct subregion volumes from T1- and T2-weighted images. First, we examined how criteria pollutants (i.e., fine particulate matter [PM2.5], nitrogen dioxide, ground-level ozone) and 15 PM2.5 components related with total amygdala volumes using linear mixed-effect (LME) regression. Next, partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analyses were implemented to identify relationships between co-exposure to criteria pollutants as well as PM2.5 components and amygdala subregion volumes. We also conducted complementary analyses to assess subregion apportionment using amygdala relative volume fractions (RVFs). Results: No significant associations were detected between pollutants and total amygdala volumes. Using PLSC, one latent dimension (LD) (52% variance explained) captured a positive association between calcium and several basolateral subregions. LDs were also identified for amygdala RVFs (ranging from 30% to 82% variance explained), with PM2.5 and component co-exposure associated with increases in lateral, but decreases in medial and central, RVFs. Conclusions: Fine particulate and its components are linked with distinct amygdala differences, potentially playing a role in risk for adolescent mental health problems.

">A Cortical Microcircuit for Region-Specific Credit Assignment in Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                The distributed architecture of the cortex poses a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning: how to assign credit specifically to regions that contribute to successful behavior? Cortical neurons can be driven by both global reinforcers, like rewards, and local sensory features, making it difficult to disentangle these influences. To address this, we investigated cortical reinforcement learning by manipulating the reward-predictive sensory modality during learning tasks, while monitoring key regulators of cortical activity-local inhibitory neurons, and cholinergic inputs. We found that VIP interneurons are broadly recruited by reward-predictive cues via a modality-independent cholinergic signal. However, when task demands aligned with local computation, SST interneurons suppressed VIP recruitment through an inhibitory feedback loop. A computational model demonstrates that this cholinergic-VIP-SST interneuron circuit motif enables targeted reinforcement learning and region-specific credit assignment in the cortex. These results offer a neurobiologically-grounded framework for how the cortex uses global reinforcement signals to direct plasticity to task-relevant regions, enabling those regions to adapt and fine-tune their responses.

">Unveiling the Functional Connectivity of Astrocytic Networks with AstroNet, a Graph Reconstruction Algorithm Coupled to Image Processing</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes form extended intercellular networks, displaying complex calcium activity. However, the specific organization of these astrocytic networks and the precise extent of their functional connectivity in different brain areas remain unexplored. To unveil the functional architecture of astrocytic networks, we developed, using a data-driven methodology, a novel algorithm called AstroNet that uses two-photon calcium imaging to map temporal correlations in activation events among neighboring astrocytes. Our approach involves reconstructing functional astrocytic networks by organizing individual astrocyte activation events chronologically. This chronological order creates activity paths that enable the extraction of local astrocyte functional correlations. Ultimately, by tallying the occurrences of direct co-activations between pairs of cells along these pathways, we construct a graph that mirrors the underlying astrocyte functional network. By applying this method to two distinct brain regions (CA1 hippocampus and motor cortex), we identified notable differences in local network organizations in sub-regions of around 20-40 astrocytes. Specifically, the cortex exhibited a lower connectivity, while astrocytes in the hippocampus displayed stronger connections. Moreover, we found that in both regions, astrocytic networks consist of smaller, tightly connected sub-networks embedded within a larger, more loosely connected one. Altogether, our innovative method enables the identification of activation paths among astrocytes, facilitates the characterization of local network functional connectivity, and quantifies distinct connectivity patterns among astrocytes from different brain regions. This approach sheds light on the heterogeneous functional organization of astrocytic networks within the brain, pointing to region-specific astrocyte connectivity.

                Studying the discharge patterns of motor units (MUs) is key to understanding the mechanisms underlying human motor behavior. Intramuscular electromyography (iEMG) allows direct study of MU activity, but is invasive. Surface electromyography (sEMG) offers a non-invasive alternative, but with lower spatial resolution. Recent advances in optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have sparked interest in the magnetic counterpart of EMG, magnetomyography (MMG), as an additional non-contact modality to study the neuromuscular system. However, it remains unclear whether MMG signals recorded with superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) or OPMs can be used to directly detect individual MUs. We addressed this question in a proof-of-principle study in which we recorded MMG signals from the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscle using SQUIDs and OPMs. Critically, we simultaneously recorded iEMG from the same muscle to validate the non-invasive measurements. First, we found that invasively recorded MUs can be detected in simultaneously recorded SQUID and OPM MMG signals. Second, we found that invasively validated MUs can be extracted directly from SQUID and OPM MMG. This provides converging evidence that individual MU activity is accessible using non-contact MMG. Our findings highlight the potential of MMG as a non-contact modality to measure and study muscle activity in health and disease.Studying the discharge patterns of motor units (MUs) is key to understanding the mechanisms underlying human motor behavior.

">Mindfulness training impacts brain network dynamics linked to stress response in young adolescents.</a></h4>

              
                Mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) may lead to lower levels of psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and stress in adolescents. Past research has advanced the discovery of neural architecture recruited by MBI. However, the brain mechanisms through which mindfulness exerts more resilient responses to social stressors in teens remain unclear. Here, we examined how MBI modulates changes in brain network dynamics following social stress with different affective valence (i.e., neutral, negative, and positive). For this aim, we carried out a longitudinal randomized controlled trial in which non-clinical adolescents underwent MBI for 8 weeks. They completed a psychosocial stress task before and following MBI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and self-reported measurements of psychological distress were collected in both measurement points (i.e., pre and post MBI). We computed co-activation patterns on fMRI data to characterize dynamic functional connectivity within whole-brain networks. The results depicted how MBI modulates transient co-activation changes in dorsal medial regions of the brain default network (DN) following the experience of stress. However, these brain changes were not specific to the affective valence of stressful stimuli. The relationship between the DN dynamics and the measurements of psychological distress was mediated by MBI. Globally, our findings support a model in which MBI causally mediate brain-behavior interactions related to psychosocial stress in adolescents.

">A bounded accumulation model of temporal generalization outperforms existing models and captures modality differences and learning effects</a></h4>

              
                Multiple systems in the brain track the passage of time and can adapt their activity to temporal requirements (Paton & Buonomano, 2018). While the neural implementation of timing varies widely between neural substrates and behavioral tasks, at the algorithmic level many of these behaviors can be described as bounded accumulation (Balci & Simen, 2024). So far, from the range of temporal psychophysical tasks, the bounded accumulation model has only been applied to temporal bisection, in which participants are requested to categorize an interval as "long" or "short" (Balci & Simen, 2014; Ofir & Landau, 2022). In this work, we extend the model to fit performance in the temporal generalization task, in which participants are required to categorize an interval as being the same or different compared to a standard, or reference, duration (Wearden, 1992). Previous models of performance in this task focused on either the group level or performance of highly trained animals (Birngruber et al., 2014; Church & Gibbon, 1982; Wearden, 1992). Whether the same models can fit performance from a few hundreds of trials of single participants, necessary for comparing performance across experimental manipulations, has not been tested. A drift-diffusion model with two decision boundaries fits the data of single participants better than the previous models. We ran two experiments, one comparing performance between vision and audition and another examining the effect of learning. We found that decision boundaries can be modified independently: While the upper boundary was higher in vision compared to audition, the lower boundary decreased with learning in the task.

">Spatial frequency channels mediate a visual metric for human spatial perception</a></h4>

              
                An intriguing and ubiquitous phenomenon in vision is the perception of spatial property information (e.g. separation, size, shape etc.) that departs from the raw physical inputs yet conforms to the visual context. While it has been postulated that visual system employs an internal adaptable metric by which the signals conveying the spatial property information are scaled, it remains unknown whether and how such putative visual metric is represented in the brain. Here, we hypothesized the putative visual metric is mediated by the joint responses of differently-tuned spatial frequency (SF) channels, and investigated this idea by combining the use of psychophysics, fMRI-based population receptive field (pRF) mapping and computation modeling. We found that reweighting of spatial frequency (SF) channels, either by adaption or presentation of the corresponding SF background, led to systematic distortions of the perceived spatial property information. Moreover, the pRFs in V1 were more concentrated towards the fovea under the high SF stimulation regardless of their positions in the visual field. Importantly, both the perceptual distortions and the global-scale pRF displacement were functionally coupled with the changes in the population SF response induced by SF channel reweighting. Our findings revealed, for the first time, the neural apparatus signaling the putative visual metric that constrains spatial vision by establishing the comprehensive three-way connection between SF channel reweighting, pRF position displacement and perceptual distortions of spatial property information.

">Microbially produced bile acids are associated with high levels of IgG autoantibodies and worse mental wellbeingin fibromyalgia subjects</a></h4>

              
                Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disease primarily associated with chronic widespread pain, but other common symptoms are anxiety and depression. We previously proposed that autoimmunity contributes to FM based on findings of increased immunoglobulin G binding to satellite glial cells (anti-SGC IgG) in FM subjects compared to healthy controls (HC). Emerging research suggests that an altered gut microbiota composition is connected to psychological symptoms in FM rather than pain. Gut microbiota can produce or alter bile acids (BAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which have immune and inflammatory functions. Here, we investigate alterations in BA and SCFA concentrations in FM subjects compared to healthy controls (HC) and potential associations with FM symptoms and anti-SGC IgG levels. Bile acids and SCFAs were quantified using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry and anti-SGC IgG levels were assessed with immunocytochemistry. The correlations between FM symptoms, anti-SGC IgG levels, and serum concentrations of 24 BAs and 11 SCFAs in 35 FM subjects and 32 matched HC were examined. Fibromyalgia subjects had significantly higher levels of microbially produced BAs than HC. Strikingly, 11 out of 24 BAs were significantly elevated in FM subjects with high, compared to those with low, anti-SGC IgG levels. Concentrations of specific BAs were associated with increased disease severity and worse mental well-being. These results revealed increased levels of secondary BAs in FM subjects compared to HC. The strong association between BAs, anti-SGC IgG levels, and mental well-being may help elucidate the importance of BAs in the psychological symptoms of FM.

                Perivascular spaces (PVS) play a critical role in fluid transfer and waste clearance in the brain, but few studies have explored how alterations to perivascular fluid flow may impact brain maturation and behavior. This study aims to characterize age-related alterations to perivascular and parenchymal fluid flow characteristics across the lifespan in typically developing children (8-21 years) and aging adults (35-90 years) and assess their contribution to cognition. In this study, we employ multi-compartment diffusion models, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and tissue tensor imaging (TTI), to quantify free water diffusion characteristics within automatically defined perivascular spaces using enhanced PVS contrasts, the surrounding parenchyma, and at variable distances from the PVS. Our findings show free water diffusion characteristics within the PVS and surrounding parenchyma are associated with age and cognitive scores.

">m6A-mediated epi-transcriptomic dysregulation underlies synaptic dysfunction in fragile X syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability, arises from FMR1 gene silencing and loss of the FMRP protein. FMRP is known to bind to and regulate the stability of m6A-containing transcripts. However, how loss of FMRP impacts on transcriptome-wide m6A modifications in FXS patients remains unknown. To answer this question, we generated cortical neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from healthy subjects and FXS patients. In electrophysiology recordings, we validated that synaptic and neuronal network defects in iPSC-derived FXS neurons corresponded to the clinical EEG data of the patients from which the corresponding iPSC line was derived. In analysis of transcriptome-wide methylation, we show that FMRP deficiency led to increased translation of m6A writers, resulting in hypermethylation that primarily affecting synapse-associated transcripts and increased mRNA decay. Conversely, in the presence of an m6A writer inhibitor, synaptic defects in FXS neurons were rescued. Taken together, our findings uncover that an FMRP-dependent epi-transcriptomic mechanism contributes to FXS pathogenesis by disrupting m6A modifications in FXS, suggesting a promising avenue for m6A-targeted therapies.

">Knockout of the LRRK2-counteracting RAB phosphatase PPM1H disrupts axonal autophagy and exacerbates alpha-synuclein aggregation</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson disease-causing mutations in the LRRK2 gene hyperactivate LRRK2 kinase activity, leading to increased phosphorylation of a subset of RAB GTPases, which are master regulators of intracellular trafficking. In neurons, processive retrograde transport of autophagosomes is essential for autophagosome maturation and effective degradation of autophagosomal cargo in the axon. We found that knockout of the LRRK2-counteracting RAB phosphatase PPM1H resulted in a gene dose-dependent disruption of the axonal transport of autophagosomes, leading to impaired degradation of axonal alpha-synuclein (aSyn), a key protein in Parkinson disease pathophysiology. Defective autophagosome transport and impaired aSyn degradation also correlated with increased aSyn aggregation in primary PPM1H knockout neurons exposed to preformed fibrils of aSyn, an effect that was dependent on LRRK2 kinase activity. Thus, our results link LRRK2-mediated RAB hyperphosphorylation to aSyn pathology in Parkinson disease and further establish a role for impaired autophagy in Parkinson disease pathophysiology.

">Background optic flow modulates responses of multiple descending interneurons to object motion in locusts</a></h4>

              
                Animals flying within natural environments are constantly challenged with complex visual information. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the impact of the visual background on the motion detection system. Locusts possess a well-identified looming detection pathway, compromised of the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) and the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD). The LGMD/DCMD pathway responds preferably to objects on a collision course, and the response of this pathway is affected by the background complexity. However, multiple other neurons are also responsive to looming stimuli. In this study, we presented looming stimuli against different visual backgrounds to a rigidly-tethered locust, and simultaneously recorded the neural activity with a multichannel electrode. We found that the number of discriminated units that responded to looms was not affected by the visual background. However, the peak times of these units were delayed, and the rise phase was shortened in the presence of a flow field background. Dynamic factor analysis (DFA) revealed that fewer types of common trends were present among the units responding to looming stimuli against the flow field background, and the response begin time was delayed among the common trends as well. These results suggest that background complexity affects the response of multiple motion-sensitive neurons, yet the animal is still capable of responding to potentially hazardous visual stimuli.

">Direct segmentation of cortical cytoarchitectonic domains using ultra-high-resolution whole-brain diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                We assess the potential of detecting cortical laminar patterns and areal borders by directly clustering voxel values of microstructural parameters derived from high-resolution mean apparent propagator (MAP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as an alternative to conventional template-warping-based cortical parcellation methods. We acquired MAP-MRI data with 200m resolution in a fixed macaque monkey brain. To improve the sensitivity to cortical layers, we processed the data with a local anisotropic Gaussian filter determined voxel-wise by the plane tangent to the cortical surface. We directly clustered all cortical voxels using only the MAP-derived microstructural imaging biomarkers, with no information regarding their relative spatial location or dominant diffusion orientations. MAP-based 3D cytoarchitectonic segmentation revealed laminar patterns similar to those observed in the corresponding histological images. Moreover, transition regions between these laminar patterns agreed more accurately with histology than the borders between cortical areas estimated using conventional atlas/template-warping cortical parcellation. By cross-tabulating all cortical labels in the atlas- and MAP-based segmentations, we automatically matched the corresponding MAP-derived clusters (i.e., cytoarchitectonic domains) across the left and right hemispheres. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution MAP-MRI biomarkers can effectively delineate three-dimensional cortical cytoarchitectonic domains in single individuals. Their intrinsic tissue microstructural contrasts enable the construction of whole-brain mesoscopic cortical atlases.

">Disentangling the effects of Anxious, Autistic and Psychotic Traits on Perceptual Inference</a></h4>

              
                The brain combines sensory information and prior information, taking into account uncertainty, to perceive the world. This inference process approaches optimality in humans but with inter-individual differences associated with psychological traits. Previous results on these differences are in fact highly heterogeneous and even contradictory. We highlight experimental, modeling, and analysis choices that may contribute to this heterogeneity. We propose a set of tasks utilizing explicit and implicit priors, combined with computational modeling, to isolate the decision and learning stages of perceptual inference. Using a multidimensional approach, we characterized differences in perceptual inference associated with anxious, autistic and psychotic traits in two large samples from the general population. Our findings reveal that anxious, autistic, and psychotic traits form three distinct, yet correlated, dimensions. More anxious traits were associated with enhanced performance and greater reliance on sensory information at the decision stage. Autistic traits were not associated with any difference in perceptual inference; results for psychotic traits were inconsistent across the two samples. Results are partly different when using unidimensional analyses. Together, these results stress the importance of a multidimensional approach that takes anxious traits into account to characterize inter-individual differences in perceptual inference.

                Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that affects connective tissue throughout the body due to mutations in the FBN1 gene. Individuals with MFS display symptoms in different organs, particularly in the vasculature, but the mechanisms of this multi-system dysfunction are still under investigation. There is still a gap in our understanding of the impact of monogenic connective tissue aberrations on the brain. This study aims to determine the impact of MFS on neurodegeneration, in cortical brain tissue of male and female MFS mice. Brain tissue of 6-month-old female and male mice with the FBN1C1041G/+ mutation and wildtype litter mates was collected and stained for active caspase-3 (ac3), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) or with TUNEL and DAPI. Data revealed increased levels of ac3 in neurons within the sensory and motor cortical areas of female MFS mice compared to sex- and age-matched controls. We confirm increased levels of apoptosis in MFS mice using TUNEL staining within the same brain areas. We also report increased levels of neuronal BDNF levels in cortical brain tissue of male and female MFS mice. These results indicate a heightened susceptibility for neurodegeneration in the mouse model of MFS.

">An analysis of RNA quality metrics in human brain tissue</a></h4>

              
                Human brain tissue studies have historically used a range of metrics to assess RNA quality. However, few large-scale cross-comparisons of pre-sequencing quality metrics with RNA-seq quality have been published. Here, we analyze how well metrics gathered before RNA sequencing (post-mortem interval (PMI) and RNA integrity number RIN) relate to analyses of RNA quality after sequencing (Percent of counts in Top Ten genes (PTT), 5' bias, and 3' bias) as well as with individual gene counts across the transcriptome. We conduct this analysis across four different human cortical brain tissue collections sequenced with varying library preparation protocols. PMI and RIN have a low inverse correlation, and both PMI and RIN show consistent and opposing correlations with PTT. Unlike PMI, RIN shows strong consistent correlations with measurements of 3' and 5' bias, and RIN also correlates with 3,933 genes across datasets, in comparison to 138 genes for PMI. Neuronal and immune response genes correlate positively and negatively with RIN respectively, suggesting that different gene sets have divergent relationships with RIN in brain tissue. In summary, these analyses suggest that conventional metrics of RNA quality have varying degrees of value, and that PMI has an overall minimal but reproducible effect on RNA quality.

                Previous diffusion magnetic resonance imaging research in autism has reported altered microstructure in the corpus callosum (CC), the major commissure connecting the two brain hemispheres. However, the CC consists of many fibers connecting various brain regions, and the precise localization of these differences in autism remains unclear. Additionally, the conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model cannot resolve complex fiber configurations and may miss subtle alterations. In this study, we investigated CC microstructure in 365 participants (5-25 years; 34.0% female; 195 with autism) from 10 sites/scanners by using a novel along-tract mapping method, BUndle ANalytics (BUAN), and advanced microstructure model, the tensor distribution function (TDF). Autism was associated with regionally specific reductions in white matter integrity and elevations in diffusivity. The TDF model detected CC microstructure differences more sensitively than DTI. Taken together, BUAN and TDF allow for precise and rigorous white matter analyses, enhancing the detection of subtle neural differences.

Cues that precede action sequences and signal opportunity for reward could serve as GO signals to initiate the sequence, whereas sequence termination cues could serve as response feedback by signaling reward delivery. Reward expectation during sequence execution depends on these cues and might condition whether behavior is habitual or goal-directed. However, it remains unknown how sequence initiation and termination cues differentially affect reward expectation and contribute to habit learning. Further, while mesolimbic dopamine plays a key role in cue-induced reward expectation and sequence learning, how dynamic changes in dopamine signals differ depending on the response strategy is unclear. Here, we determined how mesolimbic DA signals change over training during cue-mediated sequence learning, depending on the type of cue and the nature of behavioral control. We found sequence initiation and termination cues differentially affect reward expectation during action sequences, with the termination cue contributing to habit and automaticity. Distinct response strategies induced by sequence initiation and termination cues induced differential changes in mesolimbic DA signals that captured variations in reward expectation along sequence execution. Notably, habit-like behavior induced by the sequence termination cue was associated with a rapid shift in DA signals from reward retrieval to the cue. This habit-like behavior was reflected in behavioral inflexibility and attenuated DA reward prediction error signals. Finally, using optogenetics, we provide evidence that phasic DA activity elicited by the sequence termination cue is critical for the development of habit-like behavior.

">Temporal Prediction through Integration of Probability Distributions of Event Timings at Multiple Levels</a></h4>

              
                Our brain uses prior experience to anticipate the timing of upcoming events. This dynamical process can be modeled using a hazard function derived from the probability distribution of event timings. However, the contexts of an event can lead to various probability distributions for the same event, and it remains unclear how the brain integrates these distributions into a coherent temporal prediction. In this study, we create a local-global foreperiod paradigm consisting of a sequence of paired trials, where in each trial, participants respond to a target signal after a specified time interval (i.e. foreperiod) following a warning cue. The prediction of the target onset in the second trial can be based on the probability distribution of the second foreperiod (local level) and its conditional probability given the foreperiod in the first trial (global level). These probability distributions are then transformed into hazard functions to represent the local and global temporal predictions. Reaction times to the target signal are best explained by incorporating both local and global predictions, indicating that both levels of temporal information contribute to making predictions. We further show that electroencephalographic source signals are best reconstructed when integrating both predictions. Specifically, the local and global predictions are separately encoded in the posterior and anterior brain regions, and to achieve synergy between both predictions, a third region--particularly the right posterior cingulate area--is needed. Our study reveals brain networks that integrate multilevel temporal information, providing a comprehensive view of hierarchical predictive coding of time.

">The restricted N-glycome of neurons is programmed during differentiation</a></h4>

              
                The protein glycome of individual cell types in the brain is unexplored, despite the critical function of these modifications in development and disease. In aggregate, the most abundant asparagine (N-) linked glycans in the adult brain are high mannose structures, and specifically Man5GlcNAc2 (Man-5), which normally exits the ER for further processing in the Golgi. Mannose structures are uncommon in other organs and often overlooked or excluded in most studies. To understand cell-specific contributions to the unique brain N-glycome and its abundance of Man-5, we performed RNAseq and MALDI-MS TOF protein N-glycomics at several timepoints during differentiation of multiple cell types. To this end, homogeneous cultures of glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, and brain-specific endothelial cells were generated from monoclonal human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) through cellular reprogramming. Small molecule induction of stably integrated synthetic transcription units driving morphogen expression generated differentiated cells with distinct patterns mirroring intact tissue. Comparing uninduced hiPSCs for each cell type revealed identical transcriptomic and glycomic profiles before differentiation, with low quantities of Man-5. In differentiated glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, the most abundant N-glycans became Man-5 and its immediate precursor Man-6, despite the presence of transcripts encoding enzymes for their subsequent modification. Differentiation to brain-specific endothelial cells showed an opposite effect, with the N-glycome displaying an abundance of complex N-glycans and terminal modifications of the late secretory pathway. These results confirm that the restricted N-glycome profile of brain is programmed into neuronal differentiation, with regulation independent of the transcriptome and under tight evolutionary constraint.

">Prefrontal orchestration: a cortical network for rodent motor inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed action control and behavioral flexibility are prerequisites for effective, adaptive behavior. Both abilities rely on functional motor inhibition, which is linked to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where distinct subsections collaborate in functional networks. How these PFC subsections interact and which roles they play during motor inhibition remains incompletely understood. In this study, we employed an action-preparation task in rats, combined with bidirectional optogenetic interventions, opto-fMRI, single unit electrophysiology and local field potential synchrony measurements across PFC subsections. Our findings support a clear and simple model of action inhibition within the prefrontal network. This model suggests prelimbic cortex (PL) as an input-dependent switch between motor inhibition and execution, modulated by an infralimbic cortex (IL)-dominated network. This distribution of tasks allows the PL to mediate goal-directed action while the IL ensures behavioral flexibility.

">A protective role for the cerebellum in cognitive aging</a></h4>

              
                Background: Brain reserve - the brain's resilience to age-related change or damage - provides protection against cognitive decline. The cerebellum is relatively unstudied as a contributor to brain reserve. This study investigates cerebellar brain reserve in the largest cohort to date. Methods: We used data from the Human Connectome Project (n=708, 36-100yrs), UK Biobank (n=45,013, 44-81yrs), and ADNI (n=1,423, 56-95yrs). ADNI participants were cognitively normal or had a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We examined associations between cerebellar tissue volume, age, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, global PET amyloid burden, and APOE genotype. Findings: HCP-Aging data revealed heterogenous aging-associated changes in cerebellar volume, with the greatest effects in posterior hemispheric regions (crus I) (Bonferroni-corrected, p<0.05). MoCA scores were associated with higher tissue density in the cerebellum (p<0.0001) to the same extent as neocortex, and MoCA scores coupled most strongly with posterior cerebellar cortex. Strikingly, greater volume in MoCA visuospatial-related cerebellar cortex protected against aging-related cognitive decline (p=0.0001). We replicated tissue aging results in the UK Biobank with the greatest aging-related effects in posterior cerebellum (p<0.0001), and an association of greater cerebellar volumes with less cognitive decline (Trails Making-B: p<0.00001; Digit Symbol Substitution: p=0.034). AD patients with low amyloid-beta burden (AB-) exhibited the strongest cerebellar association with MoCA (volume x group, AB- AD: p=0.0001). In AB- individuals, APOE e4/e4 carriers showed the greatest effect with MoCA (volume x APOE, e4/e4: p=0.017). Interpretation: Our large-scale study demonstrates a potentially strong role for the cerebellum in mitigating cognitive decline. The persistence of this protection in APOE e4 carriers reshapes our understanding of reserve and AD risk. Our findings open the cerebellum as a novel target for future clinical research on brain reserve in aging populations.

">Representations of stimulus meaning in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The ability to discriminate and categorize the meaning of environmental stimuli and respond accordingly is essential for survival. The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) controls emotional and motivated behaviors in response to environmental cues and is hypothesized to do so in part by deciphering the positive or negative quality of these cues. Yet, what features of the environment are represented in the activity patterns of vCA1 neurons, and whether the positive or negative meaning of a stimulus is present at this stage, remains unclear. Here, using 2-photon calcium imaging across six different experimental paradigms, we consistently found that vCA1 ensembles encode the identity, sensory features, and intensity of learned and innately salient stimuli, but not their overall valence. These results offer a reappraisal of vCA1 function, wherein information corresponding to individual stimulus features and their behavioral saliency predominates, while valence-related information is attached elsewhere.

">Temporally delayed representations in alpha and beta rhythms in higher-order cortical networks track increasing relational integration demands</a></h4>

              
                Relational reasoning is the ability to infer and understand the relations between multiple elements. In humans, this ability supports higher cognitive functions and is linked to fluid intelligence. Relational complexity (RC) is a cognitive framework that offers a generalisable method for classifying the complexity of reasoning problems. To date, increased RC has been linked to static patterns of brain activity supported by the frontoparietal system, but limited work has assessed the multivariate spatiotemporal dynamics that code for RC. To address this, we conducted representational similarity analysis in two independent neuroimaging datasets (Dataset 1 fMRI, n=40; Dataset 2 EEG, n=45), where brain activity was recorded while participants completed a visuospatial reasoning task that included different levels of RC (Latin Square Task). Our findings revealed that, spatially, RC representations were widespread, peaking in brain networks associated with higher-order cognition (frontoparietal, dorsal-attention, and cingulo-opercular). Temporally, RC was represented in the 2.5 - 4.1 seconds post-stimuli window and emerged in the alpha and beta frequency range. Finally, multimodal fusion analysis revealed the information carried in the representation is concordant with the theorised RC model relative to a model of cognitive effort in higher-order cortical networks. Altogether, the results further our understanding of what information is held during relational processing, highlight the spatially distributed nature of RC representations, and emphasise the importance of late frequency-resolved neural processes to resolve RC. Significance statement: Assessing cognitive abilities in human reasoning requires a cognitive framework that can define the complexity of a problem. Relational complexity (RC) theory has emerged as a robust framework, parameterising complexity based on the number of relations that must be processed in parallel to solve a problem's underlying relational representation. To investigate where or when the brain codes for this cognitive abstraction, our study examined multimodal whole-brain activity during short reasoning problems at various complexity levels. We found that higher-cortical networks coded a representation tracking the transition between complexity demands, emerging during late-stage cognitive processing. Our findings provide neuroscientific evidence for a neural coding of relational complexity, pinpointing the frequency-resolved dynamics associated with these mechanisms.

">Understanding Neuronal Diversity: Role of Input Dynamics and Selectivity</a></h4>

              
                The diversity of neurons in the brain is traditionally studied through morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic features. However, because neurons function as spatiotemporal filters of the presynaptic activity patterns, the input dynamics should contribute to neuronal diversity. We tested this hypothesis in barrel cortical neurons using a classical 'step-and-hold' input and a rich dynamical input mimicking input from a presynaptic network. We found that the stimulus type strongly determines classification. To understand this input dependence further, we systematically compared which attributes are the most informative about neuronal heterogeneity by performing classifications based on four different attribute sets that capture 1) action potential features, 2) passive biophysical features, 3) adaptation, and 4) linear input filter using the Spike Triggered Average (STA). We compared the variance explained by the shared structure across these four attribute sets. We observed that the linear input filter explains the highest amount of private variance and thus is the most informative about neuronal heterogeneity. These results demonstrate the importance of the interplay between the input dynamics and the postsynaptic neuron's linear input filter for understanding functional neuronal diversity.

	<p>Background: With the rapid expansion of the generative AI market, conducting in-depth research on cognitive conflicts in human&amp;amp;ndash;computer interaction is crucial for optimizing user experience and improving the quality of interactions with AI systems. However, existing studies insufficiently explore the role of user cognitive conflicts and the explanation of stance attribution in the design of human&amp;amp;ndash;computer interactions. Methods: This research, grounded in mental models theory and employing an improved version of the oddball paradigm, utilizes Event-Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSP) and functional connectivity analysis to reveal how task types and stance attribution explanations in generative AI influence users&amp;amp;rsquo; unconscious cognitive processing mechanisms during service failures. Results: The results indicate that under design stance explanations, the ERSP and Phase Locking Value (PLV) in the theta frequency band were significantly lower for emotional task failures than mechanical task failures. In the case of emotional task failures, the ERSP and PLV in the theta frequency band induced by intentional stance explanations were significantly higher than those induced by design stance explanations. Conclusions: This study found that stance attribution explanations profoundly affect users&amp;amp;rsquo; mental models of AI, which determine their responses to service failure.</p>

	<p>Background: The literature lacks a combined analysis of neurosurgical microvascular anastomosis training models. We performed a systematic literature search to provide an overview of the existing models and proposed a classification system based on the level of simulation and reproducibility of the microvascular anastomosis. Methods: The systematic literature search followed the PRISMA guidelines. We consulted MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, and EMBASE independently for papers about bypass training models. Every training model was analyzed according to six tasks supposed to esteem their fidelity to the real operative setting by using a scoring system from zero to two. Finally, authors classified the models into five classes, from A to E, by summing the individual scores. Results: This study included 109 papers for analysis. Training models were grouped into synthetic tubes, ex vivo models (animal vessels, fresh human cadavers, human placentas) and in vivo simulators (live animals&amp;amp;mdash;rats, rabbits, pigs). By applying the proposed classification system, live animals and placentas obtained the highest scores, falling into class A (excellent simulators). Human cadavers and animal vessels (ex vivo) were categorized in class B (good simulators), followed by synthetic tubes (class C, reasonable simulators). Conclusions: The proposed classification system helps the neurosurgeon to analyze the available training models for microvascular anastomosis critically, and to choose the most appropriate one according to the skills they need to improve</p>

	<p>Background: Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative ocular disease that is accompanied by cerebral damage extending beyond the visual system. Recent studies based on diffusion tensor tractography have suggested an association between glaucoma and brain structural connectivity but have not clarified causality. Methods: To explore the causal associations between glaucoma and brain structural connectivity, a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted involving glaucoma and 206 diffusion tensor tractography traits. Highly associated genetic variations were applied as instrumental variables and statistical data were sourced from the database of FinnGen and UK Biobank. The inverse-variance weighted method was applied to assess causal relationships. Additional sensitivity analyses were also performed. Results: Glaucoma was potentially causally associated with alterations in three brain structural connectivities (from the SN to the thalamus, from the DAN to the putamen, and within the LN network) in the forward MR analysis, whereas the inverse MR results identified thirteen brain structural connectivity traits with a potential causal relationship to the risk of glaucoma. Both forward and reverse MR analyses satisfied the sensitivity test with no significant horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity. Conclusions: This study offered suggestive evidence for the potential causality between the risk of glaucoma and brain structural connectivity. Our findings also provided novel insights into the neurodegenerative mechanism of glaucoma.</p>

	<p>Background: The evaluation of evidence, which frequently takes the form of scientific evidence, necessitates the input of experts in relevant fields. The results are presented as expert opinions or expert evaluations, which are generally accepted as a reliable representation of the facts. A further issue that remains unresolved though is the process of evaluating the expertise and knowledge of an expert in the first instance. In general, earned certificates, grades and other objective criteria are typically regarded as representative documentation to substantiate an expert status. However, there is a possibility that these may not always be sufficiently representative. Objectives: The goal of the present study was to provide evidence that the neural processing of law-relevant and law-irrelevant terms varies significantly between participants who have received training in the field of law (experts) and those who have not (novices). Methods: To this end, changes in brain activity were recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) during visual presentations of terms belonging to five different categories (fake right, democracy, filler word, basic right and rule of law). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were subsequently averaged for each category and subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The results clearly demonstrate that participants trained in law processed fake rights and filler words in a similar manner. Furthermore, both of these conditions elicited different levels of brain activity compared to all law-relevant terms. This was not the case in participants who had not received legal training. The brains of untrained participants processed all five term categories in a strikingly similar manner. In light of prior knowledge regarding language processing, the primary focus was on two distinct electrode locations: one in the left posterior region, and the other in the left frontal region. In both locations, the most prominent differences in brain activity elicited by the aforementioned term categories in law-trained participants occurred approximately 450 milliseconds after stimulus onset. The results were further corroborated by a repeated-measures ANOVA and subsequent t-tests, which also demonstrated the absence of this effect in law-untrained participants. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide empirical evidence that brain activity measurements, in particular ERPs, can be used to distinguish between experts trained in a specific field of expertise and novices in that field. Such findings have the potential to facilitate objective assessments of expertise, enabling comparisons between experts and novices that extend beyond traditional criteria such as qualifications and experience. Instead, individuals can be evaluated based on their cognitive processes, as observed through brain activity.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Speaker race and the listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s language experience (i.e., monolinguals vs. bilinguals) have both been shown to influence accent intelligibility independently. Speaker race specifically is thought to be informed by learned experiences (exemplar model) or individual biases and attitudes (bias-based model). The current study investigates speaker race and the listener&amp;amp;rsquo;s language experience simultaneously as well as listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; attitudes toward non-native speakers and their ability to identify the accent. Methods: Overall, 140 White English monolinguals and 140 English/Norwegian bilinguals transcribed 60 Mandarin-accented English sentences presented in noise in the context of a White or East Asian face. Following sentence transcription, participants were asked to rate the strength of the accent heard and completed a short questionnaire that assessed their accent identification ability and their language usage, proficiency, familiarity, and attitudes. Results: Results show that a listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to identify an accent and their attitudes toward non-native speakers had a significant impact on accent intelligibility and accentedness ratings. Speaker race by itself did not play a role in accent intelligibility and accentedness ratings; however, we found evidence that speaker race interacted with participants&amp;amp;rsquo; accent identification scores and attitudes toward non-native speakers, and these interactions differed as a function of language experience. Conclusions: Our results suggest that bilinguals&amp;amp;rsquo; sociolinguistic processing may be more in line with a bias-based model than monolinguals.</p>

                <p>Two-photon calcium imaging allows for the activity readout of large populations of neurons at single cell resolution in living organisms, yielding new insights into how the brain processes information. Holographic optogenetics allows us to trigger activity of this population directly, raising the possibility of injecting information into a living brain. Optogenetic triggering of activity that mimics "natural" information, however, requires identification of stimulation targets based on real-time analysis of the functional network. We have developed NeuroART (Neuronal Analysis in Real Time), software that provides real-time readout of neuronal activity integrated with downstream analysis of correlations and synchrony and of sensory metadata. On the example of auditory stimuli, we demonstrate real-time inference of the contribution of each neuron in the field of view to sensory information processing. To avoid the limitations of microscope hardware and enable collaboration of multiple research groups, NeuroART taps into microscope data streams without the need for modification of microscope control software and is compatible with a wide range of microscope platforms. NeuroART also integrates the capability to drive a spatial light modulator (SLM) for holographic photostimulation of optimal stimulation targets, enabling real-time modification of functional networks. Neurons used for photostimulation experiments were extracted from Sprague Dawley rat embryos of both sexes.</p>

                <p>Advances in single-cell technologies have led to the discovery and characterization of new brain cell types, which in turn lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we present a detailed analysis of single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq data for three stages of AD from middle temporal gyrus and compare it with snRNA-seq data from the prefrontal cortices from individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). We observed a significant decrease in both inhibitory and excitatory neurons, in general agreement with previous reports. We observed several cell-type&ndash;specific gene expressions and pathway dysregulations that delineate AD stages. Endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells showed the greatest degree of gene expression changes. Cell-type&ndash;specific evidence of neurodegeneration was seen in multiple neuronal cell types particularly in somatostatin and Layer 5 extratelencephalic neurons, among others. Evidence of inflammatory responses was seen in non-neuronal cells, particularly in intermediate and advanced AD. We observed common perturbations in AD and AUD, particularly in pathways, like transcription, translation, apoptosis, autophagy, calcium signaling, neuroinflammation, and phosphorylation, that imply shared transcriptional pathogenic mechanisms and support the role of excessive alcohol intake in AD progression. Major AUD gene markers form and perturb a network of genes significantly associated with intermediate and advanced AD. Master regulator analysis from AUD gene markers revealed significant correlation with advanced AD of transcription factors that have implications in intellectual disability, neuroinflammation, and other neurodegenerative conditions, further suggesting a shared nexus of transcriptional changes between AD and AUD.</p>

                <p>Reelin, a secreted glycoprotein, plays a crucial role in guiding neocortical neuronal migration, dendritic outgrowth and arborization, and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain. Reelin primarily operates through the canonical lipoprotein receptors apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (Apoer2) and very low-density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr). Reelin also engages with noncanonical receptors and unidentified coreceptors; however, the effects of which are less understood. Using high-throughput tandem mass tag (TMT) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we identified both shared and unique intracellular pathways activated by Reelin through its canonical and noncanonical signaling in primary murine neurons of either sex during dendritic growth and arborization. We observed pathway cross talk related to regulation of cytoskeleton, neuron projection development, protein transport, and actin filament-based process. We also found enriched gene sets exclusively by the noncanonical Reelin pathway including protein translation, mRNA metabolic process, and ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis suggesting Reelin fine-tunes neuronal structure through distinct signaling pathways. A key discovery is the identification of aldolase A, a glycolytic enzyme and actin-binding protein, as a novel effector of Reelin signaling. Reelin induced de novo translation and mobilization of aldolase A from the actin cytoskeleton. We demonstrated that aldolase A is necessary for Reelin-mediated dendrite growth and arborization in primary murine neurons and mouse brain cortical neurons. Interestingly, the function of aldolase A in dendrite development is independent of its known role in glycolysis. Altogether, our findings provide new insights into the Reelin-dependent signaling pathways and effector proteins that are crucial for dendritic development.</p>

                <p>Cochlear hair cells (HCs) sense sound waves and allow us to hear. Loss of HCs will cause irreversible sensorineural hearing loss. It is well known that DNA damage repair plays a critical role in protecting cells in many organs. However, how HCs respond to DNA damage and how defective DNA damage repair contributes to hearing loss remain elusive. In this study, we showed that cisplatin induced DNA damage in outer hair cells (OHCs) and promoted OHC loss, leading to hearing loss in mice of either sex. Cisplatin induced the expression of Brca1, a DNA damage repair factor, in OHCs. Deficiency of Brca1 induced OHC and hearing loss, and further promoted cisplatin-induced DNA damage in OHCs, accelerating OHC loss. This study provides the first in vivo evidence demonstrating that cisplatin mainly induces DNA damage in OHCs and that BRCA1 promotes repair of DNA damage in OHCs and prevents hearing loss. Our findings not only demonstrate that DNA damage&ndash;inducing agent generates DNA damage in postmitotic HCs but also suggest that DNA repair factors, like BRCA1, protect postmitotic HCs from DNA damage&ndash;induced cell death and hearing loss.</p>

                <p>Human sleep exhibits multiple, recurrent temporal regularities, ranging from circadian rhythms to sleep stage cycles and neuronal oscillations during nonrapid eye movement sleep. Moreover, recent evidence revealed a functional role of aperiodic activity, which reliably discriminates different sleep stages. Aperiodic activity is commonly defined as the spectral slope <I></I> of the 1/frequency (1/f<sup></sup>) decay function of the electrophysiological power spectrum. However, several lines of inquiry now indicate that the aperiodic component of the power spectrum might be better characterized by a superposition of several decay processes with associated timescales. Here, we determined multiple timescales, which jointly shape aperiodic activity using human intracranial electroencephalography. Across three independent studies (47 participants, 23 female), our results reveal that aperiodic activity reliably dissociated sleep stage-dependent dynamics in a regionally specific manner. A principled approach to parametrize aperiodic activity delineated several, spatially and state-specific timescales. Lastly, we employed pharmacological modulation by means of propofol anesthesia to disentangle state-invariant timescales that may reflect physical properties of the underlying neural population from state-specific timescales that likely constitute functional interactions. Collectively, these results establish the presence of multiple intrinsic timescales that define the electrophysiological power spectrum during distinct brain states.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/42/e0243242024?rss=1">Mu-Opioid Receptor (MOR) Dependence of Pain in Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>We recently demonstrated that transient attenuation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, can both prevent and reverse pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a severe side effect of cancer chemotherapy, for which treatment options are limited. Given the reduced efficacy of opioid analgesics to treat neuropathic, compared with inflammatory pain, the cross talk between nociceptor TLR4 and mu-opioid receptors (MORs), and that MOR and TLR4 agonists induce hyperalgesic priming (priming), which also occurs in CIPN, we determined, using male rats, whether (1) antisense knockdown of nociceptor MOR attenuates CIPN, (2) and attenuates the priming associated with CIPN, and (3) CIPN also produces opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). We found that intrathecal MOR antisense prevents and reverses hyperalgesia induced by oxaliplatin and paclitaxel, two common clinical chemotherapy agents. Oxaliplatin-induced priming was also markedly attenuated by MOR antisense. Additionally, intradermal morphine, at a dose that does not affect nociceptive threshold in controls, exacerbates mechanical hyperalgesia (OIH) in rats with CIPN, suggesting the presence of OIH. This OIH associated with CIPN is inhibited by interventions that reverse Type II priming [the combination of an inhibitor of Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)], an MOR antagonist, as well as a TLR4 antagonist. Our findings support a role of nociceptor MOR in oxaliplatin-induced pain and priming.

                <p>The visual world is richly adorned with texture, which can serve to delineate important elements of natural scenes. In anesthetized macaque monkeys, selectivity for the statistical features of natural texture is weak in V1, but substantial in V2, suggesting that neuronal activity in V2 might directly support texture perception. To test this, we investigated the relation between single cell activity in macaque V1 and V2 and simultaneously measured behavioral judgments of texture. We generated stimuli along a continuum between naturalistic texture and phase-randomized noise and trained two macaque monkeys to judge whether a sample texture more closely resembled one or the other extreme. Analysis of responses revealed that individual V1 and V2 neurons carried much less information about texture naturalness than behavioral reports. However, the sensitivity of V2 neurons, especially those preferring naturalistic textures, was significantly closer to that of behavior compared with V1. The firing of both V1 and V2 neurons predicted perceptual choices in response to repeated presentations of the same ambiguous stimulus in one monkey, despite low individual neural sensitivity. However, neither population predicted choice in the second monkey. We conclude that neural responses supporting texture perception likely continue to develop downstream of V2. Further, combined with neural data recorded while the same two monkeys performed an orientation discrimination task, our results demonstrate that choice-correlated neural activity in early sensory cortex is unstable across observers and tasks, untethered from neuronal sensitivity, and therefore unlikely to directly reflect the formation of perceptual decisions.</p>

                <p>The GluN3A subunit of <I>N</I>-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) plays an established role in synapse development, but its contribution to neural circuits in the adult brain is less clear. Recent work has demonstrated that in select cell populations, GluN3A assembles with GluN1 to form GluN1/GluN3A receptors that are insensitive to glutamate and instead serve as functional excitatory glycine receptors (eGlyRs). Our understanding of these eGlyRs, and how they contribute to intrinsic excitability and synaptic communication within relevant networks of the developing and the mature brain, is only beginning to be uncovered. Here, using male and female mice, we demonstrate that GluN3A subunits are enriched in the adult ventral hippocampus (VH), where they localize to synaptic and extrasynaptic sites and can assemble as functional eGlyRs on CA1 pyramidal cells. GluN3A expression was barely detectable in the adult dorsal hippocampus (DH). We also observed a high GluN2B content in the adult VH, characterized by slow NMDAR current decay kinetics and a high sensitivity to the GluN2B-containing NMDAR antagonist ifenprodil. Interestingly, the GluN2B enrichment in the adult VH was dependent on GluN3A as GluN3A deletion accelerated NMDAR decay and reduced ifenprodil sensitivity in the VH, suggesting that GluN3A expression can regulate the balance of conventional NMDAR subunit composition at synaptic sites. Lastly, we found that GluN3A knock-out also enhanced both NMDAR-dependent calcium influx and NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation in the VH. Together, these data reveal a novel role for GluN3A and eGlyRs in the control of ventral hippocampal circuits in the mature brain.</p>

                <p>When faced with danger, human beings respond with a repertoire of defensive behaviors, including freezing and active avoidance. Previous research has revealed a pattern of physiological responses, characterized by heart rate bradycardia, reduced visual exploration, and heightened sympathetic arousal in reaction to avoidable threats, suggesting a state of attentive immobility in humans. However, the electrocortical underpinnings of these behaviors remain largely unexplored. To investigate the visuocortical components of attentive immobility, we recorded parieto-occipital alpha activity, along with eye movements and autonomic responses, while participants awaited either an avoidable, inevitable, or no threat. To test the robustness and generalizability of our findings, we collected data from a total of 101 participants (76 females, 25 males) at two laboratories. Across sites, we observed an enhanced suppression of parieto-occipital alpha activity during avoidable threats, in contrast to inevitable or no threat trials, particularly toward the end of the trial that prompted avoidance responses. This response pattern coincided with heart rate bradycardia, centralization of gaze, and increased sympathetic arousal. Furthermore, our findings expand on previous research by revealing that the amount of alpha suppression, along with centralization of gaze, and heart rate changes predict the speed of motor responses. Collectively, these findings indicate that when individuals encounter avoidable threats, they enter a state of attentive immobility, which enhances perceptual processing and facilitates action preparation. This state appears to reflect freezing-like behavior in humans.</p>

                <p>Rodent jaws evolved structurally to support dual functionality, for either biting or chewing food. Rodent hands also function dually during food handling, for actively manipulating or statically holding food. How are these oral and manual functions coordinated? We combined electrophysiological recording of muscle activity and kilohertz kinematic tracking to analyze masseter and hand actions as mice of both sexes handled food. Masseter activity was organized into two modes synchronized to hand movement modes. In holding/chewing mode, mastication occurred as rhythmic (~5&nbsp;Hz) masseter activity while the hands held food below the mouth. In oromanual/ingestion mode, bites occurred as lower-amplitude aperiodic masseter events that were precisely timed to follow regrips (by ~200&nbsp;ms). Thus, jaw and hand movements are flexibly coordinated during food handling: uncoupled in holding/chewing mode and tightly coordinated in oromanual/ingestion mode as regrip&ndash;bite sequences. Key features of this coordination were captured in a simple model of hierarchically orchestrated mode-switching and intramode action sequencing. We serendipitously detected an additional masseter-related action, tooth sharpening, identified as bouts of higher-frequency (~13&nbsp;Hz) rhythmic masseter activity, which was accompanied by eye displacement, including rhythmic proptosis, attributable to masseter contractions. Collectively, the findings demonstrate how a natural, complex, and goal-oriented activity is organized as an assemblage of distinct modes and complex actions, adapted for the divisions of function arising from anatomical structure. These results reveal intricate, high-speed coordination of disparate effectors and show how natural forms of dexterity can serve as a model for understanding the behavioral neurobiology of multi-body-part coordination.</p>

                <p>Vertebrate nervous systems use the axon initial segment (AIS) to initiate action potentials and maintain neuronal polarity. The microtubule-associated protein tripartite motif containing 46 (TRIM46) was reported to regulate axon specification, AIS assembly, and neuronal polarity through the bundling, or fasciculation, of microtubules in the proximal axon. However, these claims are based on TRIM46 knockdown in cultured neurons. To investigate TRIM46 function in vivo, we examined male and female TRIM46 knock-out mice. Contrary to previous reports, we find that TRIM46 is dispensable for axon specification and AIS formation. TRIM46 knock-out mice are viable, have normal behavior, and have normal brain structure. Thus, TRIM46 is not required for AIS formation, axon specification, or nervous system function. However, we confirm that TRIM46 is required for microtubule fasciculation. We also show TRIM46 enrichment in the first ~100&nbsp;&mu;m of axon occurs independently of ankyrinG (AnkG) in vivo, although AnkG is required to restrict TRIM46 only to the AIS. Our results highlight the need for further investigation of the mechanisms by which the AIS and microtubules interact to shape neuronal structure and function.</p>

                <p>Neural responses are naturally variable from one moment to the next, even when the stimulus is held constant. What factors might underlie this variability in neural population activity? We hypothesized that spontaneous fluctuations in cortical stimulus representations are created by changes in arousal state. We tested the hypothesis using a combination of fMRI, probabilistic decoding methods, and pupillometry. Human participants (20 female, 12 male) were presented with gratings of random orientation. Shortly after viewing the grating, participants reported its orientation and gave their level of confidence in this judgment. Using a probabilistic fMRI decoding technique, we quantified the precision of the stimulus representation in the visual cortex on a trial-by-trial basis. Pupil size was recorded and analyzed to index the observer's arousal state. We found that the precision of the cortical stimulus representation, reported confidence, and variability in the behavioral orientation judgments varied from trial to trial. Interestingly, these trial-by-trial changes in cortical and behavioral precision and confidence were linked to pupil size and its temporal rate of change. Specifically, when the cortical stimulus representation was more precise, the pupil dilated more strongly prior to stimulus onset and remained larger during stimulus presentation. Similarly, stronger pupil dilation during stimulus presentation was associated with higher levels of subjective confidence, a secondary measure of sensory precision, as well as improved behavioral performance. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that spontaneous fluctuations in arousal state modulate the fidelity of the stimulus representation in the human visual cortex, with clear consequences for behavior.</p>

                Introduction Cancer and cytotoxic chemotherapy used for its treatment predispose to severe and often fatal infections. Prompt diagnosis and timely antibiotic therapy are crucial, with delays in therapy initiation having high mortality. Complete blood count (CBC) is an inexpensive, standardized, and preliminary investigation for the management and follow-up of cancer patients with diagnostic and prognostic value. Method We studied the types of infections associated with various cancers treated with chemotherapy, their etiologies and susceptibility patterns, and the hematological profile of these patients as predictors of infection. Results A total of 21 patients (12 solid and 9 hematological malignancies) presented with 31 febrile episodes. White Blood cell count (2079 cells/cu. mm), percentage of neutrophils (52.9%), absolute neutrophil (137.5 cells/cu. mm), and platelet count (1,77,507 cells/cu. mm) were significantly lower in the 11 patients with febrile neutropenia. The absolute lymphocyte count (412.7 cells/cu. mm) was reduced with a strikingly low Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (6.07) in patients with neutropenia. Laboratory and radiological evidence were present in 14/15 episodes of hematological malignancies (p-0.218) whereas unexplained clinical sepsis was common in solid malignancies (p-0.0202). The majority of documented infections were bacterial, caused by gram-negative bacilli, often showing multi-drug resistance. Infectious etiologies were identified in 71.4% of the patients with febrile neutropenia for >5days. Bacterial infections developed within 2 days of neutropenia, whereas viral and fungal infections manifested in prolonged neutropenia. Multi-site infections and higher mortality rates were observed in patients with febrile neutropenia. (p<0.04) Conclusion Febrile neutropenia is a common complication among patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer, with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis is key to prompt intervention. Hematological parameters such as Total Leukocyte count, platelet count, NLR, and Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio are promising biomarkers in conjunction with morphological changes in neutrophils, thus proving that CBC and peripheral smears are simple, easily available, cost-effective, and highly dependable screening tools, especially in resource-poor settings.

                <p>by Wei Liu, Huaqin He, Davide Chicco</p>

Over the past two decades, extensive studies, particularly in cancer analysis through large datasets like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have aimed at improving patient therapies and precision medicine. However, limited overlap and inconsistencies among gene signatures across different cohorts pose challenges. The dynamic nature of the transcriptome, encompassing diverse RNA species and functional complexities at gene and isoform levels, introduces intricacies, and current gene signatures face reproducibility issues due to the unique transcriptomic landscape of each patient. In this context, discrepancies arising from diverse sequencing technologies, data analysis algorithms, and software tools further hinder consistency. While careful experimental design, analytical strategies, and standardized protocols could enhance reproducibility, future prospects lie in multiomics data integration, machine learning techniques, open science practices, and collaborative efforts. Standardized metrics, quality control measures, and advancements in single-cell RNA-seq will contribute to unbiased gene signature identification. In this perspective article, we outline some thoughts and insights addressing challenges, standardized practices, and advanced methodologies enhancing the reliability of gene signatures in disease transcriptomic research.

                Many studies report the importance of using feces as source sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19 symptoms but who are negative to oropharyngeal/ nasopharyngeal tests. Here, we report the case of an asymptomatic child whose family members had negative results with the rapid antigen nasopharyngeal swab tests. The 21-month-old child presented with fever, diarrhea, bilateral conjunctivitis, and conspicuous lacrimation. In this study, analysis for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples by using Luminex technology allowed accurate detection of the presence of the viral RNA in the feces of the child and of all her relatives, which thus resulted to be positive but asymptomatic. It is the first time that SARS-CoV-2- is observed inside the bacteria of the human gut microbiome and outside a matrix resembling extracellular bacterial lysates, in agreement with a bacteriophage mechanism with the images obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), post-embedding immunogold, and by fluorescence microscope. In addition to the typical observations of respiratory symptoms, accurate evaluation of clinical gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms, combined with efficient highly sensitive molecular testing on feces, represent an efficient approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2, and for providing the correct therapy in challenging COVID-19 cases, like the one here reported.

                Background Nurses play an essential role in patient care, and nurse-patient relationship are a fundamental aspect of healthcare delivery. Research has indicated that oncology nurses are particularly susceptible to burnout. However, there is limited research on nurse burnout in oncology, particularly in the Arab Muslim world. Objective This study aimed to investigate burnout among oncology nurses and analyze its association with professional and sociodemographic factors. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with oncology nurses at the Salah Azaiz Institute. We assessed socio-demographic data, work variables, job satisfaction, and burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results Of the nurses surveyed, 78 responded correctly to the questionnaire. The median age of participants was 37 years, with a predominance of females (52.6%). The median duration of oncology work was 11 years. Regarding job satisfaction, 30.8% were somewhat dissatisfied, and 24.4% were not satisfied. The prevalence of burnout was 89.9%, with 73.1% experiencing high levels of emotional exhaustion, 48.7% high levels of depersonalization, and 25.6% a low level of personal accomplishment. Personal medical and psychiatric history, along with job satisfaction, emerged as the strongest predictors of burnout in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion This study highlights the significant prevalence of burnout among nurses in oncology settings. In Tunisia, there is an urgent need to prioritize the psychological well-being of oncology nurses. Preventive strategies should emphasize enhancing working conditions to reduce these risks.

                Background Hormonal changes in pregnancy and their induced effect on periodontal health are well documented. The present study is aimed at the potential repercussions of multiple pregnancies on periodontal health. Materials and methods Our study utilized data from key sections of the NHANES. All the pertaining and relevant data for the study is collected. Our exposure variable was the number of pregnancies, and the outcome variable was periodontal disease. The number of pregnancies is classified as one, two, three, four, or more. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, poverty/income ratio, marital status, and other variables. Multiple logistic regression models were employed to assess the impact of multiple pregnancies on periodontal disease. Result The crude and multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that none of the variables were significantly associated with the prevalence of periodontitis. In univariate analysis, patients with one or two pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing periodontitis (OR 1.154, 95% CI 0.748-1.779), (OR 1.464, 95% CI 0.864-2.483) respectively. However, these associations did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Within the limitation of the study, there is no significant relationship between parity and the prevalence of periodontitis, the longitudinal study may be warranted to delve deeper into any potential associations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1237/v1?src=rss">The Value of Applying Big Data Analytics in Health Supply Chain Management [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The use of big data analytics (BDAs) allows for the collection, management, and analysis of large volumes of data, which helps in making real-time decisions. This study aims to assess how the application of BDA impacts the performance of healthcare supply chain management (HCSCMP). Through a systematic literature review, the research explores how BDA enhances efficiency within healthcare supply chains (HCSCs) and identifies the critical factors enabling successful BDA implementation. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to analyze 65 papers, resulting in the inclusion of 39 studies published between 2016 and 2023. The review revealed a preference for literature reviews and questionnaires as the primary research methods. The findings indicate that BDA significantly improves HCSCs' efficiency, particularly in real-time decision-making and operational management. However, successful BDA implementation depends on addressing critical enablers and overcoming associated challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27096?af=R">Serum Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein and Neurofilament Light Chain Levels Reflect Different Mechanisms of Disease Progression under B‐Cell Depleting Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the longitudinal dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) under B-cell depleting therapy (BCDT) and their capacity to prognosticate future progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 362 pwMS (1,480 samples) starting BCDT in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Cohort were included. sGFAP levels in 2,861 control persons (4,943 samples) provided normative data to calculate adjusted Z scores.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Elevated sGFAP levels (Z score &gt;1) at 1 year were associated with a higher hazard for PIRA (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.80 [95% CI: 1.17–2.78]; <i>p</i> = 0.0079) than elevated sNfL levels (HR, 1.45 [0.95–2.24], <i>p</i> = 0.0886) in a combined model. Independent of PIRA events, sGFAP levels longitudinally increased by 0.49 Z score units per 10 years follow-up (estimate, 0.49 [0.29, 0.69], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). In patients experiencing PIRA, sGFAP Z scores were 0.52 Z score units higher versus stable patients (0.52 [0.22, 0.83], <i>p</i> = 0.0009). Different sNfL Z score trajectories were found in pwMS with versus without PIRA (interaction <i>p</i> = 0.0028), with an average decrease of 0.92 Z score units per 10 years observed without PIRA (−0.92 [−1.23, −0.60], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), whereas levels in patients with PIRA remained high.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elevated sGFAP and lack of drop in sNfL after BCDT start are associated with increased risk of future PIRA. These findings provide a rationale for combined monitoring of sNfL and sGFAP in pwMS starting BCDT to predict the risk of PIRA, and to use sGFAP as an outcome in clinical trials aiming to impact on MS progressive disease biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90624">Supercomputer framework for reverse engineering firing patterns of neuron populations to identify their synaptic inputs</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we develop new reverse engineering (RE) techniques to identify the organization of the synaptic inputs generating firing patterns of populations of neurons. We tested these techniques in silico to allow rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness, using remarkably extensive parameter searches enabled by massively-parallel computation on supercomputers. We chose spinal motoneurons as our target neural system, since motoneurons process all motor commands and have well-established input-output properties. One set of simulated motoneurons was driven by 300,000+ simulated combinations of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs. Our goal was to determine if these firing patterns had sufficient information to allow RE identification of the input combinations. Like other neural systems, the motoneuron input-output system is likely non-unique. This non-uniqueness could potentially limit this RE approach, as many input combinations can produce similar outputs. However, our simulations revealed that firing patterns contained sufficient information to sharply restrict the solution space. Thus, our RE approach successfully generated estimates of the actual simulated patterns of excitation, inhibition, and neuromodulation, with variances accounted for ranging from 75–90%. It was striking that nonlinearities induced in firing patterns by the neuromodulation inputs did not impede RE, but instead generated distinctive features in firing patterns that aided RE. These simulations demonstrate the potential of this form of RE analysis. It is likely that the ever-increasing capacity of supercomputers will allow increasingly accurate RE of neuron inputs from their firing patterns from many neural systems.

                Increasing researches reveal gut microbiota was associated with the development of tuberculosis (TB). How to prevent or reduce <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> colonization in the lungs is a key measure to prevent TB. However, the data on gut microbiota preventing <i>Mycobacterium</i> colonization in the lungs were scarce. Here, we established the clindamycin-inducing intestinal microbiome dysbiosis and fecal microbial transplantation models in mice to identify gut microbiota’s effect on <i>Mycobacterium</i>’s colonization in the mouse lungs and explore its potential mechanisms. The results showed that clindamycin treatment altered the diversity and composition of the intestinal bacterial and fungal microbiome, weakened the trans-kingdom network interactions between bacteria and fungi, and induced gut microbiome dysbiosis in the mice. Gut microbiota dysbiosis increases intestinal permeability and enhances the susceptibility of <i>Mycobacterium</i> colonization in the lungs of mice. The potential mechanisms were gut microbiota dysbiosis altered the lung transcriptome and increased <i>Nos2</i> expression through the ‘gut–lung axis’. <i>Nos2</i> high expression disrupts the intracellular antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory environment by increasing the concentration of nitric oxide, decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species and <i>Defb1</i> in the cells, and promoting <i>Mycobacteria</i> colonization in the lungs of mice. The present study raises a potential strategy for reducing the risks of <i>Mycobacteria</i> infections and transmission by regulating the gut microbiome balance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97896">Negative regulation of APC/C activation by MAPK-mediated attenuation of Cdc20Slp1 under stress</a></h4>

              
                Mitotic anaphase onset is a key cellular process tightly regulated by multiple kinases. The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in this process has been established in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts. However, the detailed regulatory cascade remains elusive, and it is also unknown whether the MAPK-dependent mitotic regulation is evolutionarily conserved in the single-cell eukaryotic organisms such as fission yeast (<i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>). Here, we show that two MAPKs in <i>S. pombe</i> indeed act in concert to restrain anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity upon activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). One MAPK, Pmk1, binds to and phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, the co-activator of APC/C. Phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1, but not by Cdk1, promotes its subsequent ubiquitylation and degradation. Intriguingly, Pmk1-mediated phosphorylation event is also required to sustain SAC under environmental stress. Thus, our study establishes a new underlying molecular mechanism of negative regulation of APC/C by MAPK upon stress stimuli, and provides a previously unappreciated framework for regulation of anaphase entry in eukaryotic cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95371">Rabphilin-3A negatively regulates neuropeptide release, through its SNAP25 interaction</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides and neurotrophins are stored in and released from dense core vesicles (DCVs). While DCVs and synaptic vesicles (SVs) share fundamental SNARE/SM proteins for exocytosis, a detailed understanding of DCV exocytosis remains elusive. We recently identified the RAB3-RIM1 pathway to be essential for DCV, but not SV exocytosis, highlighting a significant distinction between the SV and DCV secretory pathways. Whether RIM1 is the only RAB3 effector that is essential for DCV exocytosis is currently unknown. In this study, we show that rabphilin-3A (RPH3A), a known downstream effector of RAB3A, is a negative regulator of DCV exocytosis. Using live-cell imaging at single-vesicle resolution with RPH3A deficient hippocampal mouse neurons, we show that DCV exocytosis increased threefold in the absence of RPH3A. RAB3A-binding deficient RPH3A lost its punctate distribution, but still restored DCV exocytosis to WT levels when re-expressed. SNAP25-binding deficient RPH3A did not rescue DCV exocytosis. In addition, we show that RPH3A did not travel with DCVs, but remained stationary at presynapses. RPH3A null neurons also had longer neurites, which was partly restored when ablating all regulated secretion with tetanus neurotoxin. Taken together, these results show that RPH3A negatively regulates DCV exocytosis, potentially also affecting neuron size. Furthermore, RAB3A interaction is required for the synaptic enrichment of RPH3A, but not for limiting DCV exocytosis. Instead, the interaction of RPH3A with SNAP25 is relevant for inhibiting DCV exocytosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92982">Hypothalamic representation of the imminence of predator threat detected by the vomeronasal organ in mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals have the innate ability to select optimal defensive behaviors with appropriate intensity within specific contexts. The vomeronasal organ (VNO) serves as a primary sensory channel for detecting predator cues by relaying signals to the medial hypothalamic nuclei, particularly the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which directly controls defensive behavioral outputs. Here, we demonstrate that cat saliva contains predator cues that signal the imminence of predator threat and modulate the intensity of freezing behavior through the VNO in mice. Cat saliva activates VNO neurons expressing the V2R-A4 subfamily of sensory receptors, and the number of VNO neurons activated in response to saliva correlates with both the freshness of saliva and the intensity of freezing behavior. Moreover, the number of VMH neurons activated by fresh, but not old, saliva positively correlates with the intensity of freezing behavior. Detailed analyses of the spatial distribution of activated neurons, as well as their overlap within the same individual mice, revealed that fresh and old saliva predominantly activate distinct neuronal populations within the VMH. Collectively, this study suggests that there is an accessory olfactory circuit in mice that is specifically tuned to time-sensitive components of cat saliva, which optimizes their defensive behavior to maximize their chance of survival according to the imminence of threat.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96543">PVN-mPFC OT projections modulate pup-directed pup care or attacking in virgin mandarin voles</a></h4>

              
                Many species of animals exhibit caregiving or aggression toward conspecific offspring. The neural mechanisms underlying the infanticide and pup care remain poorly understood. Here, using monogamous mandarin voles (<i>Microtus mandarinus</i>), we found that more oxytocin (OT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were activated during pup caring than infanticide. Optogenetic activation of OT neurons in the PVN facilitated pup caring in male and female mandarin voles. In infanticide voles, optogenetic activation of PVN OT cells or PVN-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) OT projection fibers prolonged latency to approach and attack pups, whereas inhibition of these OT neurons or projections facilitated approach and infanticide. Optogenetic activation of PVN OT neuron projections to the mPFC in males shortened the latency to approach and retrieve pups and facilitated the initiation of pup care, but produced no effects on pup-care females. In addition, OT release in the mPFC increased upon approaching and retrieving pups, and decreased upon attacking pups. Intraperitoneal injection of OT promoted pup care and inhibited infanticide behavior. It is suggested that the OT system, especially PVN OT neurons projecting to mPFC, modulates pup-directed behaviors and OT can be used to treat abnormal behavioral responses associated with some psychological diseases such as depression and psychosis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92201">A Plasmodium falciparum MORC protein complex modulates epigenetic control of gene expression through interaction with heterochromatin</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic control of gene expression is critical for blood stage development of malaria parasites. Here, we used multi-omic analyses to investigate transcriptional regulation by the chromatin-associated microrchidia protein, MORC, during asexual blood stage development of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. We show that <i>Pf</i>MORC (PF3D7_1468100) interacts with a suite of nuclear proteins, including APETALA2 (ApiAP2) transcription factors (<i>Pf</i>AP2-G5, <i>Pf</i>AP2-O5, <i>Pf</i>AP2-I, PF3D7_0420300, PF3D7_0613800, PF3D7_1107800, and PF3D7_1239200), a DNA helicase DS60 (PF3D7_1227100), and other chromatin remodelers (<i>Pf</i>CHD1 and <i>Pf</i>EELM2). Transcriptomic analysis of <i>Pf</i>MORC<sup>HA-glmS</sup> knockdown parasites revealed 163 differentially expressed genes belonging to hypervariable multigene families, along with upregulation of genes mostly involved in host cell invasion. In vivo genome-wide chromatin occupancy analysis during both trophozoite and schizont stages of development demonstrates that <i>Pf</i>MORC is recruited to repressed, multigene families, including the <i>var</i> genes in subtelomeric chromosomal regions. Collectively, we find that <i>Pf</i>MORC is found in chromatin complexes that play a role in the epigenetic control of asexual blood stage transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization.

">Building neurovascular tissue from autologous blood for modeling brain-activity</a></h4>

              
                There are no faithful individualized stem cell-based bioengineered neuro-vascularized models that can recapitulate the physiological hemodynamic phenomenon of neuro-vascular coupling (NVC)- the principal behind BOLD (blood oxygen level- dependent) signal in functional neuroimaging, thereby dissuading the research in exploring the brain activity-based investigative studies in neurological/neurosensory diseases. This encouraged us to establish a preclinical optoacoustic (Hb/dHb hemoglobin/deoxyhemoglobin) imaging-competent in vitro neuro-vascularized model by employing a novel cellular reprograming PITTRep (Plasma Induced Transcriptomics/ epi-Transcriptomics Reprograming) approach. The current reprograming approach is based on coaxing autologous blood components to ecto-mesodermal lineage intermediates that can subsequently self-pattern into neurovascular tissue by harnessing the hemorheological properties of RBCs. The nature of blood flow is non-Newtonian and is a function of RBC concentration /haematocrit when they flow through the regions of low shear rates as seen in cerebral microcirculation. The current reprograming approach is a modification of our previous cellular reprograming approach that employed a Newtonian plasma fluid. We tested a potential (yet completely unexplored) hypothesis of haemodynamic reprograming by leveraging the fluid mechanic feature of blood erythrocytes as seen in thrombus formation during cerebral ischemic stroke, that is characterized by physiologically intriguing yet clinically meaningful neurological recovery during an early time window. Intriguingly, post-stroke heightened neuroplasticity marked by dendrites, synapses, astrogliosis, microglia activation, and growth factor signaling is accompanied by adult neurogenesis, that is otherwise a non-resilient phenomenon. The current study attempted to induce a post stroke-like (adult) neurogenesis with functional synaptogenesis by instructing autologous blood components into thrombus formation by incorporation of erythrocytes in varying concentrations. The induction of neuro-vascularized niches (NVNs) and functional neuro vascular coupling (NVC) was characterized by confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, proteomic profiling, and Hb/dHb spectra based optoacoustic imaging. The blood thrombus formation was checked by rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), and switching of adult to embryonic hemoglobin was confirmed by hemoglobin typing. We also attempted to establish patient-specific neuro-vascularized niches from autologous blood of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) patients. The individualized neovascularised tissues are intended to be employed for investigating deregulated synaptic plasticity/ long term potentiation underlying poor auditory comprehension outcomes in school going kids suffering from SNHL that greatly compromises their academic performance and socio-behavioural-cognitive development. The attendant multiomics of patient-specific NVNs may have potential implications in developing potential stem cell based therapies for neurosensory and cerebrovascular diseases.

	<p>Background: Cell-based therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived inhibitory interneurons are now in early-phase clinical trials, building on findings from trials in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD). Graft rejection and the need for immunosuppressive therapy post-transplantation pose potential barriers to more epilepsy patients becoming potential candidates for inhibitory interneurons transplantation surgery. Objectives: The present literature review weighs the evidence for and against human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mediated graft rejection in PD and HD and examines the potential advantages and drawbacks to five broad approaches to cell-based therapies, including autologous cell culture and transplantation, in vivo reprogramming of glial cells using viral vectors, allogeneic transplantation using off-the-shelf cell lines, transplantation using inhibitory interneurons cultured from HLA-matched cell lines, and the use of hypoimmunogenic-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived inhibitory interneurons. The impact of surgical technique and associated needle trauma on graft rejection is also discussed. Methods: Non-systematic literature review. Results: While cell-based therapies have enjoyed early successes in treating a host of central nervous system disorders, the immunologic reaction against surgical procedures and implanted materials has remained a major obstacle. Conclusions: Adapting cell-based therapies using iPSC-derived inhibitory interneurons for epilepsy surgery will similarly require surmounting the challenge of immunogenicity.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) technologies have revolutionized cranial neurosurgery by overlaying digital information onto the surgical field, enhancing visualization, precision, and training. These technologies enable the real-time integration of preoperative imaging data, aiding in better decision-making and reducing operative risks. Despite challenges such as cost and specialized training needs, AR and MR offer significant benefits, including improved surgical outcomes and personalized surgical plans based on individual patient anatomy. Materials and Methods: This study describes three intracranial surgeries using AR and MR technologies at Hospital &amp;amp;Aacute;ngeles Universidad, Mexico City, in 2023. Surgeries were performed with VisAR software 3 version and Microsoft HoloLens 2, transforming DICOM images into 3D models. Preoperative MRI and CT scans facilitated planning, and radiopaque tags ensured accurate image registration during surgery. Postoperative outcomes were assessed through clinical and imaging follow-up. Results: Three intracranial surgeries were performed with AR and MR assistance, resulting in successful outcomes with minimal postoperative complications. Case 1 achieved 80% tumor resection, Case 2 achieved near-total tumor resection, and Case 3 achieved complete lesion resection. All patients experienced significant symptom relief and favorable recoveries, demonstrating the precision and effectiveness of AR and MR in cranial surgery. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the successful use of AR and MR in cranial surgery, enhancing precision and clinical outcomes. Despite challenges like training and costs, these technologies offer significant benefits. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes and broader applications to validate their efficacy and cost-effectiveness in neurosurgery.</p>

	<p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is an electrophysiologic pathological state in which a wave of depolarization in the cerebral cortex is followed by the suppression of spontaneous neuronal activity. This transient spread of neuronal depolarization on the surface of the cortex is the hallmark of CSD. Numerous investigations have demonstrated that transmembrane ion transport, astrocytic ion clearing and fatigue, glucose metabolism, the presence of certain genetic markers, point mutations, and the expression of the enzyme responsible for the production of various arachidonic acid derivatives that participate in the inflammatory response, namely, cyclooxygenase (COX), all influence CSD. Here, we explore the associations between CSD occurrence in the cortex and various factors, including how CSD is related to migraines, how the glucose state affects CSD, the effect of TBI and its relationship with CSD and glucose metabolism, how different markers can be measured to determine the severity of CSD, and possible connections to oligemia, orexin, and leptin.</p>

	<p>Introduction: This article provides an overview of several experimental models, including in vivo, genetics, chemical, knock-in, knock-out, electrical, in vitro, and optogenetics models, that have been employed to investigate epileptogenesis. The present review introduces a novel categorization of these models, taking into account the fact that the most recent classification that gained widespread acceptance was established by Fisher in 1989. A significant number of such models have become virtually outdated. Objective: This paper specifically examines the models that have contributed to the investigation of partial seizures, generalized seizures, and status epilepticus. Discussion: A description is provided of the primary features associated with the processes that produce and regulate the symptoms of various epileptogenesis models. Numerous experimental epilepsy models in animals have made substantial contributions to the investigation of particular brain regions that are capable of inducing seizures. Experimental models of epilepsy have also enabled the investigation of the therapeutic mechanisms of anti-epileptic medications. Typically, animals are selected for the development and study of experimental animal models of epilepsy based on the specific form of epilepsy being investigated. Conclusions: Currently, it is established that specific animal species can undergo epileptic seizures that resemble those described in humans. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that a comprehensive assessment of all forms of human epilepsy has not been feasible. However, these experimental models, both those derived from channelopathies and others, have provided a limited comprehension of the fundamental mechanisms of this disease.</p>
