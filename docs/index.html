              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20929">Decoding Predictive Inference in Visual Language Processing via Spatiotemporal Neural Coherence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.20929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human language processing relies on the brain's capacity for predictive inference. We present a machine learning framework for decoding neural (EEG) responses to dynamic visual language stimuli in Deaf signers. Using coherence between neural signals and optical flow-derived motion features, we construct spatiotemporal representations of predictive neural dynamics. Through entropy-based feature selection, we identify frequency-specific neural signatures that differentiate interpretable linguistic input from linguistically disrupted (time-reversed) stimuli. Our results reveal distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence as key features in language comprehension, with experience-dependent neural signatures correlating with age. This work demonstrates a novel multimodal approach for probing experience-driven generative models of perception in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21129">Active inference and artificial reasoning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.21129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07327">Gradient Diffusion: Sensitivity-Matrix Co-Simulation Enables Activity Adaptation and Learnable Plasticity in Neural Simulators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.07327v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational neuroscience relies on large-scale dynamical-systems models of neurons, with a vast amount of offline, pre-simulation, tuned parameters, with models often tied to their brain simulators. These fixed parameters lead to stiff models, that show unnatural behaviour when introduced to new environments, or when combined into larger networks. In contrast to offline tuning, in biology, cells continuously adapt via homeostatic plasticity to stay in desired dynamical regimes. In this work, we aim to introduce such online tuning of cellular parameters into brain simulation. We show that the sensitivity equation of a biorealistic neural models has the same shape as a general neuron model, and can be simulated within existing brain simulators. Via co-simulation with the sensitivity equation, we enable both offline, and online tuning of activity of arbitrary biophysically realistic brain models. Furthermore, we show that this opens the possibility to study the biological mechanisms underlying homeostatic plasticity, via both meta-learning plasticity mechanism as well as treating online tuning as a black-box plasticity mechanism. Through the generality of our methods, we hope that more computational science fields can capitalize on the similarity between the simulated model and its gradient system.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20481">Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.20481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11783">EEG Foundation Models: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.11783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Premise. Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubrics for long-term research progress remain unclear. Objective. In this work, we conduct a review of ten early EEG-FMs to capture common trends and identify key directions for future development of EEG-FMs. Methods. We comparatively analyze each EEG-FM using three fundamental pillars of foundation modeling, namely the representation of input data, self-supervised modeling, and the evaluation strategy. Based on this analysis, we present a critical synthesis of EEG-FM methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. Results. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked temporal EEG sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. Significance. Our review indicates that the development of benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

                arXiv:2511.20950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.

                Background A severe sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea is typified by recurrent bouts of upper airway obstruction while you’re asleep. It is associated with a variety of complications such as cardiovascular problems, poor sleep quality, and daytime fatigue. Objectives This study aimed to assess knowledge of obstructive sleep apnea and the prevalence of healthy sleep habits among nursing students at the University of Basrah. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among nursing students at the College of Nursing, University of Basrah. A non-probability (purposive sampling) method was employed to collect data from 150 students via self-reported questionnaires. The research period was prolonged from November 1, 2024, to April 1, 2025. The constructed self-administered questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographic characteristics, knowledge about obstructive sleep apnea, and sleep-related habits. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with results presented in frequencies and percentages. Results The results showed that 64% of participants had good knowledge about obstructive sleep apnea, 28% had moderate knowledge, and only 8% demonstrated poor knowledge. In terms of sleep habits, most of the students have good, healthy habits. Conclusion Most students have poor knowledge. These findings suggest a need for enhanced educational programs focusing on healthy habits and knowledge of obstructive sleep apnea among nursing students.

                Introduction Access to maternity care services from qualified health care professionals during pregnancy, labor, and the postnatal period is crucial for the survival and health of the mother and baby. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with maternal continuum of care completion in Myanmar. Methods This study used secondary data from the 2015-2016 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey. The study included 1455 women aged < 2 years. Bivariate analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA and chi-square test of independence to explore the unadjusted association between the dependent variable and each independent variable. Multivariable analysis was conducted with ordinal logistic regression to explore the factors associated with the maternity continuum of care completion. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results The prevalence of complete maternity continuum of care was 55.2% (n = 803), partial maternity continuum of care was 31.9% (n = 464), and no maternity continuum of care was 12.9% (n = 188) respectively. After adjusting for covariates, maternal education, region, place of residence, total parity, husband’s education, husband’s occupation, money needed for treatment, timing of first antenatal check, tetanus injection, blood pressure, urine sample taken, blood sample taken, given or bought iron tablets/syrup, and drugs for intestinal parasites during pregnancy were significantly associated with maternal continuum of care. Conclusion The prevalence of a complete maternity continuum of care in Myanmar was suboptimal. Important factors include maternal education, urban residency, region, total parity, husbands’ education, and occupation. Improving outcomes in the area requires addressing obstacles such as financial limitations, access to quality health services, and distance. Improving access to maternal healthcare services should be the main goal of policy initiatives, especially for rural areas, lower education levels, and low-income families.

                Background This study examined biomarker signatures in men with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in Uzbekistan, with and without viral infections. Methods A cross-sectional study included 292 males with stage II AUD (virus-negative: n = 251; virus-positive: n = 41) and 49 alcohol-free controls. Clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters were measured, and ROC analysis evaluated diagnostic performance. Results Virus-negative patients showed the clearest biomarker profile of alcohol dependence, with reduced glucose, creatinine, and urea, and elevated total protein, α-amylase, De Ritis ratio, and direct bilirubin. ROC analysis confirmed strong diagnostic value for AST (AUC = 0.951), FIB-4 (0.877), MAP (0.817), and creatinine (0.711). Leukocytes (AUC = 0.790) and lymphocytes (0.735) best differentiated viral status. Fibrosis risk in virus-positive patients was 1.5-fold higher, with splenomegaly in 7.3%. Mild thrombocytopenia, absence of granulocytopenia, and rare delirium (<5.5%) distinguished this cohort from European groups, resembling East Asian patterns. Conclusions Liver enzymes, α-amylase, bilirubin, MCV, FIB-4, and MAP provide strong diagnostic value for AUD. Multimarker panels including leukocyte, lymphocyte, and creatinine levels support viral status differentiation. Findings emphasize population-specific biomarker signatures in Central Asians and the utility of multimarker strategies for personalized AUD management.

                Background The theory of Observational Relativity (OR), a new theory, has generalized and unified Newtonian mechanics and Einstein relativity theory. The OR Serial Reports intend to interpret the theory of OR. The logical consistency and theoretical validity of OR, as well as, the empirical basis and experimental evidence of OR, have been clarified in OR Serial Report 1. The theory of OR has had significant discoveries: as reported in OR Serial Report 1, the speed of light is not really invariant and spacetime is not really curved; as reported in OR Serial Report 2, the rest mass of photons is not really zero. Now, OR Serial Report 3 reports to readers: Einstein mistakenly predicted gravitational waves; LIGO mistakenly detected gravitational waves. In 1916, Einstein derived a wave equation from his gravitational-field equation of general relativity, which has two characteristic physical quantities: the Newtonian gravitational potential χ; the light speed c. Accordingly, Einstein decided that his wave equation must represent gravitational waves and the speed of gravitational waves must be the speed of light. Methods From the GOR gravitational-field equation of the general observation agent OA(η) (0<η<∞; η→∞), the Gravitational theory of OR (GOR) has also derived a wave equation with two characteristic physical quantities: the Newtonian gravitational potential χ; the information-wave speed η of OA(η). Results The GOR wave equation suggests that the GOR wave must be the information wave of OA(η), and that the Newtonian gravitational potential χ must be the information about gravitational spacetime loaded or carried by the information wave of OA(η). Conclusions It is thus clear that Einstein’s wave equation does not represent gravitational waves, but the information wave of the optical observation agent OA(c) (η=c), that is, light or an electromagnetic wave transmitting observed information at the speed of light. So, what did LIGO detect?

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1447/v1?src=rss">Team-Based Analysis for Critical Thinking in Clinical Cases (TACTIC): Development of a new innovative method for teaching clinical reasoning [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Clinical reasoning is a core competency in undergraduate medical education, yet many instructional approaches do not fully address its cognitive complexity in a structured or scalable way. Team-Based Analysis for Critical Thinking in Clinical Cases (TACTIC) is a stepwise novel method that mirrors real-world diagnostic reasoning through iterative, team-based engagement with authentic clinical scenarios. This study describes the development of TACTIC using formal consensus methods. Methods We employed a modified Delphi followed by a nominal group technique to reach consensus on the concrete steps for implementing TACTIC. Eight faculty implementers participated in three rounds. Participants rated the importance of proposed steps on a 5-point scale. We summarized central tendency and dispersion (mean, SD; median, IQR) and calculated item-level content validity indices (I-CVI) and the scale-level average (S-CVI/Ave) using a ≥4 (agree) threshold. Results Consensus produced five clearly defined steps for TACTIC. Agreement was high across raters, reflected by high means and medians with low SDs and IQRs. Content validity was excellent: I-CVI for all steps was 1.00 and S-CVI/Ave was 1.00, indicating unanimous endorsement of the finalized steps. Conclusion TACTIC offers a structured, consensus-derived approach to teaching clinical reasoning that is feasible and initially well-received. While resource-intensive, its fidelity and scalability can be enhanced through facilitator training, hybrid/digital delivery (e.g., breakout rooms, simulated-patient substitutes), and selective use of AI for feedback and case branching. TACTIC has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional instruction and the intricate cognitive demands of diagnostic reasoning.

                Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can augment educators’ capacity to design high-quality Key Feature Problems (KFPs) for valid assessment of clinical reasoning and decision-making. This practice-oriented guide presents ten evidence-informed tips for using AI to develop KFPs that are aligned with learning outcomes, cognitively demanding, and contextually authentic. Drawing on the KFP literature and contemporary validity frameworks (content, cognitive and response processes, internal structure, and consequences), we synthesize practical strategies for translating outcomes into key features, constructing realistic vignettes, creating parallel case variants, targeting higher-order thinking, ensuring curricular alignment and learner-level appropriateness, diversifying complementary item formats, validating AI-assisted items through a stepwise workflow, delivering decision-specific feedback, iterating from learner performance data, and safeguarding equity, ethics, and governance. We illustrate these recommendations with concise examples and an adapted validation workflow that supports both formative and summative applications. Although AI can accelerate scenario construction and feedback drafting, human expertise remains essential to verify clinical accuracy, prevent bias and hallucinations, calibrate difficulty, and preserve assessment security. With transparent processes and expert review, AI can serve as a collaborative assistant rather than a replacement, helping medical educators build rigorous KFPs that enhance the assessment of clinical decision-making.

                Background In this paper, we focus on deriving an efficient method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of sixth order, and then, we modify the proposed method for solving fractional differential equations (FDEs). Methods The methodology of this paper used the approach of derivation of implicit numerical method. However, the purpose of this study is to derive a direct implicit block and multi-step strategy for solving sixth-order ODEs. Results The main novelty of this work lies in the investigation of constructing a novel method for solving FDEs. This paper presents a general block two-point approach, known as GIBM2P, for solving sixth-order initial-value problems (IVPs) using Hermite-interpolating polynomials. Consequently, the FDE problem has been transformed into ODE using the α-fractional-derivative transform, and then, the sixth-order IVP is solved using the proposed GIBM2P method. Conclusions In this paper, we offered a method for solving sixth-order FDEs. The proposed method has been shown to be an accurate and efficient method; also, one can obtain the approximate efficient solutions of FDEs problems. The numerical implementations are used to show the high accuracy and efficacy of the proposed GIBM2P approach. However, the GIBM2P method is effective in terms of accuracy, processing time, and the number of function calls.

                Background Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition characterized by the dilation and dysfunction of the left ventricle, leading to heart failure. This study investigates the relationship between dilated cardiomyopathy and factors such as lipid levels, interleukin-12 (IL-12) levels, troponin levels, and coxsackievirus antibodies. Methods This study involved 60 patients diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and 30 healthy controls. We used a BioSystems kit to measure lipid profiles and a fully automated c111 analyzer (Germany) to quantify troponin levels. We used ELISA to evaluate IL-12 levels and antibodies (IgG and IgM) to Coxsackievirus. We used SPSS for data analysis, with statistically significant defined as p≤0.05. Results Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy showed a significant difference in lipid levels compared to the control group, while HDL levels showed no statistically significant difference. In addition, troponin levels were significantly elevated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. IL-12 levels were elevated by 1.27-fold in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy suggests a reasonable diagnostic accuracy. Antibody levels for Coxsackievirus (IgG and IgM) were markedly elevated in dilated cardiomyopathy, with a positive test in both IgG t and IgM, while no positive controls were observed for either antibody.in addition This study evaluated the associations between IL-12, IgM, and IgG. The results showing nonsignificant correlation between IL-12 and IgM and IL-12 and IgG. Conclusion Elevated IL-12 levels and coxsackievirus-positive antibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy patients suggest a possible immune link. However, no statistically significant relationship has been found between IL-12 and coxsackie virus antibodies.

                Over the last decade, there has been an increased range of probability distributions in statistical and reliability literature aimed at enhancing standard models. This trend reflects a greater understanding of empirical integrity, flexibility, and adaptability in modeling income distributions, reliability, and lifetime statistics. To provide greater flexibility and general distributions, this study employs a technique that generates the T−R{Y} family distributions. It might be employed to agree with particular forms of data distributions, including the significantly left, right, thin, or heavy-tailed distributions, or for creating new distributions that are very flexible and adaptive. These results in an individual belonging to a new sub-family called the IDNAII distribution, which is also referred to as the Lomax–Weibull {Exponential} distribution. The main statistical and mathematical aspects of the new family distribution are examined. A variety of estimation approaches, including the maximum likelihood method (MLE), method of moments (MOM), least squares method (LS), and shrinkage method (SH), will be introduced to estimate the parameters of the new class distribution. Simulation tools have been created to evaluate the effectiveness of estimation approaches. The study’s findings indicate that the shrinkage estimation approach exceeded the others regarding bias and mean squared error criterion. On the contrary, a real-world dataset application has been demonstrated and the examination of the real dataset showed that the new class distribution fit the data better than the particular classical and moderate distributions, as indicated by several types of information criteria.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1441/v1?src=rss">Gender Digital Divides: New Divides, Old Inequalities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The fourth industrial revolution has introduced new forms of inequality, particularly affecting women through gender-based digital divides. These divides manifest in unequal access, usage, and quality of interaction with information and communication technologies (ICTs). Understanding these disparities is essential for shaping equitable digital policies. Methods This study employed a qualitative and documentary approach based on a systematic literature review following the PRISMA protocol. Four academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Sage Journals) were searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2010 and 2024. A total of 479 documents were initially identified, with 14 studies meeting all eligibility criteria. Three analytical categories guided the synthesis: manifestations of gender digital divides; their causes and consequences; and mitigation strategies. Results The reviewed literature reveals that women face multiple barriers to digital inclusion, including cultural constraints, economic inequality, lack of digital skills, and time poverty. The gender digital divide is particularly pronounced in developing countries, where gaps in access to the Internet and ICTs correlate with broader social and structural inequalities. Studies also highlight significant regional variation and intersectional challenges related to age, migration status, and educational background. While access has improved in some contexts, disparities in digital competencies and outcomes persist. Gender-based digital divides are rooted in both structural inequalities and cultural norms that restrict women’s digital participation. Conclusions Efforts to mitigate these divides must address the multilayered causes through inclusive policies, gender-sensitive infrastructure planning, and education programs that enhance women’s digital literacy and agency. Integrating a gender perspective into digital policy is essential for achieving equity in the digital age.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Our everyday experiences share many overlapping features, as we often engage in repeated activities and routines. This leads to interference across our experiences, making it difficult to remember specific, unique events. Hippocampal pattern separation enables the discrimination of highly similar experiences to be stored orthogonally, especially in the face of interference. Mnemonic discrimination tasks have been designed to tax hippocampal pattern separation by including perceptually similar “lure” stimuli during memory retrieval. However, we experience vast interference beyond a single instance of overlap. Thus, a key feature of our memory system is to overcome this high interference. Furthermore, some experiences tend to be better remembered by most people than others, a feature known as memorability. However, it is unclear how memorability may impact the effect of interference on memory. To this end, we designed a mnemonic discrimination task with multiple forms of interference, such that target (repeated) and lure (similar) images of a baseline image were shown to participants during a memory test designed to increase interference during memory retrieval. We additionally varied image memorability by including memorable and forgettable images to examine interactions with interference conditions. We found that greater interference during retrieval enhanced lure discrimination for memorable images, but impaired lure discrimination for forgettable images. This suggests that interference does not uniformly impact memory, with greater interference in memory leading to exaggerated memorable and forgettable experiences.</p>

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                Background Previous research has shown that popular names have become less popular over time. Simultaneously, accumulated evidence has indicated that names have become more diverse. However, the association between these two phenomena was unclear. This association should be revealed for a better understanding of names and naming practices. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the popularity and diversity of names. Methods I analyzed the data provided in a previous study in the U.K., which included complete records of all live births between 1996 and 2016 (N = 12,985,140). Results I found that the correlations between diversity and popularity indicators were highly negative, showing that they are conceptually strongly related. This means that when diversity is high, popularity is low. Conclusions Based on this study, we can predict one indicator from the other indicator. Because raw data on names are generally difficult to collect, this prediction is useful for understanding names and naming practices.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1127/v2?src=rss">Parents’ roles in young learners’ motivation and task engagement in Indonesian primary schools: Questionnaire development and validation [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Parental involvement in a child’s second language learning is important because it affects the process and outcomes. Limited research has been conducted in the Indonesian context on what roles parents play in their children’s motivation and task engagement. Therefore, the study aims to develop, pilot, and validate a questionnaire on the roles of parents in motivating and engaging young learners with English tasks assigned by teachers. Methods This study was quantitative in nature. Participants were 270 parents of fifth graders learning English at nine public and private schools in Padang. The instrument was developed by analysing the literature and existing tools and creating new items. After getting expert feedback and piloting the survey, we assessed its validity and reliability. Research questions examined factors affecting its effectiveness. Results The questionnaire was analysed through EFA and CFA via Jamovi. EFA identified five dimensions: (1) parental involvement, (2) expectations, (3) access to resources, (4) enrichment and (5) extracurricular activities. The CFA fit indices (CFI = .945, TLI = .934, SRMR = .045, RMSEA = .059) confirmed the model’s suitability. The questionnaire showed strong validity and reliability, with measures exceeding.70, making it effective for gathering data on parental roles in Indonesian children’s learning of English. Conclusions This validation study offers an effective diagnostic tool for teachers, administrators, and policymakers to pinpoint the particular dimensions of parental involvement that affect children’s motivation and task engagement as they learn English. The findings highlight the critical roles of recognising parents as active collaborators along the language learning journey. The study adds to the theoretical understanding of the impact of parental behaviour in educational psychology and motivation studies. The findings are consistent with self-determination theory, providing a more nuanced perspective to explore how different forms of parental participation influence student motivation and task engagement in learning English.

                Background Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in South Africa continues to threaten TB control, with loss to follow-up (LTFU) at both pretreatment (diagnosed but not initiated) and on-treatment stages undermining program success. Psychosocial determinants such as stigma, depression and anxiety, alcohol and substance use, and social and family support are frequently implicated, yet evidence is scattered across disciplines, uses heterogeneous definitions and tools, and is seldom synthesized for policy and implementation. Materials and Method This scoping review aims to systematically map psychosocial determinants associated with pretreatment and on-treatment LTFU among people with DR-TB in South Africa, describe how these determinants and LTFU are defined and measured, identify contextual modifiers (e.g., HIV status, sex/age, province, urban–rural setting, decentralization, regimen era), and highlight evidence gaps and practical leverage points for intervention. The review will follow established scoping-review methodology and report per PRISMA-ScR following five steps: (1) defining the research question, (2) search strategy, (3) setting inclusion criteria, (4) extracting data, (5) assessing, summarizing, presenting findings and (6) Consultation. A comprehensive peer-reviewed literature search, including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, will be conducted by two independent reviewers. The review will span over eight weeks, focusing on studies in South Africa published in English language between 2010 and 2025. Article eligibility will be determined using a two-stage screening process with disagreements resolved through consensus and consultation of a third reviewer. The results of this review will be presented as tables, including a narrative synthesis of the findings. No meta-analysis is planned. Conclusion The review will deliver a policy-ready map of psychosocial risks and promising support for DR-TB retention in South Africa, informing the design and targeting of patient-support packages and outlining priorities for future evaluation and standardization of LTFU definitions and psychosocial measures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1439/v1?src=rss">Evaluating the use of Getting It right first time GIRFT guidelines in suspected Cauda Equina Syndrome CES at a London District General Hospital DGH [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but serious condition caused by compression of the lower spinal cord. Early recognition and prompt intervention are essential to prevent irreversible neurological damage. Delays in diagnosis or treatment can lead to permanent disability and may result in significant medicolegal consequences. Aim The aim of this quality improvement project (QIP) was to identify areas for improvement in the diagnosis of CES and update local guidelines in line with the Get It Right First Time (GIRFT) recommendations. Methods and Results This retrospective study, conducted according to GIRFT guidelines, examined patients admitted to the District General Hospital Emergency Department with suspected CES. A total of 37 patients—8 males (21.6%) and 29 females (78.4%)—were assessed over a six-month period from January to June 2023. Patients without CES listed as a differential diagnosis were excluded. Data collected included documentation of neurological examinations, post-void residual scans, perianal sensation assessments, MRI request and completion times, and length of stay. Findings were presented at the Trauma and Orthopedics mortality and morbidity meeting. Overall, 89.19% of MRI scans were completed within 24 hours of request, while 10.81% exceeded this timeframe. Notably, 57% of patients did not undergo a comprehensive neurological examination on admission. Following these findings, a CES proforma was introduced to standardize the assessment process. In the subsequent cycle, documentation improved significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the intervention. Conclusion This QIP highlighted key areas requiring improvement, particularly the inconsistent completion of neurological examinations and delays in MRI access for suspected CES cases. Collaboration with the Emergency Department and radiology services led to the implementation of a CES assessment proforma, ensuring timely and consistent evaluation of patients. This structured approach supports earlier diagnosis, aligns with GIRFT standards, and enhances the quality and safety of CES management within our hospital.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00853-0?rss=yes">Neurons undergo IFNγ-driven persistent epigenetic shifts and synaptopathy in encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                Shammas et al. show a neuronal epigenetic remodeling during CNS encephalitis. This program involves IFNγ-driven persistent reduction in TF-binding site accessibility, linked to long-lasting reduction of synaptic gene expression and associated synaptopathy. Parallel findings in Rasmussen encephalitis patient neurons point toward a conserved cross-species mechanism.

These include a lack of appreciation of the history of the field and what has already been accomplished, and a lack of understanding of the pharmacology of psychedelics and 5-HT2A receptors. These gaps must be recognized, acknowledged and addressed in order for the field to advance responsibly.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 24 December 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67812-3">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-67812-3</a></p>CD163 is a macrophage scavenger receptor central to the clearance of haptoglobin-hemoglobin (HpHb) complexes and the resolution of inflammation. In a remarkable example of near-simultaneous scientific progress, three complementary studies published in Nature Communications1–3 have resolved the near-atomic resolution structure of the full extracellular domain of human CD163 complexed with HpHb, primarily utilizing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The most significant and unified conclusion emerging from this trio of papers is that CD163’s scavenging activity is fundamentally dependent on its ability to form functional multimers.

The effect could provide an experimental diagnostic for identifying the IVC state.

                The majority of vertebrate promoters have a distinct DNA composition, known as a CpG island. Cytosine methylation in promoter CpG islands is associated with a substantial reduction of transcription initiation. We hypothesise that both atypical sequence composition and epigenetic base modifications may affect the mechanical properties of DNA in CpG islands, influencing the ability of proteins to bind and initiate transcription. In this work, we model two scalar measures of the sequence-dependent propensity of DNA to wrap into nucleosomes: the energy of DNA required to assume a particular nucleosomal configuration and a measure related to the probability of linear DNA spontaneously reaching the nucleosomal configuration. We find that CpG density and modification state can alter DNA mechanics by creating states more or less compatible with nucleosome formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104359">Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) regulates interferon-lambda receptor 1 (IFN-λR1) and IFN-λ signaling in influenza A virus (IAV) infection</a></h4>

              
                Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that has several known anti-influenza functions. However, the mechanisms in relation to its expression compartment and enzymatic activity have not been completely explored. Moreover, only limited animal models have been studied to delineate its role at the tissue level in influenza infections. Our results showed that influenza A virus (IAV)-infected <i>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice exhibited exacerbated body weight loss, decreased survival rates, heightened viral replication, and increased lung damage. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that Plscr1 was required for the expression of type 3 interferon receptor (Ifn-λr1) upon IAV infection by binding to its promoter. In addition, PLSCR1 interacted with IFN-λR1 on the cell surface of pulmonary epithelial cells following IAV infection, suggesting it also modulated IFN-λ signaling via protein-protein interactions. The lipid scramblase activity of PLSCR1 was found to be dispensable for its anti-flu activity. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data indicated that <i>Plscr1</i> expression was significantly upregulated in ciliated airway epithelial cells in mice following IAV infection. Consistently, <i>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>;Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup></i>mice with ciliated epithelial cell-specific Plscr1 overexpression showed reduced susceptibility to IAV infection, less inflammation, and enhanced Ifn-λr1 expression, suggesting that Plscr1 primarily regulates type 3 IFN signaling as a cell-intrinsic defense factor against IAV in ciliated airway epithelial cells. Our research will elucidate virus-host interactions and pave the way for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs that target human elements like PLSCR1, thereby mitigating the emergence of drug-resistant IAV strains.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92443">Projection-specific integration of convergent thalamic and retrosplenial signals in the presubicular head direction cortex</a></h4>

              
                Head direction (HD) signals function as the brain’s internal compass. They are organized as an attractor and anchor to the environment via visual landmarks. Here, we examine how thalamic HD signals and visual information from the retrosplenial cortex combine in the presubiculum. We find that monosynaptic excitatory connections from anterior thalamic nucleus and from retrosplenial cortex converge on single layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal portion of mouse presubiculum. Independent dual-wavelength photostimulation of these inputs in slices leads to action potential generation preferentially for near-coincident inputs, indicating that layer 3 neurons can transmit a visually matched HD signal to medial entorhinal cortex. Layer 4 neurons, which innervate the lateral mammillary nucleus, form a second step in the association of HD and landmark signals. They receive little direct input from thalamic and retrosplenial axons. We show that layer 4 cells are excited di-synaptically, transforming regular spiking activity into bursts of action potentials, and that their firing is enhanced by cholinergic agonists. Thus, a coherent sense of orientation involves projection-specific translaminar processing in the presubiculum, where neuromodulation facilitates landmark updating of HD signals in the lateral mammillary nucleus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52513">Structural characterisation of chromatin remodelling intermediates supports linker DNA dependent product inhibition as a mechanism for nucleosome spacing</a></h4>

              
                Previously we showed that <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Chd1 chromatin remodelling enzyme associates with nucleosomes oriented towards the longer linker (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018) (1). Here we report a series of structures of Chd1 bound to nucleosomes during ongoing ATP-dependent repositioning. Combining these with biochemical experiments and existing literature we propose a model in which Chd1 first associates oriented to sample putative entry DNA. In an ATP-dependent reaction, the enzyme then redistributes to the opposite side of the nucleosome, where it subsequently adopts a conformation productive for DNA translocation. Once this active complex extends nascent exit linker to approximately 15bp, it is sensed by the Chd1 DNA binding domain resulting in conversion to a product inhibited state. These observations provide a mechanistic basis for the action of a molecular ruler element in nucleosome spacing.

                Aldosterone is a potent cholesterol-derived steroid hormone that plays a major role in controlling blood pressure via regulation of blood volume. The release of aldosterone is typically controlled by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, situated in the adrenal glands, kidneys, and lungs. Here, we reveal that the class A scavenger receptor MARCO, expressed on alveolar macrophages, negatively regulates aldosterone production and suppresses angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace) expression in the lungs of male mice. Collectively, our findings suggest alveolar macrophages as additional players in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and introduce a novel example of interplay between the immune and endocrine systems.

">Brain-body dynamics is asymmetric and stable across cognitive states</a></h4>

              
                The human body displays slow, spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity, autonomic physiology, and small incidental movements. It is unknown whether these co-fluctuations reflect a stable endogenous brain-body dynamic, or whether this dynamics varies with cognitive state. We addressed this question using a dynamical systems approach to analyze simultaneously recorded neural activity (EEG), autonomic physiology, and behavior while participants listened to spoken narratives or were at rest. We found that cognitive state did not substantially alter the endogenous dynamic. Acoustic and linguistic features predicted neural activity, which in turn affected physiological responses. Only low-level sound fluctuations exerted direct effects on autonomic signals. Peripheral physiology and behavior exerted stronger influences on EEG than the reverse. These findings suggest that slow co-fluctuations are the result of a stable brain-body dynamic with strong bottom-up feedback, and that the narrative entrains this dynamic by engaging cognition.

">Corticolimbic structure-function coupling is sensitive to childhood adversity and buffers adversity-related symptoms during development</a></h4>

              
                Childhood adversity is a potent predictor of mental health problems across the lifespan, and a rich cross-species literature implicates stress-sensitive corticolimbic circuits in adversity-related psychopathology. Structure-function coupling (SFC) is a promising multimodal marker that is sensitive to developmental plasticity. While emerging evidence suggests cortical SFC is sensitive to adversity exposure during early childhood, it is unknown how SFC in stress-sensitive corticolimbic circuits links adversity exposure with mental health across development. We examined associations between adversity exposure, transdiagnostic symptomatology, and both amygdala-cortical and hippocampal-cortical SFC across development in a large sample of youth (N = 607, 39% F). Results revealed that adversity exposure moderated age-related change in amygdala-vmPFC SFC (p = .007), such that youth exposed to higher, but not lower, levels of adversity showed an age-related increase in amygdala-vmPFC SFC. Further, amygdala-vmPFC SFC buffered the effect of adversity on internalizing symptoms (p = .012), such that those youth with higher adversity exposure who had stronger amygdala-vmPFC SFC also displayed lower internalizing symptoms. Separately, higher adversity exposure was associated with lower hippocampal-limbic network SFC (p = .037), which moderated the effect of adversity on internalizing symptoms (p = .010). These findings highlight that structural and functional neurodevelopment of amygdala-vmPFC and hippocampal-limbic network connections may adapt in distinct ways to support mental health following adversity, with implications for risk and resilience against internalizing psychopathology.

                Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are small cells in the central nervous system that proliferate and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes throughout life, allowing for myelin plasticity and repair. G protein-coupled neuromodulator receptors can regulate OPC fate, but the role of individual G protein families is unclear. Here, we use chemogenetics to directly investigate the role of Gq and Gi proteins in OPC fate. We find that expressing the DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) hM3Dq or hM4Di in OPCs without activating them with designer agonists induces constitutive G protein signalling, which alters bioelectrical membrane properties such as voltage-gated ion channels and glutamate receptors in OPCs. Further, we find that hM3Dq or hM4Di expression alone modulates OPC fate, increasing or decreasing differentiation, respectively, suggesting that directly targeting G protein signalling can be used to bidirectionally regulate differentiation. Importantly, our data raise a note of caution regarding the use of DREADDs in both excitable and non-excitable small cells.

All five neuromodulators examined, acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, histamine, and NE, exhibited synchronized infraslow cortical oscillations during NREM sleep. Optogenetic suppression of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons abolished NE oscillations and selectively reduced acetylcholine fluctuations in barrel cortex, whereas targeted inhibition of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons attenuated REM-associated acetylcholine elevations without disrupting NREM-related oscillations or NE dynamics. The synchronized infraslow cortical oscillations spanning multiple neuromodulators reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism for organizing sleep architecture.

">A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of experimental pain on rat grimace scale scores</a></h4>

              
                The rat grimace scale (RGS) purports to assess behavioural responses related to pain by assessing four facial expressions. To understand how experimental pain affects RGS scores, we conducted a systematic review of studies which reported outcomes using this scale (CRD42022292189). Systematic searches were conducted on 3 databases in January 2022. RGS studies that assessed the effects of disease models relating to pain were included. Risk of bias was assessed by using a modified version of the CAMARADES reporting checklist and SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. A standardised mean difference effect size was calculated using a random-effects model. Fifty-four studies were included, in which 15 disease model classes and 16 classes of pharmacological interventions were identified. RGS scores were increased in disease models hypothesised to be associated with persistent pain (SMD = -4.44 [95%CI -6.25 to -2.63]) and this response was attenuated by analgesic drugs (SMD = 1.97 [95%CI 1.25 to 2.69]). Post-surgical models (39% of experiments) and opioids (30% of experiments) were the most commonly reported. We could not ascertain the sources of heterogeneity due to insufficient data. Most studies were assessed as having an unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting quality. The relationship between RGS scores and mechanically evoked limb withdrawal was inconsistent. These findings indicate emerging evidence to support the use of RGS in persistent pain research, but additional research is needed to strengthen these findings. Future studies could benefit from using sex-balanced animal populations with diverse genetic backgrounds. To enhance the impact and reproducibility of their findings, studies should prioritise improvements in reporting quality.

">Neural Mechanisms of Willed Attention Control</a></h4>

              
                Cueing paradigms are commonly used to study the neural mechanisms of visual spatial attention control. In these paradigms, each trial starts with an external cue, which instructs the subject to pay covert attention to a spatial location in anticipation of an impending stimulus (instructed attention). Recent work has introduced a new type of cue which prompts the subject to spontaneously decide which spatial location to attend (willed attention). We studied the neural mechanisms of willed attention control by analyzing fMRI and EEG data recorded at two institutions (UF and UC Davis) using the same willed attention paradigm. The findings include: (1) both instructional cues and the choice cue activated the DAN, (2) the choice cue additionally activated a frontoparietal decision network consisting of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), anterior insula (AI), anterior prefrontal cortex (APFC), dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), (3) the decision about where to attend can be decoded in frontoparietal decision network in choice trials but not in instructional trials, and (4) EEG alpha oscillation patterns immediately preceding the choice cue, but not the instructional cues, predicted the postcue direction of attention and the frontoparietal decision network activity. Based on these findings we proposed a model of willed attention control revealing how the direction of visual spatial attention was decided upon in the absence of external instructions.

">Canonical Wnt signaling controls the fate and plasticity of NG2 glia in the healthy and ischemic adult mouse cortex</a></h4>

              
                NG2 glia, also known as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), exhibit unexpected plasticity in the adult brain after injury, yet the molecular cues guiding their fate remain poorly defined. Wnt signaling contributes to tissue responses following ischemic stroke, but its precise role in post-injury glial remodeling is not fully understood. Here, we define how Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling shapes NG2 glial behavior after focal cerebral ischemia. Using genetic mouse models enabling cell-specific Wnt pathway activation or inhibition, combined with single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and electrophysiological recording, we disclosed a central role for Wnt signaling in post-injury fate specification. We identified 12 transcriptionally distinct subpopulations within the oligodendroglial lineage, including a subset with an astrocyte-like transcriptional profile. Wnt signaling strongly influenced the balance between OPC proliferation and differentiation: pathway hyperactivation impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and expanded astrocyte-like NG2-derived cells, likely through concomitant activation of the Notch pathway. Remarkably, Wnt hyperactivation also induced the appearance of cholinergic neuron-like cells derived from NG2-expressing cells exclusively in the somatosensory cortex; these cells generated action potentials and exhibited sodium conductance characteristic of functional neurons. Together, these findings demonstrate that NG2 glia undergo distinct fate transitions after stroke and that their lineage plasticity is highly sensitive to Wnt pathway dynamics. Targeted fine-tuning of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling may enable directed redirection of NG2 glia toward specific reparative outcomes, including neuronal reprogramming, in the injured adult brain.

">Deterministic dynamics of distributional multi-agent reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how cognition shapes behavior across contexts remains a fundamental challenge for many disciplines. In particular, for the optimism heuristic--i.e., the tendency to overweight positive (relative to negative) information--knowledge remains fragmented, with models developed in specific domains in isolation. Here, we present a unifying computational framework by deriving the deterministic dynamics of distributional multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach discretizes reward distributions through a finite set of neurons, consistent with recent empirical findings on distributional coding in the brain. We validate our framework by reproducing established results across three iconic domains spanning individual exploration versus exploitation, social coordination, and risky choice. Beyond validation, we uncover novel interactions among optimism, reward discretization, and temporal discounting. Specifically, we identify conditions under which choice hysteresis and path-dependent strategies emerge, suggesting that perseveration results from neural reward discretization rather than constituting an independent heuristic. We further reveal "individual dilemmas": circumstances where agents gravitate toward suboptimal yet stable strategies, offering a mechanistic explanation for incoherent choice patterns. Our framework bridges neuroscience, psychology, and collective behavior, enabling empirically testable hypotheses about how cognitive biases propagate from individual cognition to social outcomes in complex environments.

">Cellular- and systems-level profiling of amyloid-beta effects on circadian timing</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of the circadian timing system has been reported in the preclinical phase of Alzheimers disease (AD) and is a well-characterized component of mid- and late-stage AD. Given the distributed nature of the circadian timing system, with a central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and peripheral clocks throughout the brain, understanding how AD affects this system has been challenging. To investigate how AD may disrupt circadian physiology, we focused on the amyloid-beta peptide, a key contributor to familial early-onset AD. Using the 5xFAD mouse model and ex vivo single-cell profiling, we examined how amyloid-beta influences clock timing in both SCN neurons and hippocampal neuronal populations. Circadian profiling of 5xFAD mice (4- and 8-months-old) showed only modest changes in key clock timing properties, including a shortening of the SCN rhythm. Interestingly, the mice showed enhanced rates of re-entrainment to changes in the light cycle, suggesting that elevated amyloid-beta levels increase the sensitivity of the SCN clock to light. Further, using both in vitro SCN slice explant and dispersed SCN culture models, the exogenous administration of oligomerized amyloid-beta had no significant effect on inherent clock timing capacity. In contrast, the timing properties of cultured hippocampal neurons showed a dose-dependent sensitivity to amyloid-beta. This included an elevated mesor and an increased rhythm amplitude. These findings reveal a divergence in amyloid-beta sensitivity between the central SCN clock and peripheral oscillators. This raises the possibility that circadian disruptions in AD may stem from both the destabilization and decoupling of peripheral oscillators from the central timing properties of the SCN.

">Numerical Variability of functional MRI Graph Measures</a></h4>

              
                Network neuroscience provides a powerful framework for studying the mechanisms underlying brain-related diseases. As analyses become increasingly computational, ensuring their numerical reliability has become a critical challenge. Small perturbations introduced during processing can propagate through complex pipelines, leading to variability in outcomes and raising concerns about the reproducibility of reported findings. Addressing this issue requires systematic evaluation of pipeline stability to ensure results remain within acceptable numerical limits. While the numerical variability of structural imaging workflows has been investigated, with findings ranging from stable to highly variable, functional MRI (fMRI) pipelines and their derived graph measures remain underexplored. Without rigorous stability assessment, conclusions drawn from these measures may remain uncertain. We systematically evaluated the numerical variability of graph measures of functional connectivity derived from the widely-used fMRIPrep pipeline and compared it to population variability. The resulting Numerical-Population Variability Ratio (NPVR) values ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 for most graph metrics, indicating a measurable influence of numerical variability on network-derived outcomes. NPVR values varied across brain regions, thresholding choices, and confound regression strategies. These findings highlight numerical variability as an important factor in functional network studies, particularly when examining subtle effects or working with small sample sizes.

">Disorganization impairs cognitive maps built from visual inputs</a></h4>

              
                The human brain organizes fragmented information into internal maps that support inference of latent relational structure. Vulnerabilities in this mapping process have been hypothesized to contribute to psychosis-spectrum disorders. Whether internal maps arise as readily from visual input as from linguistic description remains unknown. Here, participants learned food items associated with two abstract attributes, presented as images or language, organized along two abstract dimensions within a two-dimensional conceptual space. Participants then completed similarity judgments and reward-learning tasks that required inference of the underlying relational structure. We show that cognitive disorganization, a hallmark of psychosis-spectrum traits, selectively impairs spatial sensitivity and reward generalization when relational structure must be inferred from visual input, but not when matched structure is provided by linguistic descriptions. These findings support the shallow cognitive map hypothesis and suggest that cognitive disorganization selectively disrupts the transformation of perceptual input into stable relational representations.

">Open-access template and database approaches for pseudo-CT generation in brain PET/MRI attenuation correction</a></h4>

              
                Positron emission tomography (PET) provides high-sensitivity molecular information in neuroimaging. However, its quantitative accuracy critically depends on attenuation correction (AC). Unlike PET/CT, hybrid PET/MRI systems cannot directly measure photon attenuation, necessitating alternative AC strategies. While several MRI-based AC tools exist, they often raise concerns regarding data privacy, long-term accessibility and reproducibility. We present an open-access framework for PET AC using pseudo-CT (pCT) methods. A database of 60 paired MRI-CT scans was curated and normalized to stereotactic MNI space. Three established pCT approaches (Boston, MaxProb, UCL) were adapted to enable their use with the normalized database. Method performance was assessed by comparison with a CT-based AC reference in an independent validation sample of 28 subjects, using the Jaccard index and [11C]DASB PET-derived serotonin transporter quantification as evaluation metrics. Boston and MaxProb demonstrated consistent performance across database subsets, while the UCL achieved the closest agreement with CT-derived AC and yielded the lowest quantification error (mean relative error <0.5%). This work demonstrates the feasibility of different pCT approaches using a database in MNI space thereby introducing an openly available reference database to support fast, reproducible and continued integration of MRI-based AC into PET reconstruction pipelines.

                Senescent microglia develop during aging and Alzheimer disease (AD), driving chronic neuroinflammation. Here we hypothesized that the previously observed disease-modifying effects of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade occur through clearance of senescent microglia. Using CyTOF, we found that a single systemic anti-PD-L1 injection leads to rapid elimination of senescent microglia in 5xFAD and aged wild-type mice, independently of Fc effector function, while increasing homeostatic microglia. These findings suggest that immune rejuvenation via PD-L1 blockade promotes disease modification in AD through senescent-microglial elimination.

">PATZ1 remodels the nucleosome landscape to promote chromatin accessibility in injured neurons</a></h4>

              
                Adult central nervous system neurons fail to regenerate after injury, in part due to epigenetic constraints that maintain a growth-restrictive chromatin state. We previously showed that the transcription factor PATZ1 reprograms chromatin accessibility in injured corticospinal neurons to promote axon regeneration, but the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here we use nucleosome-resolution profiling to reveal that PATZ1 induces widespread nucleosome eviction at regeneration-associated gene loci. PATZ1 treatment dramatically reduces both nucleosome occupancy and fuzziness, indicating active chromatin remodeling rather than passive destabilization. This remodeling occurs preferentially at distal regulatory elements, where PATZ1 drives a greater than 3-fold expansion of H3K27ac-marked active enhancers. Nucleosome eviction at these sites precedes enhancer activation, establishing a mechanistic link between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming. Our findings demonstrate that targeted nucleosome eviction at enhancers underlies PATZ1-mediated chromatin reorganization, providing mechanistic insight into how epigenetic barriers to CNS regeneration can be overcome.

">Associations between amygdala connectivity and experienced discrimination in children</a></h4>

              
                Discrimination is a chronic stressor linked to adverse health outcomes, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities. Understanding associations between early discrimination and the brain in childhood may help identify mechanisms through which discrimination impacts future health. Data from 4512 children (ages 9-11) and a subsample of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC; N = 1567) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study(R) was used to create linear mixed-effects models that evaluated associations between Perceived Discrimination (PD) and amygdala resting-state fMRI connectivity (AC) to the salience network (SN), default mode network (DMN), and thalamus. PD was measured using the youth self-reported PD Scale. Results indicated that greater PD significantly predicted greater AC to the right thalamus in our full sample. In secondary analyses, environmental and behavioral factors were evaluated as potential moderators for associations significant at least at a trend level in both our full sample and BIPOC subsample. In our BIPOC subsample, traumatic events experienced (TE) moderated the relationship between PD and AC to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; SN), such that greater TE predicted stronger positive associations between PD and this connection. Results suggest PD impacts neural connections in early life, highlighting the need to consider the impact of discrimination on risk for psychopathology.

">10.5 Tesla High-Resolution Macaque Brain MRI for Connectivity Studies</a></h4>

              
                Mapping brain connectivity in primates remains a major challenge due to difficulties in resolving microscopic white matter architecture, while maintaining whole-brain coverage. Increasing imaging spatial resolution is key for disambiguating fiber configurations within smaller anatomical volumes. Here, we present developments that allow high-resolution diffusion MRI of the macaque brain, both in vivo and ex vivo, using one of the world's highest-field human MRI scanners operating at 10.5 Tesla. Our approach achieves data of highest reported resolutions for this field strength and scanner type, (750 m)3 in vivo and (400 m)3 ex vivo, with diffusion weighting up to b = 6000 s/mm2. We detail methodological advances in data acquisition, image reconstruction, processing and whole-brain tractography that overcome critical challenges associated with ultra-high-field imaging. This work establishes a new benchmark for high-resolution neuroimaging at 10.5T, paving the way for comparable human studies and enabling analyses of brain connectivity across species and tissue states at unprecedented detail. The dataset, along with all processing pipelines, containerised workflows, and reusable web services, is openly shared to support reproducibility and future integration with microscopy for studying white matter microstructure and connections at the mesoscale.

">A high-content imaging workflow to screen for molecules that reduce cellular uptake of α-synuclein preformed fibrils</a></h4>

              
                A classical pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases is the formation of protein-rich aggregates and inclusions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), -synuclein (-syn) constitutes a major protein component of pathological inclusions, termed Lewy bodies. These -syn aggregates are hypothesized to spread throughout the nervous system by cell-to-cell transmission acting as templates to amplify aggregate formation. In vitro generated -syn aggregates, commonly called preformed fibrils (PFFs), have been used to investigate a number of aspects related to -syn mediated pathology across different model systems. Here we describe a semi-automated assay to screen for small molecules that interfere with the cellular uptake and accumulation of PFFs. The assay uses dopaminergic progenitor cells (DPCs), derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In an initial screen, we tested 1520 small molecules and identified several molecules that strongly reduce intracellular PFF load in DPCs. From these hits, candidate compounds were validated in dopaminergic neurons (DNs) to demonstrate the utility of the assay. This assay provides a robust, scalable and adaptable tool to screen for molecules that affect PFF uptake in hiPSC-derived cell models. Within the scope of this screen, it led to the identification of a set of compounds with diverse annotated targets that effectively reduce the uptake of synuclein aggregates in DPCs and DNs.

">Speech, gait, and brain dynamics during natural conversation in motion</a></h4>

              
                Communication connects us to others and immerses us in our environment. Mobile EEG and hearing aid-embedded motion sensors allow investigation of communication and movement in real-world contexts. Here we reliably record and model neural responses to natural conversational speech while participants are walking, demonstrating the feasibility of combining EEG with whole-body movement monitoring. Participants (N = 61) performed focused listening and natural conversation while walking indoors and outdoors. Motion sensors, EEG, and audio recordings captured behavioural, neural, and motor dynamics. Walking speed varied with environment and task: faster outdoors and slower during speaking. Temporal alignment between gait and speech revealed coordinated rhythmic interactions, stronger during speaking than listening. Auditory temporal response functions were preserved across listening tasks. Gait TRFs displayed lateralized and temporal dynamics consistent across tasks. These results provide insight into the coordinated interplay of speech, brain activity, and movement. This highlights the potential of multimodal approaches in ecologically valid settings.

">Concreteness shapes semantic representations in bilingual brains</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral studies show that humans process concrete words more similarly across languages than abstract words. This suggests that in bilingual brains, semantic representations may be more similar across languages for concrete concepts than for abstract concepts, but existing neuroimaging evidence is inconclusive. Here, we analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from fluent Chinese-English bilinguals who read several hours of naturalistic narratives in both languages. We used encoding models to estimate voxelwise tuning towards concrete and abstract concepts in each language separately. We then quantified the similarity of cortical semantic representations across languages. First, we find that the cortical organization of concreteness tuning is consistent across languages. Second, semantic representations are similar across languages for both concrete-tuned voxels and abstract-tuned voxels. Third, we find that for abstract concepts, cross-language similarity of semantic representations may be driven by emotionality. Overall, these findings reveal how concreteness affects semantic representations in bilingual brains.

">Figure--ground relationship of voices in musical structure modulates reciprocal frontotemporal connectivity</a></h4>

              
                When listening to polyphonic music, we often perceive a melody as the figure against the ground of accompanying sounds. However, with repeated exposure, this figure--ground relationship may naturally shift, allowing the melody to recede into the ground. In a previous study, we found the consistent pattern of frontotemporal connectivity for the ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star'' (TTLS) melody in the headings of two variations (II and IV) in Mozart's 12 Variations, K. 265, indicating that the TTLS melody, but not the different lower voices, was the figure. However, the frontotemporal connectivity pattern may change in the same phrases repeating in the two variations. In the current study, we examined how frontotemporal connectivity changes in the repeated phrases. In the results, the frontotemporal connectivity pattern between the two variations changed in the final phrase after repeated passages. This suggests that the shift in the figure--ground relationship persists, with the TTLS melody becoming less prominent while the lower voices become relatively more prominent. Additionally, frontotemporal connectivity was strongly correlated with temporofrontal connectivity in the opposite direction. Finally, our data indicate that TTLS melody-based and sensory-based processes in response to a switched figure--ground relationship, are incorporated into the bidirectional connections between frontotemporal and temporofrontal connectivity. Our study highlights the brain's ability to reconfigure figure--ground relationships in the processing of musical voices.

">Spatially resolved translational dysregulation in Grin2a+/- mouse model of schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function (LoF) mutations of GRIN2A, encoding the GluN2A subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), confer a high risk for schizophrenia (SCZ), yet how they affect diverse brain cell types remains poorly understood. Here, we combined subcellular-resolution spatial omics technologies, STARmap and RIBOmap, to jointly resolve single-cell transcriptomes and translatomes for 3,447 genes in the brains of Grin2a+/- mice and their wild-type littermates across 538,188 cells. Translational dysregulation was markedly more prominent than transcriptional changes in neurons. Across neuronal subtypes, a set of genes including Camk2a, Arc, Egr1, Egr3, Chmp2b, and Pja2 exhibited translational reduction in a Grin2a gene dose-dependent fashion, suggesting a connection between NMDAR hypofunction and reduced protein synthesis of downstream synaptic plasticity effectors. In interneurons (particularly parvalbumin interneurons), a strong reduction of Gad2 translation implies loss of inhibitory function in cortical microcircuits, which has long been hypothesized for SCZ pathophysiology. Non-neuronal cell types including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and vascular cells also exhibited region-specific translational changes in neurotransmitter transport, lipid synthesis, myelination, and stress response pathways, some of which co-varied with regional neuron state. Together, our study reveals brain-wide translation dysregulation as a critical mechanism underlying SCZ pathophysiology.

">Hippocampal Cdk5 is regulated by distinct stress paradigms in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Anxiety and mood disorders have been rising since the COVID-19 pandemic, marked by social isolation and stress. Women are disproportionately affected by stress-related disorders, yet the interaction between social isolation and stress remains understudied in females. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an atypical kinase that exhibits sex-specific regulation following various stressors but is studied almost exclusively in males. To complement these findings, we examined sex differences in mouse hippocampal Cdk5 mRNA and protein following short and long restraint stress with or without concomitant social isolation stress. While short restraint stress was sufficient to promote anxiety-like in both male and female mice, it did not alter Cdk5. Rather, hippocampal Cdk5 mRNA increased only after a longer restraint stress duration followed by social isolation, and only in male mice. Hippocampal Cdk5 protein also shifted from the cytosolic to the nuclear compartment only in male hippocampus. Surprisingly, repeated restraint stress promoted exploratory behavior in both group-housed and socially isolated male and female mice. Social isolation alone increased Cdk5 protein in females only. Finally, under all conditions, female mice were less immobile and more exploratory than male mice. Together, these results provide new insight into the sex-specific regulation of hippocampal Cdk5 by the combination of psychological and environmental stressors.

">Early adversity potentiates prefrontal - amygdala communication through CRH+ glutamatergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Early life adversity (ELA) has enduring impacts on emotion circuit function. Following early maltreatment, neglect, or instability in the home, individuals often exhibit lifelong impairments in their evaluation and response to threats. These behavioral changes typically emerge during adolescence and can disrupt this period of enhanced exploration that drives experience-dependent maturation in emotional brain systems. However, the mechanisms linking ELA to increased threat responses remain unclear. We identified a stress-sensitive medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-basolateral amygdala pathway that co-expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and glutamate. We find that ELA strengthens this pathway and increases threat avoidance behavior during adolescence. Inhibiting this pathway rescues ELA-induced elevations in adolescent avoidance, selectively in males. Reducing mPFC CRH expression earlier in development in typically-reared mice mimics ELA phenotypes in males. Together, our findings indicate that CRH signaling regulates developmental circuit plasticity, biasing emotional circuit function and potentially contributing to psychiatric vulnerability.

">Basal Ganglia Dopamine Availability and Immune Activation Interact and Relate to Anhedonia Severity among Youth with Depression</a></h4>

              
                Anhedonia emerges in adolescence, has putative substrates in neural reward and dopamine systems, and is a hallmark of poor course in depression. Psychoneuroimmunology models suggest altered immune and reward systems may jointly underlie its development. When dopamine availability (rather than function) is considered, immune activation may be understood as a moderator amplifying how lower dopamine levels translate into motivational deficits. This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 55 youth with current depression (Mage=21.4 years; Female=75%). Plasma was assayed for relative quantification of 92 immune proteins, followed by dimensionality reduction via principal component (PC) analysis, forming five PC scores. Dopamine availability was indexed by basal ganglia tissue iron, quantified by MRI R2', a measure detectable in youth. Anhedonia was assessed using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), thought to capture overall anhedonia, and Positive Valence Systems Scale (PVSS), which provides overall, anticipatory, and consummatory anhedonia scores. PC1 scores-whose loadings indicated broadly distributed immune protein elevations consistent with general immune activation-moderated the relationship between basal ganglia dopamine availability and anhedonia: At higher PC1 levels, lower dopamine availability was linked to greater overall anhedonia (as measured by SHAPS) and anticipatory anhedonia, but not to consummatory anhedonia. Lower PC2 scores were associated with greater PVSS overall and consummatory anhedonia. Analyses examining individual basal ganglia regions suggest potential differences in dopaminergic-immune interactions across these regions, with effects most consistently observed in the putamen. Findings highlight nuanced neuroimmune pathways underlying anhedonia components in youth and support inflammation-based models of depression emphasizing dopaminergic-immune interplay.

                Spinal cord injuries (SCI) result in the loss of motor and sensory function. We are working towards restoring sensation by developing directed differentiation protocols to generate dorsal spinal interneurons (dIs; dI1-dI6) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Here, we present an improved method that produces human dIs via a neuromesodermal progenitor state, the physiological intermediate for spinal cord development. We show that retinoic acid (RA), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and growth differentiation factor (GDF) 11 direct dI identity, while GDF11 and extended time in culture promotes posterior spinal identities. Together, these protocols generate the full complement of dorsal subtypes along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the spinal cord. To benchmark in vitro-derived dIs, we constructed a single-cell RNA-Seq atlas of the human embryonic spinal cord and used it to show that hESC-derived dIs closely match their endogenous counterparts. The atlas also reveals that the dI4/dI5 populations dramatically expand in comparison with the other spinal lineages. Moreover, they have mechanosensory circuit signatures linked to autism spectrum disorder, implicating spinal circuits in autistic phenotypes.

">Juvenile reinstatement of TCF4 in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome model mice reveals a critical window for genetic intervention</a></h4>

              
                Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of TCF4 which encodes transcription factor 4. As PTHS therapeutics advance toward clinical trials, identifying the optimal timing for treatment is crucial. Our previous research demonstrated that restoring TCF4 during embryonic or neonatal stages, corresponding to prenatal or neonatal periods in humans, improved phenotypes in a PTHS mouse model (Kim et al., 2022). However, PTHS diagnosis generally occurs much later, when infants fail to reach developmental milestones and undergo genetic testing. This raises an essential question: can genetic therapeutics initiated at more clinically relevant time points retain effectiveness? Here, we examined whether reinstating TCF4 in juvenile PTHS model mice could reverse behavioral phenotypes, simulating a gene therapy. Our findings indicate that this delayed intervention largely fails to correct most phenotypes, except for a measure of cognitive function. These results reveal phenotype-specific plasticity and underscore a narrow, early critical window for effective treatment in PTHS. Our study also identifies the hippocampus as a potential target for PTHS therapeutics and suggests that while some cognitive functions may still retain therapeutic plasticity, reversing most core PTHS symptoms may require intervention during the very early postnatal, or potentially prenatal periods, in humans.

">Real-time functional connectivity-based neurofeedback of the DLPFC-amygdala pathway during threat-exposure attenuates anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Background: Adaptive regulation of negative emotion is vital for mental health and dysregulations in this domain contribute to the major mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. On the neural level, efficient emotion regulation has been linked to functional communication between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the amygdala. Gaining voluntary control over this pathway may present an effective strategy for potentiating emotion regulation. Objective: Against this background, we developed a novel connectivity-based real-time fMRI (rt-fMRI) neurofeedback (NF) training that enables individuals to gain volitional control over the DLPFC-amygdala pathway during exposure to threatening stimuli. Methods: The study employed a pre-registered, randomized, sham-controlled design with the experimental group (n = 22) receiving real-time NF information on connectivity between the right DLPFC and the amygdala during threat exposure and the sham control group (n = 23) receiving connectivity NF from a circuit not related to emotion regulation. The ability to maintain regulatory control in the absence of feedback was assessed after four NF runs. Primary outcomes included functional connectivity of the target pathway, as well as anxiety scores. Results: The results demonstrate that successful acquisition of self-regulation of the rDLPFC-amygdala top-down regulatory circuit in the experimental NF group facilitated attenuation of anxiety. Conclusion: In summary, our findings suggest that real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) allows to volitionally enhance rDLPFC-amygdala connectivity, and in turn reduces negative emotional states, rendering the training a promising neurotechnology intervention for mental disorders.

">The synaptic vesicle priming protein Munc13 mediates evoked somatodendritic dopamine release</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine neurons secrete dopamine from their somata and dendrites in addition to their axonal release. Shared and distinct properties have been proposed for somatodendritic and axonal release, but the mechanisms of somatodendritic release remain unclear. We here used mouse genetics, electrophysiology, and imaging to define roles of the synaptic vesicle priming protein Munc13 in somatodendritic release in comparison to axonal secretion. Munc13 ablation in dopamine neurons decreased evoked but not spontaneous somatodendritic dopamine transmission measured as D2 receptor-mediated currents. Imaging with a fluorescent dopamine sensor confirmed this finding and established comparable importance for Munc13 in somatodendritic and axonal secretion. Pharmacological experiments revealed that release from adrenergic terminals contributes to D2 receptor-mediated currents, and their relative contribution was enhanced after Munc13 knockout. Altogether, these data establish important roles for Munc13 in evoked somatodendritic release. These roles are similar to Munc13 functions in axonal dopamine release and at fast synapses. Spontaneous midbrain dopamine release does not necessitate Munc13 in dopamine neurons and may rely on a release pathway that is independent of the prototypical release machinery employed at synapses.

">Representation of emotional expressions across the face and voice brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing emotion expressions from facial and vocal signals is crucial for optimal social interactions. We comprehensively characterized regions within the face and voice processing networks to probe their contribution to unimodal and crossmodal emotion representation. Using multivariate pattern classification analyses, we found that emotional expressions could be reliably decoded from the dominant sensory modality in all individually defined face- and voice-selective regions. Emotion expressions from the non-dominant modality (vocal expressions in the face networks, and vice versa) could also be decoded in all areas except the occipital face areas. A shared neural code for facial and vocal emotions is implemented in the temporal voice areas (TVA), the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and the precentral gyrus (PCG). The simultaneous presentation of congruent facial and vocal expressions elicited distinct activity patterns across most regions, highlighting that multisensory inputs reshape brain responses relative to unisensory stimulation across the entire face and voice brain network. These findings suggest that face and voice-selective regions broadly encode emotion expressions within and even across the senses, relying on a multisensory gradient that converges in temporo-frontal regions where their distributed multisensory responses align to create a supramodal representation of specific emotion expressions.

">Laminar-specific control of response gain and orientation-tuning byparvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons in primate visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the role of the different types of inhibitory interneurons in cortical computations is central to elucidating how the neocortex processes sensory information. The emergence of orientation tuning in primate primary visual cortex (V1) is a canonical model for studying how cortical sensory circuits and inhibitory interneurons compute relevant stimulus features. The selective feedforward convergence of non-orientation-selective thalamic afferents establishes initial orientation tuning in the granular V1 input layer. As signals propagate through the cortical microcircuit, orientation tuning sharpens in extra-granular layers, yet the underlying mechanisms and the contribution of specific inhibitory neuron subtypes within V1 remain unresolved. To study the role of the largest cortical inhibitory neuron subclass, parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons, in this V1 computation, we combined laminar extracellular recordings with bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of PV+ cells in marmoset V1. Our results reveal a striking laminar specificity: in granular layers, PV+ cells implement divisive/ multiplicative linear gain control, whereas in extra-granular layers they exert tuned nonlinear suppression that enhances orientation tuning. Computational modeling suggests that PV+ neurons can control gain by changing a neuron's spiking threshold, and orientation tuning by changing a neuron's input noise, which regulates the neuron's input-output function. Our findings reconcile divergent results from previous rodent studies and establish a framework for understanding layer-dependent inhibitory computations in the primate cortex.

                What lies beneath is the “silent genocide” of deliberately using starvation to kill, its incidence so dire as it has become an emergency issue in contemporary international criminal law. This paper seeks to define starvation as a method of genocide, explore the various problems which arise from demonstrating the requisite criminal intent under the 1948 Genocide Convention. In many wars, hunger is used as a weapon to destroy targeted groups by depriving them of essential resources. Faced both with pivotal legal challenges which arise from the governing frameworks, from the evidentiary dilemma of establishing intent, and the liability limitations of the international courts, the study sets out key questions that we will address. The paper thus demonstrates major flaws in current mechanisms through a comparative analysis of court proceedings, from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the International Criminal Court’s involvement in crises in Darfur, Gaza, and Yemen. This research calls for immediate legal changes and better-armed judges, allowing for the identification and prosecution of starvation as a form of genocide.

                Background Fractional calculus has gained significant attention due to its applications in modeling complex systems. This paper introduces several fundamental fractional operators, including the Riemann–Liouville, Caputo, and Hadamard operators. From these, a novel α-generalized fractional operator is derived, which plays a crucial role in solving fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs). Methods The α-generalized operator is analytically constructed and its properties are rigorously proven. It is then integrated with the Daftardar–Jafari iterative method (DJM) to solve both linear and nonlinear FPDEs. The convergence of the proposed method is established using the Lipschitz condition. Two benchmark equations—the linear fractional Burger’s equation and the nonlinear fractional Heat-type equation—are used to demonstrate the method’s applicability. MATLAB is employed to implement the numerical schemes and visualize the results. Results The DJM combined with the α-generalized operator yields superior numerical results compared to the Adomian decomposition method. This superiority is evident in both accuracy and convergence, especially for the nonlinear fractional Heat-type equation. Tabulated results and graphical comparisons confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach across different values of α. Conclusions The integration of the α-generalized operator with the Daftardar–Jafari method provides a powerful tool for solving FPDEs. Its numerical advantages make it a promising alternative to existing methods. The study recommends extending this framework to other fractional operators, iterative schemes, and potential transformation techniques, with applications in quantum physics, fluid dynamics, and beyond.

                Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important regulators of cellular processes, including those implicated in autoimmune and endocrine disorders. However, their role in thyroid function, particularly hyperthyroidism, remains insufficiently defined. Growth Arrest-Specific 5 (GAS5) is a lncRNA with established functions in tumor suppression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, and may therefore influence thyroid cell regulation and hormone production. This study aimed to assess the expression of GAS5 in patients with hyperthyroidism and evaluate its potential utility as a biomarker. Thirty whole-blood samples from hyperthyroid patients and 20 samples from healthy controls were analyzed. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol, and complementary DNA (CDNA) was synthesized with oligo(dT) primers. GAS5 expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, and statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA, correlation testing, and visualization in R. GAS5 expression was significantly decreased in hyperthyroid patients compared with controls (mean 0.429 vs. 1.004, p < 0.0001), with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Approximately 77% of patient samples showed expression levels below one. Pairwise comparisons confirmed highly significant differences between groups (p = 0.0001). Spearman correlation revealed an inverse relationship between GAS5 and T3 (r = –0.454, p = 0.001) as well as T4 (r = –0.438, p = 0.001).These findings indicate that GAS5 downregulation is associated with increased thyroid hormone production, suggesting a potential regulatory role in hyperthyroidism. GAS5 expression could therefore represent a promising early biomarker for individuals at risk of thyroid dysfunction.

                Background Traditional fuzzy regression approaches, such as Tanaka’s fuzzy minimum method and fuzzy least squares, often lack theoretical guarantees of existence, uniqueness, and numerical stability. These limitations are of paramount importance in engineering applications involving uncertainty, such as predicting the compressive strength of concrete. This study addresses these issues by presenting a mathematically rigorous fuzzy regression model, based on fixed-point theory, formulated within the full metric space of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers using the metric scale d ∞ . Methodology We define a shrinkage coefficient on the trapezoidal fuzzy coefficient vector space and prove, using Banach’s fixed-point theory, the existence and uniqueness of the regression solution. An iterative algorithm is constructed to estimate the coefficients, using alpha computation and Lipschitz continuity to ensure convergence. The University of California, Irvine concrete compressive strength dataset was amplified using ASTM and ACI-based uncertainty coefficients, and the proposed fixed-point model was evaluated against the Tanaka method and least-squares fuzzy regression. Performance was assessed by mean squared error (MSE), coefficient ambiguity, convergence behavior, and toughness under ±5% noise. Results The proposed method demonstrated consistent geometric convergence with an average of 12.3 iterations and zero divergence across all experiments. It also reduced the overall mean squared error by an average of 12.5%, and by up to 25.1% at best, compared to the comparator methods. Coefficient ambiguity—measured by ambiguity width—was reduced by 18.3% compared to the Tanaka method and by 13.3% compared to ambiguity squares. Under noise perturbation, the model exhibits a significantly smaller increase in the mean error (+6.2%) compared to the Tanaka approach (+24.7%) and the LS-based approach (+18.3%), indicating a substantial improvement in robustness. Conclusions Incorporating fuzzy regression within a fixed-point theoretical framework helps resolve the stability, existence, and singularity challenges that have long plagued classical fuzzy regression models. The proposed approach offers a mathematically consistent, computationally stable, uncertainty-aware regression tool suitable for engineering applications involving imprecise measurements. Future work includes extending the model to nonlinear fuzzy structures, Gaussian/LR fuzzy representations, and broader applications in data-driven prediction under uncertainty.

                Background This cross-sectional study assessed the impact of long-term use of skin-whitening products containing corticosteroids on the function of the adrenal glands. Objectives To assess the impact of extended use of corticosteroid-based whitening creams on serum cortisol levels and to examine the prevalence of adrenal suppression among habitual users. Methods This research, executed at the Hawija Technical Institute from January to April 2025, included 57 participants aged 20 to 40. Before enrolling, all participants gave their written consent. Individuals with chronic endocrine disorders or those receiving systemic corticosteroids were excluded. They were split into two groups: 38 regular (14 male and 24 female) users of skin-whitening creams (≥3 months) as the experimental group and 19 (7 male and 12 female) non-users as the control group. The Mindray CL-900i, a fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer, was used to measure the levels of cortisol in the serum. Results In comparison to controls (7.85 ± 3.54 μg/dL; p = 0.0004), users had a significantly lower mean cortisol level (4.25 ± 2.23 μg/dL), with 42% of users exhibiting cortisol <5 μg/dL, indicating adrenal suppression. There were no discernible variations in BMI between the groups or between male and female users. These results show that extended exposure to corticosteroids suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Conclusions Using skin-whitening creams that contain corticosteroids too often can make the adrenal glands work less well. It is suggested that public health measures be used to inform users about endocrine risks and to control these products.

                Abstract* Background Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) represents the most prevalent form of thyroid malignancy worldwide, with increasing incidence rates observed across various populations. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in numerous malignancies, with its encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) playing a crucial role in modulating host gene expression, particularly microRNAs. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) has emerged as a significant oncogenic regulator in various cancers. Objectives This study was designed to investigate the involvement of EBNA1 in the regulation of miRNA-155 in PTC and to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of miR-155 in Iraqi patients. Materials and Methods A case-control study was conducted involving 100 histologically confirmed PTC patients and 100 nodular goiter controls recruited from Baghdad, Iraq, between March 2024 and August 2024. Expression levels of EBNA1 and miR-155 were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Statistical analyses included correlation assessment, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results EBNA1 positivity was higher in PTC cases (82%) compared to controls (41%) (p < 0.001), Both miR-155 and EBNA1 expression levels were significantly elevated in PTC cases, with mean values of 5.38 ± 2.50 and 24.3 ± 11.96, respectively, compared to controls (1.51 ± 1.25 and 15.9 ± 19.20, p < 0.0001). However, correlation analysis revealed a weak negative relationship between miR-155 and EBNA1 expression (r = -0.031, p = 0.758). ROC analysis demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance of miR-155 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.927, sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 87%. Conclusion EBNA1 appears to play a regulatory role in miR-155 expression in PTC, despite the absence of a direct linear correlation. MiR-155 demonstrates strong potential as a diagnostic biomarker for PTC in Iraqi patients, warranting further investigation into its therapeutic implications.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70058?af=R">Hippocampal‐Prelimbic Coupling During Context‐Dependent Extinction Retrieval in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>After fear conditioning, repeated presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS) alone produces a context-dependent extinction of learned fear. The hippocampus has a critical role in this process, but the mechanism by which contextual information encoded by the hippocampus leads to fear suppression is unknown. We hypothesize that contextual information encoded by the dorsal hippocampus supports the recall of extinction memory by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the oscillatory coherence and directional coupling of the hippocampus and mPFC during context-dependent extinction retrieval in a previously published experiment. In this experiment, male and female rats were subjected to auditory fear conditioning followed by fear extinction and extinction retrieval procedures. Previous analyses focused on oscillatory coupling during the CS; here, we performed new analyses to assess hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in the context in which extinction occurred. We found that, after extinction, re-exposing the animals to the extinction context produces a marked increase in dorsal hippocampal theta (6–8 Hz) oscillations. This increase was associated with enhanced coherence between the dHPC and the prelimbic (PL), but not the infralimbic (IL), division of the mPFC. Moreover, Granger causality analyses revealed that hippocampal theta oscillations preceded theta in the PL throughout the extinction retrieval session. This effect emerged during exposure to the extinction context and persisted during the presentation of the CSs and the expression of freezing behavior. Interestingly, this pattern of coherence was not observed between the dHPC and the IL. These results suggest that oscillatory coupling between the dorsal hippocampus and PL facilitates the context-dependent retrieval of the extinguished fear memory.</p>

                This review examines how women entrepreneurs can drive financial technology (fintech) business growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. While fintech is expanding rapidly across the region, the unique role of women-led ventures in promoting innovation and inclusive growth has been underexplored. A narrative literature review of studies from 2015 to 2025 was conducted, with qualitative findings analyzed thematically. Results show that women entrepreneurs leverage mobile technology, AI, blockchain, digital payments, and innovation hub collaborations to enhance market access, financial inclusion, and capacity building. Nonetheless, persistent challenges such as limited digital literacy, regulatory barriers, gender biases, and a lack of gender-disaggregated data constrain sustainable growth and adoption of women-led fintech ventures. These findings highlight the need for targeted policy measures to improve women’s access to finance, technology, and networks, strengthening inclusive fintech ecosystems across Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, empowering women entrepreneurs is critical for fostering equitable and sustainable fintech innovation in the region.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103324">DendroTweaks, an interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on the interplay between two critical components, dendritic morphology and ion channels, to transform synaptic inputs into a sequence of somatic spikes. Detailed biophysical models with active dendrites have been instrumental in exploring this interaction. However, such models can be challenging to understand and validate due to the large number of parameters involved. In this work, we introduce <i>DendroTweaks</i>, a toolbox designed to make detailed biophysical models with active dendrites more intuitive and more interactive. <i>DendroTweaks</i> features a web-based graphical interface, where users can explore single-cell neuronal models and adjust their morphological and biophysical parameters with real-time visual feedback. In particular, <i>DendroTweaks</i> focuses on subcellular properties, such as kinetics and distribution of ion channels, as well as the dynamics and placement of synaptic inputs. The toolbox supports various experimental protocols designed to illuminate how morpho-electric properties map to dendritic events and how these dendritic events shape neuronal output, thereby enhancing model validation. It helps users build high-level, modular model representations and includes a rich set of tools for parsing, generating, and standardizing commonly used neuronal data formats. Finally, it enables model simplification through a built-in morphology reduction algorithm, allowing users to export models for further use in faster, more interpretable networks. By combining extensive visualization capabilities and comprehensive data management functionality, <i>DendroTweaks</i> introduces a novel interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics. This approach will accelerate research on dendritic computations, their underlying mechanisms, and their fundamental role in brain function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106415">Regional heterogeneities of oligodendrocytes underlie biased Ranvier node spacing along single axons in sound localization circuit</a></h4>

              
                Spacing of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. Using this model, we investigated the potential factors underlying the biased nodal spacing pattern. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99426">Functional genomics reveals strain-specific genetic requirements conferring hypoxic growth in Mycobacterium intracellulare</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium intracellulare</i> is a major etiological agent of the recently expanding <i>Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare</i> complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD). Therapeutic regimens that include a combination of macrolides and antituberculous drugs have been implemented with limited success. To identify novel targets for drug development that accommodate the genomic diversity of <i>M. avium–intracellulare</i>, we subjected eight clinical MAC-PD isolates and the type strain ATCC13950 to genome-wide profiling to comprehensively identify universally essential functions by transposon sequencing (TnSeq). Among these strains, we identified 131 shared essential or growth-defect-associated genes by TnSeq. Unlike the type strain, the clinical strains showed increased requirements for genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the type VII secretion system under standard growth conditions, the same genes required for hypoxic pellicle-type biofilm formation in ATCC13950. Consistent with the central role of hypoxia in the evolution of <i>M. intracellulare</i>, the clinical MAC-PD strains showed more rapid adaptation to hypoxic growth than the type strain. Importantly, the increased requirements of hypoxic fitness genes were confirmed in a mouse lung infection model. These findings confirm the concordant genetic requirements under hypoxic conditions in vitro and hypoxia-related conditions in vivo and highlight the importance of using clinical strains and host-relevant growth conditions to identify high-value targets for drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106184">Mac-/Lactosylceramide regulates intestinal homeostasis and secretory cell fate commitment by facilitating Notch signaling</a></h4>

              
                Cell-to-cell communication via Delta-Notch signaling is widely used in various tissues and organs to regulate development and patterning; however, the mechanisms regulating Notch signaling for precise cell fate decisions remain poorly understood. Similar to mammals, the intestinal stem cells in the adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut generate both absorptive and secretory cell progeny, guided by differential levels of Notch activation. Here we performed a forward genetic screen in <i>Drosophila</i> and identified glucosylceramide synthase (GlcT), a rate-limiting enzyme for glycosphingolipid (GSL) production, whose mutation causes the development of secretory cell tumors. Genetic analysis of the GSL synthesis pathway, combined with metabolite rescue experiments, revealed that the tumor formation is linked to a deficiency in Mactosylceramide/Lactosylceramide. This deficiency impaired the endocytic recycling of the Delta, subsequently reducing Notch signaling activation. Conditional knockout of <i>Ugcg</i>, the mammalian ortholog of <i>GlcT</i>, in mouse small intestine caused an excessive differentiation of goblet cells, phenotypes similar to these caused by Notch inhibition. Our study suggests an evolutionarily conserved role for a specific GSL metabolite in modulating Notch signaling during stem cell fate decisions and provides a molecular connection between ceramide metabolism and Notch signaling in regulating tissue homeostasis and tumor formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107021">Cryptovaranoides is not a squamate</a></h4>

              
                Accurate reconstruction of the timescale of organismal evolution requires placement of extinct representatives among living branches. In this way, the fossil record has the capacity to revise hypotheses of organismal evolution by producing representatives of clades that far pre-date the age of the clade inferred using phylogenies built from molecular data and previous fossil calibrations. Recently, one fossil with the potential to drastically change current understanding surrounding the timescale of reptile diversification was described from Triassic fissure-fill deposits in the United Kingdom. This taxon, †<i>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</i>, was originally placed deep within the squamate crown clade, suggesting that many lineages of living lizards and snakes must have appeared by the Triassic and implying long ghost lineages that paleontologists and molecular phylogeneticists have failed to detect using all other available data. Our team challenged this identification and instead suggested †<i>Cryptovaranoides</i> had unclear affinities to living reptiles, but a crown-squamate interpretation was later re-iterated by the team that originally described this species. Here, we again challenge the morphological character codings used to support a crown squamate affinity for †<i>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</i> and illustrate several empirical problems with analyses that find this taxon is a crown squamate. Our analyses emphasize the importance of stringency in constructing hypodigms of fossils, particularly when they may be key for proper time calibration of the Tree of Life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107018">Vascular endothelial-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling as a model for choroidal neovascularization and central nervous system vascular inflammation</a></h4>

              
                In mice, postnatal endothelial cell (EC)-specific knockout of the genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR)1 and/or TGFBR2 eliminates TGF-beta signaling in vascular ECs and leads to distinctive central nervous system (CNS) vascular phenotypes. Knockout mice exhibit (1) reduced intraretinal vascularization, (2) choroidal neovascularization with occasional anastomoses connecting choroidal and intraretinal vasculatures, (3) infiltration of diverse immune cells into the retina, including macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, (4) a close physical association between immune cells and retinal vasculature, (5) a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state in CNS ECs, with increased ICAM1 immunoreactivity, and (6) increased smooth muscle actin immunostaining in CNS pericytes. Comparisons of the retinal phenotype with two other genetic models of retinal hypovascularization – loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling and loss of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling – show that the immune cell infiltrate is greatest with loss of TGF-beta signaling, more modest with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, and undetectable with loss of VEGF signaling. The phenotypes caused by loss of TGF-beta signaling in ECs recapitulate some of the cardinal features of retinal and neurologic diseases associated with vascular inflammation. These observations suggest that therapies that promote TGF-beta-dependent anti-inflammatory responses in ECs could represent a promising strategy for disease modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105782">Predictive modeling of hematoma expansion from non-contrast computed tomography in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients</a></h4>

              
                Hematoma expansion is a consistent predictor of poor neurological outcome and mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An incomplete understanding of its biophysiology has limited early preventative intervention. Transport-based morphometry (TBM) is a mathematical modeling technique that uses a physically meaningful metric to quantify and visualize discriminating image features that are not readily perceptible to the human eye. We hypothesized that TBM could discover relationships between hematoma morphology on initial Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and hematoma expansion. 170 spontaneous ICH patients enrolled in the multi-center international Virtual International Trials of Stroke Archive (VISTA-ICH) with time-series NCCT data were used for model derivation. Its performance was assessed on a test dataset of 170 patients from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study. A unique transport-based representation was produced from each presentation NCCT hematoma image to identify morphological features of expansion. The principal hematoma features identified by TBM were larger size, density heterogeneity, shape irregularity, and peripheral density distribution. These were consistent with clinician-identified features of hematoma expansion, corroborating the hypothesis that morphological characteristics of the hematoma promote future growth. Incorporating these traits into a multivariable model comprising morphological, spatial, and clinical information achieved an AUROC of 0.71 for quantifying 24 hr hematoma expansion risk in the test dataset. This outperformed existing clinician protocols and alternate machine learning methods, suggesting that TBM detected features with improved precision than by visual inspection alone. This pre-clinical study presents a quantitative and interpretable method for discovery and visualization of NCCT biomarkers of hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Because TBM has a direct physical meaning, its modeling of NCCT hematoma features can inform hypotheses for hematoma expansion mechanisms. It has potential future application as a clinical risk stratification tool.

                Trained Immunity is the nonspecific (pathogen agnostic) memory of innate immune cells, characterized by altered responses upon secondary stimulation. This review provides a RoadMap for the discovery and development of therapeutics targeting Trained Immunity, aimed at researchers with strong scientific backgrounds but limited drug development experience. The article outlines five drug development domains – epigenetic, metabolic, differentiation, inflammatory, and memory changes – that guide the identification of molecular targets, model selection, and biomarker development for the discovery and development of Trained Immunity-based therapeutics. It emphasizes the application of preclinical models and artificial intelligence in target discovery and compound screening. Additionally, the review addresses challenges in translating preclinical Trained Immunity findings to clinical trials and highlights relevant disease indications and ongoing clinical trials. This review integrates scientific findings with development strategy and thereby aims to bridge the gap between discovery and clinical application, advancing the field of Trained Immunity-based therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108748">Are peer reviewers influenced by their work being cited?</a></h4>

              
                Peer reviewers sometimes comment that their own journal articles should be cited by the journal article under review. Comments concerning relevant articles can be justified, but comments can also be unrelated coercive citations. Here, we used a matched observational study design to explore how citations influence the peer review process. We used a sample of more than 37,000 peer reviews from four journals that use open peer review and make all article versions available. We find that reviewers who were cited in versions after version 1 were more likely to make a favourable recommendation (odds ratio = 1.61; adjusted 99.4% CI: 1.16–2.23), whereas being cited in the first version did not improve their recommendation (odds ratio = 0.84; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.69–1.03). For all versions of the articles, the reviewers who commented that their own articles should be cited were less likely to recommend approval compared to the reviewers who did not, with the strongest association after the first version (odds ratio = 0.15; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.08–0.30). Reviewers who included a citation to their own articles were much more likely to approve a revised article that cited their articles compared to a revised article that did not (odds ratio = 3.5; 95% CI: 2.0–6.1). Some reviewers’ recommendations depend on whether they are cited or want to be cited. Reviewer citation requests can turn peer review into a transaction rather than an objective critique of the article.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104375">Computer prediction and genetic analysis identifies retinoic acid modulation as a driver of conserved longevity pathways in genetically diverse Caenorhabditis nematodes</a></h4>

              
                Discovery of new compounds that ameliorate the negative health impacts of aging promises to be of tremendous benefit across a number of age-based comorbidities. One method to prioritize a testable subset of the nearly infinite universe of potential compounds is to use computational prediction of their likely anti-aging capacity. Here, we present a survey of longevity effects for 16 compounds suggested by a previously published computational prediction set, capitalizing upon the comprehensive, multi-species approach utilized by the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> Intervention Testing Program. While 11 compounds (aldosterone, arecoline, bortezomib, dasatinib, decitabine, dexamethasone, erlotinib, everolimus, gefitinib, temsirolimus, and thalidomide) either had no effect on median lifespan or were toxic, 5 compounds (all-trans retinoic acid, berberine, fisetin, propranolol, and ritonavir) extended lifespan in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. These computer predictions yield a remarkable positive hit rate of 30%. Deeper genetic characterization of the longevity effects of one of the most efficacious compounds, the endogenous signaling ligand all-trans retinoic acid (atRA, designated tretinoin in medical products), demonstrated a requirement for the regulatory kinases AKT-1 and AKT-2. While the canonical Akt-target FOXO/DAF-16 was largely dispensable, other conserved Akt-targets (Nrf2/SKN-1 and HSF1/HSF-1), as well as the conserved catalytic subunit of AMPK AAK-2, were all necessary for longevity extension by atRA. Our results highlight the potential of combining computational prediction of longevity interventions with the power of nematode functional genetics and underscore that the manipulation of a conserved metabolic regulatory circuit by co-opting endogenous signaling molecules is a powerful approach for discovering aging interventions.

                Declining rates of male fertility pose a significant clinical challenge, while the mechanisms underlying testicular interstitial function remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of the murine testicular interstitium across the postnatal lifespan. The investigation unveiled a previously unrecognized population of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells nestled within the interstitium, hinting at their potential as Leydig cell progenitors. With the aging process of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells, we observed a decline in glutathione levels within the testicular interstitium. Remarkably, these Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells exhibited clonogenic self-renewal capacity and a robust propensity to differentiate into Leydig cells. Intriguingly, when transplanted into Leydig cell-disrupted or failure models, Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> cells efficiently colonized the testicular interstitium, resulting in a notable increase in testosterone production. Exploring the epigenetic landscape, we identified critical transcription factors, most notably Sox4, governing the stem cell fate of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells. Overall, this comprehensive lifespan-resolved single-cell atlas of testicular interstitial cells provides fundamental insights into Leydig cell progenitor biology and regenerative capacity during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102874">GPR30 in spinal cholecystokinin-positive neurons modulates neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain, a major health problem affecting 7–10% of the global population, lacks effective treatment due to its elusive mechanisms. Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal neurons was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Moreover, GPR30 was expressed in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons that received direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons and S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.

<p>We first investigated cellular senescence markers in resected hippocampi from patients with medically intractable TLE through multiplexed immunofluorescence. We next used a mouse model of TLE (pilocarpine induced status epilepticus [SE]) for a combination of immunohistochemistry, behavioral testing, and electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. We implemented 2 strategies for removal of senescent cells (SCs), a genetic mouse model allowing for targeted senolysis, and a pharmacological approach using dasatinib and quercetin.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found a 5-fold elevation of senescent glia in human TLE cases as compared with controls. In mice, we found increases in senescence markers at both the transcript and protein level and predominantly expressed in microglia, which developed within 2 weeks following SE. Senolytic treatment produced a 50% reduction in SCs, rescued long-term potentiation deficits, normalized spatial memory impairments, reduced seizures, and protected a third of animals from epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data demonstrate that SCs accumulate in both human TLE and in a mouse model of TLE and suggest that clearing SCs may be a viable strategy to reduce seizures and associated cognitive comorbidities. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>Mice offer a wealth of opportunities for investigating brain circuits regulating multiple behaviors, largely due to their genetic tractability. Social behaviors are translationally relevant, considering both mice and humans are highly social mammals, and human social behavior disruptions are key symptoms of myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. Stresses related to social experiences are particularly influential in the severity and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders like anxiety disorders and trauma and stressor-related disorders. Yet, induction and study of social stress in mice has disproportionately focused on males, influenced heavily by their inherent territorial nature. Social target-instigated stress (i.e., defeat), while ethologically relevant, is quite variable and predominantly specific to males, making rigorous and sex-inclusive studies challenging. In pursuit of a controllable, consistent, high-throughput, and sex-inclusive method for social stress elicitation, we modified a paradigm to train male and female F1 129S1/SvlmJ <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> C57BL/6J mice to associate (via classical conditioning) same or different sex C57BL/6J targets with a mild, aversive stimulus. While further paradigm optimization is required, social interaction testing 24&nbsp;h after conditioning indicates males socially conditioned better to male targets by exhibiting reduced social interaction, whereas females appeared not to form social stimulus associations. Serum corticosterone levels inversely corresponded to social avoidance after different sex, but not same sex, conditioning, suggesting corticosterone-mediated arousal influences cross-sex interactions. These rigorously controlled null outcomes align with past pursuits&rsquo; limited success in creating a sex-inclusive social stress paradigm.</p>

                Background Lipid deposits on rigid corneal lenses pose significant challenges, impacting visual clarity, lens comfort, and ocular health. Despite advancements in lens materials and cleaning systems, lipid deposition remains a persistent issue, influenced by individual physiological factors and external conditions. This case report explores the composition, influencing factors, and management strategies for lipid deposits through two distinct presentations. Methods Case 1 involved a jelly-like, white, deposits coating the lens surface, whereas, case 2 described localized, irregular, peripheral lipid clusters. Both cases underwent thorough evaluation, including slit-lamp microscopy and spectroscopic analysis, to characterize the deposits’ morphology and composition. These assessments, combined with detailed patient histories, revealed the multifactorial nature of lipid deposition. Results Management strategies were customized for each case, with both approaches successfully reduced lipid deposition, improved lens performance, and enhanced patient satisfaction. This report underscores the importance of a personalized, multifaceted approach to managing lipid deposits on rigid corneal lenses. Conclusions Identifying contributing factors such as tear film abnormalities, material properties, and patient behaviours is critical for effective management. The findings highlight the need for continued innovation in lens material technology and cleaning systems to address this common issue.

                This opinion article examines the convergence between artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification in learning environments, with an emphasis on deep gamification designs aimed at creating interactive and meaningful experiences that transcend extrinsic motivation. The introduction sets the context by presenting AI as a tool that must be critically analyzed within the framework of critical pedagogy, which underscores the importance of adopting technology reflectively, placing the student at the center, and responding to the real needs of the community. The body of the article develops this claim: the integration of artificial intelligence into deep gamification designs can contribute to genuine educational transformation, provided that such integration is guided by critical pedagogical principles and maintains a balance between the potential of technology and the formative power of teaching practices. Arguments related to this claim are provided, including the use of AI in gamified designs to create personalized learning experiences based on students’ needs, rhythms, and learning styles; to transform the way students learn; to offer new educational resources; to adapt elements such as difficulty levels, challenges, and feedback in real time; and to develop engaging learning systems that lead to better academic outcomes. The conclusion emphasizes the significance of instructors utilizing critical pedagogy to direct AI-optimized gamification designs by incorporating culture, creativity, and critical awareness as pillars of educational transformation. This approach enables the surmounting of the obstacles presented by this synergy.

                The fixed-point iteration method is a powerful tool in analysis and its extensions in other branches. It provides a unified structure for proving existence and uniqueness results for various nonlinear problems. This study, conducted within the scope of a real Banach space enriched by uniform convexity, presents an accelerated four-step iterative scheme designed to approximate elements of the fixed-point set corresponding to a mapping called a total asymptotically nonexpansive (briefly, TAN) mapping. The results of weak and strong convergence for the proposed method are established. The results relating to weak convergence require Opial’s condition of the normed space, while the results relating to strong convergence require the addition of the semi-compactness assumption of the mapping under consideration to the previous assumptions. Additionally, numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the algorithm’s effectiveness and compare it with previously established approaches. These findings extend and refine several recent contributions available in the literature. Lastly, the work includes an application to 2- dimensional equations.

                Background Class III malocclusion presents unique challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Bone-anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP) and facemask (FM) therapy are common approaches. Finite element analysis (FEA) helps evaluate their biomechanical effects. The study aims to evaluate and compare the stress distribution and displacement during maxillary protraction on the craniofacial complex using bone-anchored maxillary protraction and a facemask using finite element analysis. Methods A finite element model of the maxillofacial complex was developed using CT scans of a young human skull and analyzed using ANSYS (v18.1). The material properties for facemask therapy and miniplates used in bone-anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP), were gathered to create a 3D finite element analysis (FEA) model. Displacement and stress patterns were assessed in the maxilla, maxillary teeth, mandible, and surrounding structures for both BAMP and facemask therapy, applying a bilateral force of 300 grams. Results Displacement was mainly observed in the maxillary complex for both protocols, with BAMP showing more anterior displacement than the facemask. In contrast, the mandible experienced greater downward and backward displacement with the facemask protocol. Both methods revealed distinct displacement patterns in the dentoalveolar area. The facemask treatment resulted in more forward displacement of the maxillary anterior teeth, while BAMP primarily caused forward displacement in the first and second molar regions. Additionally, BAMP showed higher stress levels in the craniofacial area, particularly at the miniplate attachment site, whereas the Facemask approach had a more even distribution of stress across the craniofacial region. Conclusion This finite element analysis indicates that maxillary protraction can be achieved through both FM and BAMP methods. However, BAMP method showed greater skeletal displacement with fewer dental effects. This implies that skeletal anchorage might provide a better result for treating class III malocclusion.

                Background This socio-economic analysis studies the influence of jasmine production on the economic well-being of farmers in Huvina Hadagali, a region known for its high-quality jasmine flowers. The Vijaya Nagara district’s Havina Hadagali area is well known throughout the country for its jasmine flower farming. In addition to being referred to as Mallige Nadu, this location is also known as Malligeya Tavaru. The cultivation of the jasmine flower is protected by the Geographical Indication (GI) Tag, and this flower has been popular in this region for a substantial amount of time. Methods Data was collected from a sample of 364 jasmine growers using a structured questionnaire in Huvina Hadagali, Vijayanagar district. The data focused on different socio-economic factors such as income levels, employment, market access, and agricultural techniques. The study is analysed using IBM SPSS through frequency analysis and 2-step clustering. Result The results demonstrate that the cultivation of jasmine makes a substantial contribution to the local economy, serving as a main or additional source of income for numerous households. Jasmine farming often contributes 40% of the whole household income, and during peak seasons, it provides significant economic advantages. Nevertheless, the highlighted obstacles were volatile market pricing, pest infestations, and limited access to contemporary farming practices. Due to their decades of experience, it is felt by the farmers. Hadagali Jasmine comes under the GI Tag, hence they are authorised farmers. The study emphasises the crucial significance of cooperative societies and local marketplaces in stabilising income and offering essential resources and training to farmers. Conclusion The research highlights the necessity of governmental interventions focused on developing market infrastructure, offering financial assistance, and improving access to agricultural innovations to maintain and augment the economic advantages of jasmine cultivation in Huvina Hadagali which also lead to an overall development of floriculture in India.

                Background Continuous exposure to sunlight and pollution without adequate protection can damage skin, making it prone to premature aging. One of the natural ingredients for anti-aging is antioxidant. Malang green apple (Malus sylvestris Mill) contains bioactive compounds that can act as antioxidants, but its use is still limited to only as food ingredient. Furthermore, some studies show the potency of fruit fermentation to increase these bioactive compounds. Thus, this study is a preliminary study to examine the anti-aging potency of fermented Malang green apples. Methods Human foreskin fibroblasts were treated with fermented Malang green apple juice extract (FAJ) by Lactobacillus plantarum DAD-13 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fermipan and its unfermented (AJ) for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay and collagen deposition was measured using the Sirius red staining method. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) was measured in fibroblasts after treatment with extracts. Results Cell viability and collagen deposition of fibroblasts tended to be higher after 48 h of extract exposure. Fibroblasts that received FAJ 62.5 μg/mL showed higher cell viability than negative control (p <0.05) and FAJ 31.25 μg/mL showed higher collagen deposition than negative control (p <0.05) at 48 hours of extract exposure. AJ and FAJ also decreased MMP-1 gene expression. They showed a significant decrease in MMP-1 levels (p <0.01) compared to the untreated group, whereas they showed increased expression of COL1A1 at low concentrations. There was no significant difference in the gene expression between FAJ and AJ. Conclusions Our results indicated that Malang green apple juice extract affected fibroblast cell viability, collagen deposition, MMP-1, and COL1A1 gene expression. Exposure of lower concentrations of FAJ to skin fibroblasts for 48 hours showed better results.

                <p>by Marika Constant, Elisa Filevich, Pascal Mamassian</p>

According to the Bayesian framework, both our perceptual decisions and confidence about those decisions are based on the precision-weighted integration of prior expectations and incoming sensory information. While it is generally assumed that priors influence both decisions and confidence in the same way, previous work has found priors to have a stronger impact at the confidence level, challenging this assumption. However, these patterns were found for high-level probabilistic expectations that are flexibly induced in the task context. It remains unclear whether this generalizes to low-level perceptual priors that are naturally formed through long term exposure. Here we investigated human participants’ confidence in decisions made under the influence of a long-term perceptual prior: the slow-motion prior. Participants viewed tilted moving-line stimuli for which the slow-motion prior biases the perceived motion direction. On each trial, they made two consecutive motion direction decisions followed by a confidence decision. We contrasted two conditions – one in which the prior impacted discrimination performance, and one in which it did not. We found a confidence bias favoring the condition in which the prior influenced discrimination decisions, even after accounting for performance differences. Computational modeling revealed this effect to be best explained by confidence using the prior-congruent evidence as an additional cue, beyond the posterior evidence used in the perceptual decision. This is in agreement with a confirmatory confidence bias favoring evidence congruent with low-level perceptual priors, revealing that, in line with high-level expectations, even long-term priors have a greater influence on the metacognitive level than on perceptual decisions.

                <p>by Nishant Joshi, Sven van Der Burg, Tansu Celikel, Fleur Zeldenrust</p>

Neuronal classification based on morphology, electrophysiology, and molecular markers is often considered static. Here, we challenge this view, showing that functional classification depends on input patterns. Using single-cell recordings from layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons in mice, we compared responses to step-and-hold versus dynamic frozen noise inputs that mimic presynaptic activity. Action potential and waveform-based classifications varied significantly, highlighting the dynamic nature of neuronal identity. To assess the contribution of input versus neuronal attributes toward classification, we analyzed four attribute sets, namely action potential, passive biophysical, adaptation currents, and linear input filters derived via spike-triggered averages (STA). Our findings revealed that the STA, which captures a neuron’s selective responsiveness to presynaptic activity, explained the most variance within the population. This highlights input-driven dynamics as key to functional identity, emphasizing the need for physiologically relevant inputs in defining neuronal classes and shifting the focus from static properties to dynamic functional diversity.

                <p>by Romain Enjalbert, Jakub Köry, Timm Krüger, Miguel O. Bernabeu</p>

The tumour microvasculature is abnormal, and as a consequence oxygen and drug transport to the tumour tissue is impaired. The abnormal microvasculature contributes to tumour tissue hypoxia, as well as to varying drug penetration depth in the tumour. Many anti-cancer treatments require the presence of oxygen to be fully efficacious, however the question of how well oxygen concentration overlaps with drug concentration is not elucidated, which could compromise the therapeutic effect of these drugs. In this work we use a computational model of blood flow and oxygen transport, and develop a model for an oxygen-dependent drug, T-DM1, to study the overlap of oxygen and drug concentration in tumour tissue, where we model both compressed and uncompressed vessels in the tumour. Our results show that, due to the compressed vessels present in tumours, areas of sufficient oxygen concentration for a drug to function overlap poorly with areas of sufficient drug concentration, covering 28% of the tumour tissue, compared to 82% in healthy tissue. The reduction in drug and oxygen overlap is due to the altered red blood cell dynamics through the abnormal microvasculature, and indicates that drug transport to tumours should not be considered independently of oxygen transport in cases where the drug requires oxygen to function.

                Background Fluoride-releasing adhesives in orthodontics help protect enamel. The study compared the fluoride release, recharge, and re-release properties of three light-cure orthodontic bonding adhesives: Group A: TransbondTM Plus Color Change, Group B: Waldent Orthobond LC, and Group C: Koden EZ Bond. Methods The study conducted an in-vitro investigation using 24 maxillary first premolar teeth bonded with one of three fluoride-releasing adhesives after etching. Each sample was placed in artificial saliva, and fluoride release was measured over 60 days using a fluoride electrode. After initial release measurement, specimens were soaked in 1000 ppm fluoride solution for 5 minutes, rinsed, and placed in new containers with distilled water before re-release measurements. Statistical Analysis: One-way ANOVA and Repeated Measures ANOVA tests were used to determine significance, with the Bonferroni posthoc test for further analysis. Results The fluoride release rate decreased gradually over time for all three groups. The highest fluoride release occurred on Day 1 for all three bonding agents, with a significantly reduced fluoride release by Day 2. Group A exhibited consistent and highest overall fluoride release throughout the 60 days. Group B gradually declined to release fluoride until Day 7, releasing the least fluoride throughout the study. Group C had a higher fluoride release on Day 1 and Day 2 but slowly declined until Day 14. Group B and Group C sharply declined fluoride release by Day 30 and almost negligible amounts on Day 60. All three agents noted enhanced fluoride release post-recharge, with continuous release until day 14. Greater release on days 7 and 14 compared to the initial release in all three groups. Conclusion Transbond Plus Color Change: Consistent high fluoride was released initially and post-recharge. Waldent Orthobond LC: Lower release throughout the study. Koden EZ Bond: High initial release and post-recharge but continuing to decrease until Day 14.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70056?af=R">Examining the Three‐Dimensional Spatial Architecture of Mouse Amygdala Engram Ensembles</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Memories are stored in a sparse population of neurons active at the time of an event, an engram ensemble, and reactivation of the engram ensemble drives memory recall. Although the amygdala is essential for fear memory encoding and recall, the precise spatial organization of engram neurons within amygdala nuclei remains an outstanding question. We hypothesized that the geometric architecture of an engram ensemble reflects its underlying function, thereby revealing novel organizational principles of memory coding. Using tissue clearing and light-sheet imaging, we mapped Arc-expressing neurons across the entire mouse amygdala in 3D to examine the spatial architecture of engram ensembles for aversive (shock) and valence-neutral (no shock) contextual memories during encoding and recall. At the meso-scale level, we identified distinct spatial “hotspots” of engram neuron density during that were differentially engaged during fear conditioning and fear memory retrieval across multiple amygdala nuclei. Notably, we also found shared spatial features during the retrieval of aversive and non-aversive contextual memories. At the micro-scale level, unsupervised clustering analyses showed that aversive learning and recall was associated with increased clustering of active neurons in the lateral (LA) and basal (BA) nuclei, and selectively in the central capsular nucleus (CeC) during aversive encoding. Network graphs derived from the spatial organization of active neurons revealed highly clustered and assortative local graph structures across conditions. Assortativity increased in the CeC during aversive learning, and hub nodes increased in the LA during aversive learning and recall, and in the CeC during aversive learning. Together, these results suggest that both meso- and micro-scale spatial signatures of neuronal activity differ across amygdala subregions and vary with memory valence and stage. Such structure may shape information flow through amygdala circuits, enhancing signal-to-noise and improving the fidelity of memory encoding and retrieval.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1428/v1?src=rss">Immersive Metaverse Learning Environment (IMLE) to Improve Social-Cognitive Skills in STEAM Learning in Elementary Schools [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The development of social-cognitive skills is increasingly important in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) learning at the elementary school level. Immersive Metaverse Learning Environments (IMLEs) offer students the opportunity to learn in interactive virtual spaces, but research on their integration into STEAM learning remains limited, particularly in enhancing cognitive, social, and collaborative aspects. Purpose This study aims to test the effectiveness of using IMLE technology in improving social-cognitive skills in STEAM learning in elementary schools. Design/Methodology/Approach This study employed a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data were used to assess the effectiveness of IMLE in improving social-cognitive skills, while qualitative data explored student and teacher experiences through observations, interviews, and analysis of classroom learning activities. The study subjects included 50 elementary school students in Surabaya, Indonesia. Results The study findings showed significant improvements in students’ social-cognitive skills, including collaboration, problem-solving, empathy, communication, and learning motivation. Furthermore, the use of IMLE contributed to improved STEAM learning outcomes and enriched learning interactions. Originality/Value Research on the integration of IMLE into STEAM learning in elementary schools is still rare, both in Indonesia and globally. This study demonstrates that IMLE effectively supports the development of social-cognitive skills while encouraging innovation in immersive technology-based learning practices. These findings provide valuable contributions to teachers in adopting interactive, student-centered learning media.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1427/v1?src=rss">Clinical Risk Factors and Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns of Multidrug Resistant Enterobacter cloacae Isolates from Hospitalized Patients. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Enterobacter cloacae is considered an important hospital-acquired pathogen associated with bloodstream, respiratory, and wound infections. Its increasing ability to acquire multidrug-resistant (MDR) traits poses a serious challenge for both infection control and therapeutic management. This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial resistance profiles, prevalence of MDR, and associated clinical risk factors of E. cloacae isolated from hospitalized patients. Methods Four hundred clinical specimens such as blood, pus, and sputum were collected between July 2024 and July 2025 from hospitalized patients suspected to have a bacterial infection. Risk-factor data were obtained through medical record review. Manual and automated identification with antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using the BD Phoenix™ automated microbiology system. Results Most infected patients with E. cloacae were male (64%) and aged 60 years or older (56%). Significant risk factors associated with MDR E. cloacae infections included prior antibiotic exposure (p = 0.008), hospitalization longer than 10 days (p = 0.021), and ICU admission (p = 0.034). All isolates (100%) were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin–clavulanate, cefazolin, and cefuroxime. Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime 70%, cefepime 70%, ceftriaxone 64%), along with ciprofloxacin (44%), levofloxacin (44%), and tigecycline (50%), showed high resistance rates, indicating reduced activity of major antibiotic classes. Imipenem resistance was detected in 34% of isolates, while amikacin (10%), meropenem (10%), and ertapenem (10%) retained good activity. Ceftolozane–tazobactam remained fully effective (100% susceptibility). The overall prevalence of MDR was 86%. Conclusion A high prevalence of MDR E. cloacae was identified among hospitalized patients, with strong associations to ICU stay, prolonged hospitalization, and prior antibiotic use. Despite widespread resistance to β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, ceftolozane–tazobactam, amikacin, meropenem, and ertapenem remain effective therapeutic options. The findings emphasize the importance of strengthening local antimicrobial stewardship programs and establishing region-specific surveillance data to guide empirical treatment and support infection-prevention strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1426/v1?src=rss">Impact of sample size on optimisation algorithms for the MLP used in the prediction of client subscription to a term deposit [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background One of the disadvantages of the multilayer perception (MLP), which is a machine learning (ML) algorithm used in various fields, includes the uncontrollable growth of the number of total parameters, which may make MLP redundant in such high dimensions, and the uncontrollable growing stack of layers that ignores spatial information. Optimization algorithms were developed to determine the optimum number of parameters for MLP. Methods In this paper, the performances of the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are compared. The study also sought to determine the impact of sample size variations on these optimization algorithms. A dataset on the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with a sample size of 4 521 was used. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance the binary dependent variables for the training data across various sample sizes. Results Based on the classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F-score, and execution time, the MLP based on CMA-ES (CMA-ES-MLP) was identified as the best classifier overall, as it maintained high rates of these classification metrics and was the second fastest to train. CMA-ES-MLP with a training sample of 5 114 was our ideal classifier, and it competes well with the classifiers that have been built by previous studies that used the same dataset. Conclusions The study found no consistent increase or decrease in the classification performance of the algorithms as the sample size increased, and the metrics fluctuated rapidly across sample sizes. It is recommended that future studies be conducted to compare the best-performing classifiers identified in previous studies with the CMA-ES-MLP in this study under the same experimental conditions.

                Background The diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) relies on clinical manifestations, as no definitive gold standard exists. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is emerging as a potential biomarker for diagnosing severe ITP. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of LDH and its correlation with clinical severity in ITP patients. Methods This prospective observational study included 62 patients diagnosed with primary or secondary ITP. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected, and serum LDH along with platelets were analyzed at recruitment. The diagnostic utility of serum LDH in distinguishing severe from non-severe ITP was evaluated. Results A total of 62 patients with ITP were studied, 64.5% had severe thrombocytopenia and 35.4% had non-severe thrombocytopenia. The median serum LDH level was significantly higher in severe ITP (276 [216–307]) compared to non-severe ITP (209 [184–275]), p=0.03. LDH showed a negative correlation with platelet count (ρ = -0.817, p = 0.01) and plateletcrit (p = -0.26, p = 0.03), while no correlation was observed with MPV. The cut-off value of LDH was 234U/L, with a specificity of 62.5% and sensitivity of 63.6%, respectively for diagnosing severe thrombocytopenia. Conclusion There was a significant elevation of serum LDH levels in patients with severe ITP compared to non-severe ITP.

                Background The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) provides a secure cloud-based environment where research and education communities can analyze genomic and biomedical data. The platform supports a wide range of data analysis as well as the ability to safely store and access data in compliance with NIH policies. The purpose of this study is to better understand the current user base of the AnVIL platform. Methods We conducted the AnVIL Community Poll to collect baseline information, identify development opportunities, guide the prioritization of user support strategies, and succinctly but comprehensively describe the current AnVIL Community. The poll was shared through social media and relevant mailing lists. Respondents were categorized as potential or returning users depending on their usage description. Results Our sample of the AnVIL community found opportunities for platform adoption beyond the current user base and identified areas where training should be enhanced, training preferences, and user computational needs. Specifically, while most respondents were involved in human genomics research, there may be potential for growth in adoption of the platform by prioritizing materials to support clinical researchers. All respondents felt availability of specific tools or datasets was a key feature of the platform. The broader community may also benefit from further development or showcasing of resources to facilitate cost management, finding and incorporating analysis tools, and data import. Our sample greatly preferred virtual training opportunities and returning users of the platform foresaw needing large amounts of storage. Conclusion This poll provided an insightful snapshot of the current state of the AnVIL and demonstrated areas where the AnVIL Team can take specific steps to address barriers related to platform adoption and further support the existing and varied AnVIL Community. This work can be built upon through user interviews, community discussion, and coordinating a recurring poll.

                Background A standby system is defined as a system consisting of several components, where only one component operates at a time while the others remain in standby mode. The system fails when the applied stress exceeds the strength of the active component, at which point one of the standby components is activated. It is assumed that the inactive components do not undergo any change in their properties while in standby mode, and the system is considered to have failed when all its components have failed. Methods In this study, a mathematical formula of the standby system was derived for more than one component. Y is subject to independent random variable Ψ with Distribution of stress, which is considered a combination of two exponentials and the stress. It follows the following distributions: one-parameter exponential, two-parameter exponential, one parameter Lindley, and two-parameter generalized exponential. Hence, the dependent functions of the standby system are found { R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) , R ( 4 ) , R 4 } depending on the mathematical formulas derived for each of the four distributions mentioned above. Results In this section, we will obtain the stress-strength of standby Reliability system R 4 , based on four different distributions the above mentioned, the standby Reliability functions R ( 2 ) for distributions are given by adding Marginal Reliability R ( 1 ) and R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) given by adding R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) and R ( 3 ) . Also R 4 given by adding R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) and R ( 4 ) , and parameters estimator by maximum likelihood. Conclusions a simulation study will be conducted to see the behavior of { R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) , R ( 4 ) , R 4 } of a standby system for four different distributions, in this simulation study will be conducted to see the estimator for all distributions and compare the results by using one important statistical criteria mean square error (MSE). Then results will be discussed to see which one of the estimators is the best for each one of the distributions separately.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78117?af=R">The Phenotypic Spectrum of Sporadic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob Disease Cortical Subtype</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of the rare sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cortical subtype (sCJDMM/MV2C) in a large multicentric autopsy cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated clinical histories, biofluid markers, brain diffusion-weighted (DW)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings in 56 patients. The histomolecular assessment included misfolded prion protein (PrP) typing by immunoblotting, histopathology, and PrP immunohistochemistry in several brain areas.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Misfolded PrP typing showed a dominant 19 kDa unglycosylated PrP fragment (type 2) in all brains, focally associated with a 21 kDa (type 1) fragment in 53% of participants (MM/MV2C + 1). Immunohistochemistry revealed coarse/perivacuolar PrP deposits in the neocortices and a patchy/coarse pattern in the cerebellar molecular layer. The mean disease duration was 16.0 months. At onset and early stages, most patients manifested only progressive cognitive decline, consistent with the predominant distribution and relative severity of spongiform change in the cerebral cortex. Brain DW-MRI showed cortical hyperintensities in 94% of cases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay was positive in 70% of cases. Compared with pure MM/MV2C, the mixed MM/MV2C + 1 phenotype showed a shorter disease duration (14 vs 19 months), and a higher frequency of striatal DW-MRI hyperintensity (56% vs 19%), EEG periodic sharp-waves complexes (41% vs 6%), and CSF RT-QuIC positivity (86% vs 53%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The clinicopathologic phenotype of sCJDMM/MV2C diverges from that of typical sCJDMM/MV1. Moreover, the histomolecular heterogeneity within MM/MV2C influences clinical features and results of diagnostic investigations, challenging its identification in vivo. Nonetheless, results suggest that DW-MRI and CSF RT-QuIC allow an accurate clinical diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in most patients. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                The rapid evolution of bioinformatics and data-driven life sciences necessitates widespread, effective training solutions capable of transcending geographical and institutional boundaries. ELIXIR, as a pan-European bioinformatics research infrastructure, has strategically embraced e-learning methodologies to meet this challenge. This white paper systematically reviews the current landscape of e-learning initiatives across various ELIXIR Nodes and Communities, detailing both historical developments and contemporary practices. It identifies core attributes and desirable features of effective e-learning, presenting an analysis of diverse educational platforms and the deployment of Learning Management Systems (LMS) within ELIXIR’s framework. Emphasis is placed on the interactive, open-access, and sustainable nature of these resources, exemplified by platforms such as the Training e-Support System (TeSS) and the ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP). The paper highlights critical advancements toward standardization and interoperability through initiatives such as the adoption of SCORM protocols, facilitating resource reuse across Nodes. Additionally, the integration of e-learning into broader educational strategies—such as hybrid learning environments and structured learning paths—is examined. Finally, future directions are discussed, including strategies for integrating e-learning with traditional training methods, enhancing trainer expertise, and further expanding the availability and FAIRification of bioinformatics training resources.

                Abstract* Background Fresh produce is a vital vehicle for the transmission of foodborne pathogens, yet data from low- and middle-income countries on contamination levels and associated health risks remain scarce. Methods This study provided an analysis of Listeria species contamination in 208 fruit and vegetable samples from major geopolitical regions in Nigeria. Conventional microbiological techniques and molecular methods were used for the analysis. Results We reported a high prevalence (38.5%) and substantial bacterial loads (up to 8.33×102 CFU/25g) among the organically grown crops, with produce from Northern states exhibiting the highest contamination. Genetic characterisation revealed significant diversity, including novel strains and others closely related to global clones, confirming a resilient environmental presence. Importantly, antibiotic susceptibility testing uncovered alarming resistance rates to vancomycin (83.1%) and oxacillin (88.1%), with hierarchical clustering identifying distinct multidrug-resistant clusters. The presence of resistance genes (vanA, vanB, tetL, tetM) and the virulence gene hly was confirmed. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), incorporating this empirical data, estimated the annual probability of illness, highlighting high-risk produce-region combinations. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that fresh produce in Nigeria is a significant reservoir of pathogenic, antimicrobial-resistant L. monocytogenes, posing a serious public health threat. This study highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions, including enhanced agricultural water safety and strengthened surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, to mitigate risks and support evidence-based food safety policies in Nigeria and similar regions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1420/v1?src=rss">Effect of Corruption, Inequality, and Unemployment on Poverty in South African Perspective: Evidence from Quantile Regression Model. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background introduction Corruption has emerged to the point where it is underreported but in reality, it haunts many people daily, especially in public offices. In South Africa the corruption take place in most government institutions, government administration at top level, middle and lower level of government. Corruption benefits the few and harm the majority of people living as lower income households. The economic literature has little evidence of the connection between corruption and poverty. Many studies have concentrated on the causal effect of poverty on corruption, not vice versa. Method This study extends the literature on corruption to investigate the impact of corruption on poverty from a South African perspective. Other control variables such as the Gini coefficient and unemployment were considered equally. Secondary data stretching from 2000 to 2021 were selected based on data availability it was then converted to quarterly data (poverty and corruption). The study used the quantile regression model, descriptive statistics table and data trends of the selected variables. Results The results of the quantile regression model indicate that corruption has a positive and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles (25th, 50th, and 75th). Moreover, income inequality has a positive, dominant, and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles, and unemployment equally causes poverty at all quantiles. This imply that socio-economic issues are a threat that exacerbate poverty in South Africa. Conclusion The study argues that policymakers should invest in youth development programs concerning entrepreneurship, education and support women cooperatives and small businesses to reduce the high dependency ratio of people on state services and to reduce high inequality and unemployment rates. The study was limited to investigate the causal effect that run from corruption to poverty only and not on the other way around.

                Background High-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) has gained interest as an adjunctive therapy in cancer care due to its pro-oxidative antioxidative and cytotoxic effects. Despite growing research, a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the efficacy and safety of HDIVC in advanced solid tumors remains limited. Materials and Methods This review will follow the six steps of the Arksey and O’Malley framework, as adapted by Levac et al, namely: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection eligibility, charting the data, collating, summarizing and reporting the results, and consultation. PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases will be used for the search of articles from 2000 – 2025. Grey literature will also be conducted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will be used as a guide for this scoping review protocol. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine the eligibility of articles with two independent reviewers. Discrepancies will be handled by consensus or by consulting an expert in cancer care. The selection of studies for the review is anticipated to be completed within 12 weeks, from 01 October to 31 December 2025. The extracted data will be analyzed and presented in a report. Conclusion This scoping review will consolidate evidence on HDIVC for advanced solid tumors, identifying efficacy outcomes, safety profiles, and patient experiences limited to African adult populations and other global studies applicable to African settings in African populations that will inform clinical practice and guide policy making. Ethics and Dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. However, the results of this search will be disseminated through academic presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1324/v2?src=rss">Systematic review  of ethnomedicinal knowledge: Documentation, evaluation, and conservation of medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Ethnomedicine and ethnobotany constitute key fields for understanding how different cultures document, use, and transmit knowledge related to medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications. In recent decades, growing scientific interest has highlighted their potential contributions to healthcare systems, biodiversity conservation, and the preservation of cultural heritage. However, the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into modern medicine faces persistent challenges, particularly the lack of standardized documentation protocols and rigorous scientific validation. In this context, the present systematic review aims to assess the documentation, evaluation, and conservation of medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications across diverse cultural settings. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, using Scopus, EBSCO, and Web of Science databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2007 and 2024. Seventy studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed thematically to identify trends, methodological approaches, and research gaps. The findings reveal a wide diversity of medicinal plants and ethnomedicinal practices, with a strong emphasis on the documentation and conservation of traditional knowledge. Nevertheless, significant gaps persist in terms of phytochemical, pharmacological, and clinical validation, as well as in the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into conservation and public health policies. The thematic analysis underscores the need for standardized methodological frameworks and multidisciplinary approaches to strengthen the scientific validation, conservation, and intergenerational transmission of ethnomedicinal knowledge, ensuring its relevance for modern medicine and sustainable development.

                Background The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among scuba divers in Saudi Arabia towards equipment infection control measures, protective guidelines measures and potential post COVID-19 infection complications. Methods A cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of 35 close-ended questions, which covered the scuba divers’ profile and experience, the KAP of COVID-19 precautionary measures during diving activities as well as the demographic data and background of the scuba divers. KAP scores were subjected to non-parametric tests of statistical significance (Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Most of the 461 participants’ answers were in agreeance on the proper KAP of infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude between all the demographic and professional variables (p<0.05) except for gender and region of residence (p>0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant practice difference among age groups, education levels, and employee status in the diving center (p<0.05). Conclusions Our findings showed that scuba divers presented a good level of KAP of infection control measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease. Local officials and diving organizations need to continue their efforts in combating and control the spread of this pandemic.

<p>(A) Macroscopic connectome gradients were constructed for AD patients. (B) Gradient metrics, including gradient eccentricity and network median distance, were computed. The association between gradient values and rich-club organization was also investigated. Ultimately, we observed that the compression of cortical hierarchies in AD patients impacts cognitive function, potentially serving as a neuroimaging biomarker.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This investigation centered on Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline. Functional connectome gradient analysis was utilized to investigate alterations in the hierarchical architecture of brain networks in AD. The study cohort consisted of 222 subjects, encompassing 111 AD patients and 111 normal controls (NC). Connectome gradients were computed via a dimensionality reduction technique based on diffusion map embedding and analyzed at both the region of interest (ROI) and network levels. Additional connectome gradient metrics, including network median distance and gradient eccentricity, were calculated, and the relationship between connectome gradients and rich-club organization was assessed. These connectome gradient values were subsequently correlated with clinical cognitive scores. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the principal gradient range in AD patients. At the network level, gradient values exhibited an increase in the somatomotor (SMN) and visual networks (VIS), while decreasing in the default mode (DMN) and frontoparietal networks (FPN) relative to controls. Analyzes of network mean distance and gradient eccentricity further revealed compression of the brain cortical hierarchy in AD patients. Furthermore, rich-club analyzes indicated a reduction in the gradient value difference between hub and peripheral nodes in AD patients. Finally, clinical correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the degree of cognitive impairment and the degree of compression of the brain cortical hierarchy. These findings provide a novel perspective on the study of brain network organization in AD patients, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                The Alzheimer’s risk genes at the MS4A locus have poorly described function. Rosner et al. show that MS4A4A and MS4A6A cooperate to negatively regulate the TREM2 and TYROBP risk genes and microglia activity. MS4A4A antibodies increase TREM2 and beneficial microglia functions, suggesting therapeutic potential for this axis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109183">Cerebellar climbing fibers impact experience-dependent plasticity in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the cerebellum, climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals for supervised learning at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses. It has not been tested so far whether CF signaling may also influence plasticity in other brain areas. Here, we show that optogenetic CF activation suppresses potentiation of whisker responses in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex of awake mice that is observed after repeated whisker stimulation. Using two-photon imaging and chemogenetics, we find that CFs control plasticity by modulating SST- and VIP-positive interneurons in S1 cortex. Transsynaptic labeling identifies zona incerta (ZI) to thalamic posterior medial nucleus projections as a pathway for cerebellar output reaching S1 cortex. Chemogenetic inhibition of PV-positive neurons in the ZI prevents CF co-activation effects, identifying the ZI as a critical relay. Our findings demonstrate that CFs impact sensory signal processing and plasticity in S1 cortex and thus may convey instructive signals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98117">Human EEG and artificial neural networks reveal disentangled representations and processing timelines of object real-world size and depth in natural images</a></h4>

              
                Remarkably, human brains have the ability to accurately perceive and process the real-world size of objects, despite vast differences in distance and perspective. While previous studies have delved into this phenomenon, distinguishing the processing of real-world size from other visual properties, like depth, has been challenging. Using the THINGS EEG2 dataset with human EEG recordings and more ecologically valid naturalistic stimuli, our study combines human EEG and representational similarity analysis to disentangle neural representations of object real-world size from retinal size and perceived depth, leveraging recent datasets and modeling approaches to address challenges not fully resolved in previous work. We report a representational timeline of visual object processing: object real-world depth processed first, then retinal size, and finally, real-world size. Additionally, we input both these naturalistic images and object-only images without natural background into artificial neural networks. Consistent with the human EEG findings, we also successfully disentangled representation of object real-world size from retinal size and real-world depth in all three types of artificial neural networks (visual-only ResNet, visual-language CLIP, and language-only Word2Vec). Moreover, our multi-modal representational comparison framework across human EEG and artificial neural networks reveals real-world size as a stable and higher-level dimension in object space incorporating both visual and semantic information. Our research provides a temporally resolved characterization of how certain key object properties – such as object real-world size, depth, and retinal size – are represented in the brain, which offers further advances and insights into our understanding of object space and the construction of more brain-like visual models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105627">Afadin-deficient mouse retinas exhibit severe neuronal lamination defects but preserve visual functions</a></h4>

              
                Neural lamination is a common feature of the CNS, with several subcellular structures, such as adherens junctions (AJs), playing a role in this process. The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, in mice leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses. Our results indicate that retinas with severely altered morphology still retain some capacity to process light stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105539">Structural basis for collagen recognition by the Streptococcus pyogenes M3 protein and its involvement in biofilm</a></h4>

              
                The M protein is an essential virulence factor of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, or group A streptococcus (GAS), one of the most common and dangerous human pathogens. Molecular and functional characterization of M protein variants and their interactions with host components is crucial for understanding streptococcal pathogenesis and vaccine development. The M3 protein is produced by the prevalent <i>emm</i>3 GAS serotype, which is frequently associated with severe invasive diseases. Here, we structurally and biochemically characterize the interaction of M3 with human collagens. High-resolution structures of the N-terminal M3 domain in the free state as well as bound to a collagen peptide derived from the Collagen Ligands Collection reveal a novel T-shaped protein fold that presents binding sites complementing the characteristic topology of collagen triple helices. The structure of the M3/collagen peptide complex explains how <i>emm</i>3 GAS and related streptococci, such as <i>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</i> subsp. <i>equisimilis</i>, can target collagens to enable colonization of various tissues. In line with this, we demonstrate that the M3/collagen interaction promotes enhanced biofilm formation of <i>emm</i>3 GAS in an <i>emm</i> type-specific manner, which can be inhibited with the recombinant N-terminal M3 domain. Further, <i>emm</i>3 GAS are shown to colocalize with collagen in tissue biopsies from patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, where GAS biofilms are common. This observation is reproduced in infected organotypic skin models. Together, these data provide detailed molecular insights into an important streptococcal virulence mechanism with implications for the understanding of invasive infections, strategies for treating biofilm and M-protein-based vaccine design.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98817">Cone bipolar cell synapses generate transient versus sustained signals in parallel ON pathways of the mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Parallel processing is a fundamental organizing principle in the nervous system and understanding how parallel neural circuits generate distinct outputs from common inputs is a key goal of neuroscience. In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feedforward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and two-photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha retinal ganglion cells (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (types 5i, 6, and 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate that feedforward bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Modern robots face a challenge shared by biological systems: how to learn and adaptively express multiple sensorimotor skills. A key aspect of this is developing an internal model of expected sensorimotor experiences to detect and react to unexpected events, guiding self-preserving behaviors. Associative skill memories (ASMs) address this by linking movement primitives to sensory feedback, but existing implementations rely on hard-coded libraries of individual skills. A key unresolved problem is how a single neural network can learn a repertoire of skills while enabling integrated fault detection and context-aware execution. Here we introduce neural associative skill memories (neural ASMs), a framework that uses self-supervised temporal predictive coding to integrate skill learning and expression using biologically plausible local learning rules. Unlike traditional ASMs, which require explicit skill selection, neural ASMs implicitly recognize and express skills through contextual inference, enabling fault detection using “predictive surprise” across the entire learned repertoire. Compared to recurrent neural networks trained using backpropagation through time, our model achieves comparable qualitative performance in skill memory expression while using local learning rules and predicts a biologically relevant speed-versus-accuracy trade-off. By integrating fault detection, reactive control, and skill expression into a single energy-based architecture, neural ASMs contribute to safer, self-preserving robotics and provide a computational lens to study biological sensorimotor learning.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This paper offers a road map for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests on enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents’ world models, a problem that falls under structure learning (also known as causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry, and model reduction in structure learning and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. We then outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov’s laws of robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing, or design new, aligned structure learning systems.</span>

Given the high level of generality, our findings formally support the idea that the gradient is a fundamental object underlying all learning processes. Our results are valid across a wide range of common settings, including continuous- time, discrete-time, stochastic, and higher-order learning rules, as well as loss functions with explicit time dependence.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This simulation study shows how a set of working memory tasks can be acquired simultaneously through interaction between a stacked recurrent neural network (RNN) and multiple working memories. In these tasks, temporal patterns are provided, followed by linguistically specified task goals. Training is performed in a supervised manner by minimizing the free energy, and goal-directed tasks are performed using the active inference (AIF) framework. Our simulation results show that the best task performance is obtained when two working memory modules are used instead of one or none and when self-directed inner speech is incorporated during task execution. Detailed analysis indicates that a temporal hierarchy develops in the stacked RNN module under these optimal conditions. We argue that the model’s capacity for generalization across novel task configurations is supported by the structured interplay between working memory and the generation of self-directed language outputs during task execution. This interplay promotes internal representations that reflect task structure, which in turn support generalization by enabling a functional separation between content encoding and control dynamics within the memory architecture.</span>

                <p>by Veronika Petrova, Muqing Niu, Thomas S. Vierbuchen, Emily S. Wong</p>

Single-cell RNA-seq data from F1 hybrids provides a unique framework for dissecting complex regulatory phenomena, but allelic measurements are limited by technical noise due to low counts. Here, we present ASPEN, a statistical method for modeling allelic mean and variance in single-cell transcriptomic data from F1 hybrids. ASPEN combines a sensitive mapping pipeline and adaptive shrinkage to distinguish allelic imbalance and allelic variance in single cells. In both simulated and empirical datasets, ASPEN achieves a 30% increase in sensitivity over existing approaches for single cell allelic imbalance detection. Applied to mouse brain organoids and T cells, ASPEN identifies genes with incomplete X inactivation, stochastic monoallelic expression, and significant deviations in allelic variance. These results reveal reduced variance in essential pathways and increased variance at neurodevelopmental and immune genes.

                <p>by Fen Yan, ZhiHua Du, Yu-An Huang</p>

Developing computational methods for single-cell drug response prediction deepens our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and uncovers resistance mechanisms critical to improving cancer therapy. However, current approaches struggle to fully capture intratumoral heterogeneity, as bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) obscures heterogeneity across individual cells, while single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) remains constrained by limited throughput and high cost. Current approaches integrating bulk and scRNA-seq data frequently encounter batch effects, impairing robust knowledge transfer. Moreover, most existing methods overlook the role of intercellular interactions, treating cells as isolated entities. To overcome these limitations, we propose DAGFormer, a Graph-based Domain Adaptation framework that integrates bulk and scRNA-seq data for predicting single-cell drug responses. DAGFormer constructs cellular neighbor graphs using diverse topological strategies and employs Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) to bridge graph-level distribution gaps between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. A dual-domain decoder further disentangles shared and modality-specific representations, preserving both general and unique biological signals. Benchmarking DAGFormer on ten independent scRNA-seq datasets demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in cancer drug response prediction.

Organisations are challenged when meeting the computational requirements of large-scale bioinformatics analyses using their own resources. Cloud computing has democratised large-scale resources, and to reduce the barriers of working with large-scale compute, leading cloud vendors offer serverless computing, a low-maintenance and low-cost model that provides ample resources for highly scalable software applications. While serverless computing has broad use, its adoption in bioinformatics remains poor. Here, we demonstrate the most extensive use of high-performance serverless computing for bioinformatics by applying the available technologies to CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) design. Our adaptation of the established gRNA design tool, named Crackling, implements a novel, cloud-native and serverless-based, high-performance computing environment using technologies made available by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture, compatible with technologies from all leading cloud vendors, and the AWS implementation, contributes to an effort of reducing the barrier to large computational capacity in bioinformatics and for CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA design. Crackling Cloud can be deployed to any AWS account, and is freely available on GitHub under the BSD 3-clause license: https://github.com/bmds-lab/Crackling-AWS

Accurate simulation of the brain’s intrinsic dynamic activity is essential for understanding human cognition and behavior and developing personalized brain disease therapies. Traditional neurodynamics models depend on structural connectivity to explain the emergence of functional connectivity (FC). However, achieving high-fidelity simulations at the individual level remains challenging, as the models fail to fully capture the brain information. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stable Individualized Brain Computing Model (SI-BCM), a data-driven reverse engineering framework designed to infer spatiotemporal co-activity patterns from fMRI data for simulating whole-brain activity. This model captures the dynamic interactions between brain regions by integrating spatiotemporal dimensional information to extract a stable and shared connectivity pattern, representing the intrinsic functional collaboration pattern of the brain. This connectivity pattern is then used as the core connection weight in the dynamical system. Additionally, the model has a new cost function based on the Phase-Space Association matrix (PSA), enhancing its ability to capture brain activity dynamics. This combination enables the SI-BCM to improve simulation accuracy at the individual level compared to existing models, achieving a correlation coefficient between simulated and empirical FC of 0.87. The SI-BCM also showed enhanced robustness and reliability, and effectively captured brain properties. We found the model sensitively reflected changes in cognitive function, thereby providing valuable insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the application of SI-BCM in the brain modeling of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients substantiated the hypothesis that AD pathogenesis may be due to excessive neuronal excitation. This work establishes a new paradigm for brain network modeling by prioritizing the inference of stable dynamics features from activity data, providing a powerful tool for understanding brain function and pathophysiology.

The advent of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding marks a transformative era in large-scale biodiversity monitoring. However, the analysis of eDNA datasets is limited by incomplete reference databases and the increasing volume of data requiring processing from raw sequences to annotated taxonomic lists. To detect unexpected taxa in eDNA analysis, geographic priors are incorporated through expert post-analysis, which may introduce potential biases in assignments. Instead of relying on expert intervention, a combination of taxonomic and geographic co-occurrences could be directly integrated into machine learning to automatize and improve taxonomic annotation. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to the taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences, which leverages a species reference database, species co-occurrence data, and a phylogeny to enhance annotation directly from raw sequences. The phylogeny provides the structure to the network’s embedding space in which DNA sequences are placed utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN). We train an additional ANN from the phylogenetic embedding and co-occurrence species data to learn coherent species combinations from the whole collection of eDNA sequences, as opposed to single sequences only. When applied directly to the raw sequences, this method correctly predicts unseen species (i.e., those not contained in the reference database), out of more than 31,000 possibilities, in about 24% of the tested cases by relying on phylogenetic embeddings and geographic modulation. The trained ANNs discern species relationships accurately from the raw data, which facilitates the process of associating sequences with taxa—even those absent from reference databases. When we use real eDNA samples, our predictions mostly agree with those from a traditional bioinformatic pipeline, highlighting the potential of our method for the annotation of the increasing number of eDNA sequences.

Aging disrupts intestinal stem cell (ISC) lineage fidelity, impairing epithelial barrier function and then promoting systemic health decline. In this study, we identify peroxisomal dysfunction as a critical driver of age-associated ISC mis-differentiation. Using <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse colonic organoids, we demonstrate that reduced PEX5 expression in aged ISCs impairs peroxisomal matrix protein import, leading to very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulation. In addition, we found that RAB7-dependent late endosome maturation and SOX21A were downstream of the peroxisome in controlling aged ISC differentiation. Aspirin, a classic anti-inflammatory drug, restores ISC lineage fidelity by enhancing PEX5-mediated peroxisomal β-oxidation of VLCFAs. Taken together, these findings highlight peroxisomal dysfunction and VLCFA metabolism as pivotal regulators of ISC aging and suggest new therapeutic strategies for combating age-related intestinal decline.

                Background Biogas production from different types of biodegradable waste is an alternative to fossil fuels for energy consumption and biodegradable waste management. Biogas is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable energy source that provides a reliable method for handling food waste. Methods This study evaluated the effects of rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F as fermentation activators on biogas production from the co-digestion of cattle manure, fruit and vegetable residues, and cafeteria food waste at Debre Markos University in Ethiopia. Under mesophilic conditions, 12 treatments with different rumen fluid (0–150 ml/100 g) and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F inoculum (5–10 ml/100 g) dosages were assessed. Biogas was produced from mixed waste using plastic digesters (0.6 L) at mesophilic temperature (30°C) after the 60-day retention period. Standard techniques were used to measure the physicochemical characteristics of the mixed waste, such as pH, total solids, volatile solids, organic carbon, and moisture. This study was conducted experimentally using factorial patterns and a completely randomized 6 × 2 design. The water displacement method was used to estimate the average amount of biogas generated by a 0.6 L digester. Result Rumen fluid with S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F increased biogas generation by more than four times compared to the uninoculated control. The combination of 100 ml rumen fluid and 10 ml S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F per 100 g of mixed waste produced the highest volume of biogas (6900.3 ml). pH monitoring revealed normal acidogenesis followed by a gradual return to methanogenic conditions, while combustibility tests showed the presence of methane in the biogas. Conclusion These results suggest that using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F as inoculants in a biogas digester can enhance methane production and biodegradation efficiency.
