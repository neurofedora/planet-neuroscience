	<p>Spinal cord epidural electrical stimulation (EES) has been successfully employed to treat chronic pain and to restore lost functions after spinal cord injury. Yet, the efficacy of this approach is largely challenged by the suboptimal spatial distribution of the electrode contacts across anatomical targets, limiting the spatial selectivity of stimulation. In this study, we exploited different ESS paradigms, designed as either Spatial-Selective Stimulation (SSES) or Orientation-Selective Epidural Stimulation (OSES), and compared them to Conventional Monopolar Epidural Stimulation (CMES). SSES, OSES, and CMES were delivered with a 3- or 4-contact electrode array. Amplitudes and latencies of the Spinally Evoked Motor Potentials (SEMPs) were evaluated with different EES modalities. The results demonstrate that the amplitudes of SEMPs in hindlimb muscles depend on the orientation of the electrical field and vary between stimulation modalities. These findings show that the electric field applied with SSES or OSES provides more selective control of amplitudes of the SEMPs as compared to CMES. We demonstrate that spinal cord epidural stimulation applied with SSES or OSES paradigms in the rodent model could be tailored to the functional spinal cord neuroanatomy and can be tuned to specific target fibers and their orientation, optimizing the effect of neuromodulation.</p>

	<p>Gene expression alterations in postmortem schizophrenia tissue are well-documented and are influenced by genetic, medication, and epigenetic factors. The Wingless/Integrated (WNT) signaling pathway, critical for cell growth and development, is involved in various cellular processes including neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. Despite its importance, WNT signaling remains understudied in schizophrenia, a disorder characterized by metabolic and bioenergetic defects in cortical regions. In this study, we examined the gene expression of 10 key WNT signaling pathway transcripts: IQGAP1, CTNN&amp;amp;beta;1, GSK3&amp;amp;beta;, FOXO1, LRP6, MGEA5, TCF4, &amp;amp;beta;TRC, PPP1C&amp;amp;beta;, and DVL2 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using postmortem tissue from schizophrenia subjects (n = 20, 10 males, 10 females) compared to age, pH, and postmortem interval (PMI)-matched controls (n = 20, 10 males, 10 females). Employing the R-shiny application Kaleidoscope, we conducted in silico &amp;amp;ldquo;lookup&amp;amp;rdquo; studies from published transcriptomic datasets to examine cell- and region-level expression of these WNT genes. In addition, we investigated the impact of antipsychotics on the mRNA expression of the WNT genes of interest in rodent brain transcriptomic datasets. Our findings revealed no significant changes in region-level WNT transcript expression; however, analyses of previously published cell-level datasets indicated alterations in WNT transcript expression and antipsychotic-specific modulation of certain genes. These results suggest that WNT signaling transcripts may be variably expressed at the cellular level and influenced by antipsychotic treatment, providing novel insights into the role of WNT signaling in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>

	<p>The central nervous system (CNS) exhibits remarkable adaptability throughout life, enabled by intricate interactions between neurons and glial cells, in particular, oligodendrocytes (OLs) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). This adaptability is pivotal for learning and memory, with OLs and OPCs playing a crucial role in neural circuit development, synaptic modulation, and myelination dynamics. Myelination by OLs not only supports axonal conduction but also undergoes adaptive modifications in response to neuronal activity, which is vital for cognitive processing and memory functions. This review discusses how these cellular interactions and myelin dynamics are implicated in various neurocircuit diseases and disorders such as epilepsy, gliomas, and psychiatric conditions, focusing on how maladaptive changes contribute to disease pathology and influence clinical outcomes. It also covers the potential for new diagnostics and therapeutic approaches, including pharmacological strategies and emerging biomarkers in oligodendrocyte functions and myelination processes. The evidence supports a fundamental role for myelin plasticity and oligodendrocyte functionality in synchronizing neural activity and high-level cognitive functions, offering promising avenues for targeted interventions in CNS disorders.</p>

	<p>In this study, we investigated the cognitive mechanisms underlying action anticipation in volleyball players, especially concerned with the differences between experts and amateurs. Participants included both expert (male, N = 26) and amateur (male, N = 23) volleyball players, who were asked to predict spiking movements containing high, medium, and low levels of kinematic information while their electrophysiological activities were recorded. The high-information stimuli included the whole spiking action, the medium-information stimuli ended at 120 ms, and the low-information stimuli ended at 160 ms before hand&amp;amp;ndash;ball contact. The results showed that experts significantly outperformed amateurs in both prediction accuracy (68% in experts vs. 55% in amateurs) and reaction time (475.09 ms in experts vs. 725.81 ms in amateurs) under the medium-information condition. Analysis of alpha rhythm activity revealed that experts exhibited the strongest desynchronization under the low-information condition, suggesting increased attentional engagement. In contrast, amateurs showed the weakest desynchronization under the medium-information condition. Furthermore, mu rhythm activity analysis showed greater desynchronization in the duration of 100&amp;amp;ndash;300 ms before hand&amp;amp;ndash;ball contact for experts, correlating with their higher anticipation accuracy. These findings highlight the significant kinematic information-processing abilities of volleyball experts and elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying efficient attentional engagement and mirroring. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights for the development of targeted training programs through which to enhance athletic performance.</p>

	<p>The insular cortex, a critical hub in the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s sensory, cognitive, and emotional networks, remains an intriguing subject of study. In this article, we discuss its intricate functional neuroanatomy, emphasizing its pivotal role in processing olfactory information. Through concise exploration, we delve into the insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s diverse connectivity and its involvement in sensory integration, particularly in olfaction. Stimulation studies in humans reveal compelling insights into the insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s contribution to the perception of smell, hinting at its broader implications for cognitive processing. Additionally, we explore an avenue of research in which studying olfactory processing via insular stimulation could unravel higher-level cognitive processes. This innovative approach could help give a fresh perspective on the interplay between sensory and cognitive domains, offering valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognition and emotion. In conclusion, future research efforts should emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, combining advanced imaging and surgical techniques to explore the intricate functions of the human insula. Moreover, awake craniotomies could offer a unique opportunity for real-time observation, shedding light on its neural circuitry and contributions to higher-order brain functions. Furthermore, olfaction&amp;amp;rsquo;s direct cortical projection enables precise exploration of insular function, promising insights into cognitive and emotional processes. This multifaceted approach will deepen our understanding of the insular cortex and its significance in human cognition and emotion.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The integration of augmented reality (AR) in spine surgery marks a significant advancement, enhancing surgical precision and patient outcomes. AR provides immersive, three-dimensional visualizations of anatomical structures, facilitating meticulous planning and execution of spine surgeries. This technology not only improves spatial understanding and real-time navigation during procedures but also aims to reduce surgical invasiveness and operative times. Despite its potential, challenges such as model accuracy, user interface design, and the learning curve for new technology must be addressed. AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s application extends beyond the operating room, offering valuable tools for medical education and improving patient communication and satisfaction. Material and methods: A literature review was conducted by searching PubMed and Scopus databases using keywords related to augmented reality in spine surgery, covering publications from January 2020 to January 2024. Results: In total, 319 articles were identified through the initial search of the databases. After screening titles and abstracts, 11 articles in total were included in the qualitative synthesis. Conclusion: Augmented reality (AR) is becoming a transformative force in spine surgery, enhancing precision, education, and outcomes despite hurdles like technical limitations and integration challenges. AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s immersive visualizations and educational innovations, coupled with its potential synergy with AI and machine learning, indicate a bright future for surgical care. Despite the existing obstacles, AR&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on improving surgical accuracy and safety marks a significant leap forward in patient treatment and care.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0004-24.2024?rss=1">Sleep Disruption Precedes Forebrain Synaptic Tau Burden and Contributes to Cognitive Decline in a Sex-Dependent Manner in the P301S Tau Transgenic Mouse Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sleep disruption and impaired synaptic processes are common features in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hyperphosphorylated Tau is known to accumulate at neuronal synapses in AD, contributing to synapse dysfunction. However, it remains unclear how sleep disruption and synapse pathology interact to contribute to cognitive decline. Here, we examined sex-specific onset and consequences of sleep loss in AD/tauopathy model PS19 mice. Using a piezoelectric home-cage monitoring system, we showed PS19 mice exhibited early-onset and progressive hyperarousal, a selective dark-phase sleep disruption, apparent at 3 months in females and 6 months in males. Using the Morris water maze test, we report that chronic sleep disruption (CSD) accelerated the onset of decline of hippocampal spatial memory in PS19 males only. Hyperarousal occurs well in advance of robust forebrain synaptic Tau burden that becomes apparent at 6&ndash;9 months. To determine whether a causal link exists between sleep disruption and synaptic Tau hyperphosphorylation, we examined the correlation between sleep behavior and synaptic Tau, or exposed mice to acute or chronic sleep disruption at 6 months. While we confirm that sleep disruption is a driver of Tau hyperphosphorylation in neurons of the locus ceruleus, we were unable to show any causal link between sleep loss and Tau burden in forebrain synapses. Despite the finding that hyperarousal appears earlier in females, female cognition was resilient to the effects of sleep disruption. We conclude sleep disruption interacts with the synaptic Tau burden to accelerate the onset of cognitive decline with greater vulnerability in males.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e0050242024?rss=1">Differential Activation States of Direct Pathway Striatal Output Neurons during L-DOPA-Induced Dyskinesia Development</a></h4>

              
                <p><scp>l</scp>-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is a debilitating motor side effect arising from chronic dopamine (DA) replacement therapy with <scp>l</scp>-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. LID is associated with supersensitivity of striatal dopaminergic signaling and fluctuations in synaptic DA following each <scp>l</scp>-DOPA dose, shrinking the therapeutic window. The heterogeneous composition of the striatum, including subpopulations of medium spiny output neurons (MSNs), interneurons, and supporting cells, complicates the identification of cell(s) underlying LID. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to establish a comprehensive striatal transcriptional profile during LID development. Male hemiparkinsonian mice were treated with vehicle or <scp>l</scp>-DOPA for 1, 5, or 10&nbsp;d, and striatal nuclei were processed for snRNA-seq. Analyses indicated a limited population of DA D1 receptor&ndash;expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) formed three subclusters in response to <scp>l</scp>-DOPA treatment and expressed cellular markers of activation. These activated D1-MSNs display similar transcriptional changes previously associated with LID; however, their prevalence and transcriptional behavior were differentially influenced by <scp>l</scp>-DOPA experience. Differentially expressed genes indicated acute upregulation of plasticity-related transcription factors and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, while repeated <scp>l</scp>-DOPA-induced synaptic remodeling, learning and memory, and transforming growth factor-&beta; (TGF-&beta;) signaling genes. Notably, repeated <scp>l</scp>-DOPA sensitized <I>Inhba</I>, an activin subunit of the TGF-&beta; superfamily, in activated D1-MSNs, and its pharmacological inhibition impaired LID development, suggesting that activin signaling may play an essential role in LID. These data suggest distinct subsets of D1-MSNs become differentially <scp>l</scp>-DOPA-responsive due to aberrant induction of molecular mechanisms necessary for neuronal entrainment, similar to processes underlying hippocampal learning and memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e0240242024?rss=1">Striatal Dopamine Contributions to Skilled Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Coordinated multijoint limb and digit movements&mdash;"manual dexterity"&mdash;underlie both specialized skills (e.g., playing the piano) and more mundane tasks (e.g., tying shoelaces). Impairments in dexterous skill cause significant disability, as occurs with motor cortical injury, Parkinson's disease, and a range of other pathologies. Clinical observations, as well as basic investigations, suggest that corticostriatal circuits play a critical role in learning and performing dexterous skills. Furthermore, dopaminergic signaling in these regions is implicated in synaptic plasticity and motor learning. Nonetheless, the role of striatal dopamine signaling in skilled motor learning remains poorly understood. Here, we use fiber photometry paired with a genetically encoded dopamine sensor to investigate striatal dopamine release in both male and female mice as they learn and perform a skilled reaching task. Dopamine rapidly increases during a skilled reach and peaks near pellet consumption. In the dorsolateral striatum, dopamine dynamics are faster than in the dorsomedial and ventral striatum. Across training, as reaching performance improves, dopamine signaling shifts from pellet consumption to cues that predict pellet availability, particularly in medial and ventral areas of the striatum. Furthermore, performance prediction errors are present across the striatum, with reduced dopamine release after an unsuccessful reach. These findings show that dopamine dynamics during skilled motor behaviors change with learning and are differentially regulated across striatal subregions.</p>

                <p>The striatum plays a central role in directing many complex behaviors ranging from motor control to action choice and reward learning. In our study, we used 55 male CFW mice with rapid decay linkage disequilibrium to systematically mine the striatum-related behavioral functional genes by analyzing their striatal transcriptomes and 79 measured behavioral phenotypic data. By constructing a gene coexpression network, we clustered the genes into 13 modules, with most of them being positively correlated with motor traits. Based on functional annotations as well as Fisher's exact and hypergeometric distribution tests, brown and magenta modules were identified as core modules. They were significantly enriched for striatal-related functional genes. Subsequent Mendelian randomization analysis verified the causal relationship between the core modules and dyskinesia. Through the intramodular gene connectivity analysis, <I>Adcy5</I> and <I>Kcnma1</I> were identified as brown and magenta module hub genes, respectively. Knock outs of both <I>Adcy5</I> and <I>Kcnma1</I> lead to motor dysfunction in mice, and <I>KCNMA1</I> acts as a risk gene for schizophrenia and smoking addiction in humans. We also evaluated the cellular composition of each module and identified oligodendrocytes in the striatum to have a positive role in motor regulation.</p>

                <p>Myelinated axons conduct action potentials, or spikes, in a saltatory manner. Inward current caused by a spike occurring at one node of Ranvier spreads axially to the next node, which regenerates the spike when depolarized enough for voltage-gated sodium channels to activate, and so on. The rate at which this process progresses dictates the velocity at which the spike is conducted and depends on several factors including axial resistivity and axon diameter that directly affect axial current. Here we show through computational simulations in modified double-cable axon models that conduction velocity also depends on extracellular factors whose effects can be explained by their indirect influence on axial current. Specifically, we show that a conventional double-cable model, with its outside layer connected to ground, transmits less axial current than a model whose outside layer is less absorptive. A more resistive barrier exists when an axon is packed tightly between other myelinated fibers, for example. We show that realistically resistive boundary conditions can significantly increase the velocity and energy efficiency of spike propagation, while also protecting against propagation failure. Certain factors like myelin thickness may be less important than typically thought if extracellular conditions are more resistive than normally considered. We also show how realistically resistive boundary conditions affect ephaptic interactions. Overall, these results highlight the unappreciated importance of extracellular conditions for axon function.</p>

                <p>The third trimester is a critical period for the development of functional networks that support the lifelong neurocognitive performance, yet the emergence of neuronal coupling in these networks is poorly understood. Here, we used longitudinal high-density electroencephalographic recordings from preterm infants during the period from 33 to 45&nbsp;weeks of conceptional age (CA) to characterize early spatiotemporal patterns in the development of local cortical function and the intrinsic coupling modes [ICMs; phase&ndash;phase (PPCs), amplitude&ndash;amplitude (AACs), and phase&ndash;amplitude correlations (PACs)]. Absolute local power showed a robust increase with CA across the full frequency spectrum, while local PACs showed sleep state-specific, biphasic development that peaked a few weeks before normal birth. AACs and distant PACs decreased globally at nearly all frequencies. In contrast, the PPCs showed frequency- and region-selective development, with an increase of coupling strength with CA between frontal, central, and occipital regions at low-delta and alpha frequencies together with a wider-spread decrease at other frequencies. Our findings together present the spectrally and spatially differential development of the distinct ICMs during the neonatal period and provide their developmental templates for future basic and clinical research.</p>

                <p>Humans make decisions about food every day. The visual system provides important information that forms a basis for these food decisions. Although previous research has focused on visual object and category representations in the brain, it is still unclear how visually presented food is encoded by the brain. Here, we investigate the time-course of food representations in the brain. We used time-resolved multivariate analyses of electroencephalography (EEG) data, obtained from human participants (both sexes), to determine which food features are represented in the brain and whether focused attention is needed for this. We recorded EEG while participants engaged in two different tasks. In one task, the stimuli were task relevant, whereas in the other task, the stimuli were not task relevant. Our findings indicate that the brain can differentiate between food and nonfood items from ~112&nbsp;ms after the stimulus onset. The neural signal at later latencies contained information about food naturalness, how much the food was transformed, as well as the perceived caloric content. This information was present regardless of the task. Information about whether food is immediately ready to eat, however, was only present when the food was task relevant and presented at a slow presentation rate. Furthermore, the recorded brain activity correlated with the behavioral responses in an odd-item-out task. The fast representation of these food features, along with the finding that this information is used to guide food categorization decision-making, suggests that these features are important dimensions along which the representation of foods is organized.</p>

                <p>Human experience is imbued by the sense of being an embodied agent. The investigation of such basic self-consciousness has been hampered by the difficulty of comprehensively modulating it in the laboratory while reliably capturing ensuing subjective changes. The present preregistered study fills this gap by combining advanced meditative states with principled phenomenological interviews: 46 long-term meditators (19 female, 27 male) were instructed to modulate and attenuate their embodied self-experience during magnetoencephalographic monitoring. Results showed frequency-specific (high-beta band) activity reductions in frontoparietal and posterior medial cortices (PMC). Importantly, PMC reductions were driven by a subgroup describing radical embodied self-disruptions, including suspension of agency and dissolution of a localized first-person perspective. Neural changes were correlated with lifetime meditation and interview-derived experiential changes, but not with classical self-reports. The results demonstrate the potential of integrating in-depth first&ndash;person methods into neuroscientific experiments. Furthermore, they highlight neural oscillations in the PMC as a central process supporting the embodied sense of self.</p>

                <p>MAGUK scaffold proteins play a central role in maintaining and modulating synaptic signaling, providing a framework to retain and position receptors, signaling molecules, and other synaptic components. In particular, the MAGUKs SAP102 and PSD-95 are essential for synaptic function at distinct developmental timepoints and perform both overlapping and unique roles. While their similar structures allow for common binding partners, SAP102 is expressed earlier in synapse development and is required for synaptogenesis, whereas PSD-95 expression peaks later and is associated with synapse maturation. PSD-95 and other key synaptic proteins organize into subsynaptic nanodomains that have a significant impact on synaptic transmission, but the nanoscale organization of SAP102 is unknown. How SAP102 is organized within the synapse, and how it relates spatially to PSD-95 on a nanometer scale, could underlie its unique functions and impact how SAP102 scaffolds synaptic proteins. Here we used DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy to measure SAP102 nano-organization and its spatial relationship to PSD-95 at individual synapses in mixed-sex rat cultured neurons. We found that like PSD-95, SAP102 accumulates in high-density subsynaptic nanoclusters (NCs). However, SAP102 NCs were smaller and denser than PSD-95 NCs across development. Additionally, only a subset of SAP102 NCs co-organized with PSD-95, revealing MAGUK nanodomains within individual synapses containing either one or both proteins. These MAGUK nanodomain types had distinct NC properties and were differentially enriched with the presynaptic release protein Munc13-1. This organization into both shared and distinct subsynaptic nanodomains may underlie the ability of SAP102 and PSD-95 to perform both common and unique synaptic functions.</p>

                <p>The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a small midbrain structure that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct, regulates brain&ndash;body communication, and is often studied for its role in "fight-or-flight" and "freezing" responses to threat. We used ultra-high-field 7&nbsp;T fMRI to resolve the PAG in humans and distinguish it from the cerebral aqueduct, examining its in vivo function during a working memory task (<I>N</I> = 87). Both mild and moderate cognitive demands elicited spatially similar patterns of whole-brain blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response, and moderate cognitive demand elicited widespread BOLD increases above baseline in the brainstem. Notably, these brainstem increases were not significantly greater than those in the mild demand condition, suggesting that a subthreshold brainstem BOLD increase occurred for mild cognitive demand as well. Subject-specific masks were group aligned to examine PAG response. In PAG, both mild and moderate demands elicited a well-defined response in ventrolateral PAG, a region thought to be functionally related to anticipated painful threat in humans and nonhuman animals&mdash;yet, the present task posed only the most minimal (if any) "threat," with the cognitive tasks used being approximately as challenging as remembering a phone number. These findings suggest that the PAG may play a more general role in visceromotor regulation, even in the absence of threat.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/26/e1798232024?rss=1">Transient Attention Gates Access Consciousness: Coupling N2pc and P3 Latencies Using Dynamic Time Warping</a></h4>

              
                <p>The N2pc and P3 event-related potentials (ERPs), used to index selective attention and access to working memory and conscious awareness, respectively, have been important tools in cognitive sciences. Although it is likely that these two components and the underlying cognitive processes are temporally and functionally linked, such links have not yet been convincingly demonstrated. Adopting a novel methodological approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW), we provide evidence that the N2pc and P3 ERP components are temporally linked. We analyzed data from an experiment where 23 participants (16 women) monitored bilateral rapid serial streams of letters and digits in order to report a target digit indicated by a shape cue, separately for trials with correct responses and trials where a temporally proximal distractor was reported instead (distractor intrusion). DTW analyses revealed that N2pc and P3 latencies were correlated in time, both when the target or a distractor was reported. Notably, this link was weaker on distractor intrusion trials. This N2pc&ndash;P3 association is discussed with respect to the relationship between attention and access consciousness. Our results demonstrate that our novel method provides a valuable approach for assessing temporal links between two cognitive processes and their underlying modulating factors. This method allows to establish links and their modulator for any two time-series across all domains of the field (general-purpose MATLAB functions and a Python module are provided alongside this paper).</p>

                <p>Aging is accompanied by a decline of working memory, an important cognitive capacity that involves stimulus-selective neural activity that persists after stimulus presentation. Here, we unraveled working memory dynamics in older human adults (male and female) including those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using a combination of behavioral modeling, neuropsychological assessment, and MEG recordings of brain activity. Younger adults (male and female) were studied with behavioral modeling only. Participants performed a visuospatial delayed match-to-sample task under systematic manipulation of the delay and distance between sample and test stimuli. Their behavior (match/nonmatch decisions) was fit with a computational model permitting the dissociation of noise in the internal operations underlying the working memory performance from a strategic decision threshold. Task accuracy decreased with delay duration and sample/test proximity. When sample/test distances were small, older adults committed more false alarms than younger adults. The computational model explained the participants&rsquo; behavior well. The model parameters reflecting internal noise (not decision threshold) correlated with the precision of stimulus-selective cortical activity measured with MEG during the delay interval. The model uncovered an increase specifically in working memory noise in older compared with younger participants. Furthermore, in the MCI group, but not in the older healthy controls, internal noise correlated with the participants&rsquo; clinically assessed cognitive integrity. Our results are consistent with the idea that the stability of working memory contents deteriorates in aging, in a manner that is specifically linked to the overall cognitive integrity of individuals diagnosed with MCI.</p>

                <p>The neurophysiological effects of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for chronic pain are poorly understood, resulting in inefficient failure-prone programming protocols and inadequate pain relief. Nonetheless, novel stimulation patterns are regularly introduced and adopted clinically. Traditionally, paresthetic sensation is considered necessary for pain relief, although novel paradigms provide analgesia without paresthesia. However, like pain relief, the neurophysiological underpinnings of SCS-induced paresthesia are unknown. Here, we paired biophysical modeling with clinical paresthesia thresholds (of both sexes) to investigate how stimulation frequency affects the neural response to SCS relevant to paresthesia and analgesia. Specifically, we modeled the dorsal column (DC) axonal response, dorsal column nucleus (DCN) synaptic transmission, conduction failure within DC fiber collaterals, and dorsal horn network output. Importantly, we found that high-frequency stimulation reduces DC fiber activation thresholds, which in turn accurately predicts clinical paresthesia perception thresholds. Furthermore, we show that high-frequency SCS produces asynchronous DC fiber spiking and ultimately asynchronous DCN output, offering a plausible biophysical basis for why high-frequency SCS is less comfortable and produces qualitatively different sensation than low-frequency stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that the model dorsal horn network output is sensitive to SCS-inherent variations in spike timing, which could contribute to heterogeneous pain relief across patients. Importantly, we show that model DC fiber collaterals cannot reliably follow high-frequency stimulation, strongly affecting the network output and typically producing antinociceptive effects at high frequencies. Altogether, these findings clarify how SCS affects the nervous system and provide insight into the biophysics of paresthesia generation and pain relief.</p>

                Background Muscle injuries are the most frequent in football and may lead to the end of a player’s career. Many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of prevention programs for all injury types. Few studies have evaluated the effects of exercise on muscle injuries. Methods A documentary search was conducted in October 2022 from three databases: Medline via its PubMed interface, Google Scholar, and COCHRANE databases. We only included original articles published between October 2012 and October 2022 with a high level of evidence. The research was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. The target population consisted of professional and semi-professional footballers. The intervention in question was structured injury preventive protocols, including specific training or pre-established protocols such as the FIFA 11+ program, compared to each other or with regular training sessions. The main outcomes were the incidence rates of muscle injuries and severe injury in each group, as well as the time loss to injury. Results Seven randomized controlled trials with a high level of evidence confirmed using the PEDRO scale were included. There were 3815 male professional football players. There was heterogeneity in the age, hours of exposure, and duration of the intervention. The prevention protocols used were FIFA 11+, bounding exercises, NHE, and stretching exercises. Structured exercises significantly reduce the severity of muscle injury and, consequently, time loss to injury. Discussion Despite the diversity of prevention programs, teams still lack standardized programs. Structured exercises, such as FIFA 11+ and bounding exercises, which combine strengthening, body kinesthesic awareness, and neuromuscular control, reduce the incidence and severity of muscle injury. FIFA 11+ is the first and most complete structured program, but lacks some exercises, such as adductor strengthening. Conclusion This review showed the interest in structured exercises in reducing severity and time loss to injury in professional football players. Registration This review was registered on 8/17/2023 in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under the reference code CRD42023452202.

                <p>by Chengwei Ai, Hongpeng Yang, Xiaoyi Liu, Ruihan Dong, Yijie Ding, Fei Guo</p>

De novo drug design is crucial in advancing drug discovery, which aims to generate new drugs with specific pharmacological properties. Recently, deep generative models have achieved inspiring progress in generating drug-like compounds. However, the models prioritize a single target drug generation for pharmacological intervention, neglecting the complicated inherent mechanisms of diseases, and influenced by multiple factors. Consequently, developing novel multi-target drugs that simultaneously target specific targets can enhance anti-tumor efficacy and address issues related to resistance mechanisms. To address this issue and inspired by Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) models, we propose an upgraded GPT model with generative adversarial imitation learning for multi-target molecular generation called MTMol-GPT. The multi-target molecular generator employs a dual discriminator model using the Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) method for a concurrently multi-target molecular generation. Extensive results show that MTMol-GPT generates various valid, novel, and effective multi-target molecules for various complex diseases, demonstrating robustness and generalization capability. In addition, molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping experiments demonstrate the drug-likeness properties and effectiveness of generated molecules potentially improve neuropsychiatric interventions. Furthermore, our model’s generalizability is exemplified by a case study focusing on the multi-targeted drug design for breast cancer. As a broadly applicable solution for multiple targets, MTMol-GPT provides new insight into future directions to enhance potential complex disease therapeutics by generating high-quality multi-target molecules in drug discovery.

                <p>by Heung-Yeol Lim, Inah Lee</p>

The perirhinal cortex (PER) supports multimodal object recognition, but how multimodal information of objects is integrated within the PER remains unknown. Here, we recorded single units within the PER while rats performed a PER-dependent multimodal object-recognition task. In this task, audiovisual cues were presented simultaneously (multimodally) or separately (unimodally). We identified 2 types of object-selective neurons in the PER: crossmodal cells, showing constant firing patterns for an object irrespective of its modality, and unimodal cells, showing a preference for a specific modality. Unimodal cells further dissociated unimodal and multimodal versions of the object by modulating their firing rates according to the modality condition. A population-decoding analysis confirmed that the PER could perform both modality-invariant and modality-specific object decoding—the former for recognizing an object as the same in various conditions and the latter for remembering modality-specific experiences of the same object.

                Background This study aimed to compare the effect on postoperative complications of prehabilitation targeting predefined co-existing risky lifestyle factors with usual preoperative routines in surgical patients. Methods This systematic review followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline and the protocol (CRD42022282611). Five databases were searched from inception to November 7, 2022 for randomised controlled trials on prehabilitation targeting ≥2 predefined risky lifestyles compared with usual preoperative routines. Risky lifestyles included Smoking, Nutrition (malnutrition and/or BMI>25), risky Alcohol intake, and Physical inactivity (SNAP). Primary outcome was postoperative complications ≤30 days. Cochrane’s risk-of-bias tool 2 was used and meta-analyses were conducted. GRADE was used to assess certainty of evidence. Results The search resulted in 20,862 records. At full-text screening, only two (120 participants) of 24 identified trials on combined SNAP intervention had ≥2 predefined risk factors and were included. One (n=110) on intensive physical and brief nutritional intervention to frail patients with colorectal cancer resection reported complication rates of 45% in both groups (relative risk (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.51). The other study (n=10, subgroup) on intensive alcohol and smoking intervention in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy, reported complications in 3/7 vs 3/3 participants (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.19). The meta-analysis estimated a RR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.51, I2 51%). Conclusion Two small of the 24 trials on prehabilitation targeted co-existing and predefined risky SNAP factors and the effect on postoperative complications is very uncertain. Future prehabilitation research involving patient needs is warranted.

                Background Food insecurity is a historical global human challenge, but has yet remained a burning development agenda. The capacity to withstand and recover from food insecurity shocks and stresses refereed as resilience, which is determined by a strand of factors. This paper deals with measuring and; identifying major determinants of household resilience to food insecurity among weaving-based livelihood system in Chencha district. Methods Multi-stage sampling technique was employed to generate data from 303 sample households through household survey, focus group discussion, and key informant interviews. The collected data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, household resilience index, chi-square test, one-way ANOVA and econometric model (probit regression). Results The household survey revealed that 59.04% households were non-resilient, 24.42% were moderately resilient, 10.89% resilient and 4.95% highly resilient. The Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests have shown a meaningful and statistically significant difference among resilience categories. Finally, probit model analysis indicated that access to credit, average years of family education, crop diversity, income diversity, landholding size, TLU, expected crop harvest, expected cash income from fruit trees, frequency of extension contact, FCS, annual food expenditure, ownerships of Radio, Jewelry, furnished bed, membership in local associations, and distance to local market have positively influenced the likelihood of attaining higher household resilience at CI 95% or P<1%, 5% and 10%. Whereas; lack of access to mobile phone, inability to read and write, family business, formal employment, and transfers of payment have decreased likelihood of households to achieve higher resilience level. Conclusions Therefore, improving household access to credit, education, income diversification, livestock and land, agricultural extension services, membership to local associations, mobile service, and income diversification would enhance household income and food security, which could in turn improve household resilience to food insecurity.

                Background Private universities in Peru still need to implement digital transformation models to enhance the job performance of faculty and staff, achieving consistent improvement in the performance levels of university teachers by deploying technological and didactic tools for students. Therefore, the study aims to determine the relationship between digital transformation and the job performance of employees at a Private University. Methods The research approach was quantitative, employing a non-experimental, longitudinal correlational design. The technique used was a survey, applied to a sample of 104 employees (school heads, faculty, and a director) from the university on a national level from a total population of 144. Results Descriptive results reveal that the university has regularly adopted tools related to digital transformation. In particular, it has efficiently employed agile technologies, Big Data, and various technological means, benefiting 90% (52% and 38%) of the staff. The study also showed a high positive correlation (0.92>0.7) between digital transformation and the job performance of staff at the Private University, confirming that there is a significant connection between the variables studied. Conclusions Therefore, creating an innovative culture across all hierarchical levels and identifying key technologies that add value to the learning flow can meet the needs of an increasingly demanding society.

                Background Non-contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) plays a pivotal role in assessing central nervous system disorders and is a crucial diagnostic method. Iterative reconstruction (IR) methods have enhanced image quality (IQ) but may result in a blotchy appearance and decreased resolution for subtle contrasts. The deep-learning image reconstruction (DLIR) algorithm, which integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) into the reconstruction process, generates high-quality images with minimal noise. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the IQ of the Precise Image (DLIR) and the IR technique (iDose4) for the NCCT brain. Methods This is a prospective study. Thirty patients who underwent NCCT brain were included. The images were reconstructed using DLIR-standard and iDose4. Qualitative IQ analysis parameters, such as overall image quality (OQ), subjective image noise (SIN), and artifacts, were measured. Quantitative IQ analysis parameters such as Computed Tomography (CT) attenuation (HU), image noise (IN), posterior fossa index (PFI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum-semiovale (CSO) were measured. Paired t-tests were performed for qualitative and quantitative IQ analyses between the iDose4 and DLIR-standard. Kappa statistics were used to assess inter-observer agreement for qualitative analysis. Results Quantitative IQ analysis showed significant differences (p<0.05) in IN, SNR, and CNR between the iDose4 and DLIR-standard at the BG and CSO levels. IN was reduced (41.8-47.6%), SNR (65-82%), and CNR (68-78.8%) were increased with DLIR-standard. PFI was reduced (27.08%) the DLIR-standard. Qualitative IQ analysis showed significant differences (p<0.05) in OQ, SIN, and artifacts between the DLIR standard and iDose4. The DLIR standard showed higher qualitative IQ scores than the iDose4. Conclusion DLIR standard yielded superior quantitative and qualitative IQ compared to the IR technique (iDose4). The DLIR-standard significantly reduced the IN and artifacts compared to iDose4 in the NCCT brain.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-1196/v2?src=rss">Dissecting Loneliness in the Digital Age: An Insight into the Experiences of Medical Students Amid and Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This narrative review explores loneliness among medical students, particularly heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review aims to narratively describe how the digital age, both pre- and post-pandemic, influences loneliness and to assess the psychological effects of the pandemic on medical students. Our literature search, adhering to SANRA guidelines, scrutinized studies published in the last ten years focusing on loneliness among medical students. Our findings reveal that medical students experienced significant loneliness during the pandemic, attributed to virtual learning environments and decreased social interactions. Notably, the transition to online education has mitigated and exacerbated feelings of isolation. The review also highlights the dual role of social media in either alleviating or intensifying loneliness, depending on usage patterns and platform types. Overall, our study underscores the need for targeted interventions and support systems to address the mental well-being of medical students in the digital age and beyond, providing crucial insights for future research and policy-making in educational and psychological support frameworks.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess comparative effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of off-label rituximab, compared with frequently used therapies approved for multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A Swedish cohort study of persons with relapsing–remitting MS, age 18 to 75 years at inclusion and with a first therapy start or a first therapy switch between 2011 and 2018. Low-dose rituximab was compared with MS-approved therapies. Primary outcomes were proportions with 12 months confirmed disability worsening and change in MS Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) scores, respectively. Secondary endpoints included relapses, therapy discontinuation, and serious adverse events. Analyses used an intention-to-treat approach and were adjusted for demographics, MS features, and health characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 2,449 participants as first therapy start and 2,463 as first therapy switch. Proportions with disability worsening at 3 years were 9.1% for rituximab as first therapy and 5.1% after therapy switch, with no differences to MS-approved comparators. Worsening on rituximab was mostly independent of relapses. MSIS-29 with rituximab at 3 years improved by 1.3/8.4 points (physical/psychological) for first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and 0.4/3.6 for DMT switch, and was mostly similar across therapies. Rituximab had lower relapse rates and higher therapy persistence in both groups. The rate of hospital-treated infections was higher with rituximab after a therapy switch, but not as a first therapy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This population-based real-world cohort study found low rates of disability progression, mostly independent of relapses, and without significant differences between rituximab and MS-approved comparators. Rituximab led to lower rates of inflammatory activity and higher treatment persistence, but was associated with an increased rate of serious infections. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95621">The neuron-specific IIS/FOXO transcriptome in aged animals reveals regulatory mechanisms of cognitive aging</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive decline is a significant health concern in our aging society. Here, we used the model organism <i>C. elegans</i> to investigate the impact of the IIS/FOXO pathway on age-related cognitive decline. The <i>daf-2</i> Insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutant exhibits a significant extension of learning and memory span with age compared to wild-type worms, an effect that is dependent on the DAF-16 transcription factor. To identify possible mechanisms by which aging <i>daf-2</i> mutants maintain learning and memory with age while wild-type worms lose neuronal function, we carried out neuron-specific transcriptomic analysis in aged animals. We observed downregulation of neuronal genes and upregulation of transcriptional regulation genes in aging wild-type neurons. By contrast, IIS/FOXO pathway mutants exhibit distinct neuronal transcriptomic alterations in response to cognitive aging, including upregulation of stress response genes and downregulation of specific insulin signaling genes. We tested the roles of significantly transcriptionally-changed genes in regulating cognitive functions, identifying novel regulators of learning and memory. In addition to other mechanistic insights, a comparison of the aged vs young <i>daf-2</i> neuronal transcriptome revealed that a new set of potentially neuroprotective genes is upregulated; instead of simply mimicking a young state, <i>daf-2</i> may enhance neuronal resilience to accumulation of harm and take a more active approach to combat aging. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for regulating cognitive function with age and offer insights into novel therapeutic targets for age-related cognitive decline.

                Accurate prediction of the structurally diverse complementarity determining region heavy chain 3 (CDR-H3) loop structure remains a primary and long-standing challenge for antibody modeling. Here, we present the H3-OPT toolkit for predicting the 3D structures of monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies. H3-OPT combines the strengths of AlphaFold2 with a pre-trained protein language model and provides a 2.24 Å average RMSD<sub>Cα</sub> between predicted and experimentally determined CDR-H3 loops, thus outperforming other current computational methods in our non-redundant high-quality dataset. The model was validated by experimentally solving three structures of anti-VEGF nanobodies predicted by H3-OPT. We examined the potential applications of H3-OPT through analyzing antibody surface properties and antibody–antigen interactions. This structural prediction tool can be used to optimize antibody–antigen binding and engineer therapeutic antibodies with biophysical properties for specialized drug administration route.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89319">Elevated glycolytic metabolism of monocytes limits the generation of HIF1A-driven migratory dendritic cells in tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                During tuberculosis (TB), migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the site of infection to the draining lymph nodes is known to be impaired, hindering the rapid development of protective T-cell-mediated immunity. However, the mechanisms involved in the delayed migration of DCs during TB are still poorly defined. Here, we found that infection of DCs with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) triggers HIF1A-mediated aerobic glycolysis in a TLR2-dependent manner, and that this metabolic profile is essential for DC migration. In particular, the lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor oxamate and the HIF1A inhibitor PX-478 abrogated Mtb-induced DC migration in vitro to the lymphoid tissue-specific chemokine CCL21, and in vivo to lymph nodes in mice. Strikingly, we found that although monocytes from TB patients are inherently biased toward glycolysis metabolism, they differentiate into poorly glycolytic and poorly migratory DCs compared with healthy subjects. Taken together, these data suggest that because of their preexisting glycolytic state, circulating monocytes from TB patients are refractory to differentiation into migratory DCs, which may explain the delayed migration of these cells during the disease and opens avenues for host-directed therapies for TB.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95879">RNA polymerase III is involved in regulating Plasmodium falciparum virulence</a></h4>

              
                While often undetected and untreated, persistent seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections remain a global public health problem. Despite the presence of parasites in the peripheral blood, no symptoms develop. Disease severity is correlated with the levels of infected red blood cells (iRBCs) adhering within blood vessels. Changes in iRBC adhesion capacity have been linked to seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections, however how this is occurring is still unknown. Here, we present evidence that RNA polymerase III (RNA Pol III) transcription in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> is downregulated in field isolates obtained from asymptomatic individuals during the dry season. Through experiments with in vitro cultured parasites, we have uncovered an RNA Pol III-dependent mechanism that controls pathogen proliferation and expression of a major virulence factor in response to external stimuli. Our findings establish a connection between <i>P. falciparum</i> cytoadhesion and a non-coding RNA family transcribed by Pol III. Additionally, we have identified <i>P. falciparum</i> Maf1 as a pivotal regulator of Pol III transcription, both for maintaining cellular homeostasis and for responding adaptively to external signals. These results introduce a novel perspective that contributes to our understanding of <i>P. falciparum</i> virulence. Furthermore, they establish a connection between this regulatory process and the occurrence of seasonal asymptomatic malaria infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94605">FAK loss reduces BRAFV600E-induced ERK phosphorylation to promote intestinal stemness and cecal tumor formation</a></h4>

              
                <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup> mutation is a driver mutation in the serrated pathway to colorectal cancers. BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> drives tumorigenesis through constitutive downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, but high-intensity ERK activation can also trigger tumor suppression. Whether and how oncogenic ERK signaling can be intrinsically adjusted to a ‘just-right’ level optimal for tumorigenesis remains undetermined. In this study, we found that FAK (Focal adhesion kinase) expression was reduced in <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup>-mutant adenomas/polyps in mice and patients. In <i>Vil1-Cre;BRAF</i><sup>LSL-V600E/+</sup>;<i>Ptk2</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, <i>Fak</i> deletion maximized BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>’s oncogenic activity and increased cecal tumor incidence to 100%. Mechanistically, our results showed that Fak loss, without jeopardizing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced ERK pathway transcriptional output, reduced EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)-dependent ERK phosphorylation. Reduction in ERK phosphorylation increased the level of Lgr4, promoting intestinal stemness and cecal tumor formation. Our findings show that a ‘just-right’ ERK signaling optimal for <i>BRAF</i><sup>V600E</sup>-induced cecal tumor formation can be achieved via Fak loss-mediated downregulation of ERK phosphorylation.

">Left-Right Brain-Wide Asymmetry of Neuroanatomy in the Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                Left-right asymmetry of the human brain is widespread through its anatomy and function. However, limited microscopic understanding of it exists, particularly for anatomical asymmetry where there are few well-established animal models. In humans, most of the brain shows subtle, population-average, regional asymmetries in cortical thickness or surface area. In addition, a macro-scale twisting called the cerebral petalia exists in which the right hemisphere protrudes anteriorly relative to the left. Here, we ask whether neuroanatomical asymmetries can be observed in mice, leveraging 6 different neuroimaging cohorts of animals from 5 different research groups (~3,500 animals in total). We found an anterior-posterior pattern of volume asymmetry in mice, where anterior regions are larger on the right while posterior regions are larger on the left. This pattern appears driven by a similar trend in surface area asymmetry and is supported by a concordant pattern of positional asymmetries. The cerebral hemisphere as a whole appears shifted anteriorly on the right while the brainstem and cerebellum appear shifted anteriorly on the left. These results together indicate a small torsion of the brain is present in mice, similar to the cerebral petalia in humans. By establishing a signature of anatomical brain asymmetry in mice, we aim to provide a foundation for future studies to probe the mechanistic underpinnings of anatomical brain asymmetry seen in humans - a feature of the brain with extremely limited understanding.

                Recent studies have identified multiple genetic variants of SEL1L-HRD1 ER-associated degradation (ERAD) in humans with neurodevelopmental disorders and locomotor dysfunctions, including ataxia. However, the relevance and importance of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in the pathogenesis of ataxia remain unexplored. Here we show that SEL1L deficiency in Purkinje cells leads to early-onset progressive cerebellar ataxia with progressive loss of Purkinje cells with age. Mice with Purkinje cell-specific deletion of SEL1L (Sel1LPcp2Cre) exhibit motor dysfunction beginning around 9 weeks of age. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals dilated ER and fragmented nuclei in Purkinje cells of adult Sel1LPcp2Cre mice, indicative of altered ER homeostasis and cell death. Lastly, loss of Purkinje cells is associated with a secondary neurodegeneration of granular cells, as well as robust activation of astrocytes and proliferation of microglia, in the cerebellum of Sel1LPcp2Cre mice. These data demonstrate the pathophysiological importance of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in Purkinje cells in the pathogenesis of cerebellar ataxia.

">Midline Assembloids Reveal Regulators of Human Axon Guidance</a></h4>

              
                Organizers are specialized cell populations that orchestrate cell patterning and axon guidance in the developing nervous system. Although non-human models have led to fundamental discoveries about the organization of the nervous system midline by the floor plate, an experimental model of human floor plate would enable broader insights into regulation of human neurodevelopment and midline connectivity. Here, we have developed stem cell-derived organoids resembling human floor plate (hFpO) and assembled them with spinal cord organoids (hSpO) to generate midline assembloids (hMA). We demonstrate that hFpO promote Sonic hedgehog-dependent ventral patterning of human spinal progenitors and Netrin-dependent guidance of human commissural axons, paralleling non-human models. To investigate evolutionary-divergent midline regulators, we profiled the hFpO secretome and identified 27 evolutionarily divergent genes between human and mouse. Utilizing the hMA platform, we targeted these candidates in an arrayed CRISPR knockout screen and reveal that GALNT2, a gene involved in O-linked glycosylation, impairs floor plate-mediated guidance of commissural axons in humans. This novel platform extends prior axon guidance discoveries into human-specific neurobiology with implications for mechanisms of nervous system evolution and neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Evolution of iGluR ligand specificity, polyamine regulation, and ion selectivity inferred from a placozoan Epsilon receptor</a></h4>

              
                Epsilon ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) belong to a recently described sub-family of metazoan receptors that is distinct from the AMPA, Kainate, Delta, and Phi (i.e., AKDF) sub-family, the NMDA sub-family, and the Lambda subfamily. Here, we sought to better understand the evolutionary and functional properties of Epsilon receptors by focusing on homologues from the basal invertebrate Trichoplax adhaerens (phylum Placozoa). We provide an updated species-guided phylogeny of eukaryotic iGluRs, and a comprehensive phylogeny of placozoan receptors uncovering marked diversification of Epsilon receptors within three conserved subclades, and four invariable subclades of AKDF receptors. Detailed functional characterization of the T. adhaerens Epsilon receptor GluE1alphaA revealed robust activation by glycine, alanine, serine, and valine, but not glutamate. Through combined of structural modeling and mutation experiments, we used GluE1alphaA to test the hypothesis that only a small set of amino acids in the ligand binding domain determine ligand selectivity. Mutation of just three amino acids converted GluE1alphaA selectivity to glutamate, resulted in nascent sensitivity to AMPA, and increased sensitivity to the AMPA/Kainate receptor blocker CNQX. Lastly, combined modeling and mutation experiments revealed that an atypical serine residue in the pore NQR site of GluE1alphaA, along with an aspartate four amino acids downstream, confers sensitivity to voltage-dependent polyamine block, while the serine alone diminishes both polyamine block and Ca2+ permeation compared to asparagine and glutamine residues of AMPA and Kainate receptors. Altogether, we demonstrate conserved molecular determinants for polyamine regulation between Epsilon and AKDF receptors, and evidence that natural variations in NQR residues have important implications for ion permeation and regulation by polyamines.

">Anhedonic behaviour in a TLR7-driven neuroinflammation mouse model is associated with impaired thalamostriatal signalling and immune cell ingress into the brain</a></h4>

              
                Depression is a heterogenous condition driven by multiple aetiologies, which make its pathophysiology challenging to map. Stratifying depression by underlying biological causes may allow for more effective, targeted treatments. Immune-mediated inflammation is present in around 20% of individuals with depression and provides a potential mechanistic pathway for some key symptoms such as reward / hedonic impairment. Here we used a non-invasive model of neuroinflammation, topical application of Aldara (a TLR7/8 agonist) for 3 days in mice, to explore relationships between the intracerebral immune response, neural circuitry and behaviours closely linked to depression: motivation, reward and anxiety. Mice that were treated with Aldara exhibited anhedonia-like behaviour and impairments in intrinsic motivational behaviours (measured through assays such as sucrose preference and nest-building tests) relative to untreated controls, but displayed little anxiety-like behaviour. Aldara-driven neuroinflammation was associated with evidence of immune cell (including lymphoid and myeloid cells) ingression into the brain, and both microglia and astrocytes showed evidence of activation. Within 4 to 6 hours of Aldara treatment, neurons in midline thalamus showed strongly increased Fos immunoreactivity relative to controls. Optogenetic activation of midline thalamic projections onto ventral striatum medium spiny neurons (MSNs) revealed that Aldara treatment substantially reduced the magnitude of the evoked thalamic AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC, but with no change to the AMPA/NMDA ratio nor change in the frequency of amplitude of spontaneous EPSP. Finally, whole brain transcriptome overrepresentation analysis revealed that Aldara treatment led to significant upregulation of genes associated with immune response and downregulation of genes associated with glutamate metabolism and synaptic transmission. Altogether, our data suggest potential, testable mechanisms through which neuroinflammation can drive anhedonic-like behaviour through activation of resident neural cells, infiltrating activated immune cells and functional changes in thalamostriatal circuitry consistent with increased extrasynaptic glutamate.

                Transfer learning, the re-application of previously learned higher-level regularities to novel input, is a key challenge in cognition. While previous empirical studies investigated human transfer learning in supervised or reinforcement learning for explicit knowledge, it is unknown whether such transfer occurs during naturally more common implicit and unsupervised learning and if so, how it is related to memory consolidation. We compared the transfer of newly acquired explicit and implicit abstract knowledge during unsupervised learning by extending a visual statistical learning paradigm to a transfer learning context. We found transfer during unsupervised learning but with important differences depending on the explicitness/implicitness of the acquired knowledge. Observers acquiring explicit knowledge during initial learning could transfer the learned structures immediately. In contrast, observers with the same amount but implicit knowledge showed the opposite effect, a structural interference during transfer. However, with sleep between the learning phases, implicit observers switched their behaviour and showed the same pattern of transfer as explicit observers did while still remaining implicit. This effect was specific to sleep and not found after non-sleep consolidation. Our results highlight similarities and differences between explicit and implicit learning while acquiring generalizable higher-level knowledge and relying on consolidation for restructuring internal representations.

">Multi-talker speech comprehension at different temporal scales in listeners with normal and impaired hearing</a></h4>

              
                Comprehending speech requires deciphering a range of linguistic representations, from phonemes to narratives. Prior research suggests that in single-talker scenarios, the neural encoding of linguistic units follows a hierarchy of increasing temporal receptive windows. Shorter temporal units like phonemes and syllables are encoded by lower-level sensory brain regions, whereas longer units such as sentences and paragraphs are processed by higher-level perceptual and cognitive areas. However, the brain's representation of these linguistic units under challenging listening conditions, such as a cocktail party situation, remains unclear. In this study, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) responses from both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired participants as they listened to individual and dual speakers narrating different parts of a story. The inclusion of hearing-impaired listeners allowed us to examine how hierarchically organized linguistic units in competing speech streams affect comprehension abilities. We leveraged a hierarchical language model to extract linguistic information at multiple levels--phoneme, syllable, word, phrase, and sentence--and aligned these model activations with the EEG data. Our findings showed distinct neural responses to dual-speaker speech between the two groups. Specifically, compared to normal-hearing listeners, hearing-impaired listeners exhibited poorer model fits at the acoustic, phoneme, and syllable levels as well as the sentence levels, but not at the word and phrase levels. These results suggest that hearing-impaired listeners experience disruptions at both shorter and longer temporal scales, while their processing at medium temporal scales remains unaffected.

">Dopamine increases protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons enabling dopamine-dependent LTP</a></h4>

              
                The reward and novelty related neuromodulator dopamine plays an important role in hippocampal long-term memory, which is thought to involve protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, the direct effects of dopamine on protein synthesis, and the functional implications of newly synthesized proteins for synaptic plasticity, have not yet been investigated. We have previously reported that timing-dependent synaptic depression (t-LTD) can be converted into potentiation by dopamine application during synaptic stimulation (Brzsoko et al., 2015) or postsynaptic burst activation (Fuchsberger et al., 2022). Here we show that dopamine increases protein synthesis in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons, enabling dopamine-dependent long-term potentiation (DA-LTP). We found that neuronal activity is required for the dopamine-induced increase in protein synthesis, which is mediated via the Ca2+-sensitive adenylate cyclase (AC) subtypes 1/8, cAMP, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Furthermore, dopamine induced a protein synthesis-dependent increase in the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, but not GluA2. We found that DA-LTP is absent in GluA1 knock-out mice and that it requires calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. Taken together, our results suggest that dopamine together with neuronal activity controls synthesis of plasticity-related proteins, including GluA1, which enable DA-LTP via a signalling pathway distinct from that of conventional LTP.

">Retinal microglial cells increase expression and release of IL-1β when exposed to ATP</a></h4>

              
                Cytokine IL-1{beta} is an early component of inflammatory cascades, with both priming and activation steps required before IL-1{beta} release. Here, the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) for ATP was shown to both prime and release IL-1{beta} from retinal microglial cells. Isolated retinal microglial cells increased expression of Il1b when stimulated with endogenous receptor agonist extracellular ATP; ATP also rapidly downregulated expression of microglial markers Tmem119 and Cd206. Changes to all three genes were reduced by specific P2X7R antagonist A839977, implicating the P2X7R. Microglial cells expressed the P2X7R on ramifications and responded to receptor agonist BzATP with robust and rapid rises in intracellular Ca2+. BzATP increased expression of IL-1{beta} protein colocalizing with CX3CR1-GFP in retinal wholemounts consistent with microglial cells. ATP also triggered release of IL-1{beta} from isolated retinal microglia into the bath; release was inhibited by A839977 and induced by BzATP, supporting a role for the P2X7R in release as well as priming. The IL-1{beta} release triggered by ATP was substantially greater from microglial cells compared to astrocytes from the optic nerve head region. Il1b expression was increased by a transient rise in intraocular pressure and Il1b levels remained elevated 10 days after a single IOP elevation. In summary, this study suggests the P2X7 receptor can both prime IL-1{beta} levels in microglial cells and trigger its release. The P2Y12R was previously identified as a chemoattractant for retinal microglia, suggesting the recruitment of the cells towards the source of released extracellular ATP could position microglia for P2X7R receptor, enabling both priming and release of IL-1{beta}.

">Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of striatal microglia reveals distinct transcriptomic signatures of acute stress and chronic exercise</a></h4>

              
                Severe acute stress can produce long lasting decreases in voluntary physical activity that contribute to degraded mental and physical health. Stress also produces enduring molecular changes in the striatum, a brain region that regulates voluntary wheel-running and other motivated behaviors. Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, have specialized functions in responding to stress, sensing changes in the striatum, and controlling neuronal activity. Thus, microglia are positioned at the interface between neural responses to stress and neural coordination of voluntary activity; however, the role of striatal microglia in stress-induced long-term suppression of voluntary activity remains unexplored. The present study employs single nucleus RNA-sequencing to investigate how stress and exercise impact the biology of microglia in the striatum. We find that stress-induced decreases in running behavior are associated with specific microglial activation profiles. Furthermore, we show that access to a running wheel is associated with an additional and distinct profile of microglia activation characterized by upregulation of complement components and phagocytosis pathways. Lastly, we find that distinct microglial gene sets are associated with general running (versus not running) and more subtle variation in genes with individual running levels. Taken together, our results contribute to a broader understanding of the diverse states that striatal microglia can assume in response to stress and exercise, and broadly suggest that microglia exhibit more nuanced functional responses to environmental perturbations than previously thought.

                Ageing of the human brain was studied using large array of experimental data. The magnetic encephalograms and magnetic resonance images of the head were obtained from the open archive CamCAN. Bad data were rejected, then functional tomograms were found - the spatial distribution of elementary spectral components. Physiological noise was eliminated by joint analysis of the functional tomograms and magnetic resonance images. By massively solving the inverse problem, multichannel spectra were transformed into time series of the power of elementary current dipoles. Age-related changes in the electrical power of various brain rhythms were examined. It was found that the summary electrical activity of the brain is constant throughout a person's life. The electric power is redistributed during the lifetime: delta rhythm is diminishing, giving slow rise to all other rhythms.

">CD11c-expressing microglia are transient, driven by interactions with apoptotic cells</a></h4>

              
                Microglia, the parenchymal macrophage of the central nervous system serve crucial remodeling functions throughout development. Microglia are transcriptionally heterogenous, suggesting that distinct microglial states confer discrete roles. Currently, little is known about how dynamic these states are, the cues that promote them, or how they impact microglial function. In the developing retina, we previously found a significant proportion of microglia express CD11c (Integrin X, complement receptor 4, Itgax) which has also been reported in other developmental and disease contexts. Here, we sought to understand the regulation and function of CD11c+ microglia. We found that CD11c+ microglia track with prominent waves of neuronal apoptosis in postnatal retina. Using genetic fate mapping, we provide evidence that microglia transition out of the CD11c state to return to homeostasis. We show that CD11c+ microglia have elevated lysosomal content and contribute to the clearance of apoptotic neurons, and found that acquisition of CD11c expression is, in part, dependent upon the TAM receptor Axl. Using selective ablation, we found CD11c+ microglia are not uniquely critical for phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells. Together, our data suggest CD11c+ microglia are a transient state induced by developmental apoptosis rather than a specialized subset mediating phagocytic elimination.

">Visual search efficiency is modulated by symmetry type and texture regularity</a></h4>

              
                More than a century of vision research has identified symmetry as a fundamental cue, which aids the visual system in making inferences about objects and surfaces in natural scenes. Most studies have focused on one type of symmetry, reflection, presented at a single image location. However, the visual system responds strongly to other types of symmetries, and to symmetries that are repeated across the image plane to form textures. Here we use a visual search paradigm with arrays of repeating lattices that contained either reflection or rotation symmetries but were otherwise matched. Participants were asked to report the presence of a target tile without symmetry. When lattices tile the plane without gaps, they form regular textures. We manipulated texture regularity by introducing jittered gaps between lattices. This paradigm lets us investigate the effect of symmetry type and texture regularity on visual search efficiency. Based on previous findings suggesting an advantage for reflection in visual processing, we hypothesized that search would be more efficient for reflection than rotation. We further hypothesized that regular textures would be processed more efficiently. We found independent effects of symmetry type and regularity on search efficiency that confirmed both hypotheses: visual search was more efficient for textures with reflection symmetry and more efficient for regular textures. This provides additional support for the perceptual advantage of reflection in the context of visual search and provides important new evidence in favor of visual mechanisms specialized for processing symmetries in regular textures.

">A single-cell transcriptomic atlas of sensory-dependent gene expression in developing mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experience drives the refinement and maturation of neural circuits during postnatal brain development through molecular mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated. One likely mechanism involves the sensory-dependent expression of genes that encode direct mediators of circuit remodeling within developing cells. However, while studies in adult systems have begun to uncover crucial roles for sensory-induced genes in modifying circuit connectivity, the gene programs induced by brain cells in response to sensory experience during development remain to be fully characterized. Here, we present a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing dataset describing the transcriptional responses of cells in mouse visual cortex to sensory deprivation or sensory stimulation during a developmental window when visual input is necessary for circuit refinement. We sequenced 118,529 individual nuclei across sixteen neuronal and non-neuronal cortical cell types isolated from control, sensory deprived, and sensory stimulated mice, identifying 1,268 unique sensory-induced genes within the developing brain. To demonstrate the utility of this resource, we compared the architecture and ontology of sensory-induced gene programs between cell types, annotated transcriptional induction and repression events based upon RNA velocity, and discovered Neurexin and Neuregulin signaling networks that underlie cell-cell interactions via CellChat. We find that excitatory neurons, especially layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, are highly sensitive to sensory stimulation, and that the sensory-induced genes in these cells are poised to strengthen synapse-to-nucleus crosstalk by heightening protein serine/threonine kinase activity. Altogether, we expect this dataset to significantly broaden our understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which sensory experience shapes neural circuit wiring in the developing brain.

">Heteromeric amyloid filaments of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in FTLD-TDP Type C</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the abnormal filamentous assembly of specific proteins in the central nervous system. Human genetic studies established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from patient brains1. All diseases studied to date have been characterised by the self-assembly of a single intracellular protein in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) Types A and B. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP Type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/284-N345 and ANXA11 residues L39-L74 from their respective low-complexity domains (LCDs). Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11 previously implicated in protein-protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as a ~22 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections confirmed the co-localisation of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP Type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP Type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

">AAV delivery of GBA1 suppresses alpha-synuclein accumulation in Parkinson's disease models and restores motor dysfunction in a Gaucher's disease model</a></h4>

              
                Biallelic mutations in the glucosylceramidase beta 1 (GBA1) gene are the underlying genetic cause of Gaucher's disease (GD), resulting in a deficient lysosomal hydrolase and subsequent accumulation of glycosphingolipids. More recently, GBA1 mutations have been identified as the most prevalent genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with more pronounced symptoms characterized by earlier onset and accelerated cognitive decline. In these GBA-associated PD patients the alpha-synuclein pathology is more prominent, and recent data suggest a link between alpha-synucleinopathies and GBA1 mutations. Here, we explored the effect of GBA1 gene supplementation on the GD phenotypes and alpha-synuclein pathology by using the adeno-associated virus (AAV) system. We have compared two AAV serotypes, AAV5 and AAV9, and two different ubiquitous promoters, and demonstrate that both promoters work efficiently albeit not the same in vitro and in vivo. GBA1 overexpression reduces the accumulation of glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph) and restores motor dysfunction in a GD mouse model. We further demonstrate that GBA1 overexpression can dissolve phospho-alpha-synuclein aggregation induced by the addition of alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibril (PFF) in a mouse primary neuron model suggesting the direct effect of beta-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) on alpha-synuclein accumulation. In vivo, we show that GCase inhibition can induce insoluble high-molecular-weight alpha-synuclein aggregation and that delivery of GBA1 achieves robust reduction of the alpha-synuclein aggregates in the mouse brain. In summary, GCase expression not only reduces GlcSph, but also restores GD motor dysfunction and removes alpha-synuclein aggregates which are the hallmark for PD and alpha-synucleinopathies. AAV delivery of GBA1 is a powerful approach to restore glucocerebrosidase function and to resolve misfolded alpha-synuclein protein, with applications for GD and PD.

                The internal clock is a psychological model for timing behavior. According to information theory, psychological time might be a manifestation of information flow during sensory processing. Herein, we tested three hypotheses: (1) whether sensory adaptation reduces (or novelty increases) the rate of the internal clock (2) whether the speed of the clock reflects the amount of cortical sensory processing (3) whether motion tunes clock speed. The current study used an oddball paradigm in which participants detected duration changes while being recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). For data analysis, we combined cognitive modeling with neural decoding techniques. Specifically, we designed Adaptive-Thought-of-Control (ACT-R) models to explain human data and linked them to the sensory EEG features discovered through machine learning. Our results indicate that timing performance is influenced by both timing and non-timing factors. The internal clock may reflect the amount of sensory processing, thereby clarifying a long-standing sensory timing mystery.

	<p>Introduction: According to leading occupational therapy models, the environment appears to be a key element in fostering occupational performance and participation. There is an emerging need to identify an instrument that can assess these aspects in the school environment. Currently, there are no rating scales in Italy for the school participation of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. For this reason, this study aims to culturally adapt and translate the School Participation Questionnaire (SPQ) to Italian and to pilot test the translated Italian version on children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Methods: The original scale was translated from English to Italian using the guidelines &amp;amp;ldquo;Translation and Cultural Adaptation of Patient Reported Outcomes Measures&amp;amp;mdash;Principles of Good Practice.&amp;amp;rdquo; The psychometric properties analyzed were the following: content validity, construct validity, cross-cultural validity, and internal consistency. Construct validity was assessed using the Italian version of the Sensory Processing Measure (SPM). Results: The Italian version of the SPQ was administered to 22 children. The mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD of the score was 9.32 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.36; Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;alpha; was 0.935 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation coefficient with the SPM scores was &amp;amp;minus;0.622 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusions: This pilot testing study for the validation of the Italian version of the SPQ showed good validity and reliability results. Thanks to this study, it would be possible to further analyze the tool for the evaluation of the environment and school participation of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular autism spectrum disorder. It is a quick and easy instrument that focuses on the environment as an active variable in the child&amp;amp;rsquo;s occupational performance.</p>

	<p>Motor intention is a high-level brain function related to planning for movement. Although studies have shown that motor intentions can be decoded from brain signals before movement execution, it is unclear whether intentions relating to mental imagery of movement can be decoded. Here, we investigated whether differences in spatial and temporal patterns of brain activation were elicited by intentions to perform different types of motor imagery and whether the patterns could be used by a multivariate pattern classifier to detect such differential intentions. The results showed that it is possible to decode intentions before the onset of different types of motor imagery from functional MR signals obtained from fronto-parietal brain regions, such as the premotor cortex and posterior parietal cortex, while controlling for eye movements and for muscular activity of the hands. These results highlight the critical role played by the aforementioned brain regions in covert motor intentions. Moreover, they have substantial implications for rehabilitating patients with motor disabilities.</p>

	<p>The aim of the study was to test the effectiveness of cognitive interventions based on modern board games in school settings to improve memory outcomes and math skills. A parallel, quasi-experimental study was carried out with children (n = 234) into third and fourth grades (8&amp;amp;ndash;10 years old). School centres were allocated into a general domain intervention (playing memory board games), a specific domain intervention (playing mathematical board games) or a control group (regular classes without playing). Teachers carried out bi-weekly sessions during the last 30 min of mathematical lessons (8 weeks, 15 sessions). Before and after intervention, we individually measured verbal and visuospatial memory outcomes (short-term memory and working memory updating) and mathematical skills (number operations, number ranking, number production and problem solving). The results showed significant transfer effects of both memory and math trainings. In third grade, we found that playing math games showed medium&amp;amp;ndash;large effect sizes in visuospatial short-term memory and updating memory, number operations and number ranking compared to the control group. In fourth grade, we found that playing memory games showed significant small effect sizes in problem solving compared to the control group. Playing board games could be a methodology that enhances cognitive and mathematical development in children.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy treatment primarily involves antiseizure medications (ASMs) to eliminate seizures and improve the quality of life, but many patients develop drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), necessitating alternative interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in managing DRE. We retrospectively analyzed data from 105 adult patients treated at Agostino Gemelli Hospital from 1994 to 2022. Among the 73 patients with follow-up data, 80.8% were responders, experiencing significant reductions in seizure frequency over an average follow-up period of 9.4 years. Although 19.2% were non-responders, many of these patients still opted for generator replacements due to improvements in quality of life, such as fewer falls and shorter post-ictal periods. The overall complication rate was 12.3%, with most complications being mild and manageable. These findings suggest that VNS offers substantial long-term benefits for patients with DRE, improving seizure control and quality of life. This study underscores the importance of VNS as a viable long-term treatment option for DRE, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance patient outcomes and quality of life.</p>

	<p>Despite most episodes of low back pain (LBP) being short-lasting, some transition into persistent long-lasting problems. Hence, the need for a deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms of this is pertinent. Therefore, the aims of the present study are (1) to map pain-induced changes in brain activity and blood gene expression associated with persistent LBP, and (2) to explore whether these brain and gene expression signatures show promise as predictive biomarkers for the development of persistent LBP. The participants will be allocated into three different pain groups (no pain, mild short-lasting, or moderate long-term). One in-person visit, where two blood samples will be collected and sent for RNA sequencing, along with resting 64-channel electro-encephalography measurements before, during, and after a cold pressor test, will be conducted. Thereafter, follow-up questionnaires will be distributed at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Recruitment will start during the second quarter of 2024, with expected completion by the last quarter of 2024. The results are expected to provide insight into the relationship between central nervous system activity, gene expression profiles, and LBP. If successful, this study has the potential to provide physiological indicators that are sensitive to the transition from mild, short-term LBP to more problematic, long-term LBP.</p>

	<p>Background: The recovery of locomotion is greatly prioritized, and neuromodulation has been emerging as a promising approach in recent times. Study design: Single-subject research designSettings: A laboratory at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Objectives: To investigate the effects of augmenting activity-based therapy (ABT) to transcutaneous electrical spinal cord stimulation (TSCS) on enhancing specific lower limb muscle strength and improving locomotor ability in an individual with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Methods: An individual with iSCI underwent two phases of treatment, ABT alone followed by combined ABT+TSCS, each for a period of 10 weeks. The TSCS stimulated T10-T11 and T12-L1 segments with a frequency of 30 Hz at an intensity between 105 mA and 130 mA. Manual muscle testing, 6 min walk test (6MWT), and surface electromyography (EMG) responses of specific lower limb muscles were measured. Additionally, spasticity and sensorimotor examinations were conducted every two weeks, while pain tolerance was recorded after each treatment session. Results: After the ABT+TSCS treatment, there was an increase in overall muscle strength grading (from 1.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.3 to 2.2 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.6 out of 5.0). The 6MWT showed a greater increase in walking distance (3.5 m to 10 m) after combined treatment than ABT alone. In addition, the EMG response of the anterior rectus femoris, biceps femoris, medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior after ABT+TSCS increased more than after ABT alone. The spasticity grade was reduced (from 0.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.7 to 0.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.6) whereas the average lower limb motor score increased from 17 to 23 points. No adverse effects were reported. Conclusions: ABT+TSCS increased the target-specific lower limb muscle strength and walking ability more than ABT alone in an individual with chronic iSCI.</p>

	<p>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment option for patients with dopaminergic complications of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and drug-refractory PD tremor. However, DBS and its indications can be challenging, and they are not often debated in the medical community. Through a critical narrative review, the objective of this paper is to improve the comprehension of DBS indications and help to solve the puzzle that this process can be. Proper patient selection is the first step for a good surgical outcome. In this review, then, relevant considerations are discussed, involving PD genes, PD phenotypes, indications of early stages, non-motor symptoms, neuroimaging predictors, comorbidities, and age. Individualized approaches are encouraged, including clinical and radiological factors. Social support during the whole follow-up and expectations alignment are necessary through this process and are also debated.</p>

	<p>One&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice undergoes unique processing that distinguishes it from others&amp;amp;rsquo; voices, and thus listening to it may have a special neural basis for self-talk as an emotion regulation strategy. This study aimed to elucidate how neural effects of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice differ from those of others&amp;amp;rsquo; voices on the implementation of emotion regulation strategies. Twenty-one healthy adults were scanned using fMRI while listening to sentences synthesized in their own or others&amp;amp;rsquo; voices for self-affirmation and cognitive defusion, which were based on mental commitments to strengthen one&amp;amp;rsquo;s positive aspects and imagining metaphoric actions to shake off negative aspects, respectively. The interaction effect between voice identity and strategy was observed in the superior temporal sulcus, middle temporal gyrus, and parahippocampal cortex, and activity in these regions showed that the uniqueness of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice is reflected more strongly for cognitive defusion than for self-affirmation. This interaction was also seen in the precuneus, suggesting intertwining of self-referential processing and episodic memory retrieval in self-affirmation with one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice. These results imply that unique effects of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own voice may be expressed differently due to the degree of engagement of neural sharpening-related regions and self-referential networks depending on the type of emotion regulation.</p>

	<p>Non-human primates, due to their similarities in immune response to humans, are the preferred model for studying infectious processes and any associated cognitive impairments. Behavioral tests are indispensable for investigating pathogenesis in neuroinfections, especially those that do not manifest with noticeable clinical symptoms, as well as in the transition to a chronic form of the disease. Modeling viral infection requires specialized experimental conditions. Our work describes techniques for investigating mnemonic functions, tiredness, attentional focus, quick-wittedness, and basic behavioral responses in primates under the assumed conditions for infections with viruses that do not have an airborne route of transmission. It also outlines approaches to the training and selection of primates for virological research, as well as analyzing gender differences in learning abilities, the impact of housing conditions on the results, and the correlation between training success and behavioral test scores. These methods will allow a more detailed study of non-human primates as a model for researching cognitive and behavioral impairments under infectious and immune stress, as well as the design of less energy-intensive experiments for evaluating the efficacy and safety of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies at early stages of infection.</p>

                Background The Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has emerged as a global health threat. The causal reasoning is that Zika infection is linked to the development of microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. With no clinically approved antiviral treatment for ZIKV, the need for the development of potential inhibitors against the virus is essential. In this study, we aimed to screen phytochemicals from papaya (Carica papaya L.) against NS5 protein domains of ZIKV. Methods Approximately 193 phytochemicals from an online database (IMPACT) were subjected to molecular docking using AutoDock Vina against the NS5-MTase protein domain (5WXB) and -RdRp domain (5U04). Results Our results showed that β-sitosterol, carpaine, violaxanthin, pseudocarpaine, Δ7-avenasterols, Rutin, and cis-β-carotene had the highest binding affinity to both protein domains, with β-sitosterol having the most favorable binding energy. Furthermore, ADMET analysis revealed that selected compounds had good pharmacokinetic properties and were nontoxic. Conclusions Our findings suggest that papaya-derived phytochemicals could be potential candidates for developing antiviral drugs against ZIKV. However, further experimental studies using cell lines and in vivo models are needed to validate their efficacy and safety.

                Background Worldwide, e-commerce, as a business modality that uses information and communication technologies to make transactions of products and services, has become an indispensable part of the global retail market, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. E-commerce has experienced accelerated growth in recent years, driven by factors such as increased internet penetration, the expansion of mobile devices, user confidence and innovation of digital platforms. Dental offices have found e-commerce an opportunity to improve their competitiveness. The aim of the research was to establish the relationship between the indicators of efficiency maximization in sales and the type of modality of commerce used most by private dental offices within an emerging economy context in Latin-American city. Methods The study was classified as applied research with a non-experimental, correlational and exploratory design. The sample consisted of 34 private dental offices. A simple random probabilistic sampling was chosen. An instrument containing thirteen items including questions about payment, appointments or consultations, and advertising and indicators of efficiency maximization in sales, was used. Results The assessment of the relationship between the efficiency maximization indicators in sales and the commerce employed shows that, beyond cost reduction (PR=8, 95% CI [1.37; 46.81], p=0.021), the type does not have a statistically significant impact on the increase in clients, sales, revenues, and profit increase. (PR=3, 95% CI [0.28; 32.21], p=0.364). Conclusions E-commerce is significantly correlated with a reduction in operational costs.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The benefits of intravenous thrombolysis are time-dependent, with maximum efficacy when administered within the first “golden” hour after onset. Nevertheless, the impact of golden hour thrombolysis has not been well quantified.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched from inception to August 27, 2023. We included studies that reported safety and efficacy outcomes of ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis in the golden hour versus later treatment window. The primary outcome was an excellent functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0–1 at 90 days. The secondary efficacy outcome was a good functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0–2). The main safety outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seven studies involving 78,826 patients met the selection criteria. Golden hour thrombolysis was associated with higher odds of 90-day excellent functional outcomes (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.16–1.67) and 90-day good functional outcomes (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.13–1.69) compared with thrombolysis outside the golden hour. The number needed to treat to benefit for golden hour thrombolysis to reduce disability by at least 1 level on the modified Rankin Scale per patient was 2.6. Rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and mortality were similar between groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Golden hour thrombolysis significantly improved acute ischemic stroke outcomes. The findings provide rationale for intensive efforts aimed at expediting thrombolytic therapy within the golden hour window following the onset of acute ischemic stroke. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The provision of community health services (CHS) is critical in accelerating primary health care delivery to vulnerable and deprived populations. This systematic review study has been conducted to interrogate the interrelationship between households and community health services in accelerating primary healthcare delivery synthesizing the available empirical studies. The findings are to inform a primary research on structural linkages between households and CHS in Kisumu County, Kenya. Methods This study applied a descriptive approach using a systematic review technique to provide context and substance to the two main research questions: (1) how does the interaction between households and CHWs affect utilization of CHS to promote equity and right to health? (2) How do health-seeking behaviours of households influence their decision-making regarding choices of CHS? We screened the literature from Google scholar, JSTOR, SAGE and EBSCO based on our inclusion criteria, resulting in 21 studies. These studies were assessed for quality and eligibility and data extracted based on relevance to the research study. Results Households place primacy on trust and confidentiality in the interaction with CHWs and this affects uptake of CHS. The social determinants of health are also critical in influencing the health-seeking behaviour of households and individuals and their choice of CHS. The successful models of CHS share the characteristic of community ownership and participation and provides for comprehensive health care teams. Conclusion CHS are critical for the acceleration of primary health care delivery. It forms an important pathway for the achievement of universal health coverage, which is an outcome required for Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health.

                Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is a clinically challenging primary brain tumor with poor survival outcome despite surgical resection and intensive chemoradiation. The metabolic heterogeneity of GBM can become biomarkers for treatment response, resistance, and outcome prediction. The aim of the study is to investigate metabolic distinctions between primary and recurrent GBM tissue and patient plasma to establish feasibility for metabolic profiling. Methods A single-center cohort study analyzed tissue and blood samples from 15 patients with GBM using untargeted metabolomic/lipidomic assays. Metabolomic, lipidomic, and biogenic amine analyses were conducted on GBM tissue and patient plasma at diagnosis and recurrence using untargeted mass spectrometry. The study utilized a small but longitudinally collected cohort to evaluate alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between specimens at diagnosis and recurrence. Results Exploratory analysis revealed significant alteration in metabolites, lipids, and biogenic amines between diagnostic and recurrent states in both tumor and plasma specimens. Notable metabolites differed at recurrence, including N-alpha-methylhistamine, glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphocholine, and succinic acid in tissue, and indole-3-acetate, and urea in plasma. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolomic profiles between tumor tissue and patient plasma. Distinct metabolic profiles were observed in GBM tissue and patient plasma at recurrence, demonstrating the feasibility of using metabolomic methodologies for longitudinal studies. One patient exhibited a unique tumor resistance signature at diagnosis, possibly indicating a high-risk metabolomic phenotype. Conclusions In this small cohort, the findings suggest the potential of metabolomic signatures of GBM tissue and patient plasma for risk stratification, outcome prediction, and the development of novel adjuvant metabolic-targeting therapies. The findings suggest metabolic discrepancies at diagnosis and recurrence in tissue and plasma, highlighting potential implications for evaluation of clinical response. The identification of significant changes in metabolite abundance emphasizes the need for larger studies using targeted metabolomics to validate and further explore these profiles.

                Background Gambling disorder (GD) has become a wide concern in Indonesia, as many negative consequences arise from this psychiatric condition. Prompt treatment with an appropriate method of delivery is required to achieve optimal outcomes in GD patients. This protocol paper outlines a study to determine the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) in treating GD in Indonesia. Methods This non-randomized pilot and feasibility study will recruit 20 people with GD. All participants will receive the iCBT intervention through self-learning videos and guided weekly group sessions. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed at baseline (week 0), post- treatment completion (week 10), and 6 weeks post-treatment (week 16). The outcomes measured will be the change in gambling symptoms, gambling urges, cognitive distortions, readiness to change, emotional problems, and quality of life of the participants. Discussion The feasibility of iCBT for GD patients in Indonesia will be assessed by this study. The study's results will give an indication of the acceptability of the intervention and the feasibility of a subsequent conclusive trial. The delivery of iCBT may help to address the issue of treatment access in an extensive geographical region and provide immediate implications as a treatment resource for GD in practice.

                Background Establishment of a systematic way of measurement and utilization of indicators for improvement is one of the most challenging issues in monitoring and evaluation of indicators in healthcare settings. In realizing these fundamental challenges, we designed a monitoring and evaluation system incorporating a hospital-wide quality variance report (QVR) system using linked Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets on Microsoft SharePoint®. Methods Indicators were determined at the departmental/unit level in line with the institutional goals, departmental functions, quality expectations, inputs/outputs, clinical priorities, compliance to policies/procedures/protocols/guidelines/pathways as well as in response to gaps in service delivery picked during root cause analyses. The sample design was determined in accordance with the characteristics of the population. Drawing of sample units was done using a simple random sampling technique without replacement or systematic random sampling. The indicator’s monitoring was enhanced visually by allocating colour codes based on performance across the months and quarters. The action plan tab consisted of a platform that aids in documenting corrective actions arising from the performance reviews. Results and discussion The QVR reporting system ensured a standardized format of monitoring throughout the institution with a reduced turnaround time from data collection to analysis. Further, continuity of the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system was guaranteed even if an individual left the institution. The analysis of the QVR allowed hospital-wide trending on cross-cutting indicators with consequent ease of communication to multiple stakeholders. The automation has saved time and increased accuracy which has enhanced credible engagements during quality meetings. Conclusions Use of this system greatly enhanced quality performance monitoring in the hospital, identification of major bottlenecks that warranted hospital-wide projects or departmental-level projects. The QVR system enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of quality monitoring from data collection through to performance reviews. The QVR structure allows for customized development of an M&E database application software.

                <p>by Qince Li, Zheng Yan, Zhen Wang, Cuiping Liang, Xiqian Wang, Xianghu Wu, Wei Wang, Yongfeng Yuan, Kuanquan Wang</p>

Patients with myocardial ischemia and infarction are at increased risk of arrhythmias, which in turn, can exacerbate the overall risk of mortality. Despite the observed reduction in recurrent arrhythmias through antiarrhythmic drug therapy, the precise mechanisms underlying their effectiveness in treating ischemic heart disease remain unclear. Moreover, there is a lack of specialized drugs designed explicitly for the treatment of myocardial ischemic arrhythmia. This study employs an electrophysiological simulation approach to investigate the potential antiarrhythmic effects and underlying mechanisms of various pharmacological agents in the context of ischemia and myocardial infarction (MI). Based on physiological experimental data, computational models are developed to simulate the effects of a series of pharmacological agents (amiodarone, telmisartan, E-4031, chromanol 293B, and glibenclamide) on cellular electrophysiology and utilized to further evaluate their antiarrhythmic effectiveness during ischemia. On 2D and 3D tissues with multiple pathological conditions, the simulation results indicate that the antiarrhythmic effect of glibenclamide is primarily attributed to the suppression of efflux of potassium ion to facilitate the restitution of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, as opposed to recovery of I<sub>KATP</sub> during myocardial ischemia. This discovery implies that, during acute cardiac ischemia, pro-arrhythmogenic alterations in cardiac tissue’s excitability and conduction properties are more significantly influenced by electrophysiological changes in the depolarization rate, as opposed to variations in the action potential duration (APD). These findings offer specific insights into potentially effective targets for investigating ischemic arrhythmias, providing significant guidance for clinical interventions in acute coronary syndrome.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012218">Differences in the consolidation by spontaneous and evoked ripples in the presence of active dendrites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jannik Jauch, Moritz Becker, Christian Tetzlaff, Michael Jan Fauth</p>

Ripples are a typical form of neural activity in hippocampal neural networks associated with the replay of episodic memories during sleep as well as sleep-related plasticity and memory consolidation. The emergence of ripples has been observed both dependent as well as independent of input from other brain areas and often coincides with dendritic spikes. Yet, it is unclear how input-evoked and spontaneous ripples as well as dendritic excitability affect plasticity and consolidation.
Here, we use mathematical modeling to compare these cases. We find that consolidation as well as the emergence of spontaneous ripples depends on a reliable propagation of activity in feed-forward structures which constitute memory representations. This propagation is facilitated by excitable dendrites, which entail that a few strong synapses are sufficient to trigger neuronal firing. In this situation, stimulation-evoked ripples lead to the potentiation of weak synapses within the feed-forward structure and, thus, to a consolidation of a more general sequence memory. However, spontaneous ripples that occur without stimulation, only consolidate a sparse backbone of the existing strong feed-forward structure.
Based on this, we test a recently hypothesized scenario in which the excitability of dendrites is transiently enhanced after learning, and show that such a transient increase can strengthen, restructure and consolidate even weak hippocampal memories, which would be forgotten otherwise. Hence, a transient increase in dendritic excitability would indeed provide a mechanism for stabilizing memories.

                <p>by Simon Nougaret, Laura López-Galdo, Emile Caytan, Julien Poitreau, Frédéric V. Barthélemy, Bjørg Elisabeth Kilavik</p>

Low and high beta frequency rhythms were observed in the motor cortex, but their respective sources and behavioral correlates remain unknown. We studied local field potentials (LFPs) during pre-cued reaching behavior in macaques. They contained a low beta band (<20 Hz) dominant in primary motor cortex and a high beta band (>20 Hz) dominant in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Low beta correlated positively with reaction time (RT) from visual cue onset and negatively with uninstructed hand postural micro-movements throughout the trial. High beta reflected temporal task prediction, with selective modulations before and during cues, which were enhanced in moments of increased focal attention when the gaze was on the work area. This double-dissociation in sources and behavioral correlates of motor cortical low and high beta, with respect to both task-instructed and spontaneous behavior, reconciles the largely disparate roles proposed for the beta rhythm, by suggesting band-specific roles in both movement control and spatiotemporal attention.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to be more common in African Americans (AA), but biomarker studies in AA populations are limited. This report represents the largest study to date examining cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers in AA individuals.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed 3,006 cerebrospinal fluid samples from controls, AD cases, and non-AD cases, including 495 (16.5%) self-identified black/AA and 2,456 (81.7%) white/European individuals using cutoffs derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and using a data-driven multivariate Gaussian mixture of regressions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Distinct effects of race were found in different groups. Total Tauand phospho181-Tau were lower among AA individuals in all groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and Aβ<sub>42</sub> was markedly lower in AA controls compared with white controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Gaussian mixture of regressions modeling of cerebrospinal fluid distributions incorporating adjustments for covariates revealed coefficient estimates for AA race comparable with 2-decade change in age. Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cutoffs, fewer AA controls were classified as biomarker-positive asymptomatic AD (8.0% vs 13.4%). After adjusting for covariates, our Gaussian mixture of regressions model reduced this difference, but continued to predict lower prevalence of asymptomatic AD among AA controls (9.3% vs 13.5%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although the risk of dementia is higher, data-driven modeling indicates lower frequency of asymptomatic AD in AA controls, suggesting that dementia among AA populations may not be driven by higher rates of AD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease with high mortality, and there are only two specific drugs available for therapeutic management with limitations. The study aims to identify comprehensive therapeutic mechanisms of Zingiber zerumbet rhizomes (ZZR) to treat IPF by using network pharmacology followed battery of in silico studies. Methods The protein-protein interaction network was developed using Cytoscape to obtain core disease targets involved in IPF and their interactive molecules of ZZR. Based on the pharmacophore properties of phytomolecules from ZZR, the drug targets in IPF were explored. Protein-protein interaction network was built in Cytoscape to screen potential targets and components of ZZR. Molecular docking and dynamics were conducted as an empirical study to investigate the mechanism explored through network pharmacology in relation to the hub targets. Results The network analysis conferred kaempferol derivatives that had demonstrated a promising therapeutic effect on the perturbed, robust network hubs of TGF-β1, EGFR, TNF-α, MMP2 & MMP9 reported to alter the biological process of mesenchymal transition, myofibroblast proliferation, and cellular matrix deposition in pulmonary fibrosis. The phytomolecules of ZZR act on two major significant pathways, namely the TGF-β-signaling pathway and the FOXO-signaling pathway, to inhibit IPF. Confirmational molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies possessed good stability and interactions of the protein-ligand complexes by RMSD, RMSF, rGyr, SASA, and principal component analysis (PCA). Validated molecular docking and dynamics simulations provided new insight into exploring the mechanism and multi-target effect of ZZR to treat pulmonary fibrosis by restoring the alveolar phenotype through cellular networking. Conclusions Network pharmacology and in silico studies confirm the multitargeted activity of ZZR in the treatment of IPF. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are to be conducted to validate these findings.

                Adhikari et al. demonstrate that epigenetic regulator UBR7 functions in concert with EZH2 to modulate TGF-β signaling cascade by altering H3K27me3 landscape, thereby affecting the transcription of extracellular matrix genes. Thus, UBR7 plays a key role in stiffness-mediated metastasis suppression in triple-negative breast cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93971">Fitness landscape of substrate-adaptive mutations in evolved amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporters</a></h4>

              
                The emergence of new protein functions is crucial for the evolution of organisms. This process has been extensively researched for soluble enzymes, but it is largely unexplored for membrane transporters, even though the ability to acquire new nutrients from a changing environment requires evolvability of transport functions. Here, we demonstrate the importance of environmental pressure in obtaining a new activity or altering a promiscuous activity in members of the amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC)-type yeast amino acid transporters family. We identify APC members that have broader substrate spectra than previously described. Using in vivo experimental evolution, we evolve two of these transporter genes, <i>AGP1</i> and <i>PUT4</i>, toward new substrate specificities. Single mutations on these transporters are found to be sufficient for expanding the substrate range of the proteins, while retaining the capacity to transport all original substrates. Nonetheless, each adaptive mutation comes with a distinct effect on the fitness for each of the original substrates, illustrating a trade-off between the ancestral and evolved functions. Collectively, our findings reveal how substrate-adaptive mutations in membrane transporters contribute to fitness and provide insights into how organisms can use transporter evolution to explore new ecological niches.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91928">Reconfigurations of cortical manifold structure during reward-based motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive motor behavior depends on the coordinated activity of multiple neural systems distributed across the brain. While the role of sensorimotor cortex in motor learning has been well established, how higher-order brain systems interact with sensorimotor cortex to guide learning is less well understood. Using functional MRI, we examined human brain activity during a reward-based motor task where subjects learned to shape their hand trajectories through reinforcement feedback. We projected patterns of cortical and striatal functional connectivity onto a low-dimensional manifold space and examined how regions expanded and contracted along the manifold during learning. During early learning, we found that several sensorimotor areas in the dorsal attention network exhibited increased covariance with areas of the salience/ventral attention network and reduced covariance with areas of the default mode network (DMN). During late learning, these effects reversed, with sensorimotor areas now exhibiting increased covariance with DMN areas. However, areas in posteromedial cortex showed the opposite pattern across learning phases, with its connectivity suggesting a role in coordinating activity across different networks over time. Our results establish the neural changes that support reward-based motor learning and identify distinct transitions in the functional coupling of sensorimotor to transmodal cortex when adapting behavior.

">Astrocytic glutamate regulation is implicated in the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Severe psychological stress is one of the most potent risk factors for developing a mood or psychotic disorder, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Astrocytes are a key brain cell type associated with stress and psychiatric phenotypes in animals, but how this translates to humans is largely unknown. Here, we show that cortical astrocytes are persistently changed both physically and molecularly in humans with psychiatric disorders exposed to profound stress before diagnosis. By profiling the diversity of human astrocytes with single nucleus and spatial transcriptomics, we identified distinct alterations to glutamate-related synaptic functions, supported by histological quantification of >20,000 astrocytes. Alterations were pronounced in females compared to males and in cases exposed to profound stress during childhood. The use of human pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes confirmed that glutamate signalling is directly impacted by glucocorticoid activation. Our findings suggest that astrocytes are strategic pharmacological targets for future intervention strategies.

">The Alzheimer's disease gene SORL1 regulates lysosome function in human microglia</a></h4>

              
                The SORL1 gene encodes the sortilin related receptor protein SORLA, a sorting receptor that regulates endo-lysosomal trafficking of various substrates. Loss of function variants in SORL1 are causative for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and decreased expression of SORLA has been repeatedly observed in human AD brains. SORL1 is highly expressed by microglia, the tissue resident immune cells of the brain. Loss of SORLA leads to enlarged lysosomes in hiPSC-derived microglia like cells (hMGLs). However, whether SORLA deficiency contributes to microglia dysfunction and how this is relevant to AD is not known. In this study, we show that loss of SORLA results in decreased lysosomal degradation and lysosomal enzyme activity due to altered trafficking of lysosomal enzymes in hMGLs. Furthermore, lysosomal exocytosis, an important process involved in immune responses and cellular signaling, is also impaired in SORL1 deficient microglia. Phagocytic uptake of fibrillar amyloid beta 1-42 and synaptosomes is increased in SORLA deficient hMGLs, but due to reduced lysosomal degradation, these substrates aberrantly accumulate in lysosomes. Overall, these data highlight the microglial endo-lysosomal network as a potential novel pathway through which SORL1 may increase AD risk and contribute to development of AD. Additionally, our findings may inform development of novel lysosome and microglia associated drug targets for AD.

">Thalamocortical contributions to hierarchical cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility relies on hierarchically structured task representations that organize task contexts, relevant environmental features, and subordinate decisions. Despite ongoing interest in the human thalamus, its role in cognitive control has been understudied. This study explored thalamic representation and thalamocortical interactions that contribute to hierarchical cognitive control in humans. We found that several thalamic nuclei, including the anterior, mediodorsal, ventrolateral, and pulvinar nuclei, exhibited stronger evoked responses when subjects switch between task contexts. Decoding analysis revealed that thalamic activity preferentially encodes task contexts within the hierarchical task representations. To determine how thalamocortical interactions contribute to task representations, we developed a thalamocortical functional interaction model to predict task-related cortical representation. This data-driven model outperformed comparison models, particularly in predicting activity patterns in cortical regions that encode context representations. Collectively, our findings highlight the significant contribution of thalamic activity and thalamocortical interactions for contextually guided hierarchical cognitive control.

">Sex-steroid hormones relate to cerebellar structure and functional connectivity across adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Aging involves complex biological changes that affect disease susceptibility and aging trajectories. Although females typically live longer than males, they have a higher susceptibility to diseases like Alzheimer's, speculated to be influenced by menopause, and reduced ovarian hormone production. Understanding sex-specific differences is crucial for personalized medical interventions and gender equality in health. Our study aims to elucidate sex differences in regional cerebellar structure and connectivity during normal aging by investigating both structural and functional connectivity variations, with a focus on investigating these differences in the context of sex-steroid hormones. The study included 138 participants (mean age = 57(13.3) years, age range = 35-86 years, 54% women). The cohort was divided into three groups: 38 early middle-aged individuals (EMA) (mean age = 41(4.7) years), 48 late middle-aged individuals (LMA) (mean age = 58(4) years), and 42 older adults (OA) (mean age = 72(6.3) years). All participants underwent MRI scans, and saliva samples were collected for sex-steroid hormone quantification (17{beta}-estradiol (E), progesterone (P), and testosterone (T)). We found less connectivity in females between Lobule I-IV and the cuneus, and greater connectivity in females between Crus I, Crus II, and the precuneus with increased age. Higher 17{beta}-estradiol levels were linked to greater connectivity in Crus I and Crus II cerebellar subregions. Analyzing all participants together, testosterone was associated with both higher and lower connectivity in Lobule I-IV and Crus I, respectively, while higher progesterone levels were linked to lower connectivity in females. Structural differences were observed, with EMA males having larger volumes compared to LMA and OA groups, particularly in the right I-IV, right Crus I, right V, and right VI. EMA females showed higher volumes in the right lobules V and VI. These results highlight the significant role of sex hormones in modulating cerebellar connectivity and structure across adulthood, emphasizing the need to consider sex and hormonal status in neuroimaging studies to better understand age-related cognitive decline and neurological disorders.

">Pronouns reactivate conceptual representations in human hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                During discourse comprehension, every new word adds to an evolving representation of meaning that accumulates over consecutive sentences and constrains the next words. To minimize repetition and utterance length, languages use pronouns, like the word 'she', to refer to nouns and phrases that were previously introduced. It has been suggested that language comprehension requires that pronouns activate the same neuronal representations as the nouns themselves. Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells' preferred noun. These results imply that concept cells contribute to a rapid and dynamic semantic memory network which is recruited during language comprehension. This study uniquely demonstrates, at the single-cell level, how memory and language are linked.

">Presynaptic GABAA receptors control integration of nicotinic input onto dopaminergic axons in the striatum</a></h4>

              
                Axons of dopaminergic neurons express gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptors (GABAARs) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) which are both independently positioned to shape striatal dopamine release. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we investigated how interactions between GABAARs and nAChRs influence dopaminergic axon excitability. Direct axonal recordings showed that benzodiazepine application suppresses subthreshold axonal input from cholinergic interneurons (CINs). In imaging experiments, we used the first temporal derivative of presynaptic calcium signals to distinguish between direct- and nAChR-evoked activity in dopaminergic axons. We found that GABAAR antagonism with gabazine selectively enhanced nAChR-evoked axonal signals. Acetylcholine release was unchanged in gabazine suggesting that GABAARs located on dopaminergic axons, but not CINs, mediated this enhancement. Unexpectedly, we found that a widely used GABAAR antagonist, picrotoxin, inhibits axonal nAChRs and should be used cautiously for striatal circuit analysis. Overall, we demonstrate that GABAARs on dopaminergic axons regulate integration of nicotinic input to shape presynaptic excitability.

">Cortical Processing of Conspecific Vocalizations in Zebra Finches Depends on the Early Acoustical Environment</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experience during development has lasting effects on perception and neural processing. Exposing animals to artificial stimuli early in life influences the tuning and functional organization of the auditory cortex, but less is known about how the rich acoustical environments experienced by vocal communicators affect the processing of complex vocalizations. Here, we show that in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a colonial-breeding songbird species, exposure to a naturalistic social-acoustical environment during development has a profound impact on cortical-level auditory responses to conspecific song. Compared to birds raised by pairs in acoustic isolation, birds raised in a breeding colony had higher average firing rates, selectivity, and discriminability, especially in the narrow-spiking, putatively inhibitory neurons of a higher-order auditory area, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM). Neurons in colony-reared birds were also less correlated in their tuning and more efficient at encoding the spectrotemporal structure of conspecific song. These results suggest that the auditory cortex adapts to noisy, complex acoustical environments by strengthening inhibitory circuitry, functionally decoupling excitatory neurons while maintaining overall excitatory-inhibitory balance.

">Integrating episodic and spatial context signals in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Episodic and spatial memory are the two key components of the mnemonic system in humans. Episodic memory enables us to remember events from the past whereas spatial memory enables us to form a map-like representation of the environment. Interestingly, these seemingly different functions rely on the same brain structure: the hippocampus. Yet, how the hippocampus supports both at the same time remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypotheses that the hippocampus supports these two systems either via a common coding mechanism or via a parallel processing mechanism. To this end, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an episodic life-simulation task and a spatial virtual reality task to manipulate episodic and spatial context associations of objects. We then investigated fMRI adaptation effects between these objects as a result of shared contexts. We found that the fMRI signal in the anterior hippocampus scaled with the combined prediction of shared episodic and spatial contexts, in line with the idea of a common coding mechanism. We found no evidence for a parallel processing mechanism, as there were no differences between episodic and spatial effects. The common coding effect for episodic and spatial memory dovetails with the broader notion of domain-general hippocampal cognitive maps.

                We propose that listeners can use temporal regularities, spectro-temporal correlations that change smoothly over time, to discriminate animal vocalizations within and between species. To test this idea, we used Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) to find the most temporally regular components of vocalizations from birds (blue jay, house finch, American yellow warbler, and great blue heron), humans (English speakers), and rhesus macaques. We projected vocalizations into the learned feature space and tested intra-class (same speaker/species) and inter-class (different speakers/species) auditory discrimination by a trained classifier. We found that: 1) Vocalization discrimination was excellent (> 95%) in all cases; 2) Performance depended primarily on the [~]10 most temporally regular features; 3) Most vocalizations are dominated by [~]10 features with high temporal regularity; and 4)These regular features are highly correlated with the most predictable components of animal sounds.

                Neurons and glia work together to regulate neural circuit assembly and maintenance, but our understanding of how remains superficial. In this study, we establish that Drosophila exhibit large-scale synapse formation and elimination as part of circuit maturation, and that glia use conserved molecules to regulate these processes. We used a high throughput ELISA-based screening assay to identify new glial genes that regulate synapse numbers in Drosophila in vivo, including the scavenger receptor ortholog Croquemort (Crq). We found that Crq acts as an essential regulator of glial-dependent synapse elimination during development, leading to excess synapses and progressive seizure susceptibility in flies which lack Crq expression in glia. Loss of Crq in glia also prevents age-related synaptic loss. This work provides a platform to gain insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie synapse development and maintenance across the lifespan, and identifies glial Crq as a key regulator of these processes.

">Central tendency and serial dependence in vestibular path integration</a></h4>

              
                Path integration, the process of updating one's position using successive self-motion signals, has previously been studied using visual distance reproduction tasks in which optic flow patterns provide information about traveled distance. These studies have reported that reproduced distances show two types of systematic biases: central tendency and serial dependence. In the present study, we investigated whether these biases are also present in vestibular path integration. Participants were seated on a linear motion platform and performed a distance reproduction task in total darkness. The platform first passively moved the participant a pre-defined stimulus distance which they then actively reproduced by steering the platform back the same distance. Stimulus distances were sampled from short- and long-distance probability distributions and presented in either a randomized order or in separate blocks to study the effect of presentation context. Similar to the effects observed in visual path integration, we found that reproduced distances showed an overall positive central tendency effect as well as a positive, attractive serial dependence effect. Furthermore, reproduction behavior was affected by presentation context. These results were mostly consistent with predictions of a Bayesian Kalman-filter model, originally proposed for visual path integration.

">α/β-Hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) accelerates the desensitization and deactivation of TARP γ-2-containing AMPA receptors</a></h4>

              
                AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in mammalian brain. Their efficacy in responding to presynaptic glutamate release depends on their kinetics, which are determined by AMPARs and their auxiliary subunit composition. /{beta}-Hydrolase domain-containing 6 (ABHD6) is an AMPAR auxiliary subunit that has been shown to negatively regulate the surface delivery of AMPARs and AMPAR-mediated currents. Overexpression of ABHD6 decreased the rising slope and increased the decay {tau} of mEPSCs. However, whether ABHD6 is involved in regulating AMPAR kinetics remains unclear. Here, we found that ABHD6 per se had no effects on the gating kinetics of GluA1 and GluA2(Q) containing homomeric receptors. However, in the presence of the auxiliary subunit TARP {gamma}-2, ABHD6 accelerated the deactivation and desensitization of either GluA1 and GluA2(Q) containing homomeric receptors independent of their splicing isoforms (flip and flop) and the editing isoforms of GluA2 (R or G at position 764), except the deactivation of GluA2(Q)i-G isoform. Besides, the recovery from desensitization of GluA1 with flip splicing isoform was slowed by the co-expression of ABHD6 in the presence of TARP {gamma}-2. Furthermore, the ABHD6 accelerated the deactivation and desensitization of GluA1i/GluA2(R)i-G heteromeric receptors in the presence of TARP {gamma}-2. Therefore, these results demonstrate that ABHD6 regulates AMPAR gating kinetics in a TARP {gamma}-2-dependent manner.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe efficacy of AMPARs in responding to presynaptic glutamate release depends on their kinetics, including deactivation, desensitization, and recovery from desensitization, which are determined by AMPARs and their auxiliary subunit composition. Using ultra-fast application of glutamate and outside-out patch recordings, we found that, in the presence of the auxiliary subunit TARP {gamma}-2, ABHD6 accelerated the deactivation and desensitization of GluA1i/GluA2(R)i-G heteromeric receptors and GluA1 and GluA2(Q) containing homomeric receptors independent of their splicing isoforms (flip and flop) and the editing isoforms of GluA2 (R or G at position 764), except the deactivation of GluA2(Q)i-G isoform. These results demonstrate that ABHD6 regulates AMPAR gating kinetics in a TARP {gamma}-2-dependent manner.

	<p>The neuropsychological diagnosis and assessment of alexia remain formidable due to its multifaceted presentations and the intricate neural underpinnings involved. The current study employed a mixed-method design, incorporating cluster and thematic analyses, to illuminate the complexities of alexia assessment. We used the Web of Science and Scopus to retrieve articles spanning from 1985 to February 2024. Our selection was based on identified keywords in relation to the assessment and diagnosis of alexia. The analysis of 449 articles using CiteSpace (Version 6.3.R1) and VOSviewer (Version 1.6.19) software identified ten key clusters such as &amp;amp;lsquo;pure alexia&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;posterior cortical atrophy&amp;amp;rsquo;, highlighting the breadth of research within this field. The thematic analysis of the most cited and recent studies led to eight essential categories. These categories were synthesized into a conceptual model that illustrates the interaction between neural, cognitive, and diagnostic aspects, in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICFDH) framework. This model emphasizes the need for comprehensive diagnostic approaches extending beyond traditional reading assessments to include specific tasks like character identification, broader visual processing, and numerical tasks. Future diagnostic models should incorporate a diverse array of alexia types and support the creation of advanced assessment tools, ultimately improving clinical practice and research.</p>

	<p>Focal forms of epilepsy can result from a wide range of insults and can vary from focal symptoms to generalized convulsions. Most drugs that have been developed for epilepsy focus on the prevention of seizures. On Electroencephalography (EEG), seizures are characterized by a repetitive buildup of epileptic waveforms that can spread across the brain. Brain regions that produce seizures generate far more frequent &amp;amp;lsquo;interictal&amp;amp;rsquo; spikes seen between seizures, and in animal models, these spikes occur prior to the development of seizures. Interictal spiking by itself has been shown to have significant adverse clinical effects on cognition and behavior in both patients and animal models. While the exact relationships between interictal spiking and seizures are not well defined, interictal spikes serve as an important biomarker that, for some forms of epilepsy, can serve as a surrogate biomarker and as a druggable target. While there are many animal models of seizures for drug development, here we review models of interictal spiking, focusing on tetanus toxin, to study the relationship between interictal spiking, seizures, cognition, and behavior. Studies on human cortical regions with frequent interictal spiking have identified potential therapeutic targets; therefore, having a highly consistent model of spiking will be invaluable not only for unraveling the initial stages of the pathological cascade leading to seizure development but also for testing novel therapeutics. This review offers a succinct overview of the use of tetanus toxin animal models for studying and therapeutic development for interictal spiking.</p>

	<p>Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are well-known for their essential function in protein synthesis. Recent research has revealed a diverse range of chemical modifications that tRNAs undergo, which are crucial for various cellular processes. These modifications are necessary for the precise and efficient translation of proteins and also play important roles in gene expression regulation and cellular stress response. This review examines the role of tRNA modifications and dysregulation in the pathophysiology of various brain diseases, including epilepsy, stroke, neurodevelopmental disorders, brain tumors, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing research, our study aims to elucidate the intricate relationship between tRNA dysregulation and brain diseases. This underscores the critical need for ongoing exploration in this field and provides valuable insights that could facilitate the development of innovative diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals grappling with complex neurological conditions.</p>

                Background The quality of registry based studies depends largely on the data accuracy of the registries. The Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) is a nationwide database comprising perinatal data digitally provided by different healthcare providers. Perined data are used for comparing outcomes across regions and healthcare institutions as well as for quality analyses and research purposes. However, little is known about the data quality of the Perined database. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the quality of Perined data compared to hospital records and case report forms (CRFs) that were part of the IUGR Risk Selection (IRIS) study. Methods In this comparison study data from Perined and the IRIS Study will be used. The IRIS study was a large cluster-randomized trial investigating the effectiveness of routine third trimester ultrasonography in reducing severe adverse perinatal outcomes among Dutch low-risk pregnant women. A subsample of the IRIS study of neonates being at risk of severe adverse perinatal outcomes and their mothers will be used. Baseline demographic data were collected by midwives from participating women at inclusion (around 22 weeks’ gestation) using CRFs, and in-depth neonatal and maternal clinical data were retrieved from hospital records by trained research assistants. These latter IRIS study data were linked and compared to Perined data. Completeness of Perined data will be calculated for every variable. The reliability will be assessed as the percent of agreement between Perined and hospital record data or the CRF-based data. Additionally, intra-class correlation coefficients will be calculated for continuous variables, and Kappa and ‘Prevalence-and-Bias-Adjusted Kappa’ will be calculated for categorical variables. Discussion The results of the proposed comparison study will provide users of Perined data insight in its data quality. This will serve as an example of the accuracy of registry based data used in maternal and neonatal care research.

                Background: Major trauma places substantial demand on critical care services, is a leading cause of death in under 40-year-olds and causes significant morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Various factors influence patient outcome and predefining these could allow prognostication. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of mortality from major trauma in intensive care. Methods: This was a retrospective study of adult trauma patients admitted to general intensive care between January 2018 and December 2019. We assessed the impact on mortality of patient demographics, patterns of injury, injury scores (Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI), Acute Physiology and Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Probability of Survival Score (Ps19)), number of surgeries and mechanism of injury using logistic regression. Results: A total of 414 patients were included with a median age of 54 years (IQR 34–72). Overall mortality was 18.6%. The most common mechanism of injury was traffic collision (46%). Non-survivors were older, had higher ISS scores with lower GCS on admission and probability of survival scores. Factors independently predictive of mortality were increasing age (OR 1.06, p <0.001) and GCS <15 on admission (OR 7.21, p <0.001). Ps19 was the best predictor of mortality (p <0.001 for each score category), with an AUROC of 0.90. Conclusions: The significant mortality predictors were age, fall from <2 metres, injury of head or limbs, GCS <15 and Ps19. Contrary to previous studies CCI and APACHE II did not significantly predict mortality. Although Ps19 was found to be the best current prognostic score, trauma prognostication would benefit from a single validated scoring system incorporating both physiological variables and injury patterns.

                Background Empirical studies on the impact of devaluation in developing countries, including Ethiopia, have revealed diverse and mixed results. The effects can be positive or negative depending on the specific economic context and policies in place.This study addresses the devaluation puzzle by providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how devaluation affects the balance of payments and output. Methods To achieve this, we employ a recursive structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model focusing on Ethiopia from 2001Q1 to 2023Q4. Results The findings reveal that exchange rate shocks negatively affect the balance of payments in both the short and long run, with a greater impact observed in the short run. Shocks in other variables, such as foreign exchange rate reserves, inflation, and interest rates, exert a stronger influence on the balance of payments than the exchange rate itself in the long run. In addition, shocks in the exchange rate significantly impact foreign exchange rate reserves in the long run, highlighting the complex dynamics of exchange rates and the indirect nature of the exchange rate channel. Exchange rate shocks also negatively impact output growth in both the short and long run. Conclusion The study concludes that devaluation has a contractionary effect through various channels. Devaluation increases the money supply, leading to inflationary pressures and a decline in output. It also increases interest rates, which further reduces output. In addition, devaluation reduces foreign exchange reserves, resulting in a fall in the balance of payments and a decrease in output. We suggest policymakers prioritize exchange rate stability through practical monetary and fiscal policies. In general, International financial institutions, particularly the National Bank of Ethiopia, should reconsider their devaluation-focused policies, considering the complexities and potential negative consequences associated with devaluation.

                <p>by Hyeonuk Woo, Yubeen Kim, Chaok Seok</p>

As of now, more than 60 years have passed since the first determination of protein structures through crystallography, and a significant portion of protein structures can be predicted by computers. This is due to the groundbreaking enhancement in protein structure prediction achieved through neural network training utilizing extensive sequence and structure data. However, substantial challenges persist in structure prediction due to limited data availability, with antibody structure prediction standing as one such challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture that effectively enables structure prediction by reflecting the inherent combinatorial nature involved in protein structure formation. The core idea of this neural network architecture is not solely to track and generate a single structure but rather to form a community of multiple structures and pursue accurate structure prediction by exchanging information among community members. Applying this concept to antibody CDR H3 loop structure prediction resulted in improved structure sampling. Such an approach could be applied in the structural and functional studies of proteins, particularly in exploring various physiological processes mediated by loops. Moreover, it holds potential in addressing various other types of combinatorial structure prediction and design problems.

Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) offer a holistic view of biochemical reaction networks, enabling in-depth analyses of metabolism across species and tissues in multiple conditions. However, comparing GSMMs Against each other poses challenges as current dimensionality reduction algorithms or clustering methods lack mechanistic interpretability, and often rely on subjective assumptions. Here, we propose a new approach utilizing logisitic principal component analysis (LPCA) that efficiently clusters GSMMs while singling out mechanistic differences in terms of reactions and pathways that drive the categorization. We applied LPCA to multiple diverse datasets, including GSMMs of 222 <i>Escherichia</i>-strains, 343 budding yeasts (<i>Saccharomycotina</i>), 80 human tissues, and 2943 <i>Firmicutes</i> strains. Our findings demonstrate LPCA’s effectiveness in preserving microbial phylogenetic relationships and discerning human tissue-specific metabolic profiles, exhibiting comparable performance to traditional methods like t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) and Jaccard coefficients. Moreover, the subsystems and associated reactions identified by LPCA align with existing knowledge, underscoring its reliability in dissecting GSMMs and uncovering the underlying drivers of separation.

Biological structures are defined by rigid elements, such as bones, and elastic elements, like muscles and membranes. Computer vision advances have enabled automatic tracking of moving animal skeletal poses. Such developments provide insights into complex time-varying dynamics of biological motion. Conversely, the elastic soft-tissues of organisms, like the nose of elephant seals, or the buccal sac of frogs, are poorly studied and no computer vision methods have been proposed. This leaves major gaps in different areas of biology. In primatology, most critically, the function of air sacs is widely debated; many open questions on the role of air sacs in the evolution of animal communication, including human speech, remain unanswered. To support the dynamic study of soft-tissue structures, we present a toolkit for the automated tracking of semi-circular elastic structures in biological video data. The toolkit contains unsupervised computer vision tools (using Hough transform) and supervised deep learning (by adapting DeepLabCut) methodology to track inflation of laryngeal air sacs or other biological spherical objects (e.g., gular cavities). Confirming the value of elastic kinematic analysis, we show that air sac inflation correlates with acoustic markers that likely inform about body size. Finally, we present a pre-processed audiovisual-kinematic dataset of 7+ hours of closeup audiovisual recordings of siamang (<i>Symphalangus syndactylus</i>) singing. This toolkit (https://github.com/WimPouw/AirSacTracker) aims to revitalize the study of non-skeletal morphological structures across multiple species.

Carbohydrates and glycoproteins modulate key biological functions. However, experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult. Computational approaches can aid in carbohydrate structure prediction, structure determination, and design. In this work, we developed a glycan-modeling algorithm, <i>GlycanTreeModeler</i>, that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer, using adaptive kernel density estimates (KDE) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and from quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. <i>GlycanTreeModeler</i> was benchmarked on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths, or “trees”. Structures predicted by <i>GlycanTreeModeler</i> agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both <i>de novo</i> modeling and experimental density-guided building. We employed these tools to design <i>de novo</i> glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement.

                <p>by Praveen Kumar Viswanathan, Aline Chessel, Maria Dolores Molina, Emmanuel Haillot, Thierry Lepage</p>

In the highly regulative embryo of the sea urchin <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i>, establishment of the dorsal-ventral (D/V) axis critically depends on the zygotic expression of the TGF-β <i>nodal</i> in the ventral ectoderm. <i>nodal</i> expression is first induced ubiquitously in the 32-cell embryo and becomes progressively restricted to the presumptive ventral ectoderm by the early blastula stage. This early spatial restriction of <i>nodal</i> expression is independent of Lefty, and instead relies on the activity of Panda, a maternally expressed TGF-β ligand related to Lefty and Inhibins, which is required maternally for D/V axis specification. However, the mechanism by which Panda restricts the early <i>nodal</i> expression has remained enigmatic and it is not known if Panda works like a BMP ligand by opposing Nodal and antagonizing Smad2/3 signaling, or if it works like Lefty by sequestering an essential component of the Nodal signaling pathway. In this study, we report that Panda functions as an antagonist of the TGF-β type II receptor ACVRII (Activin receptor type II), which is the only type II receptor for Nodal signaling in the sea urchin and is also a type II receptor for BMP ligands. Inhibiting translation of <i>acvrII</i> mRNA disrupted D/V patterning across all 3 germ layers and caused <i>acvrII</i> morphants to develop with a typical Nodal loss-of-function phenotype. In contrast, embryos overexpressing <i>acvrII</i> displayed strong ectopic Smad1/5/8 signaling at blastula stages and developed as dorsalized larvae, a phenotype very similar to that caused by over activation of BMP signaling. Remarkably, embryos co-injected with <i>acvrII</i> mRNA and <i>panda</i> mRNA did not show ectopic Smad1/5/8 signaling and developed with a largely normal dorsal-ventral polarity. Furthermore, using an axis induction assay, we found that Panda blocks the ability of ACVRII to orient the D/V axis when overexpressed locally. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we showed that Panda physically interacts with ACVRII, as well as with the Nodal co-receptor Cripto, and with TBR3 (Betaglycan), which is a non-signaling receptor for Inhibins in mammals. At the molecular level, we have traced back the antagonistic activity of Panda to the presence of a single proline residue, conserved with all the Lefty factors, in the ACVRII binding motif of Panda, instead of a serine as in most of TGF-β ligands. Conversion of this proline to a serine converted Panda from an antagonist that opposed Nodal signaling and promoted dorsalization to an agonist that promoted Nodal signaling and triggered ventralization when overexpressed. Finally, using phylogenomics, we analyzed the emergence of the agonist and antagonist form of Panda in the course of evolution. Our data are consistent with the idea that the presence of a serine at that position, like in most TGF-β, was the ancestral condition and that the initial function of Panda was possibly in promoting and not in antagonizing Nodal signaling. These results highlight the existence of key functional and structural elements conserved between Panda and Lefty, allow to draw an intriguing parallel between sea urchin Panda and mammalian Inhibin α and raise the unexpected possibility that the original function of Panda may have been in activation of the Nodal pathway rather than in its inhibition.

<br/>
<p>Amyloid neuropathy is caused by deposition of insoluble β-pleated amyloid sheets in the peripheral nervous system. It is most common in: (1) light-chain amyloidosis, a clonal non-proliferative plasma cell disorder in which fragments of immunoglobulin, light or heavy chain, deposit in tissues, and (2) hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis, a disorder caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the <i>TTR</i> gene resulting in mutated protein that has a higher tendency to misfold. Amyloid fibrils deposit in the endoneurium of peripheral nerves, often extensive in the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia, leading to atrophy of Schwann cells in proximity to amyloid fibrils and blood–nerve barrier disruption. Clinically, amyloid neuropathy is manifested as a length-dependent sensory predominant neuropathy associated with generalized autonomic failure. Small unmyelinated nerves are involved early and prominently in early-onset Val30Met ATTRv, whereas other ATTRv and light-chain amyloidosis often present with large- and small-fiber involvement. Nerve conduction studies, quantitative sudomotor axon testing, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density are useful tools to evaluate denervation. Amyloid deposition can be demonstrated by tissue biopsy of the affected organ or surrogate site, as well as bone-avid radiotracer cardiac imaging. Treatment of light-chain amyloidosis has been revolutionized by monoclonal antibodies and stem cell transplantation with improved 5-year survival up to 77%. Novel gene therapy and transthyretin stabilizers have revolutionized treatment of ATTRv, improving the course of neuropathy (less change in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 from baseline) and quality of life. With great progress in amyloidosis therapies, early diagnosis and presymptomatic testing for ATTRv family members has become paramount. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Knee osteoarthritis affects the performance of daily activities, independence, and quality of life. The etiopathogenesis of this condition considers the mechanisms of activation of metalloproteinase and reactive oxygen species production pathways. Metalloproteinases-3 (MMP-3) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) may be responsible for cartilage destruction. Aquatic physiotherapy promotes a positive impact on the clinical picture of osteoarthritis, and this study presents an intervention protocol that aims to evaluate the effects of a single session of different aquatic physiotherapy modalities on the biochemical and functional behavior of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods This will be a crossover randomized controlled trial in which 15 individuals will be submitted to three aquatic physiotherapy modalities with a minimum 15-day wash-out period in patients over 50 years old and diagnosed with OA in at least one knee, presence of pain and at least one functional dysfunction for at least 6 months, absence of physical limitation that prevents the exercise protocol from being performed, Kellgren and Lawrence ranking between I and IV, walk independently and without auxiliary device. Variations in the concentrations of MMP-3 and GPx in peripheral blood, pain, edema, and flexibility resulting from the three aquatic physiotherapeutic interventions will be evaluated both pre- and immediate post-intervention. The reference group will be submitted to the same aquatic physiotherapy protocols, however, only the biochemical parameters and the self-perception questionnaires will be evaluated.

                Background: Corrective spine surgery is widely accepted for treating severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Postoperative spinal range of motion (ROM) could be affected after such surgery. In certain populations, such as Muslims, this ROM change can impact daily life, as it may affect the five-times-a-day prayer (Salah). This study aims to assess the influence of spinal fusion (SF) in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) during the daily Islamic prayer (Salah). Methods: SF-AIS patients were videoed while performing Salah prayer. The kinematic documentation was assessed and compared to Salah movements of a control group of age-matched Muslim AIS patients, who had not had surgery. The prayer quality changes were subjectively classified into improved, no change/remained, and worsened, according to the Global Perceived Effect (GPE). Functional outcome and pain were assessed by the Scoliosis Research Society Questionnaire Version 30 (SRS-30). Results: Thirty-nine women and five men (mean age±SD: 14.8±2.3 years) met the inclusion criteria, and unoperated AIS patients were used as control (twenty-two women, mean age±SD: 15.32±1.43 years). The prostrations ROM of the SF-AIS group differed significantly from the control group (p<0.05). The GPE of the prayer movement showed improvement in 36.4%, no change in 59.1%, and worsening in 4.5% of the SF-AIS patients. The worsened group had a significantly lower bowing ROM and higher prostrations ROM compared to all groups of prayer quality changes (p<0.05). SRS-30 scores showed good outcomes (function 4.0±0.2, pain 4.2±0.5), along with the overall bowing ROM and prostrations ROM (84.2±12.0° and 53.4±9.6°, respectively). Moreover, a significant moderate positive correlation between the bowing ROM and pain (r=0.417, p=0.007) was also found. Conclusion: Spinal fusion positively affects AIS Islamic patients in maintaining their daily Salah movement, ROM and prayer quality. Prayer quality assessment should be given extra attention as an adjuvant of the SRS-30 questionnaire to evaluate Muslim patients.

                Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common with a global prevalence of 4%. Dietary regimes with a low content of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyol (FODMAP) or a starch- and sucrose-reduced diet (SSRD) have proven to be efficient. The aim of the present study was to describe the recruitment process for a randomized dietary trial with low FODMAP or SSRD for 4 weeks with a follow-up period of 5 months. The results of the dietary trial itself are not included in this paper but will be presented in another publication. Methods The County of Skåne, with 1,41 million inhabitants, was used as a base to perform a dietary trial in which IBS patients, age 18-70 years, were randomized to either low FODMAP or SSRD for 4 weeks. The estimated number of IBS patients in the actual age span was approximately 32,000. The trial was announced through lectures, letters to all primary healthcare centers (n=203), social media (two campaigns), and invitations to IBS patients identified in medical records (n=744). Results Three referrals arrived from the healthcare system, 17 patients contacted the investigators in person after receiving information from their healthcare center, and four patients contacted the investigators after recommendations from friends. Of these, 14 were enrolled in the study. From social media, 218 names were delivered, of which 93 fulfilled the study criteria and were willing to participate when contacted by the investigators (42.7%). Of the 3587 identified IBS patients in medical records in close proximity to the hospital, 744 were randomly contacted. Forty-eight patients (6.5 %) were willing to be included in the study. Thus, 155 patients with IBS were included in this study. Conclusions The inclusion rate for dietary intervention was very low considering the large population informed about the study. Announcements on social media seem to be the best way to recruit patients for intervention. Trial registration NCT05192603, 29/11/2021, ClinicalTrials.gov.

                Background Recent innovations are making radiology more advanced for patient and patient services. Under the immense burden of radiology practice, Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists in obtaining Computed Tomography (CT) images with less scan time, proper patient placement, low radiation dose (RD), and improved image quality (IQ). Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the positioning accuracy, RD, and IQ of AI-based automatic and manual positioning techniques for CT kidney ureters and bladder (CT KUB). Methods This prospective study included 143 patients in each group who were referred for computed tomography (CT) KUB examination. Group 1 patients underwent manual positioning (MP), and group 2 patients underwent AI-based automatic positioning (AP) for CT KUB examination. The scanning protocol was kept constant for both the groups. The off-center distance, RD, and quantitative and qualitative IQ of each group were evaluated and compared. Results The AP group (9.66±6.361 mm) had significantly less patient off-center distance than the MP group (15.12±9.55 mm). There was a significant reduction in RD in the AP group compared with that in the MP group. The quantitative image noise (IN) was lower, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the AP group than in the MP group (p<0.05). Qualitative IQ parameters such as IN, sharpness, and overall IQ also showed significant differences (p< 0.05), with higher scores in the AP group than in the MP group. Conclusions The AI-based AP showed higher positioning accuracy with less off-center distance (44%), which resulted in 12% reduction in RD and improved IQ for CT KUB imaging compared with MP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-889/v2?src=rss">Sapporo: A workflow execution service that encourages the reuse of workflows in various languages in bioinformatics [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The increased demand for efficient computation in data analysis encourages researchers in biomedical science to use workflow systems. Workflow systems, or so-called workflow languages, are used for the description and execution of a set of data analysis steps. Workflow systems increase the productivity of researchers, specifically in fields that use high-throughput DNA sequencing applications, where scalable computation is required. As systems have improved the portability of data analysis workflows, research communities are able to share workflows to reduce the cost of building ordinary analysis procedures. However, having multiple workflow systems in a research field has resulted in the distribution of efforts across different workflow system communities. As each workflow system has its unique characteristics, it is not feasible to learn every single system in order to use publicly shared workflows. Thus, we developed Sapporo, an application to provide a unified layer of workflow execution upon the differences of various workflow systems. Sapporo has two components: an application programming interface (API) that receives the request of a workflow run and a browser-based client for the API. The API follows the Workflow Execution Service API standard proposed by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. The current implementation supports the execution of workflows in four languages: Common Workflow Language, Workflow Description Language, Snakemake, and Nextflow. With its extensible and scalable design, Sapporo can support the research community in utilizing valuable resources for data analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-682/v1?src=rss">Chronic respiratory health symptoms and associated factors among exposed and unexposed residents to cement dust, in Moodubidire, Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka; a comparative cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Exposure to cement dust poses significant risks to respiratory health, particularly among occupational workers. However, the impact of non-occupational cement dust exposure on nearby residents’ pulmonary well-being is often overlooked, particularly in the context of India. This study explores chronic respiratory health symptoms and their predictors in residents exposed to cement dust within a 1 km radius of a cement factory, comparing them with residents residing 5 kms away from the plant. Methods Using a comparative cross-sectional approach, we sampled 542 individuals from both exposed and unexposed communities using a multi-stage sampling technique. In-person interviews were conducted to collect relevant information, and descriptive methods were employed for data analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to identify factors predicting self-reported chronic respiratory symptoms. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to quantify the strength of the relationships. Results The results revealed a notable disparity in respiratory health between the two groups. Approximately 80% of residents within 1 km proximity to the cement industry reported respiratory symptoms, compared to 31% in the more distant community. Exposed residents were significantly more likely to experience respiratory manifestations, with odds ratios ranging from 5.3 kms to 5.4 kms compared to their unexposed counterparts. Conclusions While it was expected that the cement-exposed group would exhibit a higher burden of chronic respiratory symptoms, a surprising finding was that nearly one-third of non-exposed adult residents living in close proximity also reported adverse respiratory symptoms. This highlights the need for informed policies, including regular screening programs for respiratory health among proximate residents, and effective measures to control dust emissions from cement plants. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of addressing respiratory health disparities in both occupational and non-occupational settings related to cement dust exposure.

                Background Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant with strict therapeutic levels, dietary restrictions, and drug interactions that play a significant role in the physical, psychological, and social well-being of clients throughout their lives. Thus, the study aimed to assess the HRQoL of warfarin using clients in a cardiac Centre. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study design was carried out among 270 clients from 10th February to 10th March 2021 in the outpatient department of Manmohan Cardiothoracic, Vascular and Transplant Centre, Nepal. Ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Review Committee, Institute of Medicine (Reference no. 261/2021). A non-probability purposive sampling technique was followed. Data was collected through a structured Interview Schedule by using the WHO QOL-BREF version questionnaire. Variables were coded, entered in EPI-DATA version 3.1, and then transferred to SPSS 16 for descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. Results The mean score for overall quality of life was 55.60±10.25. More than half of the clients (64.8%) had a moderate level of quality of life. The mean scores for the physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains were 47.08±14.39, 56.50±14.35, 64.17±11.50, and 54.65±12.25 respectively. A statistically significant association between age (p=.015), sex (p=.007), socio-economic class (p≤.001), and comorbidities (p=.002) with overall quality of life was observed. Strong positive correlation was observed between physical (r=.768, p≤.001), psychological (r=.794, p≤.001), environmental domain (r=.777, p≤.001) with overall quality of life. Conclusions This study concluded that the warfarin-using clients had moderate mean scores of WHOQOL-BREF. The physical domain was the most compromised one and age, sex, socioeconomic class, and comorbidities in clients were significantly associated with overall quality of life. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an awareness program for healthcare care professionals and family members regarding the physical, psychological, social, and environmental health of warfarin using clients to improve their quality of life.

                Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are aquatic sessile metazoans found worldwide in marine and freshwater environments. They are significant in the animal tree of life as one of the earliest-branching metazoan lineages and as filter feeders play crucial ecological roles, particularly in coral reefs, but are susceptible to the effects of climate change. In the face of the current biodiversity crisis, genomic data is crucial for species conservation efforts and predicting their evolutionary potential in response to environmental changes. However, there is a limited availability of culturable sponge species with annotated high-quality genomes to further comprehensive insights into animal evolution, function, and their response to the ongoing global change. Despite the publication of a few high-quality annotated sponge genomes, there remains a gap in resources for culturable sponge species. To address this gap, we provide high quality draft genomes of the two congeneric aquarium species Tethya wilhelma and Tethya minuta, small ball-shaped demosponges that are easily maintained long-term in ex situ culture. As such, they offer promising opportunities as laboratory models to contribute to advancing our understanding of sponge biology and provide valuable resources for studying animal evolution, function, and responses to environmental challenges.

                Background A variety of disorders are surgically treated with laparoscopy. Its benefits are frequently considered as being less intrusive, giving superior cosmetic outcomes, and needing a shorter hospital stay because they are based on surgical knowledge and cutting-edge technology. However, laparoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia and pneumoperitoneum may result in adverse pulmonary physiological alterations. This study will make choosing between volume control ventilation and pressure control ventilation for patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries under general anaesthesia feasible. Method 82 participants of both male and female gender and of the age between 18 and 70, with 41 in each group, will be randomly allotted with pressure control or volume control ventilation. The hemodynamic parameters and ventilatory parameters will be assessed. Data collection and analysis will be done. Expected outcomes To conclude if volume control ventilation or pressure control ventilation is effective in laparoscopic surgeries and which has less hemodynamic responses and better patient outcomes.

                Background The Africa Capacity Building Initiative (ACBI) programme aimed to ‘strengthen the research and training capacity of higher education institutions and support the development of individual scientists in sub-Saharan Africa through UK-Africa research collaborations’ including by funding PhD studentships. We conducted research to understand students’ experiences and to see how consortia-based programmes such as ACBI and their own institutions can enhance PhD students’ research environment and progress. Methods In-depth interviews with 35 ACBI-funded PhD students explored their perspectives about how their research and personal development benefitted from belonging to a research consortium. Questionnaires were used to corroborate interview findings. Results Students recognised that membership of a research consortium provided many benefits compared to less well-resourced peers. By drawing on the programme and consortiums’ resources, they were often able to overcome some limitations in their own institution’s systems and facilities. Through their consortia they could access a wide range of international expertise and support from mentors and colleagues for their technical and psychosocial needs. Multiple consortia opportunities for engaging with the international scientific community and for networking, gave them confidence and motivation and enhanced their career prospects. Conclusion Our study and its recommendations highlight how the breadth and diversity of resources available to PhD students through research consortia can be harnessed to facilitate students’ progress and to create a supportive and conducive research environment. It also underlines how, through a multi-level approach, consortia can contribute to longer-term improvements in institutional research environments for PhD students.

                Metabolic disorders are highly prevalent in modern society. Exercise mimetics are defined as pharmacological compounds that can produce the beneficial effects of fitness. Recently, there has been increased interest in the role of eugenol and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in improving metabolic health. The aim of this study was to investigate whether eugenol acts as an exercise mimetic by activating TRPV1. Here, we showed that eugenol improved endurance capacity, caused the conversion of fast-to-slow muscle fibers, and promoted white fat browning and lipolysis in mice. Mechanistically, eugenol promoted muscle fiber-type transformation by activating TRPV1-mediated CaN signaling pathway. Subsequently, we identified IL-15 as a myokine that is regulated by the CaN/nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that TRPV1-mediated CaN/NFATc1 signaling, activated by eugenol, controlled IL-15 levels in C2C12 myotubes. Our results suggest that eugenol may act as an exercise mimetic to improve metabolic health via activating the TRPV1-mediated CaN signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93174">Mapping the molecular motions of 5-HT3 serotonin-gated channel by voltage-clamp fluorometry</a></h4>

              
                The serotonin-gated ion channel (5-HT<sub>3</sub>R) mediates excitatory neuronal communication in the gut and the brain. It is the target for setrons, a class of competitive antagonists widely used as antiemetics, and is involved in several neurological diseases. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R in complex with serotonin or setrons revealed that the protein has access to a wide conformational landscape. However, assigning known high-resolution structures to actual states contributing to the physiological response remains a challenge. In the present study, we used voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) to measure simultaneously, for 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R expressed at a cell membrane, conformational changes by fluorescence and channel opening by electrophysiology. Four positions identified by mutational screening report motions around and outside the serotonin-binding site through incorporation of cysteine-tethered rhodamine dyes with or without a nearby quenching tryptophan. VCF recordings show that the 5-HT<sub>3</sub>R has access to four families of conformations endowed with distinct fluorescence signatures: ‘resting-like’ without ligand, ‘inhibited-like’ with setrons, ‘pre-active-like’ with partial agonists, and ‘active-like’ (open channel) with partial and strong agonists. Data are remarkably consistent with cryo-EM structures, the fluorescence partners matching respectively apo, setron-bound, 5-HT bound-closed, and 5-HT-bound-open conformations. Data show that strong agonists promote a concerted motion of all fluorescently labeled sensors during activation, while partial agonists, especially when loss-of-function mutations are engineered, stabilize both active and pre-active conformations. In conclusion, VCF, though the monitoring of electrophysiologically silent conformational changes, illuminates allosteric mechanisms contributing to signal transduction and their differential regulation by important classes of physiological and clinical effectors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85951">Medial anterior prefrontal cortex stimulation downregulates implicit reactions to threats and prevents the return of fear</a></h4>

              
                Downregulating emotional overreactions toward threats is fundamental for developing treatments for anxiety and post-traumatic disorders. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for top-down modulatory processes, and despite previous studies adopting repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over this region provided encouraging results in enhancing extinction, no studies have hitherto explored the effects of stimulating the medial anterior PFC (aPFC, encompassing the Brodmann area 10) on threat memory and generalization. Here we showed that rTMS over the aPFC applied before threat memory retrieval immediately decreases implicit reactions to learned and novel stimuli in humans. These effects enduringly persisted 1 week later in the absence of rTMS. No effects were detected on explicit recognition. Critically, rTMS over the aPFC resulted in a more pronounced reduction of defensive responses compared to rTMS targeting the dorsolateral PFC. These findings reveal a previously unexplored prefrontal region, the modulation of which can efficiently and durably inhibit implicit reactions to learned threats. This represents a significant advancement toward the long-term deactivation of exaggerated responses to threats.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94946">Visuo-motor updating in individuals with heightened autistic traits</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) presents a range of challenges, including heightened sensory sensitivities. Here, we examine the idea that sensory overload in ASD may be linked to issues with efference copy mechanisms, which predict the sensory outcomes of self-generated actions, such as eye movements. Efference copies play a vital role in maintaining visual and motor stability. Disrupted efference copies hinder precise predictions, leading to increased reliance on actual feedback and potential distortions in perceptions across eye movements. In our first experiment, we tested how well healthy individuals with varying levels of autistic traits updated their mental map after making eye movements. We found that those with more autistic traits had difficulty using information from their eye movements to update the spatial representation of their mental map, resulting in significant errors in object localization. In the second experiment, we looked at how participants perceived an object displacement after making eye movements. Using a trans-saccadic spatial updating task, we found that those with higher autism scores exhibited a greater bias, indicating under-compensation of eye movements and a failure to maintain spatial stability during saccades. Overall, our study underscores efference copy’s vital role in visuo-motor stability, aligning with Bayesian theories of autism, potentially informing interventions for improved action–perception integration in autism.

                Examination of bacteria/host cell interactions is important for understanding the aetiology of many infectious diseases. The colony forming unit (CFU) has been the standard for quantifying bacterial burden for the past century, however, this suffers from low sensitivity and is dependent on bacterial culturability in vitro. Our data demonstrate the discrepancy between the CFU and bacterial genome copy number in an osteomyelitis-relevant co-culture system and we confirm diagnosis and quantify bacterial load in clinical bone specimens. This study provides an improved workflow for the quantification of bacterial burden in such cases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91506">The αC-β4 loop controls the allosteric cooperativity between nucleotide and substrate in the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A</a></h4>

              
                Allosteric cooperativity between ATP and substrates is a prominent characteristic of the cAMP-dependent catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C). This long-range synergistic action is involved in substrate recognition and fidelity, and it may also regulate PKA’s association with regulatory subunits and other binding partners. To date, a complete understanding of this intramolecular mechanism is still lacking. Here, we integrated NMR(Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)-restrained molecular dynamics simulations and a Markov State Model to characterize the free energy landscape and conformational transitions of PKA-C. We found that the apoenzyme populates a broad free energy basin featuring a conformational ensemble of the active state of PKA-C (ground state) and other basins with lower populations (excited states). The first excited state corresponds to a previously characterized inactive state of PKA-C with the αC helix swinging outward. The second excited state displays a disrupted hydrophobic packing around the regulatory (R) spine, with a flipped configuration of the F100 and F102 residues at the αC-β4 loop. We validated the second excited state by analyzing the F100A mutant of PKA-C, assessing its structural response to ATP and substrate binding. While PKA-C<sup>F100A</sup> preserves its catalytic efficiency with Kemptide, this mutation rearranges the αC-β4 loop conformation, interrupting the coupling of the two lobes and abolishing the allosteric binding cooperativity. The highly conserved αC-β4 loop emerges as a pivotal element to control the synergistic binding of nucleotide and substrate, explaining how mutations or insertions near or within this motif affect the function and drug sensitivity in homologous kinases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90459">Discovering non-additive heritability using additive GWAS summary statistics</a></h4>

              
                LD score regression (LDSC) is a method to estimate narrow-sense heritability from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics alone, making it a fast and popular approach. In this work, we present interaction-LD score (i-LDSC) regression: an extension of the original LDSC framework that accounts for interactions between genetic variants. By studying a wide range of generative models in simulations, and by re-analyzing 25 well-studied quantitative phenotypes from 349,468 individuals in the UK Biobank and up to 159,095 individuals in BioBank Japan, we show that the inclusion of a <i>cis</i>-interaction score (i.e. interactions between a focal variant and proximal variants) recovers genetic variance that is not captured by LDSC. For each of the 25 traits analyzed in the UK Biobank and BioBank Japan, i-LDSC detects additional variation contributed by genetic interactions. The i-LDSC software and its application to these biobanks represent a step towards resolving further genetic contributions of sources of non-additive genetic effects to complex trait variation.

	<p>Cysteamine hydrochloride (Cys-HCl) has been established as a potent ulcerogenic agent of the gastrointestinal (GI) system. GI dysfunction and olfactory deficits are the most common clinical symptoms of many movement disorders, including Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Cys-HCl has been shown to interfere with dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for motor, olfactory, and cognitive functions. However, the reports on the effect of Cys-HCl treatment on the behavioral aspects and functions of the dopamine system appear to be inconsistent. Therefore, we revisited the impact of Cys-HCl on the motor function in experimental mice using a battery of behavioral tests, such as the pole test (PT), beam-walking test (BWT), and rotarod test (RDT), while the olfactory ability and cognitive functions were examined through the buried-food test (BFT) and Y-maze test. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of Cys-HCl on the number of dopaminergic tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the substantia nigra (SN) and olfactory bulb (OB) of the experimental mice using immunohistochemistry. The results revealed that Cys-HCl administration in the mice induced significant impairments in their motor balance and coordination, as their movement-related performances were markedly reduced in terms of the behavioral tasks. Mice exposed to Cys-HCl showed pronounced reductions in their odor discrimination abilities as well as cognitive impairments. Strikingly, the number of TH-positive neurons was found to be reduced in the SN and OB of the Cys-HCl-treated group, which is a bonafide neuropathogenic hallmark of PD. This study highlights the potential neurotoxic effects of Cys-HCl in experimental brains and suggests further investigation into its role in the pathogenesis of Parkinsonism.</p>

	<p>Spasticity is a very common sign in the neurological field. It can be defined as &amp;amp;ldquo;a motor disorder marked by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone or tonic stretch reflexes&amp;amp;rdquo; associated with hypertonia. It leads to a high risk of limb deformities and pain that prejudices residual motor function, impairing quality of life&amp;amp;rdquo;. The treatment of spasticity depends on its severity and its location and, in general, it is based on rehabilitation, oral therapies (the gamma-aminobutyric acid b agonist baclofen) and injectable medications (i.e., botulin toxins, acting on polysynaptic reflex mechanisms). The botulin toxin type A (BoNT-A) injection has been effectively used to improve different types of spasticity. However, when BoNT-A is not sufficient, a combination of nonpharmacological approaches could be attempted. Therefore, additional intervention, such as conventional physical therapy by itself or further combined with robotic gait training, may be needed. Indeed, it has been shown that combination of BoNT-A and robotics has a positive effect on activity level and upper limb function in patients with stroke, including those in the chronic phase. The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatment in combination with BoNT-A injections on spasticity. The combined therapy of BoNT with conventional or adjunct activities or robot-assisted training, especially with end-effectors, is a valid tool to improve patients&amp;amp;rsquo; performance and outcomes. The combined strategies might rise the toxin&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect, lowering its dosages of botulinum and reducing side effects and costs.</p>

	<p>MANAGE-PD is a validated, web-based tool to assist physicians in identifying patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) whose symptoms are inadequately controlled by oral medication. Also, a modified patient version of MANAGE-PD (Parkinson Check) is available in Germany. However, prospective research into the clinical utility of MANAGE-PD is lacking. This non-interventional study aimed to assess the real-world clinical utility of the MANAGE-PD and Parkinson Check in PD patients attending a single visit at specialist clinics and neurologist practices in Germany in 2022. Participants&amp;amp;rsquo; disease control was rated by the physicians using their own judgment, and by completing the MANAGE-PD, and by the patients completing the Parkinson Check. Concordance was calculated between the unassisted physician&amp;amp;rsquo;s assessment and the outcome of MANAGE-PD, as well as the Parkinson Check. A total of 278 patients from 19 sites were included in the analyses, of whom 160 patients (57.6%) were assigned to the same category of disease control by physicians&amp;amp;rsquo; judgment and the MANAGE-PD. Concordance was higher in patients treated in specialist clinics (63.9%) than in neurologist practices (43.7%). Concordance between physicians&amp;amp;rsquo; and patients&amp;amp;rsquo; responses was high (&amp;amp;gt;80%) for each question in the Parkinson Check. MANAGE-PD proved to be especially valuable for general neurologists in identifying patients who should be referred to specialist clinics. The Parkinson Check self-assessment generated promising outcomes that merit its more widespread use.</p>

	<p>Counseling can help alleviate tinnitus-caused emotional distress and correct misconceptions, making it an effective rehabilitation option for people with tinnitus. Advances in communication technology have increased the demand for computer-mediated tinnitus counseling; however, the effectiveness of such counseling in reducing tinnitus is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to determine the tinnitus-relieving effects of computer-mediated counseling. Thirty-six participants with tinnitus were randomly assigned to online counseling (15 participants) or video-based counseling (21 participants) groups, defining how remote counseling was conducted. Tinnitus counseling, comprising 100 items, lasted 2 weeks and was separated into six sessions for the online counseling group and 8&amp;amp;ndash;9 items daily for 12 days for the video-based counseling group. The effectiveness of counseling was determined based on score changes between baseline and 2-week follow-up using the Korean version of the Tinnitus Primary Function Questionnaire and Visual Analog Scales for annoyance and loudness. While no significant improvements were observed in other domains, average emotional aspect-related scores showed significant improvements in both groups. Regarding individual results, four and seven participants in the online and video-based counseling groups reported significant improvements in the emotional domain, respectively. Overall, computer-mediated educational counseling might be a rehabilitation option for individuals with tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Background: Technological advancements have been rapidly integrated within the neurosurgical education track since it is a high-risk specialty with little margin for error. Indeed, simulation and virtual reality during training can improve surgical performance and technical skills. Our study aims to investigate the impact of neurosurgical technology-based simulation activities on medical students. Methods and Materials: The &amp;amp;ldquo;Suturing Mission&amp;amp;ndash;The Symposium&amp;amp;rdquo; was a three-day event held at Humanitas University. Participants had access to live-streamed conferences held by worldwide experts in several fields of neurosurgery and practical simulations of dura mater sutures, microvascular anastomosis, and augmented reality neurosurgical approaches. An anonymous survey was conducted at the beginning and end of the event. Results: 141 medical students with a mean age of 21 participated. After the course, 110 participants (77.5%) showed interest in pursuing a surgical path, with a great prevalence in those who had planned to have a surgical career before the event (88.7% vs. 41.4%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Participants were also asked about their comfort levels while handling surgical instruments, and a good outcome was reached in 72.7% of participants, with a significant difference between those who had previously attended a suture course (87.8% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.012). Conclusion: Training sessions on surgical simulators were effective in increasing participants&amp;amp;rsquo; interest in pursuing a surgical path, improving their understanding of postgraduate orientation, and boosting their confidence with surgical instruments.</p>

	<p>The pervasive sedentary lifestyle exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced physical activity (PA) among school-age children, necessitating innovative strategies to evaluate short PA breaks that are feasible in a classroom setting. This study explored the cognitive and neurophysiological (electroencephalography; EEG) impacts of short bouts of different PA modalities on inhibitory control (flanker task) and episodic memory (word recognition task) in children. Utilizing a within-participants cross-over design, thirty-six children (n = 36; 9&amp;amp;ndash;12 years old) attended the lab on three separate days with each visit including either a 9 min bout of sustained moderate-intensity cycling, high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), or seated rest. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were assessed during the flanker task (P3 component) and the word recognition task (LPC and FN400 components) to elucidate the neural mechanisms underpinning behavioral outcomes. Findings indicated no differences in flanker performance but greater episodic memory recall for HIIE compared to seated rest. Neurophysiological results revealed no differences for P3, but notably larger amplitude for LPC and FN400 postcycling, particularly over parietal electrode sites. These results underscore the potential of short PA breaks to improve cognitive and neurocognitive function in children, offering a feasible integration strategy into daily school routines without extensive time commitment.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neurometabolic disease with an increasing incidence. The pathophysiology is unknown, but improvement of diagnosis and management requires discovery of novel biomarkers. Our objective was to identify such candidate biomarkers in IIH, and secondarily, test for associations between identified metabolites and disease severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a prospective case–control study with collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, and clinical data from new-onset, treatment-naïve patients with IIH (n = 60). Patients were included consecutively from 2 tertiary headache centers in Denmark, and age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) -matched healthy controls (n = 35) were recruited. Clinical data were retrieved at ocular remission (n = 55). Samples were analyzed using non-targeted mass spectrometry.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Serum sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), adenosine, and glutamate were 0.46-fold (q &lt; 0.0001), 0.25-fold (q = 0.0048), and 0.44-fold (q &lt; 0.0001) lower, respectively, in IIH. CSF stearoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC-18) and 2-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC-16) were 0.42 (q = 0.0025) and 0.37 (q &lt; 0.001) -fold lower. LysoPC-18 was higher in patients with moderate–severe versus mild papilledema (<i>p</i> = 0.022). LysoPC-18 correlated positively with retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (<i>p</i> = 0.0012, r = 0.42) and inversely with mean deviation on automated perimetry (<i>p</i> = 0.01, r = −0.35). Higher baseline serum S1P (<i>p</i> = 0.018) and lower CSF LysoPC-16 (<i>p</i> = 0.003) were associated with optic nerve atrophy at ocular remission. Pathway analysis suggests dysregulated lipid metabolism and redox disturbances in new-onset IIH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identify perturbed metabolism in new-onset IIH. S1P and LysoPC-16 demonstrate potential prognostic value due to association with subsequent optic nerve atrophy. This association between specific, differential metabolites and outcome provides substantial evidence for novel biomarkers of clinical significance that should be the focus of further targeted studies.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogens are believed to modulate cognitive functions in part through the modulation of synaptic transmission in the cortex and hippocampus. Administration of 17β-estradiol (E2) can rapidly enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and facilitate excitatory synaptic transmission in rat lateral entorhinal cortex via activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1). To assess the mechanisms through which GPER1 activation facilitates synaptic transmission, we assessed the effects of acute 10 nM E2 administration on pharmacologically isolated evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in layer II/III entorhinal neurons. Female Long-Evans rats were ovariectomized between postnatal day (PD) 63 and 74 and implanted with a subdermal E2 capsule to maintain continuous low levels of E2. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained between 7 and 20 days after ovariectomy. Application of E2 for 20 min did not significantly affect AMPA or NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic currents. However, GABA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents (IPSCs) were markedly reduced by E2 and returned towards baseline levels during the 20-min washout period. The inhibition of GABA-mediated IPSCs was blocked in the presence of the GPER1 receptor antagonist G15. GPER1 can modulate protein kinase A (PKA), but blocking PKA with intracellular KT5720 did not prevent the E2-induced reduction in IPSCs. GPER1 can also stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a negative modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and blocking activation of ERK with PD90859 prevented the E2-induced reduction of IPSCs. E2 can therefore result in a rapid GPER1 and ERK signaling-mediated reduction in GABA-mediated IPSCs. This provides a novel mechanism through which E2 can rapidly modulate synaptic excitability in entorhinal layer II/III neurons and may also contribute to E2 and ERK-dependent alterations in synaptic transmission in other brain areas.</p>

	<p>Imbalance and falls in patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) do not only reduce their quality of life but also their life expectancy. Aging-related symptoms as well as disease-specific motor and non-motor symptoms contribute to these conditions and should be treated when appropriate. In addition to an active lifestyle, advanced exercise training is useful and effective, especially for less medically responsive symptoms such as freezing of gait and postural instability at advanced stages. As treadmill training in non-immersive virtual reality, including dual tasks, significantly reduced the number of falls in PD patients, the mechanism(s) explaining this effect should be further investigated. Such research could help to select the most suitable patients and develop the most effective training protocols based on this novel technology. Real-life digital surrogate markers of mobility, such as those describing aspects of endurance, performance, and the complexity of specific movements, can further improve the quality of mobility assessment using wearables.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0108-24.2024?rss=1">Early-Stage Alzheimer's Disease Affects Fast But Not Slow Adaptive Processes in Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an initial decline in declarative memory, while nondeclarative memory processing remains relatively intact. Error-based motor adaptation is traditionally seen as a form of nondeclarative memory, but recent findings suggest that it involves both fast, declarative, and slow, nondeclarative adaptive processes. If the declarative memory system shares resources with the fast process in motor adaptation, it can be hypothesized that the fast, but not the slow, process is disturbed in AD patients. To test this, we studied 20 early-stage AD patients and 21 age-matched controls of both sexes using a reach adaptation paradigm that relies on spontaneous recovery after sequential exposure to opposing force fields. Adaptation was measured using error clamps and expressed as an adaptation index (AI). Although patients with AD showed slightly lower adaptation to the force field than the controls, both groups demonstrated effects of spontaneous recovery. The time course of the AI was fitted by a hierarchical Bayesian two-state model in which each dynamic state is characterized by a retention and learning rate. Compared to controls, the retention rate of the fast process was the only parameter that was significantly different (lower) in the AD patients, confirming that the memory of the declarative, fast process is disturbed by AD. The slow adaptive process was virtually unaffected. Since the slow process learns only weakly from an error, our results provide neurocomputational evidence for the clinical practice of errorless learning of everyday tasks in people with dementia.</p>

Here, we combined optogenetics, retrograde labeling, and electrophysiology to characterize the synaptic connections between M1 and layer 5 (L5) intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in S1 of mice (both sexes). We found that M1 synapses onto IT cells displayed modest short-term depression, whereas synapses onto PT neurons showed robust short-term facilitation. Despite M1 inputs to IT cells depressing, their slower kinetics resulted in summation and a response that increased during short trains. In contrast, summation was minimal in PT neurons due to the fast time course of their M1 responses. The functional consequences of this reduced summation, however, were outweighed by the strong facilitation at these M1 synapses, resulting in larger response amplitudes in PT neurons than IT cells during repetitive stimulation. To understand the impact of facilitating M1 inputs on PT output, we paired trains of inputs with single backpropagating action potentials, finding that repetitive M1 activation increased the probability of bursts in PT cells without impacting the time dependence of this coupling. Thus, there are two parallel but dynamically distinct systems of M1 synaptic excitation in L5 of S1, each defined by the short-term dynamics of its synapses, the class of postsynaptic neurons, and how the neurons respond to those inputs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-674/v1?src=rss">The gamma-band activity model of the near-death experience: a critique and a reinterpretation. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Near-death experience (NDE) is a transcendent mental event of uncertain etiology that arises on the cusp of biological death. Since the discovery of NDE in the mid-1970s, multiple neuroscientific theories have been developed in an attempt to account for it in strictly materialistic or reductionistic terms. Therefore, in this conception, NDE is at most an extraordinary hallucination without any otherworldly, spiritual, or supernatural denotations. During the last decade or so, a number of animal and clinical studies have emerged which reported that about the time of death, there may be a surge of high frequency electroencephalogram (EEG) at a time when cortical electrical activity is otherwise at a very low ebb. This oscillatory rhythm falls within the range of the enigmatic brain wave-labelled gamma-band activity (GBA). Therefore, it has been proposed that this brief, paradoxical, and perimortem burst of the GBA may represent the neural foundation of the NDE. This study examines three separate but related questions concerning this phenomenon. The first problem pertains to the electrogenesis of standard GBA and the extent to which authentic cerebral activity has been contaminated by myogenic artifacts. The second problem involves the question of whether agents that can mimic NDE are also underlain by GBA. The third question concerns the electrogenesis of the surge in GBA itself. It has been contended that this is neither cortical nor myogenic in origin. Rather, it arises in a subcortical (amygdaloid) location but is recorded at the cortex via volume conduction, thereby mimicking standard GBA. Although this surge of GBA contains genuine electrophysiological activity and is an intriguing and provocative finding, there is little evidence to suggest that it could act as a kind of neurobiological skeleton for a phenomenon such as NDE.
