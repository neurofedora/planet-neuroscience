              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01201">Psychoacoustic study of simple-tone dyads: frequency ratio and pitch</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how listeners perceive consonance and dissonance in dyads composed of simple (sine) tones, focusing on the effects of frequency ratio ($R$) and mean frequency ($F$). Seventy adult participants - categorized by musical training, gender, and age group - rated randomly ordered dyads using binary preference responses (``like'' or ``dislike''). Dyads represented standard Western intervals but were constructed with sine tones rather than musical notes, preserving interval ratios while varying absolute pitch. Statistical analyses reveal a consistent decrease in preference with increasing mean frequency, regardless of interval class or participant group. Octaves, fifths, fourths, and sixths showed a nearly linear decline in preference with increasing $F$. Major seconds were among the least preferred. Musicians rated octaves and certain consonant intervals more positively than non-musicians, while gender and age groups exhibited different sensitivity to high frequencies. The findings suggest that both interval structure and pitch range shape the perception of consonance in simple-tone dyads, with possible psychoacoustic explanations involving frequency sensitivity and auditory fatigue at higher frequencies.

                arXiv:2510.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neural coding is yet to be discovered. The neuronal operational modes that arise with fixed inputs but with varying degrees of stimulation help to elucidate their coding properties. In neurons receiving in vivo stimulation, we show that two operation modes can be described with simplified models: the coincidence detection mode and the integration mode. Our derivations include a simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients betam that captures the subthreshold dynamics of these modes of operation. The resulting model can explain these transitions with the sign and size of the smallest nonlinear coefficient of the polynomial alone. Defining neuronal operational modes provides insight into the processing and transmission of information through electrical currents. Requisite operational modes for proper neuronal functioning may explain disorders involving dysfunction of electrophysiological behavior, such as channelopathies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01502">Aligning Video Models with Human Social Judgments via Behavior-Guided Fine-Tuning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity structure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on 250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning shapes video representations toward human social perception.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01753">Promoting arm movement practice with a novel wheelchair armrest early after stroke: A randomized controlled trial</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic upper extremity (UE) impairment is common after stroke. This study evaluated Boost, a novel wheelchair-mounted rehabilitation device designed to assist individuals in UE motor recovery during inpatient rehabilitation. Thirty-five stroke inpatients were randomized to perform additional UE exercises alongside standard therapy, using either Boost or a therapist-customized booklet for self-practice. Outcomes included the UE Fugl-Meyer (UEFM) Exam, Box and Block Test, Motor Activity Log, Modified Ashworth Scale, shoulder subluxation, and shoulder pain. At baseline, mean days post-stroke were 11.9$\pm$4.6 and 13.1$\pm$5.9, and UEFM scores were 20.5$\pm$10.1 and 21.0$\pm$13.5. Intervention durations averaged 11.9$\pm$4.0 and 17.2$\pm$8.8 days, respectively. Participants in the Boost group completed 3,359$\pm$3,137 additional arm movements. No significant between-group differences were found at the three-month follow-up. However, the Boost group showed a trend toward greater UEFM improvement immediately post-intervention (11.8 vs. 6.9 points, p=0.06). Importantly, UEFM gains were predicted by the number of Boost exercises performed (p=0.02, R-square=0.34). Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with less severe impairment (baseline UEFM >21) achieved significantly greater UEFM improvements at discharge with Boost compared to controls (15.8 vs. 7.8 points, p=0.01). These findings demonstrate the feasibility of achieving thousands of additional UE practice movements while seated in a wheelchair without direct supervision during subacute rehabilitation. The added movement practice was well tolerated and may offer short-term impairment-reduction benefits, particularly in those with less severe impairment. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy, establish optimal dosage, and determine long-term clinical and functional benefits of Boost-assisted therapy.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01864">A Modular Theory of Subjective Consciousness for Natural and Artificial Minds</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.01864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how subjective experience arises from information processing remains a central challenge in neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI research. The Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) proposes a biologically grounded and computationally explicit framework in which consciousness is a discrete sequence of Integrated Informational States (IISs). Each IIS is a packet of integrated information tagged with a multidimensional density vector that quantifies informational richness. Its magnitude correlates with subjective intensity, shaping memory, behavior, and continuity of experience. Inputs from body and environment are adaptively filtered, processed by modules (abstraction, narration, evaluation, self-evaluation), and integrated into an IIS. The resulting packet, tagged with its density vector, is transmitted to behavioral readiness, memory, and decision-making modules, closing the loop. This explains why strongly tagged states exert greater influence on long-term memory and action. Unlike Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory, or Higher-Order Thought, MCT specifies a full computational pipeline producing discrete informational units with quantifiable internal structure. Subjectivity is reframed as a correlate of the density-tagging signal with functional consequences. MCT generates testable predictions, such as stress enhancing memory encoding, and provides a naturalistic blueprint for both biological and artificial architectures. Consciousness, in this view, is not an irreducible essence but an evolvable, quantifiable, and constructible feature of complex information processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02182">Uncovering Semantic Selectivity of Latent Groups in Higher Visual Cortex with Mutual Information-Guided Diffusion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations. This leaves open a scientific question: "how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas, and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces." To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information (MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our understanding of its encoding principles.

                arXiv:2510.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning. Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks. This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid compositional meta-learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01986">Reducing Discomfort in Driving Simulators: Motion Cueing for Motion Sickness Mitigation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.01986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving simulators are increasingly used in research and development. However, simulators often cause motion sickness due to downscaled motion and unscaled veridical visuals. In this paper, a motion cueing algorithm is proposed that reduces motion sickness as predicted by the subjective vertical conflict (SVC) model using model predictive control (MPC). Both sensory conflict and specific force errors are penalised in the cost function, allowing the algorithm to jointly optimise fidelity and comfort.
  Human-in-the-loop experiments were conducted to compare four simulator motion settings: two variations of our MPC-based algorithm, one focused on pure specific force tracking and the second compromising specific force tracking and motion sickness minimisation, as well as reference adaptive washout and no motion cases. The experiments were performed on a hexapod driving simulator with participants exposed to passive driving.
  Experimental motion sickness results closely matched the sickness model predictions. As predicted by the model, the no motion condition yielded the lowest sickness levels. However, it was rated lowest in terms of fidelity. The compromise solution reduced sickness by over 50% (average MISC level 3 to 1.5) compared to adaptive washout and the algorithm focusing on specific force tracking, without any significant reduction in fidelity rating.
  The proposed approach for developing MCA that takes into account both the simulator dynamics and time evolution of motion sickness offers a significant advancement in achieving an optimal control of motion sickness and specific force recreation in driving simulators, supporting broader simulator use.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15440">State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating the steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased coupling-related entropy flow per spike during task engagement, suggesting economical computation in the higher-performing mice. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20378">Hyperbolic embedding of multilayer networks</a></h4>

Abstract: Multilayer networks offer a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across diverse domains, effectively capturing multiple types of connections and interdependent subsystems commonly found in real world scenarios. To analyze these networks, embedding techniques that project nodes into a lower-dimensional geometric space are essential. This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic embedding framework that advances the state of the art in multilayer network analysis. Our method, which supports heterogeneous node sets across networks and inter-layer connections, generates layer-specific hyperbolic embeddings, enabling detailed intra-layer analysis and inter-layer comparisons, while simultaneously preserving the global multilayer structure within hyperbolic space, a capability that sets it apart from existing approaches, which typically rely on independent embedding of layers. Through experiments on synthetic multilayer stochastic block models, we demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves community structure, even when layers consist of different node sets. When applied to real brain networks, the method successfully clusters disease-related brain regions from different patients, outperforming layer-independent approaches and highlighting its relevance for comparative analysis. Overall, this work provides a robust tool for multilayer network analysis, enhancing interpretability and offering new insights into the structure and function of complex systems.

                arXiv:2506.15190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animals flexibly recombine a finite set of core motor motifs to meet diverse task demands, but existing behavior segmentation methods oversimplify this process by imposing discrete syllables under restrictive generative assumptions. To better capture the continuous structure of behavior generation, we introduce motif-based continuous dynamics (MCD) discovery, a framework that (1) uncovers interpretable motif sets as latent basis functions of behavior by leveraging representations of behavioral transition structure, and (2) models behavioral dynamics as continuously evolving mixtures of these motifs. We validate MCD on a multi-task gridworld, a labyrinth navigation task, and freely moving animal behavior. Across settings, it identifies reusable motif components, captures continuous compositional dynamics, and generates realistic trajectories beyond the capabilities of traditional discrete segmentation models. By providing a generative account of how complex animal behaviors emerge from dynamic combinations of fundamental motor motifs, our approach advances the quantitative study of natural behavior.

                arXiv:2510.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC) extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core, VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.

                arXiv:2510.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing computational and memory demands of large language models (LLMs) necessitate innovative approaches to optimize resource usage without compromising performance. This paper leverages microscaling floating-point formats, a novel technique designed to address these challenges by reducing the storage and computational overhead associated with numerical representations in LLMs. Unlike traditional floating-point representations that allocate a dedicated scale for each value, microscaling employs a shared scale across a block of values, enabling compact one-byte floating-point representations while maintaining an extended dynamic range. We explore the application of microscaling in the context of 8-bit floating-point formats to significantly reduce memory footprint and computational costs. We tested several configurations of microscaling floats within the GPT-2 LLM architecture, demonstrating that microscaling data formats can achieve competitive accuracy during training and inference, proving its efficacy as a resource-efficient alternative for deploying LLMs at scale.

                arXiv:2510.01350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristive crossbar arrays enable in-memory computing by performing parallel analog computations directly within memory, making them well-suited for machine learning, neural networks, and neuromorphic systems. However, despite their advantages, non-volatile memristors are vulnerable to security threats (such as adversarial extraction of stored weights when the hardware is compromised. Protecting these weights is essential since they represent valuable intellectual property resulting from lengthy and costly training processes using large, often proprietary, datasets. As a solution we propose two security mechanisms: Keyed Permutor and Watermark Protection Columns; where both safeguard critical weights and establish verifiable ownership (even in cases of data leakage). Our approach integrates efficiently with existing memristive crossbar architectures without significant design modifications. Simulations across 45nm, 22nm, and 7nm CMOS nodes, using a realistic interconnect model and a large RF dataset, show that both mechanisms offer robust protection with under 10% overhead in area, delay and power. We also present initial experiments employing the widely known MNIST dataset; further highlighting the feasibility of securing memristive in-memory computing systems with minimal performance trade-offs.

                arXiv:2510.02099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector-Matrix Multiplication (VMM) is the fundamental and frequently required computation in inference of Neural Networks (NN). Due to the large data movement required during inference, VMM can benefit greatly from in-memory computing. However, ADC/DACs required for in-memory VMM consume significant power and area. `Distributed Arithmetic (DA)', a technique in computer architecture prevalent in 1980s was used to achieve inner product or dot product of two vectors without using a hard-wired multiplier when one of the vectors is a constant. In this work, we extend the DA technique to multiply an input vector with a constant matrix. By storing the sum of the weights in memory, DA achieves VMM using shift-and-add circuits in the periphery of ReRAM memory. We verify functional and also estimate non-functional properties (latency, energy, area) by performing transistor-level simulations. Using energy-efficient sensing and fine grained pipelining, our approach achieves 4.5 x less latency and 12 x less energy than VMM performed in memory conventionally by bit slicing. Furthermore, DA completely eliminated the need for power-hungry ADCs which are the main source of area and energy consumption in the current VMM implementations in memory.

                arXiv:2509.21369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing use of electric vehicles (EVs) has made it even more important to manage the charging infrastructure sustainably. The expansion of charging station networks, especially in large cities, creates serious logistical challenges for charging point operators (CPOs) in planning maintenance and repair activities. Inefficient field personnel management can lead to time loss, high operational costs, and resource waste. This study presents an integrated method to optimize the planning of EV charging network maintenance operations. The proposed approach groups charging stations according to geographical proximity using the K-means clustering algorithm and calculates the shortest routes between clusters using a genetic algorithm. The method was developed in Python and applied to a dataset consisting of 100 EV charging stations in Istanbul.
  Considering the population density, traffic density, and resource constraints of Istanbul, the route planning approach presented in this study has great potential, especially for such metropolises. According to the different parameter configurations tested, the most efficient scenario provided approximately 35\% distance savings compared to the reference route created according to the sequential data layout. While the reference route provides a simple comparison, the study presents a solution that will enable field operations in metropolitan cities such as Istanbul to be conducted in a more efficient, planned and scalable manner. In future studies, it is planned to integrate real-time factors such as traffic conditions and field technician constraints.

                arXiv:2405.17506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency of neural network inference is undeniably important in a time where commercial use of AI models increases daily. Node pruning is the art of removing computational units such as neurons, filters, attention heads, or even entire layers to significantly reduce inference time while retaining network performance. In this work, we propose the projection of unit activations to an orthogonal subspace in which there is no redundant activity and within which we may prune nodes while simultaneously recovering the impact of lost units via linear least squares. We furthermore show that the order in which units are orthogonalized can be optimized to maximally rank units by their redundancy. Finally, we leverage these orthogonal subspaces to automatically determine layer-wise pruning ratios based upon the relative scale of node activations in our subspace, equivalent to cumulative variance. Our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art pruning results on ImageNet-trained VGG-16, ResNet-50 and DeiT models while simultaneously having up to 24x lower computational cost than alternative methods. We also demonstrate that this method can be applied in a one-shot manner to OPT LLM models, again outperforming competing methods.

                arXiv:2411.19209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks are neuromorphic systems that emulate certain aspects of biological neurons, offering potential advantages in energy efficiency and speed by for example leveraging sparsity. While CMOS-based electronic SNN hardware has shown promise, scalability and parallelism challenges remain. Photonics provides a promising platform for SNNs due to the speed of excitable photonic devices standing in as neurons and the parallelism and low-latency of optical signal conduction. Here, we present a photonic SNN comprising 40,000 neurons using off-the-shelf components, including a spatial light modulator and a CMOS camera, enabling scalable and cost-effective implementations for photonic SNN proof of concept studies. The system is governed by a modified Ikeda map, were adding additional inhibitory feedback forcing introduces excitability akin to biological dynamics. Using latency encoding and sparsity, the network achieves 83.5% accuracy on MNIST using 22% of neurons, and 77.5% with 8.5% neuron utilization. Training is performed via liquid state machine concepts combined with the hardware-compatible SPSA algorithm, marking its first use in photonic neural networks. This demonstration integrates photonic nonlinearity, excitability, and sparse computation, paving the way for efficient large-scale photonic neuromorphic systems.

                arXiv:2509.16215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for discovering loops in programming code according to their potential for parallelization. Two genetic algorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of code: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous loops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the loop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and preprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were implemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a robust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of both models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance, but the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset sizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the identification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool for software optimization and performance improvement.

                Autism spectrum disorders are diseases characterized by a combination of cognitive, behavioral and neurological symptoms. A complex interplay between environmental factors and a multitude of genetic determinants, most of them composed of low-risk variants, impose difficulties in understanding the molecular and cellular underpinnings of these conditions. In some cases, autistic patients have been shown to display alterations in splicing patterns of several genes, but the extent to which this phenomenon is common in the context of these multifactorial disorders is unknown, nor is it known if monogenic cases of autism also display dysregulation of splicing. Moreover, very few studies have investigated the causal links between splicing alterations in specific genes and the phenotypic characteristics of the neural tissue in autism patients. In this study, we have focused on a monogenic type of autism caused by haploinsufficiency of the Transcription Factor 4 gene, known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome. We show that neurons and organoids derived from patients with this disease have altered expression of splicing regulators in the NOVA and RBFOX families, accompanied by aberrant splicing patterns in a substantial number of genes involved in neural tissue development and synapse organization. We focused on a gene encoding a member of the Neurexin Family, the splicing of which normally leads to the production of transcript variants coding for both transmembrane and secreted protein isoforms. In Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome neurons, we detected an aberrant splicing pattern that results in lower expression of the transcript that encodes the secreted isoform, a phenomenon that may explain why the neural tissue in these patients have decreased electrical activity through impaired synapse organization. Our data shed light on the role splicing regulation plays in a monogenic type of autism.

">Minor Cannabinoids CBD, CBG, CBN and CBC differentially modulate sensory neuron activation</a></h4>

              
                The use of minor cannabinoids has been advanced, in part, by the idea of providing relief from pain and inflammation without the burden of unwanted psychogenic effects associated with {Delta}9THC. In this regard, investigators have focused on the effects of minor cannabinoid activation / desensitization of peripheral sensory neurons on nociceptive signaling and/or peripheral inflammation. With a focus on peripheral nociception, four common minor cannabinoids: cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabichromene (CBC) were studied in primary cultures of mouse Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons. We queried if calcium responses induced by the four cannabinoids differed in potency of activation, neuronal size preference, and dose-response relationships. Additionally, we determined the dependence of CBD and CBN on key channel-receptors that are known to mediate pain and/or antinociception. Individually, CBD, CBG and CBC directed greater response magnitudes when compared to CBN. All four minor cannabinoids activated overlapping but distinct size populations of sensory neurons. CBD and CBG activated the widest range of DRG neuron sizes (smaller-larger) overlapping with smaller capsaicin-sensitive neurons. In contrast, CBN and CBC activated predominantly larger sensory neurons. CBD diverged from other minor cannabinoids in directing a linear dose-response profile whereas CBG and CBC directed sigmoidal dose-response profiles and CBN activated DRG neurons with an inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship. CBD-induced activation of DRG neurons was dependent on co-expression of the nociceptive channel TRPV1 plus cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R), whereas CBN-induced activation was independent of TRPV1. Overall, we observed that minor cannabinoids CBD, CBG, CBN and CBC differed in their activation of DRG neurons and directed unique activation properties across a diverse population of sensory neurons. Such differences underly the hypothesis that a combination (entourage) of complimentary minor cannabinoids can direct synergistic antinociceptive activity

">Distinct laminar origins of high-gamma and low-frequency ECoG signals revealed by optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Electrocorticography (ECoG) provides a high-spatiotemporal-resolution measure of cortical activity (cortical surface electrical potentials, CSEPs) in humans and animals. The CSEP high-gamma band (H{gamma}, 65-170 Hz) correlates with neuronal firing rates at the columnar spatial scale and is widely used as a biomarker of local activity. Whether H{gamma} reports all stages of columnar processing, intermediate processing in L2/3 (close to the ECoG electrode), or the main columnar output in L5, is unknown. We disentangled the laminar origins of H{gamma} and other ECoG bands by optogenetically suppressing L2/3 or L5 pyramidal cells during micro-ECoG recording in mouse somatosensory cortex. Whisker deflections evoked transient, topographically localized CSEPs. L5 optogenetic suppression most strongly reduced 65-450 Hz (H{gamma}-uH{gamma}) bands in sensory-evoked ECoG signals, whereas L2/3 suppression most strongly reduced 4-30 Hz ({theta}-{beta}) bands. Thus, different CSEP frequency bands reflect layer-specific activity and are biomarkers of distinct stages of columnar processing.

">Strong mnemonic prediction errors increase cognitive control, attention, and arousal</a></h4>

              
                Ongoing experience is continuously processed in the context of past events. Divergence between current experience and memory-based predictions (i.e., a mnemonic prediction error; MPE) is theorized to be a signal for the hippocampus that encoding, as opposed to retrieval, should be prioritized. We asked how MPEs place demands on cognitive and neural resources beyond the hippocampus, and whether these demands differ as a function of prediction strength. We investigated these questions across two experiments, wherein we recorded scalp electroencephalography and/or pupillometry as 101 young human adults performed an associative memory task. Strong MPEs, more so than weak MPEs, increased physiological indices of cognitive control (frontal theta), attention (posterior alpha and pupil size), and arousal (pupil size). Trial-level pupil-linked MPE responses scaled with the amount of attention (posterior alpha) allocated during prediction generation. Finally, greater cognitive control (frontal theta) during strong MPEs promoted better learning of prediction violating (i.e., unexpected) stimuli. Collectively, these findings reveal how the mind and brain respond adaptively to violations of strong mnemonic predictions.

">Structured Sampling of Molecularly Classified Mossy Fiber Inputs by Cerebellar Granule Cells</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellar granule cell layer receives mossy fiber inputs from diverse brain regions, yet the principles governing how individual granule cells sample distinct types of inputs remain poorly understood. Using a volumetric correlated light and electron microscopy (vCLEM) dataset from an adult female mouse cerebellum, in which VGluT1 positive and VGluT1 negative mossy fiber terminals are molecularly distinguished, we reconstructed granule cell and mossy fiber connectivity to examine input selection rules. We constructed spatially constrained null models to simulate sampling during adulthood and development. Granule cell-centered analysis showed that granule cells shared less innervation from the same mossy fiber than expected by chance. Moreover, subpopulations of granule cells preferentially sample either VGluT1 positive or VGluT1 negative mossy fibers. In contrast, mossy fiber centered analysis showed that individual terminals distributed their outputs across granule cells in a pattern consistent with random sampling. However, sampling in the adult state was more selective than in developmental simulations. Together, our findings demonstrated structured, non random sampling of cerebellar VGluT1 positive and VGluT1 negative mossy fiber inputs and provide a framework for understanding how granule cells integrate molecularly distinct inputs to support cerebellar computation.

">Insular input to the prelimbic cortex underlies social affective behavior in rats.</a></h4>

              
                To navigate social interactions, animals must adjust their behavior in response to information derived from conspecifics. The integration of social information and coordination of behavior occurs within a distributed social decision making network. The prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex and the insula (IC) are key nodes in the salience network which is anatomically situated to interact with the social brain. We investigated the IC-PL circuit in a social affective preference (SAP) test in which subject rats are exposed to 2 age-matched conspecifics where one is stressed via footshock and the other is naive to stress. Typically, rats approach stressed juvenile conspecifics but avoid stressed adults. Using a combination of local and tract specific loss of function methods, we demonstrate that the PL, anterior IC, and the tracts between the posterior or anterior IC and the PL are necessary when rats face the choice to approach or avoid stressed conspecifics. Going further, chemogenetic inhibition of PL neurons innervated by the IC also interfered with social affective behaviors. These studies enrich our understanding of the neurobiology of social decision making by establishing a mechanistic link between insular and prefrontal circuits.

">Locus Coeruleus-Amygdala Circuit Disrupts Prefrontal Control to Impair Fear Extinction</a></h4>

              
                Stress undermines extinction learning and hinders exposure-based clinical therapies for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. In both animals and humans, dysfunction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) contributes to stress-impaired extinction, but the neural circuit by which stress modulates vmPFC function is not known. We hypothesize that locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine undermines extinction learning by recruiting projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to vmPFC. Using a combination of circuit-specific chemogenetics and calcium imaging, we find that activation of LC noradrenergic neurons mimics a behavioral stressor (footshock), induces freezing behavior, reduces spontaneous neuronal activity in the vmPFC, impairs extinction learning, and alters the population dynamics of vmPFC ensembles. Activation of LC also increases shock-induced responses in BLA neurons that project to vmPFC. Selective chemogenetic activation of LCBLA projections impairs extinction; propranolol infusions into the BLA mitigate the effects of LC activation. Together, these results indicate that the BLA serves as a critical interface between the LC and mPFC to mediate stress-induced extinction impairments.

                Background Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastrointestinal emergency with unpredictable clinical progression. Early identification of severe cases is essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), a marker of systemic inflammation, has emerged as a potential prognostic tool. This study investigates the utility of NLR in assessing AP severity using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2018 cycle. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,250 NHANES participants diagnosed with AP. Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA) summarized demographic and clinical variables, including age, BMI, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and NLR. Chi-square and t-tests assessed associations between variables and disease severity. Logistic regression identified independent predictors. Three machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained to classify AP severity. Feature importance and performance metrics were evaluated. Results NLR was significantly higher in severe AP (p < 0.001) and correlated with WBC (r = 0.62) and lymphocytes (r = -0.55). Logistic regression confirmed NLR as a strong predictor (OR = 2.43). Random Forest and XGBoost models showed superior performance, with XGBoost achieving an F1-score of 0.91. Feature importance ranked NLR, WBC, and triglycerides among top predictors. Conclusion NLR is a clinically relevant, low-cost biomarker that enhances early severity prediction in AP. Combined with machine learning, it provides robust risk stratification to aid clinical decision-making.

                This policy brief explores possible itineraries towards teachers’ satisfaction, and students’ performance through remuneration, morale, and learning in Uganda’s government secondary schools. The satisfaction of teachers is a key determinant of the performance of students in government secondary schools in Uganda. The existing remuneration packages do not mostly fulfil the needs of educators. Therefore, teacher morale is low, hence reduced effectiveness in teaching. Educational policies can only be effective if they take cognizance of the relationship between teacher remuneration, their job satisfaction, and student output. It is, therefore, imperative for policymakers to come up with holistic strategies addressing these interrelated factors in a bid to enhance the quality of education that is being dispensed. The government should increase investment in teacher salaries. It should also set up a fund for performance-based incentives and regular professional development training that will empower teachers and put them in high spirits. Stakeholders’ collaboration between educational institutions and the local community is also highly welcome for an environment among educators. Raising the issue of pay and morale leads to better output, and targeted policy pathways create room for the government to have a happy teaching workforce, raising students’ performances, which will trickle down for long periods

                This study aimed to compare perceived stress, personality traits, and resilience in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and healthy counterparts. Methods A causal-comparative design was employed. The sample consisted of 100 participants, divided into 50 patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) referred to the Valiasr International Hospital Gastroenterology Clinic in Tabriz, and 50 healthy matched controls (patient companions). Participants were selected via purposive sampling. Data were collected using three standardized questionnaires: the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [5], the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) [9], and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) [12]. Data were analyzed using both univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Results The results indicated a significant difference between the two groups across all measured variables (p < 0.05). Patients with GI disorders reported significantly higher levels of perceived stress and neuroticism. Conversely, healthy controls scored significantly higher on the other four personality traits: extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness as well as on all components of resilience (personal competence, trust in instincts, tolerance of negative affect, positive acceptance of change, and spiritual influences). Conclusion The findings suggest that psychological factors, including specific personality traits and lower resilience, are significantly associated with GI disorders. Integrating psychological assessments and interventions, such as stress management and resilience training, into the standard care for patients with GI conditions is strongly recommended.

A cohort study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a skin disease, but its clinical impact is systemic with more than 30% of patients suffering from other allergic diseases and mental health disorders. Early disease control could prevent the development of comorbidities or reduce the severity of the condition. Topical treatments, such as skin moisturizers, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, have proven to be effective in achieving clinical control in AD; However, sustained improvement is observed in approximately 50–70% of patients, depending on disease severity, treatment adherence, and individual response. Early detection of patients with a low probability of response to topical treatment would help start with other therapies and improve the quality of life of patients. Several clinical and laboratory biomarkers have been proposed to predict the prognosis of AD. In this study, we present a protocol for developing a model to predict the clinical response of AD patients to topical treatment. To achieve this goal, a cohort study will be performed for the prognostic model using the following steps: 1. Selection of predictive variables for the model 2. Evaluation of the quality of the collected data and control of lost data 3. Data statistical management 4. Strategies to select the variables to include at the end of the model 5. Evaluation of the performance of different possible models (predictive accuracy) 6. selection of the best model. 7. Validation The performance and internal validation of the model will be assessed, and if high diagnostic performance is confirmed, external validation will be justified to assess its clinical impact ( Figure 1).

                Background This study investigates the psychological and technological factors influencing the utilization of mental health applications among medical students at Umm Al-Qura University in the holy city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, The study aims to evaluate the prevalence, perceptions, and barriers related to mental health applications usage, identify demographic and psychological factors influencing their adoption, and estimate the prevalence of mental health conditions among undergraduate medical students at Umm Al-Qura University in 2024. Methods A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at Umm Al-Qura University among 255 undergraduate medical students using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected through a validated, self-administered (English) online questionnaire adapted from a previously published study. The questionnaire assessed sociodemographic characteristics, smartphone usage, mental health app use, and perceived barriers. The Statistical analysis included Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and logistic regression, performed using R software version 4.2.2. And confidentiality was strictly maintained. Results The SEM model exhibited an exemplary fit (CFI = 1.000, TLI = 1.029, RMSEA < 0.001, SRMR = 0.027). Cognitive Influence was significantly represented by variables such as the perceived importance of mental health and awareness of available resources. In contrast, neither Social Influence nor Technology Compatibility exhibited significant predictive pathways to Cognitive Influence. The covariance between Social Influence and Technology Compatibility was significant (p = 0.011), suggesting a potential indirect relationship. Observed variables, including “Technology helps positively” and “Peer influence item,” demonstrated strong factor loadings (p < 0.001). Conclusion This research underscores the intricate interplay between psychological, technological, and demographic variables in the adoption of mental health applications. Interventions designed to enhance cognitive awareness and promote tailored application development may significantly improve uptake among medical students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1026/v1?src=rss">Antecedents of data analytics adoption: A systematic literature review from 2018-2024 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The rise of data analytics adoption has transformed multiple industries through technological advancements. However, utilizing big data analytics presents challenges that depend on adoption models used by individuals or organizations. Whilst numerous models on big data analytics exist, understanding the most influential theories shaping research in this domain remains limited. The study systematically explores the antecedents of data analytics adoption, aims to map the evolution of the field and uncover underexplored domains and integration gaps. Methods A rigorous systematic literature review of 43 peer-reviewed articles published between 2018 and 2024, collected mostly from Scopus and Web of Science databases, was conducted, employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Advanced bibliometric tools like VOSviewer and Microsoft Excel were employed to identify key trends, thematic clusters and integration gaps. Results The study reveals research concentration in manufacturing sectors and developed Asian countries. The review identifies five interconnected adoption dimensions: technological; organizational; environmental; individual; and data-related factors. The Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework dominates organizational-level studies, while the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) primarily guides individual-level investigations. Having identified five key research clusters, the review highlights that theoretical fragmentation persists between behavioral and resource-based perspectives. Conclusion This study synthesizes the theoretical model of big data analytics research, providing guidance for future researchers in selecting an appropriate theoretical framework, differentiating between individual and organizational adoption levels and identifying significant determinants for technology adoption studies.

                <p>by Charlotte R. Taylor, Vincent Tse, Drew D. Willoughby, Maxine Levesque, Trisha V. Vaidyanathan, Jeanne T. Paz, Kira E. Poskanzer</p>

Classical neuromodulators regulate arousal states, spanning deep sleep to vigilant wakefulness, primarily by activating cortical neurons. However, cortical astrocytes also express neuromodulatory G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). While astrocytic noradrenergic receptors have been shown to modulate two critical regulators of arousal—cortical synchrony and extracellular adenosine levels—how other neuromodulatory signaling pathways similarly shape arousal remains unclear. Astrocytes in mammalian cortex express particularly high levels of the wake-promoting, Gq-coupled histamine-1-receptor (H1R), yet little is known about how astrocytic H1R contributes to regulation of arousal. To address this gap, we used pharmacological and genetic approaches in murine cortex to test how astrocyte-H1R signaling affects astrocyte calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), cortical neural activity across sleep/wake, and extracellular adenosine—an astrocytic output that regulates cortical arousal. Using ex vivo two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in acute cortical slices, we show that H1R mediates cell-autonomous astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to histamine (HA) and attenuates responses to norepinephrine (NE). Next, in vivo fiber photometry and electrophysiology results show that H1R deletion in cortical astrocytes disrupts local astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> during wake and extracellular adenosine dynamics specifically around REM sleep transitions, when HA release is minimal. Further, astrocyte-specific H1R deletion in cortex promotes wakefulness and reduces REM sleep time. Our results indicate that H1R activity modulates astrocyte responses to non-histaminergic inputs by inducing lasting changes in astrocyte physiology that modulate extracellular adenosine and REM sleep. Our findings contribute to an emerging model in which neuromodulator GPCRs synergistically shape astrocyte physiology to regulate arousal behavior and adenosine signaling in the cortex.

                This essay compares how Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Abdulrazak Gurnah, two leading East African writers, represent postcolonial identity and historical trauma through fiction. It examines their contrasting approaches to literary resistance: Ngugi embraces radical language politics and collective cultural reclamation, while Gurnah employs narrative ambiguity, exile experiences, and linguistic hybridity. The analysis reveals how intergenerational trauma operates in their works, with memory functioning as a morally charged force shaping identity and narrative authority. Despite their differences, Ngugi prioritizing political clarity and revolutionary consciousness, Gurnah exploring subtle psychological details and narrative dissonance, both authors demonstrate literature’s ethical power to contest historical erasure and reimagine postcolonial futures with compassion and complexity.

                Castelli et al. identify two ripple profiles in hippocampal CA1. Radsink ripples integrate superficial- and deep-sublayer pyramidal cells into dense, higher-dimensional coactivity motifs that stably reactivate recent waking experience during sleep. LMsink ripples primarily recruit deep-sublayer cells into sparse, lower-dimensional motifs that gradually drift from reactivating prior toward recent representations.

                Kamath et al. examine the neural mechanism by which hunger makes animals take more risks. They show that hunger neurons in the hypothalamus suppress threat and salience-related dopamine signals in the tail of the striatum during bouts of novelty exploration and risk assessment.

                Jia et al. develop SCOPE-C, a method to map open chromatin and associated chromatin loops from low-input samples. Applying it to the fetal cortex of humans, macaques, and mice, they show that human excitatory neurons form extended enhancer-promoter networks, enriched with human-biased enhancers and neurodevelopmental disorder SNPs, compared with those of other species.

                Zan et al. have identified a neuroglial microcircuit within the central amygdala modulating anxiety symptoms comorbid with chronic pain through astrocytes. They find that pain induces dynorphin release by activating the CeLPdyn-CeM microcircuit. Dynorphin activates astrocytes by acting on kappa receptors to increase CeM neuron excitability by releasing gliotransmitter.

Application of this approach reveals a previously undetected pre-mRNA splicing intermediate, highlighting its potential to streamline biological discovery.

To find out how can machine learning be applied to biocatalysis research, we talked to three scientists, Professor Rebecca Buller (Zurich University of Applied Sciences), Dr. Stanislav Mazurenko (Masaryk University) and Associate Professor Yang Yang (University of California, Santa Barbara). We discussed the potentials and challenges associated with ML, how collaborations between computational and biocatalysis experts can be promoted, and how will the field develop in the future.

                Mammalian genomes are organized by multi-level folding; yet how this organization contributes to cell-type-specific transcription remains unclear. SATB1 forms a nuclear substructure that resists high-salt extraction. SATB1 binds base-unpairing regions (BURs), genomic elements with high unwinding propensities. In mouse thymocytes, we found that SATB1 establishes a two-tiered chromatin organization: one through indirect binding to transcriptionally active DNase 1-accessible chromatin and another by direct binding to BURs in the DNase 1-inaccessible nuclear substructure. Recently published ChIP-seq datasets show SATB1 binding to accessible chromatin at enhancers and CTCF sites, but not to BURs. By employing urea ChIP-seq, which retains only directly bound protein:DNA complexes, we found that BURs, but not CTCF sites, are direct SATB1 binding targets genome-wide. BURs bound to the SATB1 nuclear substructure interact with accessible chromatin, crossing multiple topologically associated domains (TADs). SATB1 is required for these megabase-scale interactions linked to cell-type-specific gene expression. BURs are highly enriched within transcriptionally repressive lamina-associated domains (LADs). Besides these BURs, SATB1 anchors some BURs (18%) outside LADs near genes in otherwise accessible chromatin to the SATB1 nuclear substructure. Only a subset of total BURs is bound to SATB1, depending on cell type. Notably, despite the mutually exclusive SATB1-binding profiles uncovered by the two ChIP-seq methods, we found most peaks in both profiles are valid and require SATB1. Based on these and previous data, we propose that the SATB1 protein network forms a chromatin scaffold, providing an interface that connects accessible chromatin to a subnuclear architectural structure, thereby facilitating the three-dimensional organization linked to cell-type-specific gene expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106688">Trained immunity in skin infections: Macrophages and beyond</a></h4>

              
                The skin is frequently subjected to minor mechanical insults that may compromise its barrier integrity and permit the entry of pathogens. Therefore, the immune system of the skin needs to rapidly balance antimicrobial defense with tissue repair. To maintain homeostasis, the skin relies both on acute immune defenses and on mechanisms of innate memory or trained immunity. This enhanced inflammatory response to a second challenge has been well characterized in bone marrow cells, such as monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and stem cells. Yet, the specific memory responses in skin-resident immune cells remain less understood. Importantly, the common skin colonizer <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> has been identified as a potent inducer of trained immunity, triggering both metabolic and epigenetic changes at local sites such as the skin, and centrally in the bone marrow. This review explores the emerging understanding of trained immunity in the skin, that is how infection-driven cellular processes induce long-lasting immune adaptation and modulate skin barrier integrity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100605">Age-related changes in ‘cortical’ 1/f dynamics are linked to cardiac activity</a></h4>

              
                The power of electrophysiologically measured cortical activity decays with an approximately <i>1 /f<sup>X</sup></i> function. The slope of this decay (i.e. the spectral exponent, <i>X</i>) is modulated by various factors such as age, cognitive states or psychiatric/neurological disorders. Interestingly, a mostly parallel line of research has also uncovered similar effects for the spectral slope in the electrocardiogram (ECG). This raises the question of whether these bodywide changes in spectral slopes are (in-)dependent. Focusing on well-established age-related changes in spectral slopes, we analyzed a total of 1282 recordings of magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting state measurements with concurrent ECG in an age-diverse sample (18–88 years). Using a diverse array of analytical approaches, we demonstrate that the aperiodic signal recorded via surface electrodes/sensors originates from multiple physiological sources. Furthermore, our results suggest that common ‘artifact’ rejection approaches (i.e. ICA) may not be sufficient to separate cardiac from neural activity. In particular, significant parts of age-related changes in aperiodic activity normally interpreted to be of neural origin can be explained by cardiac activity. Moreover, our results suggest that changes (flattening/steepening) of the spectral slope with age are dependent on the recording site and investigated frequency range. Our results highlight the complexity of aperiodic activity while raising concerns when interpreting aperiodic activity as ‘cortical’ without considering physiological influences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102792">Endophilin A1 facilitates organization of the GABAergic postsynaptic machinery to maintain excitation-inhibition balance</a></h4>

              
                The assembly and operation of neural circuits in the brain rely on the coordination and balance of excitatory and inhibitory activities. Inhibitory synapses are key regulators of the functional balance of neural circuits. However, due to the diversity of inhibitory presynaptic neurons, the complex composition of postsynaptic receptor subunits, and the lack of typical postsynaptic dense structure, there are relatively few studies on the regulatory mechanisms for inhibitory synaptic structure and function, and insufficient understanding of the cellular and molecular abnormalities of inhibitory synapses in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we report a crucial role for endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses. We show that endophilin A1 directly interacts with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin in excitatory neurons and promotes organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and synaptic recruitment/stabilization of the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors via its plasma membrane association and actin polymerization-promoting activities. Loss of endophilin A1 by gene knockout in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells weakens inhibitory synaptic transmission and causes imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory function of neural circuits, leading to increased susceptibility to epilepsy. Our findings identify endophilin A1 as an iPSD component and provide new insights into the organization and stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses to maintain E/I balance as well as the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106814">Lipid peroxidation and type I interferon coupling fuels pathogenic macrophage activation causing tuberculosis susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                A quarter of the human population is infected with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, but less than 10% of those infected develop pulmonary TB. We developed a genetically defined sst1-susceptible mouse model that uniquely reproduces a defining feature of human TB: the development of necrotic lung granulomas and determined that the sst1-susceptible phenotype was driven by the aberrant macrophage activation. This study demonstrates that the aberrant response of the sst1-susceptible macrophages to prolonged stimulation with TNF is primarily driven by conflicting Myc and antioxidant response pathways leading to a coordinated failure (1) to properly sequester intracellular iron and (2) to activate ferroptosis inhibitor enzymes. Consequently, iron-mediated lipid peroxidation fueled superinduction of Ifnβ and sustained the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway hyperactivity that locked the sst1-susceptible macrophages in a state of unresolving stress and compromised their resistance to Mtb. The accumulation of the aberrantly activated, stressed, macrophages within the granuloma microenvironment led to the local failure of anti-tuberculosis immunity and tissue necrosis. The upregulation of the Myc pathway in peripheral blood cells of human TB patients was significantly associated with poor outcomes of TB treatment. Thus, Myc dysregulation in activated macrophages results in an aberrant macrophage activation and represents a novel target for host-directed TB therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101371">Balancing safety and efficiency in human decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The safety-efficiency dilemma describes the problem of maintaining safety during efficient exploration and is a special case of the exploration-exploitation dilemma in the face of potential dangers. Conventional exploration-exploitation solutions collapse punishment and reward into a single feedback signal, whereby early losses can be overcome by later gains. However, the brain has a separate system for Pavlovian fear learning, suggesting a possible computational advantage to maintaining a specific fear memory during exploratory decision-making. In a series of simulations, we show this promotes safe but efficient learning and is optimised by arbitrating Pavlovian avoidance of instrumental decision-making according to uncertainty. We provide a basic test of this model in a simple human approach-withdrawal experiment in virtual reality and show that this flexible avoidance model captures choice and reaction times. These results show that the Pavlovian fear system has a more sophisticated role in decision-making than previously thought, by shaping flexible exploratory behaviour in a computationally precise manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105544">Understanding the global rise of artemisinin resistance: Insights from over 100,000 Plasmodium falciparum samples</a></h4>

              
                Artemisinin partial resistance (ART-R) in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> is a major challenge to malaria control globally. Over the last two decades, ART-R has spread widely across Southeast Asia, undermining public health strategies and hindering elimination. As of 2024, ART-R has now emerged in East Africa, with the potential to dramatically impact current efforts to control malaria in the region. Mitigating its spread requires detailed genomic surveillance of point mutations in the <i>kelch13</i> gene, the primary known determinant of artemisinin resistance. Although extensive surveillance data on these markers is available, it is distributed across many literature studies and open databases. In this review, we aggregate spatiotemporal data for 112,933 <i>P. falciparum</i> samples collected between 1980 and 2023 into a single resource, providing the most comprehensive overview of <i>kelch13</i> markers to date. We outline the history and current status of these mutations globally, with particular focus on their emergence in Southeast Asia and East/Northeast Africa. Concerningly, we find the recent increases in ART-R in Africa mirror patterns observed in Southeast Asia 10–15 years ago. We examine factors that may influence its spread, including fitness costs, treatment strategies, and local epidemiological dynamics, before discussing potential scenarios for how resistance may spread in Africa in coming years. This review provides a comprehensive account of how the situation of ART-R has unfolded globally so far, highlighting insights for researchers and public health bodies which aim to reduce its negative effects.

">Sequelae and reversal of age-dependent alterations in mitochondrial dynamics via autophagy enhancement in reprogrammed human neurons</a></h4>

              
                How aging of human neurons affects dynamics of essential organelle such as mitochondria and autophagosomes remains largely unknown. MicroRNA-induced directly reprogrammed neurons (miNs) derived from adult fibroblasts retain age-associated signatures of the donor, enabling the study of age-dependent features in human neurons, including longitudinal isogenic samples. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that neurons derived from elderly individuals are characterized by gene expression changes associated with the regulation of autophagosomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria, compared to young counterparts. To clarify these changes at the cellular level, we performed live-cell imaging of cellular organelles in miNs from donors of different ages. Older donor miNs exhibit decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, which surprisingly co-occurs with a significant increase in mitochondrial fission and fusion events. We posit that the increased fission and fusion of mitochondria may reflect age-dependent compensation for impaired mitochondrial turnover, perhaps due to changes in autophagy. We subsequently identified a significant decrease in autophagosome acidification in neurons derived from individuals >65 years compared to younger donors, and a corresponding age-dependent reduction in neuritic lysosomes resulting in fewer lysosomes available to acidify autophagosomes. This age-dependent deficit in autolysosome flux was rescued by chemically promoting autophagosome generation, which also reversed the age-dependent increase in mitochondrial fission and fusion and improved mitochondrial health. Together, this work reveals a mechanism by which aging reduces autophagic flux secondary to a loss of neuritic lysosomes, resulting in in mitochondria-intrinsic mechanisms to avoid loss of energy production.

">Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanoflowers Rescue Immune Cells from the Cytotoxic Effects of Amyloid Aggregates</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe pathology caused by a progressive degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Although etiology of PD remains unclear, accumulating evidence indicates that neurodegenerative effects are triggered by the abrupt aggregation of a-synuclein (a-Syn), a small membrane protein that is responsible for cell vesicle trafficking. a-Syn aggregates are highly toxic to neurons and immune cells present in the brain, including macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells. Transition metal dichalcogenide nanoflowers (TMD NFs) are novel nanomaterials with unique optical and biological properties. However, their effects on the immune system remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate cytoprotective properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) NFs on macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells exposed to a-Syn fibrils. We found that MoSe2 NFs exerted strong cytoprotective properties fully mitigating toxic effects of a-Syn fibrils, while MoS2 NFs were found to be significantly less potent in rescuing immune cells from a-Syn aggregates. At the same time, MoS2 NFs triggered polarization of macrophages into M1 and dendritic cells into M2 phenotypes, while an increase in both M1 and M2 was observed in microglia exposed to MoS2 NFs. MoSe2 NFs did not trigger polarization of DC cells and microglia in M1/M2 phenotypes, while MoSe2 NFs-facilitated polarization of macrophages into M1 was observed. These results indicate that TMD NFs could be used to improve viability of immune cells and attenuate their phenotypes, which, ultimately, can be used to treat PD and other neurodegenerative pathologies.

                Connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) applied to functional MRI connectivity data can identify brain networks that vary with behavioral measures across subjects. The prediction strength also provides an index of how closely an external instrument relates to specific brain networks, potentially impacting their clinical interpretation. Here we use a deeply phenotyped transdiagnostic population (n = 317) to evaluate CPM performance across a variety of clinical and cognitive measures. The findings revealed a wide range of predictive performance for external instruments, with cognitive tests generally predicting better than self-reported clinical measures (unpaired t-test, p < 0.001). Testing the hypothesis that networks supporting cognition should be apparent in networks related to symptomatology, we examined the networks' overlap. The overlap was sparse, but primarily identified the thalamus, cerebellum, somatomotor networks, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as key hubs in mediating relationships between clinical and cognitive measures. The findings reveal the extent to which external measures reflect underlying brain networks and highlight that examining network overlap can identify networks specific to clinically relevant cognitive dysfunction.

">Multimodal MR Imaging for quantification of brain lipid in mice at 9.4T</a></h4>

              
                Background: Advanced MR imaging techniques like steady state Nuclear Overhauser enhancement (ssNOE), transient NOE (tNOE), and myelin water fraction (MWF) provide a non-invasive way to assess the biochemical and structural integrity of brain tissue. Their sensitivity to endogenous lipids and macromolecules allows for the early detection of neuropathological changes, making them valuable tools in studying brain health and disease progression. In this study, we systematically evaluate the repeatability and sensitivity of NOEMTR, tNOE, and MWF for quantifying lipid and myelin content in the brains of wild-type (WT) mice, correlating the results with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Methods: Five 6-month-old C57BL6/J mice were imaged using 3D-NOE, and four mice underwent imaging with 2D tNOE and MWF across four repeated sessions using a 9.4T Scanner. For ssNOE imaging, CEST-weighted images at 56 frequency offsets were acquired using B1rms of 1.0 T and 3s saturation duration. For tNOE, 52 offsets were acquired with a hyperbolic secant inversion pulse (bandwidth = 400Hz, duration = 44ms) and a mixing time of 200ms. For MWF, a multi-echo spin-echo (MESE) sequence was acquired with 40 evenly spaced echoes from 5.5ms to 200ms. For both ssNOE and tNOE, B0 correction was performed using WASSR. Repeatability was quantified using intra- and inter-subject coefficients of variation (COV%). Pearson correlation was performed to see the association between imaging matrices and IHC measures, Luxol fast blue (LFB) stained sections, and myelin basic protein (MBP). Results: All techniques demonstrated high repeatability across the whole brain (WB) and selected regions of interest (ROIs). Whole-brain intra-subject COV% for NOEMTR ranged from 1.92% to 3.40%, with corresponding inter-subject COVs of 1.50%. tNOE exhibited improved intra-subject repeatability with COVs ranging from 0.75% to 5.57%, but a reduced inter-subject COV of 2.97%. MWF imaging showed the highest stability overall, with an intra-subject COV ranging from 0.47% to 2.03% and an inter-subject COV of 0.75%. Visually, tNOE offers superior contrast in myelin-rich areas compared to NOEMTR and MWF imaging, showing greater sensitivity to myelinated regions. tNOE strongly correlates with histological markers: r = 0.83 with MBP staining and r = 0.72 with LFB staining (both p < 0.001). MWF and NOEMTR showed correlations with MBP (r = 0.63 and r = 0.57, respectively). Conclusion: NOEMTR, tNOE, and MWF imaging are reliable and repeatable methods for quantifying macromolecules in the brain. Among these, tNOE emerges as the most sensitive for detecting myelin lipids as confirmed by histological validation. These findings highlight the translational potential of tNOE for studying demyelinating disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

">Cerebellar outputs for rapid directional refinement of forelimb movement</a></h4>

              
                Much of our interaction with the world relies on the ability to move our limbs with speed and precision. The cerebellum is critical for movement coordination, yet how outputs from the cerebellum continually guide the limb and whether discrete pathways differentially contribute to adjusting motor output remain unclear. Using intersectional viral approaches in mice, we identify two spatially intermingled yet anatomically distinct cerebellar populations that drive the forelimb either toward or away from the body. Neural recordings reveal cerebellar activity that correlates with and precedes these opposing directional changes in limb movement. Both cerebellar output pathways influence motor neuron and muscle activity within milliseconds, producing reliable effects on limb trajectory despite substantial underlying variability in muscle recruitment patterns. Our findings disentangle a subtype organization to cerebellar limb control, revealing a subcortical circuit basis for online directional refinement during movement execution.

">Neural Receptive Fields, Stimulus Space Embedding and Effective Geometry of Scale-Free Networks</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neuronal dynamics couple with stimuli space and how receptive fields emerge and organize within brain networks remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Several models attempted to explain these phenomena, often by adjusting the network to empirical manifestations, but struggled to achieve biological plausibility. Here, we propose a physiologically grounded model in which receptive fields and population-level attractor dynamics emerge naturally from the effective hyperbolic geometry of scale-free networks. In particular, we associate stimulus space with the boundary of a hyperbolic embedding, and study the resulting neural dynamics in both rate-based and spiking implementations. The resulting localized attractors faithfully reflect the structure of the stimulus space and capture key properties of the receptive fields without fine-tuning of local connectivity, exhibiting a direct relation between a neuron's connectivity degree and the corresponding receptive field size. The model generalizes to stimulus spaces of arbitrary dimensionality and scale, encompassing various modalities, such as orientation and place selectivity. We also provide direct experimental evidence in support of these results, based on analyses of hippocampal place fields recorded on a linear track. Overall, our framework offers a novel organizing principle for receptive field formation and establishes a direct link between network structure, stimulus space encoding, and neural dynamics.

">Dynamic updating of cognitive maps via traces of experience in the subiculum</a></h4>

              
                In the classical view of hippocampal function, the subiculum is assigned the role as the output layer. In spatial paradigms, some subiculum neurons manifest as so-called boundary vector cells (BVCs), firing in response to boundaries at specific allocentric directions and distances. More recently it has been shown that some subiculum BVCs can be classified as vector trace cells (VTCs), which exhibit traces of activity after a boundary/object has been removed. Here we propose a model of processing within subiculum that accounts for VTCs, taking into account proximodistal differences in subiculum (pSub vs dSub) and CA1. dSub neurons receive feedforward input, either in the form of perceptual information (from BVCs in pSub) or mnemonic information (from place cells in CA1). Mismatch between these two inputs updates associative memory encoded in the synapses between CA1 and dSub. With a range of learning rates, the model captures the majority of experimental findings, including the distribution of VTCs along the proximodistal axis, the percentage of VTCs across different cue types, and the hours-long persistence of the vector trace. Incorporating experimentally reported effects of inserted objects/rewards on place cells (place field shift), we also explain why VTCs have longer tuning distances after cue removal. This adds predictive character to subiculum traces and suggests the online use of mnemonic content during navigation. Our model suggests that mismatch detection for updating spatial memory content provides a mechanistic explanation for findings in the CA1-subiculum pathway. This work constitutes the first dedicated circuit-level model of computation within the subiculum, consistent with known effects in CA1, and provides a potential framework to extend the canonical model of hippocampal function with a subiculum component.

">Disruption of emotional processing by GBR 12909 in male and female mice highlights novel behavioral paradigms relevant to bipolar disorders.</a></h4>

              
                Bipolar disorders (BD) are defined by a chronic recurrence of manic and depressive phases. Along with mood, acute phases are associated with altered emotions. The biological underpinnings of these changes are unresolved, mostly because modeling the cycling nature of BD is still a major challenge in preclinical studies. One model is based on GBR 12909 administration, a dopamine transporter inhibitor aiming at mimicking some dimensions of mania. It has recently been shown that this model generates a mixed phenotype with negative hedonic biases and anxiety along with the hyperlocomotion. These studies have been only assessed in male animals, and other behavioral dimensions relevant for BD remain to be explored, in particular recognition of conspecifics emotions and reactivity to danger. The objective of this study is to further characterize the GBR model in both sexes by introducing two novel behavioral assays, the sweeping/looming disk and the negative emotion recognition tasks to evaluate response to threat and emotion discrimination. First, we replicated the previous results in the GBR model: higher anxiety, hyperlocomotion, anhedonia in males. These phenotypes were less pronounced in females. GBR also induced a hypersensibility to threat in both sexes in the sweeping/looming disk. GBR abolished preference for the emotional target only in males, suggesting altered emotion recognition. This work introduces new phenotypic dimensions relevant to study BD and highlights the necessity to study both sexes which are not strictly equivalent in their behavioral responses.

">Social learning of emotion and its implication for memory: An ERP Study</a></h4>

              
                Social learning of emotional salience from surrounding social cues is especially advantageous under conditions of uncertainty. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying this process and its consolidation into long-term memory remain poorly understood. In this two-day EEG study, we examined whether emotional salience from social cues (facial expressions) transfers to perceptually uncertain target images, and whether such learned salience is preserved in memory even after the social cues are removed. On Day 1 (learning session), we found no evidence for automatic emotional salience transfer across trials. Instead, ERP results indicated that social cue use was modulated by participants' metacognitive state of subjective uncertainty, as reflected in the P1 amplitudes. On Day 2 (test session), recognition memory revealed evidence of additive emotional salience: EPN amplitudes were enhanced for accurately classified positive target images previously paired with social cues. In contrast, LPC amplitudes were reduced for negative target images in the social condition, regardless of classification accuracy. Together, these findings suggest that the influence of social cues is contingent on subjective uncertainty. Social cues enhanced emotional salience when internal valence judgments were strong (as for positive images), but led to increased reliance on the cue - and therefore dampened memory encoding - when internal valence judgments were weaker (as for negative images).

">Motor dysfunction at 4 weeks in streptozotocin-induced diabetic animals</a></h4>

              
                Aims: Diabetic neuropathy is still a severe and common consequence for diabetic patients. The impact of neuropathy emphasizes the need to study its biology in order to treat patients early. The limitations of preclinical neuropathy models to date demand in vivo models that combine early nerve dysfunction detection with low mortality. Streptozotocin is commonly used to cause diabetes in rodents, but conventional high dose design often results in high mortality rates. In this study, I present a secondary analysis of a neuropathy primary model [8], focusing on the 4-week timepoint and validating proximal motor dysfunction in a short timeframe with high survival using F-wave metrics as early biomarkers. Methods: Male Wistar rats received low-dose STZ (30 mg/kg) on alternate days for one week (three injections) or vehicle. At baseline and 4-week, I analyzed blood glucose and body weight, and electrophysiological recordings (M-/F-waves) were performed at endpoint. Results: Rats treated with STZ had significant body weight loss (p < 0.001) and hyperglycemia greater than (20 mmol/L), which was aligned with a negative correlation (Pearson r = -0.77, p = 0.003). Furthermore, in diabetic animals, electrophysiology displayed that M-waves were unchanged, whereas F-waves were absent (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 91.7% of the animals were still alive at the end of the study, indicating a high level of survival. Conclusions: The new approach of this secondary study resulted in development of neuropathy at 4 weeks, accompanied by high survival, which in turn validates F-waves as an early biomarker of nerve dysfunction within a short timeframe. Thus, this new work provides an early and reliable platform for testing neuroprotective drugs and mechanistic work in the short term.

">Cerebrovascular response dynamics to hypercapnia in healthy aging</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular dysfunction is an early and underrecognized contributor to cognitive decline. Standard measures such as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) during hypercapnia capture only the amplitude of flow responses, providing limited insight into the timing of vascular adaptation. Temporal features, such as delay (onset latency) and time constant (rate of adjustment), together with gain (response amplitude) may serve as more sensitive indicators of vascular health, but cannot be directly obtained from conventional imaging. Here, we investigated cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal dynamics during hypercapnic challenge in healthy aging. Using a physiologically validated computational model, we estimated delay, time constant, and gain by optimizing the mapping of end-tidal gases to their arterial counterparts in a region-of-interest framework. Once parametrized using CBF, the model successfully predicted CBV and BOLD responses in independent experimental sessions. Across subjects, aging was associated with widespread heterogeneous region-specific changes in delay and substantial reductions in gain and time constant, indicating that cerebrovascular responses become weaker and less adaptable with age. These results demonstrate that calibrated simulations have the ability to track vascular aging, allowing the extraction of parameters that may represent novel biomarkers of cerebrovascular dysfunction. Unlike conventional CVR, temporal hemodynamic parameters capture the dynamics of vascular adaptation, providing a complementary dimension for early detection and therapeutic monitoring in aging and disease.

                Multielectrode array (MEA) technology enables simultaneous recording of electrical signals from neuronal networks, producing complex datasets. Current analytical approaches typically examine a limited number of metrics such as mean firing rate and synchronicity, leaving much of the data underutilized. To address this gap, we created NOVA (Neural Output Visualization and Analysis), an accessible R-based computational tool for comprehensive MEA data interpretation and visualization. NOVA integrates dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering with heatmap generation, and temporal trajectory mapping of network activity patterns. Our code offers both a user-friendly pipeline requiring minimal coding background as well as customizable advanced plotting modules for experienced users. Validation experiments using primary cortical neurons during development and pharmacological manipulation demonstrated NOVA's capacity to detect subtle activity shifts overlooked by conventional methods. Notably, our unbiased approach identified network burst duration as a stronger contributor to activity variance than commonly reported firing rate metrics, exemplifying NOVA's utility for discovering meaningful patterns and generating data-driven hypotheses.

">The Rod Bipolar Cell Pathway Contributes To Surround Responses In OFFRetinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons can be influenced by stimuli beyond their receptive field center, yet the mechanisms underlying this surround modulation remain poorly understood. In the retina, many OFF ganglion cells exhibit responses to ON stimulation outside their receptive field center. However, disentangling the pathways and cell types contributing to these responses has been challenging with traditional experimental approaches. Here, we combined optogenetics, two-photon holographic stimulation, and multi-electrode array recordings to identify the intermediate retinal cell types involved in this circuit. We found that the pathway formed by rod bipolar cells and AII amacrine cells (one of the primary relays of rod-driven signals under low-light conditions) plays a key role in mediating this surround modulation. Specifically, crossover inhibition exploits the same amacrine cells responsible for surround suppression to disinhibit distant ganglion cells. This suggests that the retina repurposes existing circuits for surround modulation, optimizing resources through multifunctional inhibitory pathways.

">Sex and gender differences in perivascular space in early adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Perivascular spaces (PVS) surrounding cerebral blood vessels play an important role in the blood-brain barrier and glymphatic system. Although it was once thought that PVS were either absent or too small to be seen or quantified during healthy development with MRI, recent studies have found visible, quantifiable PVS exist throughout the white matter of the cerebrum in childhood and adolescence. As a result, researchers have begun to explore individual differences, including potential sex-based variations in developing PVS. Meta-analyses in adults have shown that PVS are larger on average in males than in females, and several studies have shown a similar relationship in children. In contrast, no studies to date have examined the association between gender and PVS at any age. This cross-sectional study examined 6,538 youths from a large, nationwide sample of 9- to 11-year-olds in the U.S. to examine the relationship between sex, felt-gender, and PVS count and volume. Using a model-building approach, we conducted a series of linear mixed-effects models to determine the maximum variance explained in PVS count and volume, including age, pubertal development status, race, parent education, BMI z-score, and regional white matter volume, while also adjusting for MRI scanner and site. BMI z-score, age, and parent education were significant predictors of both PVS volume and count. Adding sex to the model improved model fit in all regions, and the further addition of felt-gender significantly improved model fit for PVS count in 5/6 regions of interest. Moreover, we found increases in PVS volume and count were associated with reduced executive function, learning, and memory. As the first study to report an association between felt-gender and PVS, our findings demonstrate the importance of considering gender in addition to sex as a potential source of structural variance in PVS in adolescents.

">Differential Burst dynamics of Slow and Fast gamma rhythms in Macaque primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations have been ubiquitously observed across a wide spectrum of brain areas in multiple species. They tend to occur intermittently in the form of bursts, rather than being produced as sustained and continuous rhythmic activity. Recent studies have shown that large visual sinusoidal gratings elicit two distinct gamma rhythms, namely, slow ({approx} 20-35 Hz) and fast gamma ({approx} 40-65 Hz), in the primary visual cortex (V1) of non-human primates. However, their mechanisms of generation and potential functional role in cortical processing remain unclear. Details of their burst signatures could potentially provide crucial insights about how the two rhythms influence network dynamics. Therefore, we computed burst statistics (durations and latencies) of simultaneously induced slow and fast gamma rhythms in the local field potential (LFP) recorded from area V1 of two adult female bonnet monkeys using several burst estimation methods. We found that slow gamma rhythm exhibited significantly longer burst durations and longer latencies as compared to fast gamma. Slow gamma exhibited higher long-range synchrony compared to fast gamma, as estimated by coherence and weighted phase lag index (WPLI), which could aid in enhanced global coordination in neocortex. Interestingly, longer burst length of slow-gamma could be replicated in a recently-developed noisy Wilson-Cowan network model by simply changing the firing-rate time-constant of the corresponding inhibitory interneuronal population, which leads to both slower and longer bursts. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the two oscillations are generated by different inter-neuronal classes that operate over different temporal and spatial scales of integration.

">Association of cytochrome c oxidase dysfunction with amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease and patient-derived cerebral organoids</a></h4>

              
                Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrate brain mitochondrial dysfunction and energy deficiency that are closely associated with cognitive impairment. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO), also known as mitochondrial complex IV, is the terminal enzyme in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Consistent with the pivotal role of CCO in mitochondrial bioenergetics and high demand for energy to sustain neuronal function, CCO dysfunction has been linked to neurological disorders including AD. However, it remains unclear whether mitochondrial CCO dysfunction represents an adaptive response to AD-associated toxic molecules versus a bona fide pathology to promote AD development. In this study, by meta-analysis of publicly available proteomics analysis of post-mortem frontal lobe tissues from four large cohorts of patients with AD we identified loss of key CCO subunits including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded COX1 and COX3 as well as nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded COX5A, COX6B1, COX7C, COX8A, and NDUFA4 in patients with AD. Further biochemical analysis using post-mortem frontal lobe tissues showed lowered CCO activity of neuronal mitochondria from patients with AD, suggesting CCO vulnerability and its potential association with amyloidosis in AD. Lastly, in addition to the inverse relationship between neuronal CCO activity and brain amyloidosis in the tested AD cohort, pharmacological inhibition of CCO promoted amyloid production and elevated beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity in cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from one nonAD and one AD subject. The simplest interpretation of the results is that CCO dysfunction in the frontal lobe is a phenotypic mitochondrial change accompanying AD, which may contribute to the development of brain amyloidosis.

">Parameter scalability of multivariate Granger causality</a></h4>

              
                Estimating causal interactions between signals provides unique insights into their dynamics. In neuroscience, causal inference has been widely used in electrophysiological data to shed light on brain communication. Multivariate autoregressive models (MVAR) often form the basis of causal estimation methods. However, given the high-dimensionality of whole-brain data, MVARs can become too large for proper estimation, and reducing the dimensions to a reasonable range affects causal inference. In this study, we provide a clear, practical range for each parameter, motivate the choice of the causal estimation algorithm, and guide the optimization of model parameters for practical analyses. To that end, we simulate electrophysiological data with underlying causalities and estimate the causality with current algorithms based on MVAR models. We then model how the samples, signals, and MVAR order affect the performance and computation time of each algorithm. Our results indicate that, although all algorithms scale at least quadratically with the three parameters together, some are more sensitive to the number of signals and others to the number of samples. We further reveal that the number of samples required for accurate causal inference depends on the number of signals involved. Generally, more recent algorithms designed for robustness scale worse in computation time than older, simpler algorithms. Overall, this work highlights the need to consider scalability in Granger causality inference.

">Common Phenomenal and Neural Substrate Geometry in Visual Motion Perception.</a></h4>

              
                What is a possible physical substrate of the qualitative aspects of consciousness (qualia)? Answering this question is a central goal of consciousness research. Due to their subjective and ineffable nature, finding a quantitative way to characterise qualia from verbal description has thus far proven elusive. To overcome the challenge of expressing subjective experience, recent structural and relational approaches have been proposed from mathematics. Yet, as far as we know, no attempts have been made to evaluate the relationship between a certain structure of qualia and a structure of its possible underlying physical substrate. Towards this ambitious goal of linking qualia and the physical, we set out to make an empirical first step by focusing on qualia of visual motion in human participants and their possible neural substrate recorded in mouse primary visual cortex. From human participants (N=171), we obtained dissimilarity ratings of visual motion experiences induced by 48 stimuli, spanning across 8 directions and 6 spatial frequencies. Analysis revealed similarity structures of visual motion qualia that were disassociated from similarity structures purely expected from physical parameters or their combinations. From nine individual mice, we recorded single-neuron activity (n=751) with optical imaging in both awake and lightly anaesthetised conditions (isoflurane 0.6-0.8%, which retains neural responses and renders mice unresponsive to sensory stimulation). From neuron population responses to a similar set of motion stimuli, we computed a distance matrix that is comparable to our human dissimilarity matrix. Quantitative analyses show structural commonalities between human qualia structure and mouse neural structure, where a categorical organisation of stimulus direction best explains human qualia structure and mice neural activity. Interestingly, these commonalities held true for both awake and lightly anaesthetised conditions, leaving a possibility that mice may have been unresponsive but conscious of visual motion under light anaesthesia. Finally, we list several empirical factors that can be improved to promote our qualia structure approach in the future.

">Circadian phosphotimer generates time cues through PER dimerization-mediated trans-phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock generates autonomous molecular rhythms that regulate sleep cycles, chronotypes, daily physiology, and expression patterns of almost the entire genome. Temporal phosphorylation of PERIOD (PER) proteins creates a phosphotimer that is critical for clock function. Although previous studies show that PER stably binds the casein kinase CK1, cis-acting phosphorylation of PER by CK1 is not compatible with slow PER phosphorylation extended over 24 hrs. So how can PER phosphorylation be programmed in a slow and controlled manner? Here, we show that the timing cues are encoded by PER-PER dimerization-mediated trans-phosphorylation, which enables the necessary time delay in phosphorylation and slow phosphorylation. When PER dimerization is disrupted, PER phosphorylation and circadian rhythms are severely compromised. In mouse models with point mutations in the PER dimerization domain, circadian period is shortened to ~20 hrs, and the phase of wake/sleep cycles is dramatically advanced, switching a nocturnal animal to a half diurnal animal.

">Spared nerve injury induces long-term and brain region-specific changes in oligodendrocyte density in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Emerging evidence suggests a role for non-neuronal cells in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. Chronic pain causes profound alterations of the transcriptomic program of oligodendroglia, but the effect of pain on the oligodendroglial cells themselves remains unknown. Methods: Male and female C57BL6/J mice underwent spared nerve injury (SNI). Mechanical hypersensitivity was assessed five weeks later using the von Frey test. Six weeks post-surgery, mice were perfused, brains dissected, and immunostained for oligodendrocyte precursors cells (OPC) and mature oligodendrocytes (OL) in four brain regions involved in pain chronification: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), central amygdala (CeA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Results: We found OL were reduced in the ACC and CeA of both sexes six weeks after SNI. Conversely, BLA OL were increased in both sexes following SNI. There was a sex-dependent effect of SNI on PAG-OL, where OL were only reduced in females. SNI did not affect OPC in any of the studied brain regions, but female PAG and BLA appeared to have fewer OPC than males independent of SNI. Conclusion: Long-term nerve injury differentially affects OL in a brain region- and sex-dependent manner. This effect is observable six weeks after injury, suggesting a long-lasting impact of chronic pain on oligodendroglial cells. OPC, on the other hand, are remarkably stable. This finding aligns with previous literature showing OPC maintain homeostasis, even in pathological conditions.

">Molecular Logic of Cell Diversity and Circuit Connectivity in the REM Sleep Hub</a></h4>

              
                The complexity of the brain arises from the diversity of its circuits and the molecular heterogeneity of the cells that compose them. A mechanistic understanding therefore requires mapping cellular identity and connectivity at single-cell resolution. Here we define the cellular taxonomy of the murine sublaterodorsal tegmental nucleus (SLD), a critical hub for REM sleep, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We identified all major brain cell classes, with oligodendrocytes as the most abundant, and resolved seventeen transcriptionally distinct neuronal groups defined by neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neuropeptides, each with unique molecular signatures. Projection-specific analysis further revealed that glutamatergic subpopulations targeting the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and ventral medulla are molecularly distinct, marked by characteristic receptor motifs. Strikingly, we provide the first direct evidence that SLDGLUT neurons innervate the vlPAG. This newly uncovered SLDGLUT-vlPAG pathway represents a previously unrecognized circuit node for REM sleep regulation, with the potential to act as a REM-OFF population suppressing it. Together, these findings establish a transcriptionally resolved atlas of the SLD, reveal the molecular logic of its circuit connectivity, and nominate candidate molecular actuators of REM sleep control, opening new avenues for dissecting how brainstem circuits orchestrate REM state and its transitions.

">Meningeal macrophages exhibit diverse calcium signaling at steady-state and in response to aberrant cortical hyperexcitability in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                The meninges, which envelop and protect the brain, host a large number of resident macrophages that play a crucial role in regulating homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Intracellular Ca2+ signaling mediates a variety of macrophage functions. While diverse, ontogeny, transcriptional profiles, and phenotypes of meningeal macrophages have been described, little is known about their spatiotemporal Ca2+ signal dynamics in healthy and diseased states. Using two-photon functional Ca2+ imaging in a novel transgenic reporter mouse line, combined with an event-based Ca2+ signaling analysis pipeline, we comprehensively characterized the Ca2+ activity of meningeal macrophages both at steady-state and in response to cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), a pathophysiological brain hyperexcitability event, implicated in migraine, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. In homeostatic meninges of behaving mice, perivascular macrophages exhibit several Ca2+ activity features, including event duration and signal frequency spectrum, distinct from those of interstitial non-perivascular macrophages. The Ca2+ activity of dural perivascular macrophages is uniquely coupled to behaviorally driven diameter fluctuation of their associated vessels. Most perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages displayed propagating intracellular Ca2+ activity. Both macrophage subtypes also exhibit synchronized intercellular Ca2+ elevations, likely driven by an external factor. In response to CSD, the majority of perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages show a persistent decrease in their Ca2+ activity. Smaller subsets of both macrophage subtypes display either acute or persistent increases in Ca2+ activity, with the latter response mediated by CGRP/RAMP1 signaling. Collectively, our results highlight a previously unknown diversity of meningeal macrophage Ca2+ signaling at steady-state and in response to an aberrant brain hyperexcitability event.

">TDP-43 expression in the cytoplasm leads to early synaptic and mitochondrial abnormalities in an inducible mouse model of ALS/FTD</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 proteinopathy is the primary pathology associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), indicating that these neurodegenerative diseases have common underlying mechanisms. We have previously shown that transgenic (Tg) mice conditionally overexpressing a cytoplasmic form of human TDP-43 protein (TDP-43-{Delta}NLS) in forebrain neurons replicate key features of FTD/ALS, including altered cognitive, motor and social behaviors. These behavioral phenotypes and changes in plasticity-related gene expression can be detected as early as 1 month after Tg induction, before overt neurodegeneration occurs. To assess early ultrastructural features in this model, we performed Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis in the cortex (Ctx) and hippocampus (Hp) of Tg animals and their non-Tg controls. TEM evaluation of Ctx and Hp revealed that synaptic density was significantly decreased and synapse length was increased in both regions of Tg animals. Synaptic cleft thickness was increased and post-synaptic density thickness was decreased only in the Ctx of Tg mice, revealing differential regional effects in synaptic morphology. We analysed mitochondrial density and we found an increase in the Ctx and a decrease in the Hp of Tg animals, with preserved individual mitochondrial area. Lastly, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis from both transgenic TDP-43-{Delta}NLS mice and human proteinopathy showed widespread decreased expression of synaptic structure and function genes. The alterations in synaptic density and architecture reported here, combined with the mRNA/protein expression data, suggest that TDP-43-{Delta}NLS mice may exhibit abnormal synaptic transmission and that ultrastructural changes play a role in the early behavioral deficits observed in this model.

Older youth whose parents had mental health issues more frequently preferred solitude and/or were socially withdrawn (β = 0.04 to 0.14, CI = [0.002, 0.19], <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.05), both of which were associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors, depression, and anxiety (β = 0.25 to 0.45, CI = [0.20, 0.49], <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.05). Youth who preferred solitude and/or were socially withdrawn had lower cortical thickness in regions involved in social function (cuneus, insula, anterior cingulate, and superior temporal gyri) and/or mental health (β = −0.09 to −0.02, CI = [−0.14, −0.003], <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.05), and higher amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and basal ganglia volume (β = 2.62 to 668.10, CI = [0.13, 668.10], <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.05). Youth who often preferred solitude had more topologically segregated dorsal attention, temporoparietal, and social networks (β = 0.07 to 0.10, CI = [0.02, 0.14], <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> ≤ 0.03). Socially withdrawn youth had a less topologically robust and efficient (β = −0.05 to −0.80, CI = [−1.34,−0.01], <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.03) and more fragile cerebellum (β = 0.04, CI = [0.01, 0.07], <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that social isolation in adolescence may be a risk factor for widespread alterations in brain regions supporting social function and mental health.</span>

                <p>The sensorimotor system continuously uses error signals to remain precisely calibrated. We examined how attention influences this automatic and implicit learning process in humans (male and female). Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which attention was oriented either toward or away from the visual feedback that defined the error signal. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of sensorimotor adaptation. Using dual-task methods, we next examined the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused and divided attention conditions. However, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. These results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.</p>

                <p>The central amygdala (CeA) is an important neuronal hub that integrates external sensory inputs and information about internal states to regulate a range of innate and learned behaviors, including fear learning and memory. Prior studies, leveraging robust fear conditioning assays, have delineated detailed circuit mechanisms underlying the acquisition and recall of fear memories. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in the CeA remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the clock output molecule mWAKE/ANKFN1 within the CeA of male mice in fear learning and memory. mWAKE is expressed in multiple neuronal subclusters in the lateral CeA. Surprisingly, mWAKE levels do not exhibit rhythmic expression in the CeA. In line with this observation, expression of the core clock genes PER2 and BMAL also does not cycle in the CeA. Consistent with prior studies, loss of mWAKE function increases intrinsic excitability of CeA neurons. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of mWAKE and chemogenetic activation of CeA<sup>mWAKE</sup> neurons impair fear learning and memory. Finally, we show that mWAKE levels in a subset of CeA neurons are reduced following fear conditioning. These findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism modulating the activity and function of CeA neurons in fear learning and memory.</p>

                <p>While cerebrovascular dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis are extensively characterized hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the dynamic relationship between reactive astrocytes and cerebral vessels remains poorly understood. Here, we used jGCaMP8f and two-photon microscopy to investigate calcium signaling in multiple astrocyte subcompartments, concurrent with changes in cerebral arteriole activity, in fully awake 7- to 8-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice, a model for AD-like pathology, and wild-type (WT) littermates. In the absence of movement, spontaneous calcium transients in barrel cortex occurred more frequently in astrocyte somata, processes, and perivascular regions of 5xFAD mice. However, evoked arteriole dilations (in response to air puff stimulation of contralateral whiskers) and concurrent calcium transients across astrocyte compartments were reduced in 5xFAD mice relative to WTs. Synchronous activity within multicell astrocyte networks was also impaired in the 5xFAD group. Using a custom application to assess functional coupling between astrocyte end feet and immediately adjacent arteriole segments, we detected deficits in calcium response probability in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, end feet calcium transients following arteriole dilations exhibited a slower onset, reduced amplitude, and lacked relative proportionality to vasomotive activity compared with WTs. The results reveal nuanced alterations in 5xFAD reactive astrocytes highlighted by impaired signaling fidelity between astrocyte end feet and cerebral arterioles. The results have important implications for the mechanistic underpinnings of brain hypometabolism and the disruption of neurophysiologic communication found in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by mislocalization and aggregation of proteins in motor neurons. Ataxin-2 (ATXN2), an RNA-binding protein harboring 22-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats, is a risk factor for ALS, when its polyQ repeats are expanded to 27&ndash;33 repeats. However, the physiological function of ATXN2 beyond its role in RNA regulation and how polyQ expansion in ATXN2 increases risk for ALS remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that <I>Drosophila</I> Atx2 functions as a regulator of microtubule (MT) dynamics in motor neurons. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism underlying Atx2-mediated MT regulation and how polyQ expansion disrupts its function, using a mixed-sex population of <I>Drosophila</I> as a model system. Specifically, we show that Atx2 requires its RNA-binding Lsm domain to regulate MTs. Notably, the LSM domains of human ATXN2 rescue MT phenotype in <I>Drosophila</I>, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved role of ATXN2 in MT regulation. Importantly, we find that polyQ-expanded ATXN2 forms cytoplasmic aggregates and leads to excessive MT destabilization. Additionally, polyQ expansion severely impairs axon outgrowth. Finally, we identify uncoordinated-76 (UNC-76/FEZ1) as a downstream effector of Atx2 in MT regulation and neuronal development.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/40/e0702252025?rss=1">Mechanisms of Long-Term Nonexternally Reinforced Preference Change: Functional Connectivity Changes in a Longitudinal Functional MRI Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Behavioral change studies mostly focus on external reinforcements to modify preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) is a paradigm that influences preferences by the mere association of stimuli, sensory cues, and a rapid motor response, without external reinforcements. The behavioral effect has been shown to last for months after less than 1&nbsp;h of training. Here, we used a modified version of CAT by changing the neutral-cue to a number that represented a monetary amount of reward that the participants accumulate (i.e., incentive-cue). After a single training session, we compared behavioral performance and functional connectivity (FC), as measured by resting-state scans using functional magnetic resonance imaging, between two groups (total of 107 males and females in both groups), one receiving a neutral-cue and the other receiving an incentive-cue, at five time points across 1&nbsp;year. We replicated the maintenance of behavioral changes after 6&nbsp;months for the nonexternally reinforced neutral-cue participants, but not for the reinforced group. The reinforced training group showed higher FC within the limbic system, whereas the nonexternally reinforced group showed higher functional connectivity within and between default mode and dorsal attention networks. Our findings offer putative neural correlates for both reinforced and nonexternally reinforced preference changes that are maintained over time and which could be implemented in future behavioral change interventions.</p>

                <p>Behavioral outcomes are rarely certain, requiring subjects to discriminate between available choices by using feedback to guide future decisions. Probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) tasks test subjects&rsquo; ability to learn and flexibly adapt to changes in reward contingencies. Cortico-striatal circuitry has been broadly implicated in flexible decision-making&mdash;though what role these circuits play remains complicated. In this study we leveraged the fast temporal dynamics of local field potentials to precisely identify the role that cortico-striatal networks play during PRL reward feedback. We measured widespread (32-CH) local field potential activity of male Long&ndash;Evans rats during a PRL task wherein a target response delivered reward on 80% of trials while a non-target response delivered reward on 20% of trials. When subjects learned those reward probabilities, contingencies were reversed. We found that reward-evoked oscillations at beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) and high gamma (&gt;70&nbsp;Hz) frequencies marked positive reward valence and reflected probability of reward. Activity and connectivity at beta frequencies between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum during expected rewards were correlated with behavioral performance and specific aspects of value/exploitative behavior as defined by a reinforcement learning computational model. Finally, we found that modulating beta activity in orbitofrontal cortex with optogenetic (20&nbsp;Hz) stimulation promoted maladaptive behavior when stimulation was provided during non-target responses, consistent with our data and computational model predictions. Reward-evoked beta oscillations may reflect a crucial component underlying reward learning, and erroneous elevations in this physiological signal may contribute to maladaptive task performance and behavioral disruptions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/40/e1170252025?rss=1">Stopping Muscle Contractions and Relaxations during Action Inhibition Involves Global and Targeted Control Dependent on Muscle State</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mechanisms underpinning the stopping of muscle contractions and relaxations during action inhibition remain unclear. Central stop commands may be targeted and act on task-active muscles only, or instead be global, acting on task-passive muscles as well. We addressed this question in three stop signal task experiments with human participants (<I>n</I> = 54; 18 male, 36 female). While maintaining baseline force levels (10% MVC) in both index fingers, Go signals required participants to increase or decrease this force in the task-active finger (Task-active Contract vs Task-active Relax) while keeping activity in the task-passive muscle constant. On 30% of trials, delayed stop signals instructed participants to stop the task-active responses. Stop-related activity was detected in task-active muscles at the single trial level, using electromyography (EMG), and used to determine whether stop-related activity was also present in task-passive muscles. We found that stop commands act on both task-active and task-passive muscles, suggesting global control. This global control was furthermore muscle state specific, by decreasing muscle activity when stopping contractions and increasing muscle activity when stopping relaxations. However, stopping muscle contractions involved more sustained suppression of muscle activity in task-active than task-passive muscles, suggesting additional targeted control. This was not the case when stopping muscle relaxations, which only showed evidence of global control. Our results may explain how complex, real-world actions are inhibited. Global stop commands that are sensitive to muscle state may rapidly adjust muscle activity across the body, with additional control targeted to contracting, task-active muscles.</p>

                <p>The basal forebrain (BF) acts as a pivotal relay station in the transmission of arousal signals, projecting to both cortical and subcortical structures. Among its downstream targets is the lateral habenula (LHb), which recent research has implicated in the modulation of sleep rhythms and in mediating the loss of consciousness associated with anesthetic agents. In our study, we utilized optogenetic manipulation to selectively modulate the BF<sup>VGluT2/SOM</sup> neuron projection pathway to the LHb, thereby examining its impact on behavioral and electroencephalographic responses to isoflurane anesthesia. Our results demonstrated that in healthy adult male mice, the activation of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway significantly prolonged the induction time of anesthesia and shortened recovery time, consequently diminishing the anesthetic potency of isoflurane and reducing EEG <I></I> power. In contrast, the inhibition of this pathway yielded the inverse effects. Notably, modulation of the BF<sup>VGluT2</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway did not significantly affect the induction or recovery times of isoflurane anesthesia. Employing optogenetics in conjunction with calcium signal recording, we elucidated that the arousing effect of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb pathway is attributable to the enhanced inhibitory action of BF<sup>SOM</sup> neurons on LHb<sup>Glu</sup> neurons. This discovery sheds new light on the neural circuits involved in the loss and recovery of consciousness induced by anesthetic drugs, potentially informing future therapeutic strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/40/e1815242025?rss=1">The Extralemniscal System Modulates Early Somatosensory Cortical Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sudden and surprising sensory changes signal environmental events that may require immediate behavioral reactions. In mammals, these changes engage nonspecific "extralemniscal" thalamocortical pathways and evoke large and widespread cortical vertex potentials (VPs). Extralemniscal activity modulates cortical motor output in a variety of tasks and facilitates purposeful and immediate behavioral responses. In contrast, whether the extralemniscal system also affects cortical processing of sensory input transmitted through canonical "lemniscal" thalamocortical pathways remains unknown. Here we tested this hypothesis. In 23 healthy human participants (11 females) we continuously probed lemniscal processing in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) by measuring the early-latency evoked potentials elicited by a stream of high-frequency (9.5&nbsp;Hz) somatosensory electrical stimuli. We concurrently recorded extralemniscal activity by measuring the large VPs elicited by fast-rising and infrequent (~0.1&nbsp;Hz) auditory pure tones. We observed that the amplitude of S1 responses changes as a function of the phase of the VP, an effect consequent to a modulation of lemniscal input at the cortical rather than subcortical level. These findings demonstrate that a transient activation of the extralemniscal system interferes with ongoing cortical functions across different brain systems&mdash;i.e., not only at the level of the motor output but already at the sensory input&mdash;and thereby influences global brain dynamics.</p>

                <p>Acute restraint stress (RS) causes analgesia in humans and laboratory animals, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Recently, we have shown that a multinodal circuitry between the dorsal lateral septum (dLS), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) plays an instructive role in RS-induced analgesia (SIA). We found that the dLS neurons are activated when mice struggle to escape the restraint, and we wondered about the origin of the escape signals. Hence, we performed retrograde viral labeling from the dLS and found that the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), a known anatomical substrate for escape behaviors, provides inputs to the dLS. Through anatomical, behavioral, and in vivo fiber photometry, we show that the PAG and dLS neurons are synaptically connected; activation of either PAG or the postsynaptic dLS neurons is sufficient to cause analgesia and, when inhibited, cause hyperalgesia. Moreover, we found that the dLS neurons that receive inputs from PAG send axonal projections to the LHA. Together, our data indicate that the vlPAG neurons encoding nociceptive and escape behaviors provide synaptic inputs to the dLS&ndash;LHA&ndash;RVM circuitry to mediate acute restraint SIA in both male and female mice.</p>

                <p>A key process for successful working memory is to prioritize task-relevant information over distraction, i.e., to control attentional deployment. Here we investigate to what extent attentional control during a delayed match-to-sample task can be achieved when to-be-remembered items were presented unconsciously together with distracting information and with a prestimulus cue that indicated whether the target was likely to appear on the left or right side of the screen. This expectation was sometimes violated (20% of trials), requiring reorienting of attention to successfully solve the task. Moreover, the cue was uninformative of the exact location of the target, which could appear on the top, middle, or bottom part of the screen. Participants performed better than chance on unconscious trials only when the cue correctly indicated target side, suggesting an inability to reorient attention when the cues were invalid. Neural activity (fMRI BOLD signal change) in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex was significant for unconscious valid-cue trials and remained significant for invalid-cue trials only in the lateral prefrontal cortex, although neither region was significantly modulated by cue validity. Parietal regions did not show significant activation for valid or invalid unconscious stimuli. Thus, even though activity in brain regions associated with cognitive control reached significant levels for unconscious stimuli, there was no evidence for adaptive deployment of selective attention based on unconscious information, which was the case for conscious stimuli. The ability to control attentional deployment appears to differ between conscious and unconscious working memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-797/v2?src=rss">Multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and human development in Sub-Saharan Africa: A panel data analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The reintroduction of multiparty democracy in Sub-Saharan Africa during the early 90s and the persistent poor human development performance of the region, have sparked several controversies regarding the need for such a political system in Africa. In the extant literature, these controversies have been characterized by fierce theoretical debates as to whether multiparty democracy influences human development and the scholarly contention that social cohesion, rather than this form of democracy leads to development. Objectives The present study examines these controversies along with the perception of Sub-Saharan African populations concerning the democratic transition and its impact on their well-being. To this aim, the following objectives have been formulated: to determine the effect of multiparty democracy on human development; to determine the effect of social cohesion on human development; and to determine the effect of the interaction between multiparty democracy and social cohesion on human development. Methods A panel data analysis of 35 countries was conducted between 1995 and 2019 to test the research hypotheses. Fixed-effects and system generalized methods of moments estimations were used to control for specific characteristics. Results The study found that, multiparty democracy, social cohesion, and the interaction between these two variables have a positive long-term effect on human development. More importantly, the study revealed that social cohesion decreases the negative influence of multiparty democracy on human development. Conclusions Overall, the findings of this study suggest that multiparty democracy is likely to improve the well-being of the populations of Sub-Saharan Africa if the degree of social cohesion is sufficiently high. As such, social cohesion is critical in terms of the extent to which multiparty democracy wields influence on human development outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Based on these conclusions, the study calls for comprehensive policy interventions—ranging from institutional reforms to the implementation of home-grown policies—to achieve sustained human development in the region.

                Background Ankyrin 3 (Ankyrin G), encoded by the ANK3 gene, is a membrane-associated scaffold protein critical for neuronal signaling and highly enriched in axonal initial segments and nodes of Ranvier. ANK3 variants have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Objectives To identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANK3 associated with psychiatric disorders, assess population-specific significance, determine variant locations, and explore regulatory effects through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Methods A meta-analysis and systematic literature review were conducted to identify disease-associated SNPs in ANK3. QTL analyses were performed using datasets from the eQTL Catalogue and GTEx v10 to evaluate regulatory effects in brain tissues. Results Meta-analysis identified significant associations between ANK3 SNPs and psychiatric disorders. In bipolar disorder, rs10994336 (OR = 1.28, P = 1.04×10−4) was significant in European+North American populations; rs9804190 was protective in Europeans (OR = 0.88, P = 0.020); and rs1938526 was significant in both European+North American (OR = 1.32, P = 7.26×10−12) and Asian populations (OR = 1.08, P = 4.68×10−12), with an overall effect (OR = 1.17, P = 0.003). In schizophrenia, rs10761482 showed opposite effects: protective in Chinese (OR = 0.74, P = 0.002) and risk-associated in Iranian cohorts (OR = 1.57, P = 0.025). rs10994359 was protective in major depressive disorder in Asians (OR = 0.69, P = 0.016), and three SNPs reduced PTSD risk (OR = 0.48, P = 0.045). All significant variants were intronic. QTL analyses showed rs10761482 increased ANK3 expression in neocortex (P = 0.001) and neurons (P = 0.038); three PTSD SNPs showed robust cerebellar splicing effects (FDR = 0.010); and apaQTLs indicated modest 3′-UTR effects in putamen. Conclusion Multiple intronic ANK3 SNPs are significantly associated with psychiatric disorders and display tissue-specific regulatory effects. Integrating QTL data provides insights into their potential functional roles in neuropsychiatric pathogenesis.

                Background We are considering the statistical analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. As demonstrated in previous work, grouping voxels into regions (of interest) and carrying out a multiple test for signal detection on the basis of these regions typically leads to a higher sensitivity when compared with voxel-wise multiple testing approaches. Methods In the case of a multi-subject study, we propose to define the regions for each subject separately based on their individual brain anatomy, represented, e.g., by regional labels. The aggregation of the subject-specific evidence for the presence of signals in the different regions is then performed by means of a combination function for p-values. We validate the proposed methodology with simulated data and apply it to real fMRI data of a hypothesis-driven approach towards identifying brain regions involved in understanding software code. Results The results of our simulated data show that our proposed method demonstrated significantly higher power in detecting true activation. Testing our method on real fMRI data, we found that our approach yields overlapping results with a two-stage approach for which two independent experiments are needed, one for defining the regions and one for actual signal detection. Conclusions In this paper, we overall demonstrate that our method of utilizing anatomical information is a candidate to provide a more sensitive analysis of fMRI data.

                Objective This study examined the application of Modified Flanders Interaction Analysis during mathematics lessons in senior secondary schools in the Festac area of Lagos State, Nigeria. Methods The study employed a descriptive survey design to observe and analyse classroom interactions between teachers and students, focusing on verbal and non-verbal communication. Researchers used a structured observation schedule to collect data from a purposively selected sample of 10 mathematics teachers and 725 students across five schools. The researchers designed the instrument to collect information on teachers’ and students’ interaction patterns in the classroom. They analysed the data using mean scores, standard deviation, percentages, and t-test statistics, applying a 0.05 significance level for hypothesis testing. Findings The results of the analysis revealed that teachers dominate all the activities in the classroom; that is, the teachers were the active people in the classes, while the students were just passive listeners and moderate engagement through non-verbal behaviours. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between teacher and student patterns, particularly verbal behaviours. The study underscores that mathematics classes in senior secondary schools in the Festac area of Lagos State were teachers-centered. Conclusion Based on the study findings, the researchers recommended that mathematics teachers adopt more student-centered teaching approaches to enhance active student participation and engagement during lessons. Also, they should not be too strict, but they should be approachable, friendly, and accommodating so that the students will not be afraid to ask questions during or after the lesson, enhancing their performance. Hence, the government should ensure that teacher training programs incorporate observation techniques to effectively equip teachers with the skills to assess and improve classroom interaction.
