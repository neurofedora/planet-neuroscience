<p>Parkinson patients with mild cognitive impairment do not only show established motor (e.g., tremor and rigor) and nonmotor (e.g., depression and global cognitive impairment) symptoms. They also show deficits in some basic numerical functions: (non-) symbolic magnitude comparison and number line estimation In contrast, auditory and written transcoding skills were preserved.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have a huge impact on patients, caregivers, and the health care system. Until now, diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments in PD has been established based on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention, or working memory. However, specific numerical deficits observed in clinical practice have not yet been systematically investigated. PD-immanent deterioration of domain-general functions and domain-specific numerical areas suggests mechanisms of both primary and secondary dyscalculia. The current study systematically investigated basic number processing performance in PD patients for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of numerosity and the influence of domain-general factors. The overall sample consisted of patients with a diagnosis of PD, according to consensus guidelines, and healthy controls. PD patients were stratified into patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) or mild cognitive impairment (level I-PD-MCI based on cognitive screening). Basic number processing was assessed using transcoding, number line estimation, and (non-) symbolic number magnitude comparison tasks. Discriminant analysis was employed to assess whether basic number processing tasks can differentiate between a healthy control group and both PD groups. All participants were subjected to a comprehensive numerical and a neuropsychological test battery, as well as sociodemographic and clinical measures. Results indicate a profile of preserved (verbal representation) and impaired (magnitude representation, place × value activation) function in PD-MCI, hinting at basal ganglia dysfunction affecting numerical cognition in PD. Numerical deficits could not be explained by domain-general cognitive impairments, so that future research needs to incorporate domain-specific tasks of sufficient difficulty.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23647?af=R">Dissecting the Hippocampal Regulation of Approach‐Avoidance Conflict: Integrative Perspectives From Optogenetics, Stress Response, and Epigenetics</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Psychiatric disorders are multifactorial conditions without clear biomarkers, influenced by genetic, environmental, and developmental factors. Understanding these disorders requires identifying specific endophenotypes that help break down their complexity. Here, we undertake an in-depth analysis of one such endophenotype, namely imbalanced approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), reviewing its significant dependency on the hippocampus. Imbalanced AAC is a transdiagnostic endophenotype, being a feature of many psychiatric conditions in humans. However, it is predominantly examined in preclinical research through paradigms that subject rodents to conflict-laden scenarios. This review offers an original perspective by discussing the AAC through three distinct lights: optogenetic modulation of the AAC, which updates our understanding of the hippocampal contribution to behavioral inhibition; the impact of environmental stress, which exacerbates conflict and strengthens the stress-psychopathology axis; and inherent epigenetic aspects, which uncover crucial molecular underpinnings of environmental (mal) adaptation. By integrating these perspectives, in this review we aim to underline a cross-species causal nexus between heightened hippocampal activity and avoidance behavior. In addition, we suggest a rationale to explore epigenetic pharmacology as a potential strategy to tackle AAC-related psychopathology. This review assumes greater significance when viewed through the lens of advancing AAC-centric diagnostics in human subjects. Unlike traditional questionnaires, which struggle to accurately measure individual differences in AAC-related dimensions, new approaches using virtual reality and computer games show promise in better focusing the magnitude of AAC contribution to psychopathology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23644?af=R">Egr1 Expression Is Correlated With Synaptic Activity but Not Intrinsic Membrane Properties in Mouse Adult‐Born Dentate Granule Cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The discovery of adult-born granule cells (aDGCs) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus has raised questions regarding how they develop, incorporate into the hippocampal circuitry, and contribute to learning and memory. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate the intrinsic and synaptic excitability of mouse aDGCs as they matured, enabled by using a tamoxifen-induced genetic label to birth date the aDGCs at different animal ages. Importantly, we also undertook immunofluorescence studies of the expression of the immediate early gene Egr1 and compared these findings with the electrophysiology data in the same animals. We examined two groups of animals, with aDGC birthdating when the mice were 2 months and at 7–9 months of age. In both groups, cells 4 weeks old had lower thresholds for current-evoked action potentials than older cells but fired fewer spikes during long current pulses and responded more poorly to synaptic activation. aDGCs born in both 2 and 7–9-month-old mice matured in their intrinsic excitability and synaptic properties from 4–12 weeks postgenesis, but this occurred more slowly for the older age animals. Interestingly, this pattern of intrinsic excitability changes did not correlate with the pattern of Egr1 expression. Instead, the development of Egr1 expression was correlated with the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results suggest that in order for aDGCs to fully participate in hippocampal circuitry, as indicated by Egr1 expression, they must have developed enough synaptic input, in spite of the greater input resistance and reduced firing threshold that characterizes young aDGCs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23648?af=R">Distinct Ventral Hippocampus Network Properties in Dissociated Cultures</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Extensive research has been focused in the past century on structural, physiological, and molecular attributes of the hippocampus. This interest was created by the unique involvement of the hippocampus in cognitive and affective functions of the brain. Functional analysis revealed that the hippocampus has divergent properties along its axial dimension to the extent that the dorsal sector (dorsal hippocampus, DH) has different connections with the rest of the brain than those of the ventral sector (VH). Still, longitudinal pathways connect the DH with the VH and dampen the functional differences between the sectors. To be able to identify the intrinsic functional difference between the DH and VH, we produced dissociated monolayer cultures from prenatal DH and VH and examined their properties at 10–20 days after plating by imaging the spontaneous activity of the network using Fluo-2 AM, a calcium indicator. Surprisingly, while DH and VH sectors produced dissociated cultures with similar morphological attributes, VH cultures were more active spontaneously than DH cultures. Furthermore, when stimulated to produce action potentials, VH neurons triggered network bursts in postsynaptic neurons more often than DH cultures. Finally, in both DH and VH cultures, electrical stimulation of single cells produced network bursts in response to a burst of action potentials rather than to single spikes. These experiments indicate that even in dissociated cultures, neurons of the VH are more excitable and sensitive to electrical stimulation than DH; hence, they are more likely to generate network bursts and epileptic seizures, as suggested for in vivo brains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23641?af=R">Comparable Theta Phase Coding Dynamics Along the Transverse Axis of CA1</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Topographical projection patterns from the entorhinal cortex to area CA1 of the hippocampus have led to a hypothesis that proximal CA1 (pCA1, closer to CA2) is spatially more selective than distal CA1 (dCA1, closer to the subiculum). While earlier studies have shown evidence supporting this hypothesis, we recently showed that this difference does not hold true under all experimental conditions. In a complex environment with distinct local texture cues on a circular track and global visual cues, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable spatial selectivity. Correlated with the spatial selectivity differences, the earlier studies also showed differences in theta phase coding dynamics between pCA1 and dCA1 neurons. Here we show that there are no differences in theta phase coding dynamics between neurons in these two regions under the experimental conditions where pCA1 and dCA1 neurons are equally spatially selective. These findings challenge the established notion of dCA1 being inherently less spatially selective and theta modulated than pCA1 and suggest further experiments to understand theta-mediated activation of the CA1 sub-networks to represent space.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23642?af=R">Flexible Behavioral Adjustment to Frustrative Nonreward in Anticipatory Behavior, but Not in Consummatory Behavior, Requires the Dorsal Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HC) is recognized for its pivotal role in memory-related plasticity and facilitating adaptive behavioral responses to reward shifts. However, the nature of its involvement in the response to reward downshifts remains to be determined. To bridge this knowledge gap, we explored the HC's function through a series of experiments in various tasks involving reward downshifts and using several neural manipulations in rats. In Experiment 1, complete excitotoxic lesions of the HC impaired choice performance in a modified T-maze after reducing the quantity of sugar pellet rewards. In Experiment 2, chemogenetic inhibition of the dorsal HC (dHC) disrupted anticipatory behavior following a food-pellet reward reduction. Experiments 3–5 impaired HC function by using peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. This treatment, which induces peripheral inflammation affecting HC function, significantly increased cytokine levels in the dHC (Experiment 3) and impaired anticipatory choice behavior (Experiment 4). None of these dorsal hippocampal manipulations affected consummatory responses in animals experiencing sucrose downshifts. Accordingly, we found no evidence of increased neural activation in either the dorsal or ventral HC, as measured by c-Fos expression, after a sucrose downshift task involving consummatory suppression (Experiment 6). The results highlight the HC's pivotal role in adaptively modulating anticipatory behavior in response to a variety of situations involving frustrative nonreward, while having no effect on adjustments on consummatory behavior. The data supporting this conclusion were obtained under heterogeneous experimental conditions derived from a multi-laboratory collaboration, ensuring the robustness and high reproducibility of our findings. Spatial orientation, memory update, choice of reward signals of different values, and anticipatory versus consummatory adjustments to reward downshift are discussed as potential mechanisms that could account for the specific effects observed from HC manipulations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23643?af=R">Adult Neurogenesis and the Initiation of Social Aggression in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is important for social behavior and exhibits unusual structural plasticity in the form of continued production of new granule neurons throughout adulthood, but it is unclear how adult neurogenesis contributes to social interactions. In the present study, we suppressed neurogenesis using a pharmacogenetic mouse model and examined social investigation and aggression in adult male mice to investigate the role of hippocampal adult-born neurons in the expression of aggressive behavior. In simultaneous choice tests with stimulus mice placed in corrals, mice with complete suppression of adult neurogenesis in adulthood (TK mice) exhibited normal social investigation behaviors, indicating that new neurons are not required for social interest, social memory, or detection of and response to social olfactory signals. However, mice with suppressed neurogenesis displayed decreased offensive and defensive aggression in a resident-intruder paradigm, and less resistance in a social dominance test, relative to neurogenesis-intact controls, when paired with weight and strain-matched (CD-1) mice. During aggression tests, TK mice were frequently attacked by the CD-1 intruder mice, which never occurred with WTs, and normal CD-1 male mice investigated TK mice less than controls when corralled in the social investigation test. Importantly, TK mice showed normal aggression toward prey (crickets) and smaller, nonaggressive (olfactory bulbectomized) C57BL/6J intruders, suggesting that mice lacking adult neurogenesis do not avoid aggressive social interactions if they are much larger than their opponent and will clearly win. Taken together, our findings show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in the instigation of intermale aggression, possibly by weighting a cost–benefit analysis against confrontation in cases where the outcome of the fight is not clear.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in the hypothalamus, in conjunction with the hippocampus (HPC), has been implicated through theta oscillations in various brain functions ranging from locomotion to learning and memory. While the indispensable role of the SuM in HPC theta generation in anesthetized animals is well-characterized, the SuM is not always necessary for HPC theta in awake animals. This raises questions on the precise behavioral relevance of SuM theta activity and its interaction with HPC theta activity. We used simultaneously recorded SuM and HPC local field potentials (LFPs) in a one-day water maze (WM) learning paradigm in rats (<i>n</i> = 8), to show that theta activities recorded from the SuM itself were not positively correlated with locomotor (swimming) speed nor acceleration, but the individual relationship between acceleration and SuM theta frequency is correlated with WM learning rates. In contrast, we found that SuM-HPC theta phase coherence is strongly correlated with swimming speed and acceleration, but these do not relate to WM learning. SuM-HPC-directed coherence analysis demonstrated no swimming kinetics nor learning rate associations, but revealed that periods of high SuM-HPC theta phase coherence are driven by the SuM at relatively low (~6.2 Hz) frequencies. Additionally, we demonstrate that the SuM and the HPC also engage in non-random, non-coherent phase coupling modes where either structure preferentially displays a ± 2 Hz difference with the other. Our data indicate SuM theta LFPs do not appear to be related to either speed coding or spatial learning in swimming rats and display non-random out-of-phase theta frequency coupling with the HPC.</p>

">PrP turnover in vivo and the time to effect of prion disease therapeutics</a></h4>

              
                PrP lowering is effective against prion disease in animal models and is being tested clinically. Therapies in the current pipeline lower PrP production, leaving pre-existing PrP to be cleared according to its own half-life. We hypothesized that PrPs half-life may be a rate-limiting factor for the time to effect of PrP-lowering drugs, and one reason why late treatment of prion-infected mice is not as effective as early treatment. Using isotopically labeled chow with targeted mass spectrometry, as well as antisense oligonucleotide treatment followed by timed PrP measurement, we estimate a half-life of 5-6 days for PrP in the brain. PrP turnover is not affected by over- or under-expression. Mouse PrP and human PrP have similar turnover rates measured in wild-type or humanized knock-in mice. CSF PrP appears to mirror brain PrP in real time in rats. PrP is more readily quantifiable in colon than in other peripheral organs, and appears to have a shorter half-life in colon than in brain. Our data may inform the design of both preclinical and clinical studies of PrP-lowering drugs.

">Impact of adolescent high-fat diet and psychosocial stress on neuroendocrine stress responses and binge eating behavior in adult male Lewis rats</a></h4>

              
                Childhood obesity is a multifactorial disease affecting more than 160 million adolescents worldwide. Adolescent exposure to obesogenic environments, characterized by access to high-fat diets and stress, precipitates maladaptive eating habits in adulthood such as binge eating. Evidence suggests a strong association between Western-like high-saturated-fat (WD) food consumption and dysregulated hormone fluctuations. However, few studies have explored the long-term impact of adolescent WD and psychosocial stress on brain and behavior. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate the impact of adolescent exposure to an obesogenic diet on stress resiliency and increased susceptibility for binge-like eating behaviors. Adolescent male Lewis rats were given WD (41% fat; n=40) or control diet (CD, 16% fat; n=38) for 4 weeks before undergoing a stress paradigm of predator exposure and social instability (CDE, WDE, CDU, WDU; n=16/group). Subjects were provided intermittent WD access (24 h/week) to evaluate binge eating-like behavior in adulthood. Fecal corticosterone and testosterone were measured at four timepoints throughout adolescence and adulthood. WD rats exhibited increased body weight (p = 0.0217) and elevated testosterone in mid-adolescence (p=0.0312) and blunted stress-induced corticosterone response in mid-late adolescence (CDE:WDE, p=0.028). Adolescent hormone levels were negatively correlated with bingeing and explained the variability between adult rats expressing hyperphagic and hypophagic behaviors. These results demonstrate that exposure to WD in adolescence disrupts hormone fluctuations and stress responsivity, with effects persisting into adulthood. This underscores the importance of addressing obesogenic environments early to mitigate their lasting impact on hormone regulation and stress responsiveness.

">Chemogenetic Breakdown of the Dentate Gate Causes Seizures and Spatial Memory Deficits</a></h4>

              
                The dentate gyrus has often been posited to act as a gate that dampens highly active afferent input into the hippocampus. Effective gating is thought to prevent seizure initiation and propagation in the hippocampus and support learning and memory processes. Pathological changes to DG circuitry that occur in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) can increase DG excitability and impair its gating ability which can contribute to seizures and cognitive deficits. There is evidence that TLE pathologies and seizures may independently contribute to learning and memory deficits in TLE through distinct mechanisms. These two factors are difficult to untangle since TLE pathologies can drive seizures, and seizures can worsen TLE pathologies. Here we assessed whether chemogenetically increasing dentate granule cell (DGC) excitability was enough to break down the dentate gate in the absence of TLE pathologies. We found that increasing excitability specifically in DGCs caused seizures in non-epileptic mice. Importantly, due to the modulatory nature of DREADD effects, seizures were driven by intrinsic circuit activity rather than direct activation of DGCs. These seizures resulted in a spatial memory deficit when induced after training in the spatial object recognition task and showed stereotypical patterns of activity in miniscope calcium recordings. Our results provide direct support for the dentate gate hypothesis since seizures could be induced in non-epileptic animals by artificially degrading the dentate gate with chemogenetics in the absence of epilepsy pathologies.

">Heat Acclimation in Mice Requires Preoptic BDNF Neurons and Postsynaptic Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                Heat acclimation (HA) is a key adaptive response in mammals to repeated heat exposure, essential for fitness and survival1-3. HA improves cardiovascular function, thermal comfort, and exercise capacity4, 5. However, the lack of a genetically tractable model has hindered understanding of the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying HA. Here, we show that 10 days of daily 38{degrees}C exposure lowers core body temperature (Tcore) and reduces anxiety during subsequent heat exposures in mice. HA increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the medial preoptic area (MPO). BDNF-expressing MPO neurons (MPOBDNF) show increased intrinsic heat sensitivity after HA. These neurons orchestrate downstream targets in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and rostral raphe pallidus (rRPa) to mediate HA effects. BDNF, acting through its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) in the DMH, facilitates the anxiolytic effect of HA by enhancing excitatory synaptic connections between MPOBDNF and DMH neurons. This study provides new insights into HA mechanisms, setting the stage for future research on heat stress reduction and exercise optimization.

">Type I interferon signaling enhances kainic acid-induced seizure severity</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, yet the role and mechanisms of type I interferon (IFN) signaling in seizure conditions remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that type I IFN signaling exacerbates seizure phenotypes in a kainic acid-induced seizure mouse model. We found that the absence of type I IFN signaling in Ifnar1-/- mice led to decreased neuronal excitability and microglial activation in response to kainic acid stimulation. Conversely, intracerebroventricular injection of IFN-{beta} heightened the severity of kainic acid-induced seizures. In vitro calcium imaging revealed that IFN-{beta} treatment amplified both basal and kainic acid-induced neuronal excitability, though no significant difference was observed in basal neuronal excitability between wild-type and Ifnar1-/- neurons. Furthermore, Ifnar1-/- mice exhibited reduced mTOR activation in the brain following kainic acid administration. Consistent with this finding, IFN-{beta} treatment induced mTOR activation, as indicated by S6 phosphorylation in in vitro mixed glial cultures. Taken together, these results demonstrate the critical role of type I IFN signaling in seizure pathogenesis and suggest that targeting type I IFNs could be a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing seizure severity and mitigating epilepsy.

">WMH-DualTasker: A Dual-Task Deep Learning Model with Self-supervised Consistency for Automated Segmentation and Visual Rating of White matter Hyperintensities - a Multicentre study</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH) are neuroimaging markers linked to an elevated risk of cognitive decline. WMH severity is typically assessed via visual rating scales and through volumetric segmentation. While visual rating scales are commonly used in clinical practice, they offer limited descriptive power. In contrast, supervised volumetric segmentation requires manually annotated masks, which is labor-intensive and challenging to scale for large studies. Therefore, our goal was to develop an automated deep learning model that can provide accurate and holistic quantification of WMH severity with minimal supervision.

MethodsWe developed WMH-DualTasker, a deep learning model that simultaneously performs voxel-wise segmentation and visual rating score prediction. The model leverages self-supervised, transformation-invariant consistency constraints, using WMH visual ratings from clinical settings as the sole supervisory signal. Additionally, we assessed its clinical utility by applying it to identify individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to predict dementia conversion.

FindingsThe volumetric quantification performance of WMH-DualTasker was either superior to or on par with existing supervised methods, as demonstrated on the MICCAI-WMH dataset (N=60, Dice=0.602) and the SINGER dataset (N=64, Dice=0.608). Furthermore, the model exhibited strong agreement with clinical visual rating scales on an external dataset (SINGER, MAE=1.880, K=0.77). Importantly, WMH severity metrics derived from WMH-DualTasker improved predictive performance beyond conventional clinical features for MCI classification (AUC=0.718, p<0.001), MCI conversion prediction (AUC=0.652, p<0.001) using the ADNI dataset.

InterpretationsWMH-DualTasker substantially reduces the reliance on labor-intensive manual annotations, facilitating more efficient and scalable quantification of WMH severity in large-scale population studies. This innovative approach has the potential to advance preventive and precision medicine by enhancing the assessment and management of vascular cognitive impairment associated with WMH.

                Sortilin C-terminal fragments (sorfra) can co-deposit in {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques in human brain. However, sorfra plaques develop in the cerebrum with a spatiotemporal trajectory as of tauopathy. Here we examined sorfra pathogenesis relative to neuritic plaque evolution in the human brains with amyloid and tau pathologies converged in the neocortex and hippocampus. Sorfra plaques occurred in correlation with pTau/tangle, but not A{beta}, pathologies across cerebral regions, neighboring cortical/hippocampal areas, and along the sulcal valley to gyral hilltop transition. Sorfra plaques and neuritic plaques were matchable in location, shape and size between consecutive sections, and were colocalized in double-labeling preparations. Microscopical study and tissue clearance three-dimensional imaging revealed sorfra/A{beta} colocalized as well as independent plaques. Among the former, sorfra labeling correlated negatively to A{beta}/amyloid labeling and {beta}-secretase-1 labeling in dystrophic neurites. Sorfra plaques were depleted of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) labeled neuronal somata and dendrites, whereas normal looking MAP2/sortilin co-labeled profiles occurred nearby. Sorfra deposits were seen in astrocytes but not microglia around the plaques. Taken together, sorfra plaques are anatomically matchable to silver stained neuritic plaques. They develop with tangle-related somatodendritic degeneration, presenting as nonamyloid growth of the A{beta} plaques and formation of A{beta}-independent neuritic plaques during Alzheimers disease pathogenesis.

">Attention-dependent attribute comparisons underlie multi-attribute decision-making in orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Economic decisions often require weighing multiple dimensions, or attributes. The orbitofrontal cortex FC) is thought to be important for computing the integrated value of an option from its attributes and comparing lues to make a choice. Although OFC neurons are known to encode integrated values, evidence for value mparison has been limited. Here, we used a multi-attribute choice task for monkeys to investigate how OFC eurons integrate and compare multi-attribute options. Attributes were represented separately and eye tracking as used to measure attention. We found that OFC neurons encode the value of attended attributes, dependent of other attributes in the same option. Encoding was negatively weighted by the value of the same tribute in the other option, consistent with a comparison between the two like attributes. These results indicate at OFC computes comparisons among attributes rather than integrated values, and does so dynamically, ifting with the focus of attention.

">Functional Connectivity Alterations in Cocaine Use Disorder: Insights from the Triple Network Model and the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment Framework</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine use disorder (CUD) disrupts functional connectivity within key brain networks, specifically the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). While the triple network model has been proposed to explain various psychiatric disorders, its applicability to CUD requires further exploration. In the present study, we built machine learning classifiers based on different combinations of DMN/SN/CEN to distinguish cocaine-use disorder (CUD) subjects from healthy control (HC) subjects. Among them, the combination of the SN and the CEN results in a remarkably high accuracy of 73.4% (sensitivity/specificity: 69.6%/78.6%, AUC: 0.78), outperforming the model based on the full triple network. This supports the hypothesis that during the binge/intoxication stage of addiction, the SN and the CEN play a more critical role than the DMN, consistent with the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) framework. Functional connectivity analysis revealed decreased connectivity within the DMN and the SN and increased connectivity within the CEN in CUD patients, suggesting that alterations in these networks could serve as biomarkers for addiction severity.

">Morphological brain alterations and morphological brain network disorganizations in heroin and methamphetamine abstinent patients</a></h4>

              
                Heroin and methamphetamine are the two common types of drugs abused, which poses significant health risks. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of drug addiction on human brain are unclear. In this study, we collected T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 26 heroin abstinent (HA) patients, 24 methamphetamine abstinent (MA) patients and 32 healthy controls. Four surface-based morphological features including cortical thickness (CT), fractal dimension (FD), gyrification index (GI), and sulcal depth (SD) were calculated, and further used to construct the morphological brain networks. We observed the common CT reductions of the right TE 1.0 and TE 1.2 and SD reductions of the right intermediate lateral area 20 for HA and MA patients, HA-specific CT reductions in the left area 2, and the MA-specific GI reductions in the left medial area 6 and right dorsomedial parietooccipital sulcus. For the morphological brain networks, HA patients exhibited the global disorganizations (higher shortest path length) in CT-based networks, whereas MA patients showed the disrupted nodal efficiency of the left medial area 38 in CT-based networks, the right caudal area 7 in GI-based networks, and the right inferior occipital gyrus in SD-based networks. Furthermore, the altered SD of HA patients and disrupted nodal efficiency of MA patients were associated with drug abuse-related clinical variables. Our findings suggest the morphological index-dependent effects of drug addiction on human brain morphology, and indicate the differential neural mechanism underlying heroin and methamphetamine abuses which attack the global and local information transfer of morphological brain networks, respectively.

	<p>Background: Hypofunction of the glutamate system in the brain is one of the pathophysiological hypotheses for schizophrenia. Accumulating animal and clinical studies show that sarcosine (N-methylglycine), a glycine transporter-1 inhibitor, is effective in ameliorating the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were to observe the effects of sarcosine on neuronal activity in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) hippocampal neurons within an NMDA receptor hypofunction model induced by MK801. Methods: We applied in vivo calcium imaging to observe the dynamics of fluorescence from the dCA1 hippocampal neurons when the mice were exploring in an open field. Using this tool, we directly measured and compared neuronal properties between sarcosine-treated and untreated mice. At the same time, the physiological function of the neurons was also quantified by measuring their place fields. Results: Our data demonstrated that MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg) diminished the fluorescence intensity of dCA1 neurons that had been genetically modified with a calcium indicator. MK-801 also significantly increased the correlation coefficient between the fluorescence dynamics of pairs of cells, a feature that may be linked to the symptom of disorganization in human patients with schizophrenia. The spatial correlations of place fields in the mice were impaired by MK-801 as well. Injected sarcosine (500 mg or 1000 mg/kg) significantly alleviated the abovementioned abnormalities. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence to support the use of sarcosine to alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia, especially hippocampus-related functions.</p>

	<p>Background. To investigate the behavior of spiking neural networks (SNNs), the sensitivity of input perturbation serves as an effective metric for assessing the influence on the network output. However, existing methods fall short in evaluating the sensitivity of SNNs featuring biologically plausible leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons due to the intricate neuronal dynamics during the feedforward process. Methods. This paper first defines the sensitivity of a temporal-coded spiking neuron (SN) as the deviation between the perturbed and unperturbed output under a given input perturbation with respect to overall inputs. Then, the sensitivity algorithm of an entire SNN is derived iteratively from the sensitivity of each individual neuron. Instead of using the actual firing time, the desired firing time is employed to derive a more precise analytical expression of the sensitivity. Moreover, the expectation of the membrane potential difference is utilized to quantify the magnitude of the input deviation. Results/Conclusions. The theoretical results achieved with the proposed algorithm are in reasonable agreement with the simulation results obtained with extensive input data. The sensitivity also varies monotonically with changes in other parameters, except for the number of time steps, providing valuable insights for choosing appropriate values to construct the network. Nevertheless, the sensitivity exhibits a piecewise decreasing tendency with respect to the number of time steps, with the length and starting point of each piece contingent upon the specific parameter values of the neuron.</p>

	<p>Background: Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of vision, commonly caused by strabismus or anisometropia during early childhood. While studies demonstrated that perceptual learning improves visual acuity and stereopsis in adults with amblyopia, accompanying changes in visual cortical function remain unclear. Methods: We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses before and after perceptual learning in seven adults with amblyopia. Our learning tasks involved dichoptic high-attention-demand tasks that avoided V1 function-related tasks and required high-level cortical functions (e.g., intraparietal sulcus) to train the amblyopic eye. Results: Perceptual learning induced low-level visual cortical function changes, which were strongly associated with the etiology of amblyopia and visual function improvements. Anisometropic amblyopes showed functional improvements across all regions of interest (ROIs: V1, V2, V3, V3A, and hV4), along with improvements in visual acuity and stereoacuity. In contrast, strabismic amblyopes showed robust improvements in visual cortical functions only in individuals who experienced significant gains in visual acuity and stereoacuity. Notably, improvements in V1 functions were significantly correlated with the magnitude of visual acuity and stereoacuity improvements when combining both anisometropic and strabismic amblyopes. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that learning occurs in both high-level and low-level cortical processes. Our study suggests that early intervention to correct eye alignment (e.g., strabismus surgery) is critical for restoring both visual and cortical functions in strabismic amblyopia.</p>

Blood coagulation is a vital physiological process involving a complex network of biochemical reactions, which converge to form a blood clot that repairs vascular injury. This process unfolds in three phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation, ultimately leading to thrombin formation. Coagulation begins when tissue factor (TF) is exposed on an injured vessel’s wall. The first step is when activated factor VII (VIIa) in the plasma binds to TF, forming complex TF:VIIa, which activates factor X. Activated factor X (Xa) is necessary for coagulation, so the regulation of its activation is crucial. Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) is a critical regulator of the initiation phase as it inhibits the activation of factor X. While previous studies have proposed two pathways—direct and indirect binding—for TFPI’s inhibitory role, the specific biochemical reactions and their rates remain ambiguous. Many existing mathematical models only assume an indirect pathway, which may be less effective under physiological flow conditions. In this study, we revisit datasets from two experiments focused on activated factor X formation in the presence of TFPI. We employ an adaptive Metropolis method for parameter estimation to reinvestigate a previously proposed biochemical scheme and corresponding rates for both inhibition pathways. Our findings show that both pathways are essential to replicate the static experimental results. Previous studies have suggested that flow itself makes a significant contribution to the inhibition of factor X activation. We added flow to this model with our estimated parameters to determine the contribution of the two inhibition pathways under these conditions. We found that direct binding of TFPI is necessary for inhibition under flow. The indirect pathway has a weaker inhibitory effect due to removal of solution phase inhibitory complexes by flow.

Mosquitoes transmit medically important human pathogens, including viruses like dengue virus and parasites such as <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., the causative agent of malaria. Mosquito microbiomes are critically important for the ability of mosquitoes to transmit disease-causing agents. However, while large collections of bacterial isolates and genomic data exist for vertebrate microbiomes, the vast majority of work in mosquitoes to date is based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon data that provides limited taxonomic resolution and no functional information. To address this gap and facilitate future studies using experimental microbiome manipulations, we generated a bacterial Mosquito-Associated Isolate Collection (MosAIC) consisting of 392 bacterial isolates with extensive metadata and high-quality draft genome assemblies that are publicly available, both isolates and sequence data, for use by the scientific community. MosAIC encompasses 142 species spanning 29 bacterial families, with members of the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> comprising 40% of the collection. Phylogenomic analysis of 3 genera, <i>Enterobacter</i>, <i>Serratia</i>, and <i>Elizabethkingia</i>, reveal lineages of mosquito-associated bacteria isolated from different mosquito species in multiple laboratories. Investigation into species’ pangenomes further reveals clusters of genes specific to these lineages, which are of interest for future work to test for functions connected to mosquito host association. Altogether, we describe the generation of a physical collection of mosquito-associated bacterial isolates, their genomic data, and analyses of selected groups in context of genome data from closely related isolates, providing a unique, highly valuable resource for research on bacterial colonisation and adaptation within mosquito hosts. Future efforts will expand the collection to include broader geographic and host species representation, especially from individuals collected from field populations, as well as other mosquito-associated microbes, including fungi, archaea, and protozoa.

                Background/Objective Weight stigma has significant psychological and social implications, yet studies on perspective-taking as an intervention strategy remain scarce. This study aimed to investigate the effect of perspective-taking on weight stigma among Chinese university students and examine the potential mediating role of common ingroup identity. Methods A randomized controlled experiment with 202 Chinese university students (experimental group, perspective-taking group: n = 102; control group: n = 100) was conducted. Weight stigma was measured pre- and post-intervention using the Anti-Fat Attitudes Test. The study employed a 2 × 2 mixed design with ANCOVA and mediation analysis. Results The experimental group showed significantly lower post-test weight stigma when controlling for pre-test scores (F(1, 199) = 25.69, p < .001). Perspective-taking engagement was significantly higher in the experimental group (t = 3.13, p = .002). Common ingroup identity negatively correlated with post-test weight stigma (r = -.28, p < .001) but did not significantly mediate the perspective-taking and weight stigma reduction relationship. Conclusion Perspective-taking effectively reduces weight stigma among Chinese university students, contributing to stigma reduction strategies in university settings. Further research on underlying mechanisms is warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1369/v1?src=rss">Financial inclusion and stability in Ethiopia using bank-level data: A two-step system GMM estimation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper examines the impact of financial inclusion on bank stability within Ethiopian context, using panel data from 17 commercial banks over the period 2015-2023. Given the scarcity of research focused on the relationship between financial inclusion and bank stability in Ethiopia, this paper seeks to address a crucial gap by analyzing both conventional and digital aspects of financial inclusion in relation with bank stability. Methods A two-stage principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to construct a composite financial inclusion index, integrating 10 conventional and 5 digital indicators. The study applied a two-step robust system generalized method of moments (GMM) to examine the effects of financial inclusion on bank stability, complemented by Granger causality testing to examine the directionality of this relationship. Results The result reveals a significant positive effect of financial inclusion on bank stability and Granger causality tests confirms a bi-directional relationship between financial inclusion and stability, indicating that improvements in financial inclusion foster greater stability and vice versa. Our results also highlight that while bank efficiency and GDP growth rate positively effect stability, total assets and income diversification exhibit detrimental effects. Conclusions It is essential to capitalize policy synergies to promote bank stability and to enhance financial inclusion through conventional and digital channels, while carefully managing the implications of risks associated with income diversification and asset distribution. Ensuring inclusive financial system is vital for maintaining bank stability, thus positioning it as a key priority for financial institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1368/v1?src=rss">Performance of Forensic Age Estimation by Aspartic Acid Racemization and DNA Methylation: A Systematic Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Forensic age estimation is not difficult when the body is found in good condition, but in cases of severe decomposition or damage, such as burnt or separated body parts, then the analysis can only be done with bones and teeth. There has been abundant research and development in the field of related biochemistry over the years. Various molecular changes occur in hard tissues and long-lived proteins, such as those in bones and teeth during the physiological process of aging. Aspartic acid racemization and DNA methylation are still the most frequently used age estimation methods because of their advantages in accuracy. Method This study aimed to compare the accuracy of DNA methylation and aspartic acid racemization methods for age estimation. Journal articles were searched in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar of 2017-2022 according to PRISMA guidelines. Result Twelve journal articles were eligible for review. The DNA methylation method is quite simple to use because of commercially available methylation kits. Furthermore, the results can be obtained relatively quickly without requiring many samples, and the method is less sensitive to thermal and other damage than the aspartic acid racemization method. Conclusion The aspartic acid racemization method for age estimation has high accuracy, especially in determining age at death. However, temperature and the condition of the teeth affect the racemization of aspartic acid. Given that DNA methylation is generally stable in a wide range of temperatures, it provides a better approach to determining the chronological age even from charred remains.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1367/v1?src=rss">“Unmasking the Uncommon”: A case series of multi-drug resistant Elizabethkingia meningoseptica causing late-onset sepsis and meningitis in preterm neonates [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an uncommon nosocomial pathogen that causes meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis in neonates and in immunocompromised individuals. It exhibits resistance to many commonly employed first-line antibiotics used to treat gram-negative pathogens. Herein, we present three cases of late-onset sepsis with multi-drug resistant (MDR) Elizabethkingia meningoseptica in high-risk neonates. Case 1 was a one-day-old preterm low-birth-weight infant who presented with respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. The patient was intubated and administered empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents. Blood culture grew Candida krusei, hence Amphotericin B was initiated. Repeat blood culture on day 27 showed gram-negative bacilli, identified as Elizabethkingia meningoseptica by MALDI-TOF . Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) revealed resistance to Piperacillin/Tazobactam, but sensitivity to Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Minocycline. IV Vancomycin was administered, which resulted in clinical improvement and negative blood culture results. Case 2 was an eleven-day-old preterm, low-birth-weight baby who presented with fever. Initial investigations revealed normal complete blood counts (CBC) parameters and elevated CRP levels. Blood and CSF cultures isolated Elizabethkingia meningoseptica with a similar AST pattern. Intravenous Ciprofloxacin was initiated with clinical improvement and negative follow-up blood cultures. Case 3 was a one-day-old preterm baby, appropriate-to-gestational age, presenting with respiratory distress syndrome. The infant was intubated and started on inotropic support and intravenous antibiotics. Blood cultures on day 4 showed Elizabethkingia meningoseptica and Vancomycin was started. Follow-up cultures on days 6 and 14 grew Acinetobacter baumannii. A combination of Levofloxacin and Colistin was added, and blood cultures were negative after seven days, with clinical improvement. Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a significant cause of hospital-acquired infections, especially in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), leading to outbreaks. Clinicians must have a high degree of suspicion of E. meningoseptica for gram-negative bacilli causing sepsis and meningitis in high-risk patients. Recent technological advances have enabled accurate speciation to guide therapy and reduce morbidity and mortality rates.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), the most common pathology associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), is not always visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), causing surgical delays and reduced postsurgical seizure-freedom. We developed an open-source software to characterize and localize HS to aid the presurgical evaluation of children and adults with suspected TLE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included a multicenter cohort of 365 participants (154 HS; 90 disease controls; 121 healthy controls). HippUnfold was used to extract morphological surface-based features and volumes of the hippocampus from T1-weighted MRI scans. We characterized pathological hippocampi in patients by comparing them to normative growth charts and analyzing within-subject feature asymmetries. Feature asymmetry scores were used to train a logistic regression classifier to detect and lateralize HS. The classifier was validated on an independent multicenter cohort of 275 patients with HS and 161 healthy and disease controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>HS was characterized by decreased volume, thickness, and gyrification alongside increased mean and intrinsic curvature. The classifier detected 90.1% of unilateral HS patients and lateralized lesions in 97.4%. In patients with MRI-negative histopathologically-confirmed HS, the classifier detected 79.2% (19/24) and lateralized 91.7% (22/24). The model achieved similar performances on the independent cohort, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new data. Individual patient reports contextualize a patient's hippocampal features in relation to normative growth trajectories, visualise feature asymmetries, and report classifier predictions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Automated and Interpretable Detection of Hippocampal Sclerosis (AID-HS) is an open-source pipeline for detecting and lateralizing HS and outputting clinically-relevant reports. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Systems consolidation theories propose two mechanisms that enable the behavioral integration of related memories: coordinated reactivation between hippocampus and cortex, and the emergence of cortical traces that reflect overlap across memories. However, there is limited empirical evidence that links these mechanisms to the emergence of behavioral integration over time. In two experiments, participants implicitly encoded sequences of objects with overlapping structure. Assessment of behavioral integration showed that response times during a recognition task reflected behavioral priming between objects that never occurred together in time but belonged to overlapping sequences. This priming was consolidation-dependent and only emerged for sequences learned 24 hr prior to the test. Critically, behavioral integration was related to changes in neural pattern similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increases in post-learning rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and lateral occipital cortex. These findings suggest that memories with a shared predictive structure become behaviorally integrated through a consolidation-related restructuring of the learned sequences, providing insight into the relationship between different consolidation mechanisms that support behavioral integration.

                Astrocytes derive from different lineages and play a critical role in neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI). Whether selectively eliminating these main origins of astrocytes in lumbar enlargement could attenuate SCI-induced neuropathic pain remains unclear. Through transgenic mice injected with an adeno-associated virus vector and diphtheria toxin, astrocytes in lumbar enlargement were lineage traced, targeted, and selectively eliminated. Pain-related behaviors were measured with an electronic von Frey apparatus and a cold/hot plate after SCI. RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, molecular experiment, and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the potential mechanisms after astrocyte elimination. Lineage tracing revealed that the resident astrocytes but not ependymal cells were the main origins of astrocytes-induced neuropathic pain. SCI-induced mice to obtain significant pain symptoms and astrocyte activation in lumbar enlargement. Selective resident astrocyte elimination in lumbar enlargement could attenuate neuropathic pain and activate microglia. Interestingly, the type I interferons (IFNs) signal was significantly activated after astrocytes elimination, and the most activated Gene Ontology terms and pathways were associated with the type I IFNs signal which was mainly activated in microglia and further verified in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, different concentrations of interferon and Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist could activate the type I IFNs signal in microglia. These results elucidate that selectively eliminating resident astrocytes attenuated neuropathic pain associated with type I IFNs signal activation in microglia. Targeting type I IFNs signals is proven to be an effective strategy for neuropathic pain treatment after SCI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95720">Luminal epithelial cells integrate variable responses to aging into stereotypical changes that underlie breast cancer susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Effects from aging in single cells are heterogenous, whereas at the organ- and tissue-levels aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary luminal epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merit attention because these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation. We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger &lt;30 (y)ears old and older &gt;55y women. In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as <i>SATB1</i>. Epithelial expression of gap junction protein <i>GJB6</i> increased with age, and modulation of <i>GJB6</i> expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.

">A hierarchical multiscale model of forward and backward alpha-band traveling waves in the visual system</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that low-frequency oscillations in the cortex are often organized as traveling waves. The dynamical properties of these waves, that span different scales, have been linked to both sensory processing and cognitive functions. In EEG recordings, alpha-band (~10Hz) traveling waves propagate predominantly in both directions of the occipital-frontal axis, with forward waves being most prominent during visual processing, while backward waves dominate at rest and during sensory suppression. While a previous study has proposed a functional model to explain their generation and propagation, a multi-scale, biologically plausible implementation is still lacking. Here, we present a multi-scale network model with mean-field dynamics that, building on known interlaminar and cortico-cortical projections, reproduces the dynamics of alpha-band traveling waves observed in EEG recordings. We show that scalp-level forward and backward waves can arise from two distinct sub-networks that are connected in infragranular layers at each area. At rest, the network generates spontaneous backward waves and switches to a forward state upon bottom-up sensory stimulation, reproducing the dynamics we observed in EEG recordings in healthy participants. We then expand our model to a cortico-thalamic network with a parallel feedforward pathway through the pulvinar. Our results show that this pathway biases the cortical dynamics to the forward state and that high pulvinar engagement leads to spontaneous forward waves without external input. This result is in line with previous studies suggesting a key role for the pulvinar in directing information flow in the cortex, and provide a computational basis to investigate the role of the pulvinar in cortical dynamics. In summary, our model provides a biologically plausible architecture for modeling the dynamics of macroscale traveling waves. Importantly, our study bridges the gap between distinct scales by connecting laminar mean-field activity to spatial patterns at the scalp level, providing a biologically grounded and comprehensive view of the generation and propagation of alpha-band traveling waves.

">High-resolution imaging atlas reveals context-dependent role of pancreatic sympathetic innervation in diabetic mice</a></h4>

              
                Gaining a better understanding of how sympathetic nerves impact pancreatic function is helpful for understanding diabetes. However, there is still uncertainty and controversy surrounding the roles of sympathetic nerves within the pancreas. To address this, we utilize high-resolution imaging and advanced three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques to study the patterns of sympathetic innervation and morphology in islets of adult WT and diabetic mice. Our data shows that more than ~30% alpha/beta-cells are innervated by sympathetic nerves in both WT and diabetic mice. Also, sympathetic innervated alpha/beta-cells are reduced in DIO mice, whereas sympathetic innervated beta-cells are increased in db/db mice. Besides, in situ chemical pancreatic sympathetic denervation (cPSD) improves glucose tolerance in WT and db/db mice, but decreases in DIO mice. In situ cPSD also enhances insulin sensitivity in diabetic mice without affecting WT mice. Overall, our findings advance our comprehension of diabetes by highlighting the distinctive impact of pancreatic sympathetic innervation on glucose regulation.

">Attentional failures after sleep deprivation represent moments of cerebrospinal fluid flow</a></h4>

              
                Sleep deprivation rapidly disrupts cognitive function, and in the long term contributes to neurological disease. Why sleep deprivation has such profound effects on cognition is not well understood. Here, we use simultaneous fast fMRI-EEG to test how sleep deprivation modulates cognitive, neural, and fluid dynamics in the human brain. We demonstrate that after sleep deprivation, sleep-like pulsatile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow events intrude into the awake state. CSF flow is coupled to attentional function, with high flow during attentional impairment. Furthermore, CSF flow is tightly orchestrated in a series of brain-body changes including broadband neuronal shifts, pupil constriction, and altered systemic physiology, pointing to a coupled system of fluid dynamics and neuromodulatory state. The timing of these dynamics is consistent with a vascular mechanism regulated by neuromodulatory state, in which CSF begins to flow outward when attention fails, and flow reverses when attention recovers. The attentional costs of sleep deprivation may thus reflect an irrepressible need for neuronal rest periods and widespread pulsatile fluid flow.

">Variable Cerebral Blood Flow Responsiveness to Acute Hypoxic Hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to changes in blood carbon dioxide and oxygen levels is a robust indicator of vascular health. Although CVR is typically assessed with hypercapnia, the interplay between carbon dioxide and oxygen, and their ultimate roles in dictating vascular tone, can vary with pathology. Methods to characterize vasoreactivity to oxygen changes, particularly hypoxia, would provide important complementary information to established hypercapnia techniques. However, existing methods to study hypoxic CVR, typically with arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, demonstrate high variability and paradoxical responses. To understand whether these responses are real or due to methodological confounds of ASL, we used phase-contrast MRI to quantify whole-brain blood flow in 21 participants during baseline, hypoxic, and hypercapnic respiratory states in three scan sessions. Hypoxic CVR reliability was poor-to-moderate (ICC=0.42 for CVR relative to PETO2 changes, ICC=0.56 relative to SpO2 changes) and was less reliable than hypercapnic CVR (ICC=0.67). Without the uncertainty from ASL-related confounds, we still observed paradoxical responses at each timepoint. Concurrent changes in blood carbon dioxide levels did not account for paradoxical responses. Hypoxic CVR and hypercapnic CVR shared approximately 40% of variance across the dataset, indicating that the two effects may indeed reflect distinct, complementary elements of vascular regulation.

                We recently reported development of human MAPT knock-in mice that carry single or double pathogenic mutations of frontotemporal dementia. However, it takes more than 14 months for the line with the most aggressive phenotypes to exhibit tau pathology without forming high-order tau oligomers, along with concomitant abnormal behavior. We thus generated MAPT knock-in mice carrying triple mutations, among which the MAPTP301S;Int10+3;S320F line exhibited robust pathology starting earlier than 6 months. Tau accumulation took place mainly in the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex, but less so in the hippocampus, leading to synaptic loss, atrophy and behavioral abnormalities. Crossbreeding MAPTP301S;Int10+3;S320F with App knock-in mice AppNL-G-F resulted in the manifestation of tau pathology in the hippocampus and cortex. These mutant mice will be valuable tools for understanding the mechanisms of frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.

">Regional Brain Entropy, Brain Network and Structural-Functional Coupling in Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Brain entropy (BEN) indicates the irregularity, unpredictability and complexity of brain activity. In healthy brains, resting-state fMRI-based regional BEN (rBEN) distribution has been shown to have potential relationships with functional brain networks. However, the relationship between rBEN and structural and functional networks, as well as how rBEN facilitates the coupling between structural and functional networks remains unclear. Additionally, network dimensionality reduction methods, such as the use of connectome gradients, have become popular in recent years for explaining the hierarchical architecture of brain function, and the sensorimotor-association (S-A) axis, as a major axis of hierarchical cortical organization, exerts a widespread influence on both brain structure and function. However, how this functional hierarchy affects the relationship between rBEN and brain networks remains unclear. In this study, we systematically examine the relationship between rBEN and both structural and functional networks, including BOLD-based functional networks and MEG-based functional networks. We also assess the impact of the BEN and network gradients, as well as the influence of the S-A axis, on the relationship between rBEN and brain networks. Our results reveal a negative correlation between BEN and the network efficiency of both structural and BOLD-based functional networks, as assessed by average connection strength, degree centrality, and local efficiency. Additionally, BEN shows a negative correlation with the coupling between structural and BOLD functional networks. In contrast, the relationship between BEN and MEG functional network efficiency varies from negative to positive across different frequency bands, with a shift from negative to positive correlation observed in the coupling between BEN and MEG-functional networks. Moreover, the coupling between BOLD and MEG functional networks is positively correlated with BEN. The relationship between BEN and network gradients is complex, and no consistent patterns were observed. Importantly, the relationship between BEN and brain networks is influenced by the S-A axis, and the connection between BEN and networks is further modulated by changes in cytoarchitectural organization. These results are consistent with the commonly observed relationship between elevated rBEN and impaired networks in psychiatric disorders. The negative correlation between BEN and the efficiency of both structural and BOLD functional networks, as well as their coupling, may suggest that lower rBEN is associated with higher information processing potential. Additionally, the positive correlation between BEN and high-frequency MEG functional networks, as well as the coupling between BOLD and MEG functional networks, may indicate that brain processes related to information acquisition and integration could increase rBEN. In summary, this complex relationship may reflect a dynamic process in which the brain continuously acquires external information for integration (increasing entropy) and internalizes it (decreasing entropy) as part of its information-processing mechanism in different timescales.

">Filling-in of the Blindspot is Multisensory</a></h4>

              
                The blind spot is an area on the retina that lacks photoreceptors, thus no visual information is encoded. Yet, we can maintain the sense of a seamless visual field owing to perceptual filling-in. Traditionally viewed as a surface interpolation mechanism, filling-in has been studied predominantly under unimodal conditions. However, there are limits to this process; the brain cannot always reconstruct all surfaces. Multisensory processing may bolster the process of perceptual filling-in to occur even with complex and dynamic perceptual stimuli. In this study, we employed the Audiovisual (AV) Rabbit Illusion to investigate how auditory stimuli influence visual filling-in at the blind spot. Our findings confirmed that auditory cues can induce the perception of an illusory flash within the blind spot, indicating that the brain leverages multimodal information to enrich visual scenes. This suggests that perceptual filling-in is not merely unimodal surface interpolation but a cross-modally integrated spatial representation and therefore more similar to other visual field locations than previously hypothesized. Furthermore, for blind spot filling-in to occur, visual stimuli do not need to be spatially contiguous, they simply need to be crossmodally associated (or grouped), which supports a higher-level sensory processing in filling-in than previously understood.

">Regenerative potential of human enteric glia in a preclinical model of acute brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Acute brain injuries are characterized by extensive tissue damage, resulting in neuronal loss and severe functional deficits in patients. Self-regeneration is insufficient for the repair of damaged tissue. Therapies based on exogenous cells may offer a promising approach. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of transplanting exogenous human enteric glia (hEG) in a preclinical model of brain injury. hEG were isolated, expanded and administered intranasally in brain-injured immunocompetent rats. hEG satisfied the safety criteria for cell therapy and were well tolerated. Additionally, hEG migrated to the injured area of the brain, where they enhanced endogenous angiogenesis and neurogenesis, contributing to tissue regeneration. Notably, hEG generated neurons that engrafted and integrated into the brain tissue. These neurons were enveloped by host oligodendrocytes and formed synaptic connections within the host tissue. Our findings provide evidence that hEG have regenerative potential and might be safely used for repair strategies in brain injury.

">On Levodopa interactions with brain disease proteins at the nanoscale</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral accumulation of alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn) and amyloid beta-1-42 (Abeta-42) proteins are known to play a crucial role in the pathology of neurocognitive disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Currently, Levodopa (L-dopa) is the dopamine replacement therapy for treating bradykinetic symptoms visible in PD patients. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to evidence at nanometer length scales the effects of L-dopa on the morphology of alpha-Syn and Abeta-42 protein fibrils. L-dopa treatment reduces the length and diameter of both types of protein fibrils, with a stark reduction observed for Abeta-42 both in physiological buffer and human spinal fluid. The insights gained on Abeta-42 fibril disassembly from the nanoscale imaging experiments are substantiated using atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal the mechanism governing L-dopa-driven reversal of protein aggregation, which may be useful in drug design of small molecule drugs for potentially treating neurocognitive disorders and provide leads for designing chemical effector-mediated disassembly of protein architectures.

">Putative Role of Norrin in Neuroretinal Differentiation Revealed by bulk and scRNA Sequencing of Human Retinal Organoids</a></h4>

              
                Pathogenic variants in the X-linked gene NDP (Norrie disease protein) have been associated with a variety of non-syndromic and syndromic human retinal diseases, including Norrie disease and familial exudative vitroretinopathy. The gene codes for Norrin, a secreted angiogenic molecule which binds to FZD4 and its co-receptors LRP5/6 and TSPAN12 and activates Wnt-signaling. Additionally, it also potentiates Wnt-signaling by binding to the LGR4 receptor. Norrin was also found to exert a neuroprotective function in the retina, specifically for retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, it was suggested to be involved in neurodevelopmental processes such as early neuro-ectodermal specification and differentiation, as well as maintenance of cochlear hair cells. To better understand the putative role of Norrin in neuronal cells of the retina we generated NDP mutant and eGFP-expressing NDP reporter human induced pluripotent stem cells, which were differentiated to retinal organoids. Bulk RNA sequencing and fixed single-cell RNA sequencing revealed alterations in gene expression as well as cellular composition, with increased proportions of retinal progenitors as well as Muller glia cells in NDPKO retinal organoids. Differential expression of genes related to glutamate signaling, Wnt and MAPK signaling, as well as neurogenesis was detected. Furthermore, genes associated with functions in the extracellular matrix were also differentially expressed. The considerable decrease in retinal neurons found in our NDPKO organoids suggest that Norrin is also important for retinal neurogenesis, which may precede the vascular manifestations in NDP-associated diseases.

	<p>Introduction. Previous studies have shown that probiotics have positive effects on both motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Additionally, in preclinical settings, probiotics have demonstrated the ability to counteract neuronal loss and alpha-synuclein aggregation, important pathological hallmarks of PD. Notably, preliminary in vitro studies have revealed the immunomodulatory properties of probiotics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of probiotics on symptoms and peripheral cytokines levels in PD patients compared to placebo. Methods. Patients were enrolled and blindly randomized to receive either active probiotics (comprising Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BS01 LMG P-21384, Bifidobacterium longum BL03 DSM 16603, Bifidobacterium adolescentis BA02 DSM 18351, Fructo-oligosaccharides and Maltodextrin-Group A) or placebo (Maltodextrin-Group B). Clinical evaluations and plasma levels cytokines (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, IFN-&amp;amp;gamma;, IL-6, and TGF-&amp;amp;beta;) were also assessed at enrollment and after 12 weeks. Anti-parkinsonian therapy remained stable throughout the study. Results. Forty PD patients were recruited. After 12 weeks, Group A showed significant improvement in motor symptoms (UPDRS III: 13.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.08 vs. 12.74 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.57, p = 0.028) and non-motor symptoms (NMSS: 34.32 &amp;amp;plusmn; 21.41 vs. 30.11 &amp;amp;plusmn; 19.89, p = 0.041), with notable improvement in the gastrointestinal sub-item (3.79 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.14 vs. 1.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.54, p = 0.021). A reduction of IFN-&amp;amp;gamma; levels was observed in both groups, but group A also showed a significant decrease in IL-6 and a slight increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-&amp;amp;beta;. Conclusions. Our data suggest that probiotics may modulate peripheral cytokines levels and improve clinical symptoms in PD patients. Probiotics may, therefore, represent a valuable adjunctive therapy to conventional anti-parkinsonian drugs.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Neuropathic pain is challenging to treat, often resistant to current therapies, and associated with significant side effects. Pregabalin, an anticonvulsant that modulates calcium channels, is effective but can impair mental and motor functions, especially in older patients. To improve patient outcomes, reducing the doses of pregabalin and combining it with other drugs targeting different neuropathic pain mechanisms may be beneficial. TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; blockers such as etanercept have shown potential in addressing neuropathic pain by affecting sodium channels, synaptic transmission, and neuroinflammation. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of combining low doses of etanercept and pregabalin in allodynia and nociceptive tests. Materials and Methods: Male C57/BL6 mice underwent chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve to induce neuropathic pain. They were divided into seven groups: sham control, CCI control, low and high doses of pregabalin, low and high doses of etanercept, and a combination of low doses of both drugs. Behavioral tests, including von Frey, hot-plate, and rotarod tests, were used to assess pain responses and motor activity. Results: The results indicated that a high dose of pregabalin significantly reduced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia but impaired motor function. Conversely, low doses of etanercept alone had no significant effect. However, the combination of low doses of etanercept (20 mg/kg) and pregabalin (5 mg/kg) effectively alleviated pain without compromising locomotor activity. Conclusions: These results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain, enhancing analgesic efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Most of the rapid inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain is mediated through activation of the &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A (GABAA) receptor, which is a ligand-gated ion channel. GABAA receptor activation via GABA binding allows for an intracellular influx of Cl&amp;amp;minus; ions, thus inducing cellular hyperpolarization. Each GABAA receptor consists of a combination of five subunits, and several subunits have been proposed as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer. Here, we show the expression of genes encoding &amp;amp;beta; subunits of the GABAA receptor, namely GABRB1, GABRB2, and GABRB3, across the four different molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma (MB), which is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. We also show the associations of GABAA receptor &amp;amp;beta; subunits with MB patients&amp;amp;rsquo; overall survival (OS). Methods: The expression of genes encoding GABAA receptor &amp;amp;beta; subunits was analyzed using a previously described dataset comprising 763 MB tumor samples. Patients were classified into high- and low-gene-expression groups, and the Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier estimate was used to examine the relationship between gene expression levels and patient OS. Results: High GABRB1 expression was associated with better OS within each of the four molecular subgroups. The GABRB2 gene showed higher transcript levels in Group 3 MB compared to all other subgroups, and high expression was associated with better prognosis in Group 3 tumors. GABRB3 expression was significantly higher in Group 3 and Group 4 MB, and high expression of GABRB3 genes was associated with longer OS in the sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup. The high expression of GABRB1, GABRB2, and GABRB3 is associated with longer patient OS in a subgroup-specific manner. Conclusions: These results indicate a role for GABAA receptors containing &amp;amp;beta; subunits in influencing MB progression.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Stroke remains a major cause of disability and death, with survivors facing significant physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges. Rehabilitation is crucial for recovery, but outcomes can vary widely. Cognitive reserve (CR) has emerged as a factor influencing these outcomes. This systematic review evaluates the role of CR in post-stroke rehabilitation, examining whether higher CR is associated with better outcomes. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted for studies published between 2004 and 2024. Studies examining social-behavior CR proxies (e.g., education, bilingualism) and their impact on post-stroke outcomes were included. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The study quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for NOn-Randomized Studies (MINORS) scale. Results: Among 3851 articles screened, 27 met the inclusion criteria. Higher education levels, bilingualism, and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities were associated with better cognitive outcomes and functional recovery. Lower socioeconomic status (SES) correlated with poorer outcomes. Early rehabilitation and dynamic CR proxies showed stronger associations with cognitive recovery than static ones. Conclusions: CR may predict post-stroke rehabilitation outcomes, with education, bilingualism, and active engagement in cognitive activities showing potential benefits. Future research should explore CR&amp;amp;rsquo;s role alongside factors like lesion location and severity in enhancing recovery.</p>

	<p>Background: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare and frequently misdiagnosed disorder characterized by a low volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by the leakage of CSF through the spinal dural membrane. Patients with Marfan Syndrome (MS) and other connective tissue disorders are at an increased risk for dural ectasia, which may predispose them to spontaneous CSF leaks due to the structural weakness of their dural membranes. The management of SIH in MS patients is debated. Conservative measures, an epidural blood patch (EBP), and surgical treatments are the options generally provided. Methods: Herein, we report on the case of a 52-year-old female affected by MS, genetically confirmed, with a two-month history of sudden-onset, &amp;amp;ldquo;thunderclap&amp;amp;rdquo; headache, worsened in an upright position and horizontal diplopia. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed a bilateral chronic subdural hematoma, slit ventricles, and a caudal descent of the brainstem without overt tonsillar herniation. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the whole spine revealed dural ectasia in the lumbosacral area and presacral perineural cyst without extradural CSF collection. The case was successfully managed with bed rest and high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Then, we discuss the pertinent literature, consisting of 25 papers dealing with the treatment of SIH in patients affected by MS. Results: The literature review yielded 25 papers dealing with SIH management in patients with MS, including 28 patients overall; 21 patients underwent EBP, of whom 7 patients had multiple procedures. Overall, in 23 cases (82%), the symptoms improved. In three cases, the patients were managed conservatively with bed rest. In three of these cases, there was an improvement. In one case, the surgical fenestration of two lumbar intradural spinal meningeal cysts was performed and the patient improved after the procedure. Our patient underwent 15 days of steroid therapy (dexamethasone iv 12 mg/day for 7 days, then reduced to 4 mg/day) and intravenous hydration (Ringer lactate 1500 mL/day). In ten days, the symptoms disappeared. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient was in good clinical condition, and a CT scan showed an almost complete regression of the bilateral subdural hematoma. Conclusions: The management of SIH in MS patients is still challenging. Patients with connective tissue disorders such as MS are at an increased risk for SIH. Few studies have assessed the management of these patients and different strategies. Our case and the available literature provide further data for this type of case.</p>

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by pruritus and skin barrier dysfunction. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Pelargonium graveolens (Geraniaceae) in managing AD symptoms through its essential oil. Methods The chemical composition of Pelargonium graveolens flower essential oil (PFEO) was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties were assessed, along with the inhibitory effects of PFEO on key enzymes involved in skin repair: tyrosinase, elastase, and collagenase. An in vivo evaluation of a gel formulation containing PFEO was also conducted to assess its anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Results GC-MS analysis identified major compounds in PFEO, including Geraniol (22.83%), beta-citronellol (19.51%), naphthalenemethanol (15.36%), and Geranyl tiglate (9.38%), with minor constituents such as linalool (3.81%) and neryl formate (1.31%). PFEO exhibited bacteriostatic activity against various bacterial and fungal strains, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Malassezia spp. The essential oil also demonstrated significant antioxidant properties and inhibited key enzymes linked to skin alterations in AD. Conclusions PFEO shows promising therapeutic potential for managing symptoms of atopic dermatitis due to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its analgesic effects. The findings support further exploration of PFEO as a natural alternative in the treatment of AD.

                Background Cytoscape is an open-source software to visualize and analyze networks. However, large networks, such as protein interaction networks, are still difficult to analyze as a whole. Methods Here, we propose Clust&See3.0, a novel version of a Cytoscape app that has been developed to identify, visualize and manipulate network clusters and modules. It is now enriched with functionalities allowing custom annotations of nodes and computation of their statistical enrichments. Results As the wealth of multi-omics data is growing, such functionalities are highly valuable for a better understanding of biological module composition, as illustrated by the presented use case. Conclusions In summary, the originality of Clust&See3.0 lies in providing users with a complete tool for network clusters analyses: from cluster identification, visualization, node and cluster annotations to annotation statistical analyses.

                Background This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the financial technologies (fintech) era on the performance in the banking sector, measured through non-performing loans (NPL) and their coverage by provisions for NPL. It is a question of knowing whether banking investment in fintech makes it possible to better evaluate the granting of credits, and therefore makes it possible to reduce overdue credits. Methods To this end, the method used consists of using a regression analysis and a Pearson correlation applied to the financial data of Moroccan banks observed during two distinct periods, namely 2007-2014, considered pre-fintech, and the period 2015-2022, considered as the fintech period. Results With the emergence of the fintech era, the Moroccan banking situation improved slightly compared to the pre-fintech period: bad debts did not increase despite the significant increase in net banking income and the size of banking assets during the fintech era. Conclusions The implementation of fintech has improved customer relationship management, credit risk analysis and loan monitoring services, which ultimately reduces non-performing loans and improves the coverage of non-performing loans by provisions. The main implication of the results allows us to deduce that the implementation of fintech makes it possible to have a positive impact on overdue credits, and they are also likely to serve as a lever for the inclusion of those excluded from banking services.

                <p>Visual working memory (VWM) requires precise feature binding. Previous studies have revealed a close relationship between the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and feature binding during VWM; this study further examined their causal relationship through three transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiments. In Experiment 1 (<I>N</I> = 57), participants underwent three sessions of tDCS separately, including PPC stimulation, occipital cortex stimulation, and sham stimulation, and completed delayed estimation tasks for orientations before and after stimulation. Results showed that tDCS over PPC selectively prolonged recall response time (RT) and increased the probability of nontarget responses (a.k.a. failure of feature binding, <I>p</I>NT). In Experiment 2 (<I>N</I> = 29), combining metacognition estimation, we further investigated whether the effects of PPC stimulation were attributed to misbinding (i.e., participants self-reported "remembered" in nontarget responses) or informed guessing trials (participants self-reported "forgotten" in nontarget responses). We replicated the main findings in Experiment 1 and observed greater tDCS effects of PPC on RT in informed guessing trials while there are comparable effects on <I>p</I>NT in these two types of trials. In Experiment 3 (<I>N</I> = 28), we then examined whether the tDCS effects over PPC specifically influenced the memory retrieval process by using a change detection task. We found that PPC stimulation did not influence the recognition RT or accuracy. Together, this study provided direct causal evidence supporting the specific involvement of PPC in feature binding during VWM retrieval, from both aspects of speed and response preference, expanding our understanding of the neural basis of feature binding in VWM.</p>

                <p>Neurodevelopmental abnormalities are considered to be one of the important causes of schizophrenia. The offspring of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM)&ndash;exposed mice are recognized for the dysregulation of neurodevelopment and are well-characterized with schizophrenia-like phenotypes. However, the inhibition-related properties of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus throughout adolescence and adulthood have not been systematically elucidated. In this study, both 10 and 15&nbsp;mg/kg MAM-exposed mice exhibited schizophrenia-related phenotypes in both adolescence and adulthood, including spontaneous locomotion hyperactivity and deficits in prepulse inhibition. We observed that there was an obvious parvalbumin (PV) loss in the mPFC and hippocampus of MAM-exposed mice, extending from adolescence to adulthood. Moreover, the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pyramidal neurons at mPFC and hippocampus was significantly dampened in the 10 and 15&nbsp;mg/kg MAM-exposed mice. Furthermore, the firing rate of putative pyramidal neurons in mPFC and hippocampus was increased, while that of putative inhibitory neurons was decreased during both adolescence and adulthood. In conclusion, PV loss in mPFC and hippocampus of MAM-exposed mice may contribute to the impaired inhibitory function leading to the attenuation of inhibition in the brain both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

                Background Sustaining a ‘fit-for-purpose’ health workforce requires a better understanding of the health care worker cadres that are affected during pandemics and their outcomes. In hospitalized health care workers with confirmed COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2023 in Liberia, we determined the hospitalization and case fatality rates, type of health care worker cadres affected, their demographic and clinical characteristics and hospital exit outcomes. Methods This was a cohort study using routine data extracted from hospitalization forms for health care workers in 24 designated COVID-19 treatment facilities. Results Of the 424 health care workers with COVID-19, hospitalization rates progressively declined between 2020 and 2023, (P<0.001) with the highest rates in 2020 (24/1,000 health care workers) and 2021 (14/1,000 health care workers). Case fatality was 2% in both 2020 and 2021 with no deaths thereafter. Among those hospitalized, the highest proportions were nursing cadres with 191(45%), physicians with 63 (15%) and laboratory technicians with 42 (10%). The most frequent reported site for COVID-19 infection was the health facility (326, 89%). COVID-19 vaccination coverage in health care workers was 20%. The majority (91%) of hospitalizations were for mild symptomatic infections. Even in referral centres (n-52), 18 (35%) were for mild infections. Of the 424 who were hospitalized, 412 (97%) recovered, 9 (2%) died and 3 (1%) either left against medical advice or absconded. Of the nine deaths, none were vaccinated, seven had moderate-to-severe disease but were not referred to specialized COVID-19 treatment centers. Conclusions The hospitalized health care workers for COVID-19 were predominantly clinical and laboratory personnel who were mostly unvaccinated, and health facilities were hot-spots for contracting infections. The triage and referral system was weak with unnecessary hospitalization of mild infections. This study provides useful insights for outbreak preparedness including priority vaccination and improving health care worker safety in Liberia.

                Background Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has poor clinical outcomes. Recently, stimulating arteriogenesis has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have beneficial effects on limb ischemia related to arteriogenesis. This study aimed to review the roles of therapeutic miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia. Methods A systematic search was conducted through July 2021 using the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases. Two authors independently assessed studies that investigated the role of miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia, both in vivo and in clinical studies. Results All selected studies were in vivo studies, with a total of 36 articles and 28 types of miRNAs. miRNAs potentially regulate arteriogenesis by targeting different targets. The following miRNAs were upregulated to enhance arteriogenesis: miRNA-126-3p, -93, -675, -143-3p, -130a, -210, -146b, -21, -let-7g, -132/212, -150, and 155. Meanwhile, microRNAs needed to be downregulated, namely: miRNA-939-5p, -503, -199a-5p, -146a, -92a, -14q32 microRNA gene cluster, -15a/16, -100, -133a, -139-5p, -223, -352, -615-5p, -15b/5p, -124-3p, and 29a. MiRNA-126 was the most studied miRNA, and SPRED1 was the most common target of microRNA. However, the included studies showed high heterogeneity in terms of inducing hindlimb ischemia, the timing of administration, and the method used for evaluating arteriogenesis. Moreover, most studies presented unclear or high-risk bias. Conclusion MicroRNA application in a preclinical model of hindlimb ischemia has beneficial effects on arteriogenesis. This result indicates that miRNAs might be potentially beneficial in patients with CLTI. Registration The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024484988.

                Background Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common retinal condition with an increased risk of recurrence. Traditional approaches have made choroidal visualization challenging, but recent advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) innovation have permitted the collection of more accurate choroidal visualizations. This study aimed to measure choroidal thickness in eyes with active CSCR as well as in the unaffected opposite eyes of these same individuals. Methods This research was conducted at the ophthalmology division in Ghazi Al-Hariri Hospital from the 1st of October 2019 until the 31st of March 2020. A total of 49 people, corresponding to 65 eyes, were included in the study. Among these participants, 16 individuals presented with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), affecting a total of 32 eyes. The CSCR individuals were further split into two groups: “Group A” consisted of 20 eyes with active CSCR, and “Group B” encompassed the remaining 12 unaffected opposite eyes. Additionally, the right eyes of 33 individuals who were age and gender-matched served as controls assigned as “Group C”. Results The choroid exhibited a substantial rise in thickness across each of the nine sectors in group A as compared to group C. Similarly, group B showed a significant increase in choroidal thickness in relation to group C. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was measured as follows: 474.55μm, 437.5μm, and 292.03μm among groups A, B, and C, correspondingly. These differences were identified as clinically significant for both A vs. C and B vs. C. Conclusions This study’s findings indicate a thickening of the choroid in both eyes exhibiting active CSCR, as well as in the unaffected opposite eyes of those with the disease.

                Introduction Low and middle-income countries account for the largest proportion of women’s deaths as a result of pregnancy or childbirth-related complications. The sub-Saharan region is the most affected with approximately 70% (202 000) of maternal deaths between 2000 and 2020. These deaths could have been prevented if expectant mothers were prepared for childbirth. Birth preparedness is perceived as a better strategy that helps attain a substantial reduction in maternal mortality. This is achieved by attending early antenatal classes, receiving skilled care during childbirth, and care and support right after birth. The latest survey on antenatal class attendance conducted in South Africa provides an estimated 30.8% of expectant mothers in public healthcare facilities. Methods This study employed a qualitative approach to collect data, as a result, one focus group discussion with five (N=5) participants and two others with six (N=6) participants each (n=6X2=12) and twenty individual interviews were conducted. The study sought to explore and describe the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals regarding the birth preparedness of women in labour at selected hospitals in Durban KwaZulu-Natal. Results Expectant mothers were unprepared for both labour and postnatal care. The unprepared expectant mothers were uncooperative and made the task of midwives difficult to the extent of endangering the life of their expected newborn babies and their own. Factors such as finance, heterogeneity, staff shortage, language barrier, lack of family support, lack of interest, cultural beliefs, and confusion caused by various sources of information were responsible for birth unpreparedness. Conclusion The synergy between expectant mothers and midwives appears to be an important factor in achieving better birth preparedness.

                Digital and financial literacy are changing the landscape of the globe in terms of its approach to development. These two literacies also help to achieve women’s empowerment and, consequently, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) more quickly. This systematic literature review looks at the two literacies and their effects, focusing on women’s participation and showing how digital literacy not only increases women’s access to knowledge and connectivity but is also a door to women’s entrepreneurship and financial independence. Likewise, financial literacy, when coupled with digital skills, can be a breakthrough to the traditional socioeconomic barrier – poverty – by assisting women in making informed economic decisions, increasing their financial independence and resilience in the face of a global crisis. Empirical realities that still hinder women’s education, such as cultural norms, infrastructural deficiencies and educational gaps, still exist. However, the paper points out that to have a more equal world based on the SDGs, the double literacy strategy for women’s empowerment should not be negotiable.

                Background Studies have shown that perceived self-efficacy can influence teachers’ emotional state, thoughts and behaviours, and students’ learning. It’s also an important referential of professional satisfaction. In turn, teaching methodologies influence motor learning, as well as psychological, cognitive and social learning, with different impacts on human development and learning retention, levels of intrinsic motivation and continuity of practice in order to support a healthy lifestyle. Research on aquatic educators and teaching methodologies is scarce and at the same time necessary according to the view that aquatic literacy is an integral part of physical literacy and the only possibility of being more able to interact with this environment. Methods In this study we used an online questionnaire, aimed at aquatic professionals, which was answered voluntarily and anonymously to measure the prevalence of the use of different teaching methodologies, the comprehensive aquatic method and the perception of teacher self-efficacy. It has been deposited and can be consulted at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27316242.v1. Results All methods can generate a feeling of self-efficacy in teachers despite having different results, with the methodologies that involve students more actively (cognitivist and constructivist) being those that generate a greater feeling of self-efficacy in teachers. MAC is a method that is more closely related to methodologies focused on active student participation and, consequently, it is a method that generates a high perception of self-efficacy in teachers. Conclusions Levels of self-efficacy influence professional satisfaction, teacher physical, mental and emotional health, as well as student learning. Is recommended that aquatic professionals give prevalence to the cognitivist and constructivist teaching methodologies being MAC a privileged methodological approach for promoting active lifestyle habits throughout life.

                <p>Slowly expanding lesions (SELs) in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) indicate a progressive pathological process. Whether SELs are present in pediatric-onset MS (POMS) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is unknown. We studied 19 children with POMS and 14 with MOGAD (median age 14.3 and 9.4 years, respectively) recruited to the Canadian Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Study with: (1) ≥3 research scans 12 months apart; and (2) ≥1 T2-lesions on the earliest scan. A total of 70 SELs from 16 POMS participants and 1 SEL in the MOGAD group were detected. SELs are an early feature of POMS and essentially not a feature of MOGAD.

                <p>Cryptogenic new-onset refractory status epilepticus (cNORSE) is a devastating condition with unclear pathogenesis. Here, we analyzed the genetic underprints of 31 cNORSE patients from an autoimmune encephalitis observational cohort through whole-genome sequencing. Compared to their controls, cNORSE patients exhibited elevated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for traits associated with autoimmune diseases. The individual PRS against these diseases were correlated with specific clinical phenotypes of cNORSE. The variants were enriched in genes expressed in the central nervous system and lymphocytes. These results suggest a shared genetic framework between cNORSE and other autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, and its involvement in the disease pathogenesis.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the <i>C9orf72</i> gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). A large body of evidence implicates dipeptide repeats (DPRs) proteins as one of the main drivers of neuronal injury in cell and animal models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pure repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD was generated. Embryonic and adult transgenic zebrafish lysates were investigated for the presence of RAN-translated DPR species and adult-onset motor deficits. Using C9orf72 cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish, hypothermic-therapeutic temperature management (TTM) was explored as a potential therapeutic option for C9orf72-ALS/FTD.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we describe a pure RAN translation zebrafish model of C9orf72-ALS/FTD that exhibits significant RAN-translated DPR pathology and progressive motor decline. We further demonstrate that hypothermic-TTM results in a profound reduction in DPR species in C9orf72-ALS/FTD cell models as well as embryonic C9orf72-ALS/FTD zebrafish.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The transgenic model detailed in this paper provides a medium throughput in vivo research tool to further investigate the role of RAN-translation in C9orf72-ALS/FTD and further understand the mechanisms that underpin neuroprotective strategies. Hypothermic-TTM presents a viable therapeutic avenue to explore in the context of C9orf72-ALS/FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1058–1069</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurofilament light chains (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains (pNfH), established as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in hospital-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cohorts, are now surrogate markers in clinical trials. This study extends their evaluation to a population level, with the aim of advancing their full establishment and assessing the transferability of biomarker findings from controlled cohorts to real-world ALS populations.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured serum NfL and pNfH levels in all ALS patients (n = 790) and general population controls (n = 570) with available baseline samples participating in the epidemiological ALS Registry Swabia, providing platform-specific (ELLA™) reference data and Z-scores for controls, as well as reference data, disease-specific Z-scores and longitudinal data in ALS. We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of neurofilaments and quantified the impact of ALS-related factors and non-ALS confounders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Neurofilaments showed high diagnostic and prognostic utility at the population level, with NfL superior to pNfH. The novel concept of a population-based ALS Z-score significantly improved the prognostic utility compared to absolute raw values. Both biomarkers increased more strongly with age in controls than in ALS, and age adjustment improved diagnostic accuracy. Our data show that disease progression rates, ALS phenotype, body mass index (BMI), and renal function need to be considered when interpreting neurofilament levels; longitudinal neurofilament levels were generally stable in individual patients, especially when adjusted for age and baseline levels.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Population-based assessment enhances the utility of particularly serum NfL as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in ALS and improves the translation of findings from controlled cohorts to real-world populations. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1040–1057</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) is the most common neuronal heterotopia, frequently resulting in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Here, we characterize variables that predict good epilepsy outcomes following surgical intervention using stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) -informed magnetic resonance-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective review of consecutive cases from a single high-volume epilepsy referral center identified patients who underwent SEEG evaluation for PVNH to characterize the intervention and outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty-nine patients underwent SEEG-guided MRgLITT of the seizure onset zone (SoZ) in PVNH and associated epileptic tissue. PVNH and polymicrogyria (PMG) were densely sampled with a mean of 16.5 (SD = 2)/209.4 (SD = 36.9) SEEG probes/recording contacts per patient. Ablation principally targeted just the PVNH and cortex that was abnormal on imaging was ablated (5 patients) only if implicated in the SoZ. Volumetric analyses revealed a high percentage of PVNH SoZ ablation (96.6%, SD = 5.3%) in unilateral and bilateral (92.9%, SD = 7.2%) cases. Mean follow-up duration was 31.4 months (SD = 20.9). Seizure freedom (ILAE 1) was excellent: unilateral PVNH without other imaging abnormalities, 80%; PVNH with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) or PMG, 63%; bilateral PVNH, 50%. SoZ ablation percentage significantly impacted surgical outcomes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PVNH plays a central role in seizure genesis as revealed by dense recordings and selective targeting by LITT. MRgLITT represents a transformative technological advance in PVNH-associated epilepsy with seizure control outcomes consistent with those seen in focal lesional epilepsies. In localized unilateral cases and otherwise normal imaging, PVNH ablation without invasive recordings may be considered, and this approach deserves to be explored further.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B due to GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (<i>FGF14</i>) gene has recently been recognized as a common cause of late-onset hereditary cerebellar ataxia. Here we present the first report of this disease in the US population, characterizing its clinical manifestations, disease progression, pathological abnormalities, and response to 4-aminopyridine in a cohort of 102 patients bearing GAA repeat expansions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compiled a series of patients with SCA27B, recruited from 5 academic centers across the United States. Clinical manifestations and patient demographics were collected retrospectively from clinical records in an unblinded approach using a standardized form. Post-mortem analysis was done on 4 brains of patients with genetically confirmed SCA27B.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In our cohort of 102 patients with SCA27B, we found that SCA27B was a late-onset (57 ± 12.5 years) slowly progressive ataxia with an episodic component in 51% of patients. Balance and gait impairment were almost always present at disease onset. The principal finding on post-mortem examination of 4 brain specimens was loss of Purkinje neurons that was most severe in the vermis most particularly in the anterior vermis. Similar to European populations, a high percent of patients 21/28 (75%) reported a positive treatment response with 4-aminopyridine.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further estimates prevalence and further expands the clinical, imaging and pathological features of SCA27B, while looking at treatment response, disease progression, and survival in patients with this disease. Testing for SCA27B should be considered in all undiagnosed ataxia patients, especially those with episodic onset. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1092–1103</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether arterial spin labeling perfusion images of healthy controls can enhance ictal single-photon emission computed tomography analysis and whether the acquisition of the interictal image can be omitted.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed 2 pipelines: The first uses ictal and interictal images and compares these to single-photon emission computed tomography and arterial spin labeling of healthy controls. The second pipeline uses only the ictal image and the analogous healthy controls. Both pipelines were compared to the gold standard analysis and evaluated on data of individuals with epilepsy who underwent ictal single-photon emission computed tomography imaging during presurgical evaluation between 2010 and 2022. Fifty healthy controls prospectively underwent arterial spin labeling imaging. The correspondence between the detected hyperperfusion and the postoperative resection cavity or the presumably affected lobe was assessed using Dice score and mean Euclidean distance. Additionally, the outcomes of the pipelines were automatically assigned to 1 of 5 concordance categories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Inclusion criteria were met by 43 individuals who underwent epilepsy surgery and by 73 non-surgical individuals with epilepsy. Compared to the gold standard analysis, both pipelines resulted in significantly higher Dice scores and lower mean distances (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The combination of both provided localizing results in 85/116 cases, compared to 54/116 generated by the current gold standard analysis and the ictal image alone produced localizing results in 60/116 (52%) cases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We propose a new ictal single-photon emission computed tomography protocol; it finds relevantly more ictal hyperperfusion, and halves the radiation dose in about half of the individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1160–1173</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The transcriptional heterogeneity at a single-nucleus level in human Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) dystrophic muscle has not been explored. Here, we aimed to understand the transcriptional heterogeneity associated with myonuclei, as well as other mononucleated cell types that underly BMD pathogenesis by performing single-nucleus RNA sequencing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We profiled single-nucleus transcriptional profiles of skeletal muscle samples from 7 BMD patients and 3 normal controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 17,216 nuclei (12,879 from BMD patients and 4,337 from controls) were classified into 13 known cell types, including 9 myogenic lineages and 4 non-myogenic lineages, and 1 unclassified nuclear type according to their cell identities. Among them, type IIx myonuclei were the first to degenerate in response to dystrophin reduction. Differential expression analysis revealed that the fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) population had the largest transcriptional changes among all cell types. Sub-clustering analysis identified a significantly compositional increase in the activated FAPs (aFAPs) subpopulation in BMD muscles. Pseudotime analysis, regulon inference, and deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data derived from 29 BMD patients revealed that the aFAPs subpopulation, a distinctive and previously unrecognized mononuclear subtype, was profibrogenic and expanded in BMD patients. Muscle quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of the aFAPs markers including <i>LUM</i>, <i>DCN</i>, and <i>COL1A1</i> in BMD patients were significantly higher than those in controls, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide insights into the transcriptional diversity of human BMD muscle at a single-nucleus resolution and new potential targets for anti-fibrosis therapies in BMD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1070–1085</p>

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion/deletions syndrome (MDDS) comprises a group of diseases caused by primary autosomal defects of mtDNA maintenance. Our objective was to study the etiology of MDDS in 4 patients who lack pathogenic variants in known genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing of the probands was performed to identify pathogenic variants. We validated the mitochondrial defect by analyzing mtDNA, mitochondrial dNTP pools, respiratory chain activities, and GUK1 activity. To confirm pathogenicity of GUK1 deficiency, we expressed 2 GUK1 isoforms in patient cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified biallelic <i>GUK1</i> pathogenic variants in all 4 probands who presented with ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, and myopathic proximal limb weakness, as well as variable hepatopathy and altered T-lymphocyte profiles. Muscle biopsies from all probands showed mtDNA depletion, deletions, or both, as well as reduced activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes. <i>GUK1</i> encodes guanylate kinase, originally identified as a cytosolic enzyme. Long and short isoforms of GUK1 exist. We observed that the long isoform is intramitochondrial and the short is cytosolic. In probands’ fibroblasts, we noted decreased GUK1 activity causing unbalanced mitochondrial dNTP pools and mtDNA depletion in both replicating and quiescent fibroblasts indicating that GUK1 deficiency impairs de novo and salvage nucleotide pathways. Proband fibroblasts treated with deoxyguanosine and/or forodesine, a purine phosphatase inhibitor, ameliorated mtDNA depletion, indicating potential pharmacological therapies.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Primary GUK1 deficiency is a new and potentially treatable cause of MDDS. The cytosolic isoform of GUK1 may contribute to the T-lymphocyte abnormality, which has not been observed in other MDDS disorders. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1209–1224</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27072?af=R">Fetal Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage Imaging Patterns, Etiology, and Outcomes: A Single Center Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study examines associations among fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) injury patterns, etiologies, and outcomes in fetal intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective, single-center cohort study of IPH diagnosed on fetal MRI (1996–2022). IPH and associated abnormalities were categorized by 2 pediatric neuroradiologists; electronic medical records were reviewed by 2 pediatric neurologists to classify etiology and outcomes including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, developmental delay, and death.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-four fetuses with IPH were identified (34 singleton and 10 twin gestations) with MRI at median 24 weeks gestation (interquartile range [IQR] = 22–28 weeks). IPH was commonly supratentorial (84%) and focal (50%) or focal with diffuse injury (43%) and was often associated with germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH; 75%) and/or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; 52%). An etiology was identified in 75%, including twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS, n = 10), COL4A1/2 variants (n = 8), or other fetal/maternal conditions (n = 15). COL4A1/2 variants were associated with focal IPH and the presence of hemorrhagic porencephaly, and intrauterine transfusion was associated with infratentorial hemorrhage. Twenty-two fetuses were liveborn, and 18 pregnancies were terminated. Among those with follow-up ≥ 12 months (median = 7 years), 12 of 13 had cerebral palsy, 6 of 13 had developmental delay, and 5 of 13 had epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>An etiology for fetal IPH with or without GMH-IVH is identified in most cases in our cohort and is commonly TTTS, COL4A1/2 variants, or other maternal/fetal comorbidities. Pattern of fetal IPH on MRI is associated with etiology. Cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental impairment were common in liveborn infants. Genetic studies should be considered in cases of fetal IPH without an otherwise apparent cause. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1137–1147</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27073?af=R">Comparison of Perfusion Imaging Definitions of the No‐Reflow Phenomenon after Thrombectomy—What Is the Best Perfusion Imaging Definition?</a></h4>

              
                <p>The no-reflow phenomenon is a potential contributor to poor outcome despite successful thrombectomy. There are multiple proposed imaging-based definitions of no-reflow leading to wide variations in reported prevalence. We investigated the agreement between existing imaging definitions and compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients identified as having no-reflow.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed an external validation of 4 existing published definitions of no-reflow in thrombectomy patients with extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction scale 2c to 3 (eTICI2c-3) angiographic reperfusion who underwent 24-hour perfusion imaging from 2 international randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA TNK part-1 and 2) and a multicenter prospective observational study. Receiver-operating-characteristic and Bayesian-information-criterion (BIC) analyses were performed with the outcome variable being dependent-or-dead at 90-days (modified Rankin Score [mRS] ≥3).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 131 patients analyzed, the prevalence of no-reflow significantly varied between definitions (0.8–22.1%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There was poor agreement between definitions (kappa 5/6 comparisons &lt;0.212). Among patients with no-reflow according to at least 1 definition, there were significant differences between definitions in the intralesional interside differences in cerebral blood flow (CBF) (<i>p</i> = 0.006), cerebral blood volume (CBV) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and mean-transit-time (MTT) (<i>p</i> = 0.005). No-reflow defined by 3 definitions was associated with mRS ≥3 at 90 days. The definition of &gt;15% CBV or CBF asymmetry was the only definition that improved model fit on BIC analysis (ΔBIC = −8.105) and demonstrated an association between no-reflow and clinical outcome among patients with eTICI3 reperfusion.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Existing imaging definitions of no-reflow varied significantly in prevalence and post-treatment perfusion imaging profile, potentially explaining the variable prevalence of no-reflow reported in literature. The definition of &gt;15% CBV or CBF asymmetry best discriminated for functional outcome at 90 days, including patients with eTICI3 reperfusion. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1104–1114</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mitochondria are implicated in regulation of the innate immune response. We hypothesized that abnormalities in interferon signaling may contribute to pathophysiology in patients with primary mitochondrial disease (PMD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in whole blood samples from a cohort of patients with PMD.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Upregulated ISG expression was observed in a high proportion (41/55, 75%) of patients with PMD on at least 1 occasion, most frequently <i>IFI27</i> upregulation, seen in 50% of the samples. Some patients had extremely high <i>IFI27</i> levels, similar to those seen in patients with primary interferonopathies. A statistically significant correlation was observed between elevated <i>IFI27</i> gene expression and PMD, but not between <i>IFI27</i> and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that ISG upregulation is a biomarker of PMD. In some patients with PMD, ISG abnormalities persisted on repeat measurement over several years, indicative of ongoing chronic inflammation. Subgroup analyses suggested common ISG signatures in patients with similar mitochondrial disease mechanisms and positive correlations with disease severity among patients with identical genetic diagnoses.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Dysregulated interferon signaling is frequently seen in patients with PMD suggesting that interferon dysregulation is a contributor to pathophysiology. This may indicate a role for repurposing of immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of PMDs by targeting interferon signaling. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1185–1200</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To determine the prevalence and distribution of intracranial vessel occlusion identified on computed tomography (CT) or magnet resonance (MR) angiography and to explore its association with functional outcome in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter cohort study enrolling consecutive patients with AF with imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke who underwent CT- or MR-angiography on admission (2014–2022). Multivariable regression was used to explore the association between intracranial vessel occlusion and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 3–6) at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 10,164 patients (median age 81.5 years, 47.8% female, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission 6; 14.7% on a vitamin K antagonist [VKA], 27.5% on a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC], 57.8% not receiving oral anticoagulation). Angiography showed intracranial vessel occlusion in 5,190 patients (51.1%), affecting the anterior cerebral circulation in 87.4%. Overall, 29.2% and 29.4% of patients received thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, respectively. The proportion of patients with poor functional outcome at 90 days was 60.6% and 42.7% in those with and without vessel occlusion, respectively. In multivariable analyses, vessel occlusion was associated with poor functional outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.71–2.22) with consistent results in subgroups according to oral anticoagulation use (VKA, aOR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.40–2.80; DOAC, aOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.83–3.03; none, aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.49–2.09).</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sex differences in the association between cardiovascular risk factors and the incident all-cause dementia and the subtype Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk are unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants (n = 4,171, 54% women, aged 55 to 69 years) were included at baseline and followed up to 40 years. The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) was dichotomized into 2 levels (cutoff: 75th percentile of the FSRP z-scores). Cause-specific hazard models, with death as a competing event, and restricted mean survival time (RMST) model were used to analyze the association between FSRP levels and incident all-cause dementia and AD. Interactions between FSRP and sex were estimated, followed by a sex-stratified analysis to examine the sex modification effect.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>High FSRP was significantly associated with all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.25, robust 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21 to 1.29, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) and AD (HR = 1.58, robust 95% CI = 1.57 to 1.59, <i>p &lt;</i> 0.001) in cause-specific hazard models. High FSRP was significantly associated with incident dementia (HR = 2.81, robust 95% CI = 2.75 to 2.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and AD (HR = 2.96, robust 95% CI = 2.36 to 3.71, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in women, but not in men. Results were consistent in the RMST models. Current diabetes and high systolic blood pressure as FSRP components were significantly associated with dementia and AD in women but not in men.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>High FSRP in mid- to early late life is a critical risk factor for all-cause dementia and AD, particularly in women. Sex-specific interventions and further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms are warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1124–1134</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A significant challenge of video-electroencephalography (vEEG) in epilepsy diagnosis is timing monitoring sessions to capture epileptiform activity. In this study, we introduce and validate “pro-ictal EEG scheduling”, a method to schedule vEEG monitoring to coincide with periods of increased seizure likelihood as a low-risk approach to enhance the diagnostic yield.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A database of long-term ambulatory vEEG monitoring sessions (n = 5,038) of adults and children was examined. Data from linked electronic seizure diaries were extracted (minimum 10 self-reported events) to generate cycle-based estimates of seizure risk. In adults, vEEG monitoring sessions coinciding with periods of estimated high-risk were allocated to the high-risk group (n = 305) and compared to remaining studies (baseline: n = 3,586). Test of proportions and risk-ratios (RR) were applied to index differences in proportions and likelihood of capturing outcome measures (abnormal report, confirmed seizure, and diary event) during monitoring. The impact of clinical and demographic factors (age, sex, epilepsy-type, and medication) was also explored.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During vEEG monitoring, the high-risk group was significantly more likely to have an abnormal vEEG report (190/305:62% vs 1,790/3,586:50% [%change = 12%], RR = 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.137–1.370], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), present with a confirmed seizure (56/305:18% vs 424/3,586:11% [%change = 7%], RR = 1.63, 95% CI = [1.265–2.101], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and report an event (153/305:50% vs 1,267/3,586:35% (%change = 15%), RR = 1.420, 95% CI = [1.259:1.602], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Similar effects were observed across clinical and demographic features.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides the first large-scale validation of pro-ictal EEG scheduling in improving the yield of vEEG. This innovative approach offers a pragmatic and low-risk strategy to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of vEEG monitoring, significantly impacting epilepsy management.

                <p>by Lin Lin, Rachel L. Spreng, Kelly E. Seaton, S. Moses Dennison, Lindsay C. Dahora, Daniel J. Schuster, Sheetal Sawant, Peter B. Gilbert, Youyi Fong, Neville Kisalu, Andrew J. Pollard, Georgia D. Tomaras, Jia Li</p>

Despite significant progress in vaccine research, the level of protection provided by vaccination can vary significantly across individuals. As a result, understanding immunologic variation across individuals in response to vaccination is important for developing next-generation efficacious vaccines. Accurate outcome prediction and identification of predictive biomarkers would represent a significant step towards this goal. Moreover, in early phase vaccine clinical trials, small datasets are prevalent, raising the need and challenge of building a robust and explainable prediction model that can reveal heterogeneity in small datasets. We propose a new model named Generative Mixture of Logistic Regression (GeM-LR), which combines characteristics of both a generative and a discriminative model. In addition, we propose a set of model selection strategies to enhance the robustness and interpretability of the model. GeM-LR extends a linear classifier to a non-linear classifier without losing interpretability and empowers the notion of predictive clustering for characterizing data heterogeneity in connection with the outcome variable. We demonstrate the strengths and utility of GeM-LR by applying it to data from several studies. GeM-LR achieves better prediction results than other popular methods while providing interpretations at different levels.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012578">Human-like dissociations between confidence and accuracy in convolutional neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Medha Shekhar, Dobromir Rahnev</p>

Prior research has shown that manipulating stimulus energy by changing both stimulus contrast and variability results in confidence-accuracy dissociations in humans. Specifically, even when performance is matched, higher stimulus energy leads to higher confidence. The most common explanation for this effect, derived from cognitive modeling, is the positive evidence heuristic where confidence neglects evidence that disconfirms the choice. However, an alternative explanation is the signal-and-variance-increase hypothesis, according to which these dissociations arise from changes in the separation and variance of perceptual representations. Because artificial neural networks lack built-in confidence heuristics, they can serve as a test for the necessity of confidence heuristics in explaining confidence-accuracy dissociations. Therefore, we tested whether confidence-accuracy dissociations induced by stimulus energy manipulations emerge naturally in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We found that, across three different energy manipulations, CNNs produced confidence-accuracy dissociations similar to those found in humans. This effect was present for a range of CNN architectures from shallow 4-layer networks to very deep ones, such as VGG-19 and ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet. Further, we traced back the reason for the confidence-accuracy dissociations in all CNNs to the same signal-and-variance increase that has been proposed for humans: higher stimulus energy increased the separation and variance of evidence distributions in the CNNs’ output layer leading to higher confidence even for matched accuracy. These findings cast doubt on the necessity of the positive evidence heuristic to explain human confidence and establish CNNs as promising models for testing cognitive theories of human behavior.

                <p>by Michael Alexander Ramirez Sierra, Thomas R. Sokolowski</p>

Understanding how multicellular organisms reliably orchestrate cell-fate decisions is a central challenge in developmental biology, particularly in early mammalian development, where tissue-level differentiation arises from seemingly cell-autonomous mechanisms. In this study, we present a multi-scale, spatial-stochastic simulation framework for mouse embryogenesis, focusing on inner cell mass (ICM) differentiation into epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PRE) at the blastocyst stage. Our framework models key regulatory and tissue-scale interactions in a biophysically realistic fashion, capturing the inherent stochasticity of intracellular gene expression and intercellular signaling, while efficiently simulating these processes by advancing event-driven simulation techniques. Leveraging the power of Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) through the AI-driven Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE) algorithm, we conduct a large-scale Bayesian inferential analysis to identify parameter sets that faithfully reproduce experimentally observed features of ICM specification. Our results reveal mechanistic insights into how the combined action of autocrine and paracrine FGF4 signaling coordinates stochastic gene expression at the cellular scale to achieve robust and reproducible ICM patterning at the tissue scale. We further demonstrate that the ICM exhibits a specific time window of sensitivity to exogenous FGF4, enabling lineage proportions to be adjusted based on timing and dosage, thereby extending current experimental findings and providing quantitative predictions for both mutant and wild-type ICM systems. Notably, FGF4 signaling not only ensures correct EPI-PRE lineage proportions but also enhances ICM resilience to perturbations, reducing fate-proportioning errors by 10-20% compared to a purely cell-autonomous system. Additionally, we uncover a surprising role for variability in intracellular initial conditions, showing that high gene-expression heterogeneity can improve both the accuracy and precision of cell-fate proportioning, which remains robust when fewer than 25% of the ICM population experiences perturbed initial conditions. Our work offers a comprehensive, spatial-stochastic description of the biochemical processes driving ICM differentiation and identifies the necessary conditions for its robust unfolding. It also provides a framework for future exploration of similar spatial-stochastic systems in developmental biology.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002877">Decrease in decision noise from adolescence into adulthood mediates an increase in more sophisticated choice behaviors and performance gain</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vanessa Scholz, Maria Waltmann, Nadine Herzog, Annette Horstmann, Lorenz Deserno</p>

Learning and decision-making undergo substantial developmental changes, with adolescence being a particular vulnerable window of opportunity. In adolescents, developmental changes in specific choice behaviors have been observed (e.g., goal-directed behavior, motivational influences over choice). Elevated levels of decision noise, i.e., choosing suboptimal options, were reported consistently in adolescents. However, it remains unknown whether these observations, the development of specific and more sophisticated choice processes and higher decision noise, are independent or related. It is conceivable, but has not yet been investigated, that the development of specific choice processes might be impacted by age-dependent changes in decision noise. To answer this, we examined 93 participants (12 to 42 years) who completed 3 reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: a motivational Go/NoGo task assessing motivational influences over choices, a reversal learning task capturing adaptive decision-making in response to environmental changes, and a sequential choice task measuring goal-directed behavior. This allowed testing of (1) cross-task generalization of computational parameters focusing on decision noise; and (2) assessment of mediation effects of noise on specific choice behaviors. Firstly, we found only noise levels to be strongly correlated across RL tasks. Second, and critically, noise levels mediated age-dependent increases in more sophisticated choice behaviors and performance gain. Our findings provide novel insights into the computational processes underlying developmental changes in decision-making: namely a vital role of seemingly unspecific changes in noise in the specific development of more complex choice components. Studying the neurocomputational mechanisms of how varying levels of noise impact distinct aspects of learning and decision processes may also be key to better understand the developmental onset of psychiatric diseases.

                <p>by Michael Chimento, Gustavo Alarcón-Nieto, Lucy M. Aplin</p>

Longstanding theory predicts that strategic flexibility in when and how to use social information can help individuals make adaptive decisions, especially when environments are temporally or spatially variable. A short-term increase in reliance on social information under these conditions has been experimentally shown in primates, including humans, but whether this occurs in other taxa is unknown. We asked whether migration between spatially variable environments affected social information use with a large-scale cultural diffusion experiment with wild great tits (<i>Parus major</i>) in captivity, a small passerine bird that can socially learn novel behaviors. We simulated an immigration event where knowledgeable birds were exchanged between groups with opposing preferences for a socially learned foraging puzzle, living in similar or different environments. We found evidence that both immigrants and residents were influenced by social information and attended to the rewards that others received. Our analysis supported the use of a payoff-biased social learning by immigrants when both resources and habitat features were spatially variable. In contrast, immigrants relied more-so on individual learning when payoffs or the environment were unchanged. In summary, our results suggest that great tits assess the payoffs others receive and are more influenced by socially observed differences in payoffs when environmental cues differ in their new environment. Our results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that spatial variability is a strong driver for the evolution of social learning strategies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Subclinical vascular brain injury is an increasingly recognized risk factor for stroke and dementia. Despite well-established sex differences in vascular risk and disease prevalence, the impact of sex on drivers of subclinical vascular brain injury remains unclear, presenting a barrier to developing sex-specific prevention guidelines. We aimed to establish the extent to which sex moderates associations between vascular risk factors and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of subclinical brain injury in stroke-free older adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We leveraged cross-sectional data from 1,579 stroke- and dementia-free Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants at exam 8 (age 65.7 ± 8.8 years, 53% women). Vascular risks were assessed using components of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). White matter hyperintensity volume (WMH), total cerebral brain volume (TBV), and covert brain infarcts were quantified using MRI. We examined whether vascular risk factors were associated with MRI measures across the combined cohort, and then determined whether sex modified these associations.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Higher FSRP and specifically systolic blood pressure (SBP) were associated with greater WMH. These associations were stronger in women and remained after adjusting for menopause age and hormone therapy use. By contrast, diabetes and lower DBP were associated with smaller TBV primarily in men. The DBP-atrophy relationship was only observed in men with declining DBP or prior hypertension.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight differential vulnerability to the impact of vascular risk factors on white matter health in women and global atrophy in men, supporting the development of sex-specific guidelines to better preserve vascular brain health in aging. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), which capture patients' perspectives on the consequences of health and disease, are widely used in neurological care and research. However, it is unclear how PROMs relate to performance-rated impairments. Sociodemographic factors are known to affect PROMs. Direct damage to brain regions critical for self-awareness (i.e., parietal regions and the salience/ventral-attention network) may also impair self-report outcomes. This study examined the relationship between PROMs and performance-based measures in stroke survivors with arm motor impairments. We hypothesized that PROMs would be distinct from performance-based outcomes, influenced by sociodemographic factors, and linked to damage in brain circuits involved in self-perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally assessed 54 stroke survivors using patient-reported and performance-rated measures at 4 timepoints. We used factor analysis to reveal the outcome battery's factorial structure. Linear regression examined the association between classes of measures and sociodemographics. Voxel-lesion-symptom-mapping, region-of-interest-based analysis, and voxel-lesion-network-mapping investigated the relationship between classes of outcomes and stroke-related injury.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Performance-based and patient-reported measures formed distinct factors, consistent across recovery phases. Higher education (β1 = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and income adequacy (β2 = 0.48, <i>p</i> = 0.05) were associated with patient-reported, but not performance-rated outcomes. Greater parietal lobe injury, irrespective of hemisphere, was associated with worse patient-reported outcomes; greater corticospinal tract injury related to worse performance-rated outcomes. Lesions with greater functional connectivity to the salience/ventral-attention network were associated with worse patient-reported outcomes (<i>r</i> = −0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings reveal important differences between performance-rated and patient-reported outcomes, each with specific associated factors and anatomy post-stroke. Incorporating sociodemographic and neuroanatomic characteristics into neurorehabilitation strategies may inform and optimize patient outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Understanding the demographics, tumor characteristics, genetic mutations, and immune scores in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients may aid in tailoring treatment and predicting survival. Methods This retrospective cohort study assessed clinical parameters, immune scores, and their relationship with survival in patients with CRC. Results The study included 74 patients, mean age 53.7 years, mostly male (53.3%) and aged 41-70 (77.3%). Common comorbidities included cardiovascular diseases (29.3%) and hypertension (21.3%). Adenocarcinoma (74%) primarily affects the colon (73%). KRAS mutations and Microsatellite instability-High (MSI-H)/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) were found in 1.3% and 16% of patients, respectively. Stage IV (77.3%) and liver metastases (52.7%) were prevalent. Immune score was influenced by cancer stage (p = 0.04) and metastasis (p=0.05). The immune score was not associated with survival (p = 0.181). Patients with comorbidities had lower one- (p = 0.027) and two-year survival rates (p = 0.037) survival rates. Cardiovascular comorbidities negatively impacted one-year survival (p = 0.047) and two-year survival (p = 0.037). The mean survival time was shorter for males (2.047±0.288 vs. 2.781±0.195 years, p = 0.041), patients with comorbidities (1.772±0.371 vs. 2.702±0.188 years, p = 0.017), and cardiovascular comorbidities (1.558±0.316 vs. 2.685±0.207 years, p = 0.038). Comorbidities (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.948, p = 0.023) and cardiovascular comorbidities (unadjusted HR 2.695, p = 0.046) were initially associated with survival but lost significance after adjusting for confounding variables. Conclusions This study provides insights into CRC patient demographics and their interplay with the immune score and survival.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Harvey Jules Karten passed away on July 15, 2024. With his passing, the world lost a remarkable and energetic man who had made major contributions to neuroscience, in particular, resetting our understanding of the evolution of the forebrain and the evolution of intelligence. He left behind a legion of loyal colleagues with whom he had collaborated and shared ideas, students he had inspired and trained, and non-neuroscientist friends he had made in the passionate pursuit of his hobbies—sailing, skiing, and hiking.</p>

                The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial-prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) play a key role in decision-making and encode task states in addition to expected value. We review evidence suggesting a connection between value and state representations and argue that OFC / vmPFC integrate stimulus, context, and outcome information. Comparable encoding principles emerge in late layers of deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, where single nodes exhibit similar forms of mixed-selectivity, which enables flexible readout of relevant variables by downstream neurons. Based on these lines of evidence, we suggest that outcome-maximization leads to complex representational spaces that are insufficiently characterized by linear value signals that have been the focus of most prior research on the topic. Major outstanding questions concern the role of OFC/ vmPFC in learning across tasks, in encoding of task-irrelevant aspects, and the role of hippocampus–PFC interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93428">Structure of scavenger receptor SCARF1 and its interaction with lipoproteins</a></h4>

              
                SCARF1 (scavenger receptor class F member 1, SREC-1 or SR-F1) is a type I transmembrane protein that recognizes multiple endogenous and exogenous ligands such as modified low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and is important for maintaining homeostasis and immunity. But the structural information and the mechanisms of ligand recognition of SCARF1 are largely unavailable. Here, we solve the crystal structures of the N-terminal fragments of human SCARF1, which show that SCARF1 forms homodimers and its epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains adopt a long-curved conformation. Then, we examine the interactions of SCARF1 with lipoproteins and are able to identify a region on SCARF1 for recognizing modified LDLs. The mutagenesis data show that the positively charged residues in the region are crucial for the interaction of SCARF1 with modified LDLs, which is confirmed by making chimeric molecules of SCARF1 and SCARF2. In addition, teichoic acids, a cell wall polymer expressed on the surface of gram-positive bacteria, are able to inhibit the interactions of modified LDLs with SCARF1, suggesting the ligand binding sites of SCARF1 might be shared for some of its scavenging targets. Overall, these results provide mechanistic insights into SCARF1 and its interactions with the ligands, which are important for understanding its physiological roles in homeostasis and the related diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93242">An antimicrobial drug recommender system using MALDI-TOF MS and dual-branch neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Timely and effective use of antimicrobial drugs can improve patient outcomes, as well as help safeguard against resistance development. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is currently routinely used in clinical diagnostics for rapid species identification. Mining additional data from said spectra in the form of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles is, therefore, highly promising. Such AMR profiles could serve as a drop-in solution for drastically improving treatment efficiency, effectiveness, and costs. This study endeavors to develop the first machine learning models capable of predicting AMR profiles for the whole repertoire of species and drugs encountered in clinical microbiology. The resulting models can be interpreted as drug recommender systems for infectious diseases. We find that our dual-branch method delivers considerably higher performance compared to previous approaches. In addition, experiments show that the models can be efficiently fine-tuned to data from other clinical laboratories. MALDI-TOF-based AMR recommender systems can, hence, greatly extend the value of MALDI-TOF MS for clinical diagnostics. All code supporting this study is distributed on PyPI and is packaged at https://github.com/gdewael/maldi-nn.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99809">Isobaric crosslinking mass spectrometry technology for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and complexes</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic conformational and structural changes in proteins and protein complexes play a central and ubiquitous role in the regulation of protein function, yet it is very challenging to study these changes, especially for large protein complexes, under physiological conditions. Here, we introduce a novel isobaric crosslinker, Qlinker, for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and protein complexes using quantitative crosslinking mass spectrometry. Qlinkers are small and simple, amine-reactive molecules with an optimal extended distance of ~10 Å, which use MS2 reporter ions for relative quantification of Qlinker-modified peptides derived from different samples. We synthesized the 2-plex Q2linker and showed that the Q2linker can provide quantitative crosslinking data that pinpoints key conformational and structural changes in biosensors, binary and ternary complexes composed of the general transcription factors TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92025">Proteomic and functional comparison between human induced and embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have great potential to be used as alternatives to embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in regenerative medicine and disease modelling. In this study, we characterise the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines derived from independent donors and find that while they express a near-identical set of proteins, they show consistent quantitative differences in the abundance of a subset of proteins. hiPSCs have increased total protein content, while maintaining a comparable cell cycle profile to hESCs, with increased abundance of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins required to sustain high growth rates, including nutrient transporters and metabolic proteins. Prominent changes detected in proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism correlated with enhanced mitochondrial potential, shown using high-resolution respirometry. hiPSCs also produced higher levels of secreted proteins, including growth factors and proteins involved in the inhibition of the immune system. The data indicate that reprogramming of fibroblasts to hiPSCs produces important differences in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins compared to hESCs, with consequences affecting growth and metabolism. This study improves our understanding of the molecular differences between hiPSCs and hESCs, with implications for potential risks and benefits for their use in future disease modelling and therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98031">Astrocytes mediate two forms of spike timing-dependent depression at entorhinal cortex-hippocampal synapses</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex (EC) connects to the hippocampus sending different information from cortical areas that is first processed at the dentate gyrus (DG) including spatial, limbic and sensory information. Excitatory afferents from lateral (LPP) and medial (MPP) perforant pathways of the EC connecting to granule cells of the DG play a role in memory encoding and information processing and are deeply affected in humans suffering Alzheimer’s disease and temporal lobe epilepsy, contributing to the dysfunctions found in these pathologies. The plasticity of these synapses is not well known yet, as are not known the forms of long-term depression (LTD) existing at those connections. We investigated whether spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) exists at these two different EC-DG synaptic connections in mice, and whether they have different action mechanisms. We have found two different forms of t-LTD, at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses and characterised their cellular and intracellular mechanistic requirements. We found that both forms of t-LTD are expressed presynaptically and that whereas t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses does not require NMDAR, t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDAR containing GluN2A subunits. The two forms of t-LTD require different group I mGluR, mGluR5 LPP-GC synapses and mGluR1 MPP-GC synapses. In addition, both forms of t-LTD require postsynaptic calcium, eCB synthesis, CB<sub>1</sub>R, astrocyte activity, and glutamate released by astrocytes. Thus, we discovered two novel forms of t-LTD that require astrocytes at EC-GC synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96425">Chemokine expression profile of an innate granuloma</a></h4>

              
                Granulomas are defined by the presence of organized layers of immune cells that include macrophages. Granulomas are often characterized as a way for the immune system to contain an infection and prevent its dissemination. We recently established a mouse infection model where <i>Chromobacterium violaceum</i> induces the innate immune system to form granulomas in the liver. This response successfully eradicates the bacteria and returns the liver to homeostasis. Here, we sought to characterize the chemokines involved in directing immune cells to form the distinct layers of a granuloma. We use spatial transcriptomics to investigate the spatial and temporal expression of all CC and CXC chemokines and their receptors within this granuloma response. The expression profiles change dynamically over space and time as the granuloma matures and then resolves. To investigate the importance of monocyte-derived macrophages in this immune response, we studied the role of CCR2 during <i>C. violaceum</i> infection. <i>Ccr2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice had negligible numbers of macrophages, but large numbers of neutrophils, in the <i>C. violaceum</i>-infected lesions. In addition, lesions had abnormal architecture resulting in loss of bacterial containment. Without CCR2, bacteria disseminated and the mice succumbed to the infection. This indicates that macrophages are critical to form a successful innate granuloma in response to <i>C. violaceum</i>.

                The brain is a dynamic system where complex behaviours emerge from interactions across distributed regions. Accurately linking brain function to cognition requires tools that are sensitive to these dynamics. We introduce a novel technique - Feature Similarity (FS) - to capture intricate interaction patterns between brain systems. Our results show that FS can capture functional brain organisation: regions within the same functional network have greater FS compared to those in different networks, and FS also identifies the principal gradient that spans from unimodal to transmodal cortices. FS was found to be more sensitive to task modulation than traditional functional connectivity (FC). Specifically, FS reveals interaction patterns missed by FC, such as a double dissociation in the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN): greater interaction with the Visual network during working memory tasks and greater interaction with the default mode network (DMN) during long-term memory tasks. This study highlights FS as a promising tool for understanding flexibility in brain network dynamics.

">SEX-RELATED GENE EXPRESSION IN THE POSTERODORSAL MEDIAL AMYGDALA OF CYCLING FEMALE RATS ALONG WITH PROLACTIN MODULATION OF LORDOSIS BEHAVIOR</a></h4>

              
                The rat posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD) is sexually dimorphic, has a high concentration of receptors for gonadal hormones and prolactin (PRL), and modulates reproduction. To unravel genetic and functional data for this relevant node of the social behavior network, we studied the expression of ERalpha, ERbeta, GPER1, Kiss1, Kiss1R, PRGR, PRL, PRLR, EGR1, JAK2, STAT5A, and STAT5B in the MePD of males and females along the estrous cycle using the RT-qPCR technique. We also investigated whether PRL in the MePD would affect the sexual behavior display of proestrus females by microinjecting saline, the PRL receptor antagonist Del1-9-G129R-hPRL (1 microM and 10 microM), or PRL (1 nM) and Del1-9-G129R-hPRL (10 microM) 3h before the onset of the dark-cycle period. The estrogen-dependent lordosis behavior, indicative of sexual receptivity of proestrus females, was recorded and compared before (control) and after (test) microinjections in these groups. Sex differences were found in the right and left MePD gene expression. ERalpha and Kiss1R, as well as PRL, Short PRLR, and STAT5B expression is higher in cycling females than males. Kiss1 expression is higher in males than females, and GPER1 is higher during diestrus than proestrus. Furthermore, Del1-9-G129R-hPRL in the MePD significantly reduced the full display and quotient of lordosis in proestrus females, an effect restored by the co-microinjection of PRL. In conjunction, the expression of studied genes showed specific sex and estrous cycle phase features while, in proestrus, PRL action in the MePD plays an essential role in the display of lordosis during the ovulatory period.

">Multimodal investigation of the neurocognitive deficits underlying dyslexia in adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Dyslexia is a neurobiological disorder characterised by reading difficulties, yet its underlying causes remain unclear. Neuroimaging and behavioural studies found anomalous responses in tasks requiring phonological processing, motion perception, and implicit learning, and showed gray and white matter abnormalities in several brain regions of dyslexics compared to controls, indicating that dyslexia is a heterogeneous condition and promoting a multifactorial approach. In order to evaluate whether the combination of behavioural and multimodal MRI can have greater sensitivity in identifying neurocognitive traits of dyslexia compared to monocomponential approaches, in 19 dyslexic and 19 control subjects we acquired behavioural cognitive assessments, multiple (phonological, visual motion, rhythmic) mismatch-response functional MRI tasks, structural diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted images. To examine between-group differences in the multimodal neurocognitive measures, we applied univariate and multivariate approaches. Results showed that dyslexics performed worse than controls in behavioural phonological tasks. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that individuals with dyslexia present reduced cerebellar responses to mismatching rhythmic stimuli, as well as structural disorganization in several white matter tracts and cortical regions previously implicated in dyslexia. Most importantly, in line with the view of dyslexia as a multifactorial phenomenon, a machine learning model trained with features from all three MRI modalities (functional, diffusion, and T1-weighted) discriminated between dyslexics and controls with greater accuracy than models including just one modality. The individual classification scores in the multimodal machine learning model correlated with behavioural reading accuracy. These results confirm that dyslexia should be approached as a composite condition characterised by multiple distinctive cognitive and brain features.

">Comparative analysis of spike-sorters in large-scale brainstem recordings</a></h4>

              
                Recent technological advancements in high-density multi-channel electrodes have made it possible to record large numbers of neurons from previously inaccessible regions. While the performance of automated spike-sorters has been assessed in recordings from cortex, dentate gyrus, and thalamus, the most effective and efficient approach for spike-sorting can depend on the target region due to differing morphological and physiological characteristics. We therefore assessed the performance of five commonly used sorting packages, Kilosort3, MountainSort5, Tridesclous, SpyKING CIRCUS, and IronClust, in recordings from the rostral ventromedial medulla, a region that has been characterized using single-electrode recordings but that is essentially unexplored at the high-density network level. As demonstrated in other brain regions, each sorter produced unique results. Manual curation preferentially eliminated units detected by only one sorter. Kilosort3 and IronClust required the least curation while maintaining the largest number of units, whereas SpyKING CIRCUS and MountainSort5 required substantial curation. Tridesclous consistently identified the smallest number of units. Nonetheless, all sorters successfully identified classically defined RVM physiological cell types. These findings suggest that while the level of manual curation needed may vary across sorters, each can extract meaningful data from this deep brainstem site.

Significance StatementHigh-density multichannel recording probes that can access deep brainstem structures have only recently become commercially available, but the performance of open-source spike-sorting packages applied to recordings from these regions has not yet been evaluated. The present findings demonstrate that Kilosort3, MountainSort5, Tridesclous, SpyKING CIRCUS, and IronClust can all be reasonably used to identify units in a deep brainstem structure, the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). However, manual curation of the output was essential for all sorters. Importantly, all sorters identified the known, physiologically defined RVM cell classes, confirming their utility for deep brainstem recordings. Our findings provide suggestions for processing parameters to use for brainstem recordings and highlight considerations when using high-density silicon probes in the brainstem.

">Brain functional network connectivity interpolation characterizes neuropsychiatric continuum and heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are challenging to characterize in part due to their heterogeneous presentation in individuals, with psychotic symptoms now thought to exist on a continuum from the general population to chronic SZ. Conventional diagnostic and neuroimaging analytical approaches rely on subjective assessment or group differences, but typically ignore progression between groups or heterogeneity within a group. Here, we propose a functional network connectivity (FNC) interpolation framework based on an unsupervised generative model, a variational autoencoder (VAE), to estimate the neuropsychiatric continuum and heterogeneity using static FNC (sFNC) and dynamic FNC (dFNC) data from controls and patients with SZ or ASD. We first demonstrate that VAEs significantly outperform a linear baseline and a semi-supervised counterpart in the interpolation task. We next utilize VAEs to perform sFNC and dFNC interpolation separately. For sFNC interpolation, we observe a high degree of correspondence between the generated sFNC and the corresponding original sFNC. We display the sFNC matrices on a two-dimensional grid to examine individual- and group-specific patterns, as well as pattern alterations. Specifically, the interpolated continua from patients to controls in both disorders show increased hyper-connectivity within the auditory, sensorimotor and visual networks, and between the subcortical and cerebellar domains, as well as hypo-connectivity between the subcortical domain and the sensory domains, and between the cerebellar domain and the sensory regions. For dFNC interpolation, we find that the generated dFNC states effectively capture representative and generalizable dynamic properties for each group. Finally, we show examples of how to leverage interpolation in the VAE latent space, following pathological, state-based, or temporal trajectories. The proposed framework offers added advantages over traditional methods, including data-driven discovery of hidden relationships, visualization of individual differences, imputation of missing values along a continuous spectrum, and estimation of the stage where an individual falls within the continuum. Further, it could potentially be applied to identify patient subgroups and predict future disorder progression.

">Older is Order: Entropy reduction in cortical spontaneous activity marks healthy aging</a></h4>

              
                Entropy trajectories remain unclear for the aging process of human brain system due to the lacking of longitudinal neuroimaging resource. We used open data from an accelerated longitudinal cohort (PREVENT-AD) that included 24 healthy aging participants followed by 4 years with 5 visits per participant to establish cortical entropy aging curves and distinguish with the effects of age and cohort. This reveals that global cortical entropy decreased with aging, while a significant cohort effect was detectable that people who were born earlier showed higher cortical entropy. Such entropy reductions were also evident for large-scale cortical networks, although with different rates of reduction for different networks. Specifically, the primary and intermediate networks reduce their entropy faster than the higher-order association networks. We conclude two specific characteristics of the entropy of the human cortex with aging: the shift of the complexity hierarchy and the diversity of complexity strengthen.

">Modeling Complex Animal Behavior with Latent State Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                Understanding complex animal behavior is crucial for linking brain computation to observed actions. While recent research has shifted towards modeling behavior as a dynamic process, few approaches exist for modeling long-term, naturalistic behaviors such as navigation. We introduce discrete Dynamical Inverse Reinforcement Learning (dDIRL), a latent state-dependent paradigm for modeling complex animal behavior over extended periods. dDIRL models animal behavior as being driven by internal state-specific rewards, with Markovian transitions between the distinct internal states. Using expectation-maximization, we infer reward functions corresponding to each internal states and the transition probabilities between them, from observed behavior. We applied dDIRL to water-starved mice navigating a labyrinth, analyzing each animal individually. Our results reveal three distinct internal states sufficient to describe behavior, including a consistent water-seeking state occupied for less than half the time. We also identified two clusters of animals with different exploration patterns in the labyrinth. dDIRL offers a nuanced understanding of how internal states and their associated rewards shape observed behavior in complex environments, paving the way for deeper insights into the neural basis of naturalistic behavior.

">Interactions established by isoform-specific TrkB-T1 sequences govern inflammatory response and neurotoxicity in stroke</a></h4>

              
                Ugalde-Trivino et al. develop cell-penetrating peptides derived from neurotrophin receptor TrkB-T1 to identify isoform-specific protein interactions and demonstrate protective effects on neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity reducing brain damage in a mice model of ischemic stroke, of relevance to human therapy.

AbstractGlia reactivity, neuroinflammation and excitotoxic neuronal death are central processes to ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, altogether a leading cause of death, disability, and dementia. Due to the high incidence of these pathologies and the lack of efficient treatments, it is a priority developing brain protective therapies impacting both neurons and glial cells. Truncated neurotrophin receptor TrkB-T1, a protein produced by all these cells, plays relevant roles in excitotoxicity and ischemia. We have hypothesized that interactions established by isoform-specific TrkB-T1 sequences might be relevant to neurotoxicity and/or reactive gliosis and, therefore, constitute a therapeutic target. We identify here the TrkB-T1-specific interactome, poorly described to date, and demonstrate that interference of these protein-protein interactions using brain-accessible TrkB-T1-derived peptides can prevent reactive gliosis and decrease excitotoxicity-induced damage in cellular and mouse models of stroke. The pivotal role played by TrkB-T1 on microglia and astrocyte reactivity suggests that isoform-derived peptides could become important in development of therapies for human stroke and other excitotoxicity-associated pathologies.

">A Unified Approach for Identifying PET-based Neuronal Activation and Molecular Connectivity with the functional PET toolbox</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Functional PET (fPET) enables the identification of stimulation-specific changes of various physiological processes (e.g., glucose metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis) as well as computation of individual molecular connectivity and group-level molecular covariance. However, currently no consistent analysis approach is available for these techniques. We present a versatile, freely available toolbox designed for the analysis of fPET data, thereby filling a gap in the assessment of neuroimaging data. Methods: The fPET toolbox supports analyses for a variety of radiotracers, scanners, experimental protocols, cognitive tasks and species. It includes general linear model (GLM)-based assessment of task-specific effects, percent signal change and absolute quantification, as well as independent component analysis (ICA) for data-driven analyses. Furthermore, it allows computation of molecular connectivity via temporal correlations of PET signals between regions and molecular covariance as between-subject covariance using static images. Results: Toolbox performance was validated by analysis protocols established in previous work. Stimulation-induced changes in [18F]FDG metabolic demands and neurotransmitter dynamics obtained with 6-[18F]FDOPA and [11C]AMT were robustly detected across different cognitive tasks. Molecular connectivity analysis demonstrated metabolic interactions between different networks, whereas group-level covariance analysis highlighted interhemispheric relationships. These results underscore the flexibility of fPET in capturing dynamic molecular processes. Conclusions: The toolbox offers a comprehensive, unified and user-friendly platform for analyzing fPET data across a variety of experimental settings. It provides a reproducible analysis approach, which in turn facilitates sharing of analyses pipelines and comparison across centers to advance the study of brain metabolism and neurotransmitter dynamics in health and disease.

">Bidirectional Impact of miR-29a modulation on Memory Stability in the Adult Brain</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs are key regulators of brain gene expression, with miR-29a notably upregulated from development to adulthood and in aging, and showing links to cognitive decline. However, the extent to which miR-29 levels influence learning and memory processes, and its molecular mediators, remains to be determined. Here, we down- and up-regulated miR-29a levels in the dorsal hippocampus of adult mice to reveal miR-29 role in memory. Inhibiting miR-29a enhanced trace fear memory stability, increased Dnmt3a levels, and affected CpG methylation in gene regulation regions. In contrast, increasing miR-29a impaired memory performances and decreased Dnmt3a levels, suggesting a destabilization of memory processes. Proteomic and transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that miR-29a antagonism upregulated RNA-binding and synaptic proteins and downregulated inflammation and myelin associated proteins. These results underscore miR-29a pivotal role in memory persistence, plasticity, and cognitive aging, suggesting that miR-29a modulation could offer potential strategies for cognitive enhancement and age-related memory decline.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous research has explored the neural mechanisms of bilinguals’ language production, but most studies focused on neural mechanisms of cognitive control during language production. Therefore, it is unclear which brain regions represent lexical information (especially phonological information) during production and how they are affected by language context. To address those questions, we used representational similarity analysis to explore neural representations of phonological information in native (L1) and second languages (L2) in the single- and mixed-language contexts, respectively. Results showed that Chinese–English bilinguals behaviorally performed worse and exhibited more activations in brain regions associated with language processing and cognitive control in the mixed-language context relative to the single-language context. Further representational similarity analysis revealed that phonological representations of L1 were detected in the left pars opercularis, middle frontal gyrus, and anterior supramarginal gyrus, while phonological representations of L2 were detected in the bilateral occipitotemporal cortex regardless of the target language. More interestingly, robust phonological representations of L1 were observed in brain areas related to phonological processing during L2 production regardless of language context. These results provide direct neuroimaging evidence for the nonselective processing hypothesis and highlight the superiority of phonological representations in the dominant language during bilingual language production.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Visual working memory has a limited maximum capacity, which can be larger if stimuli are presented bilaterally vs. unilaterally. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage are not known. Visual working memory capacity is predicted by oscillatory delay-period activity, specifically, by a decrease in alpha (8 to 12 Hz) band amplitudes in posterior brain regions reflecting attentional deployment and related shifts in excitation, as well as a concurrent increase of prefrontal oscillation amplitudes and interareal synchronization in multiple frequencies reflecting active maintenance of information. Here, we asked whether posterior alpha suppression or prefrontal oscillation enhancement explains the bilateral field advantage. We recorded brain activity with high-density electroencephalography, while subjects (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 26, 14 males) performed a visual working memory task with uni- and bilateral visual stimuli. The bilateral field advantage was associated with early suppression of low-alpha (6 to 10 Hz) and alpha–beta (10 to 17 Hz) band amplitudes, and a subsequent alpha–beta amplitude increase, which, along with a concurrent load-dependent interareal synchronization in the high-alpha band (10 to 15 Hz), correlated with hit rates and reaction times and thus predicted higher maximum capacities in bilateral than unilateral visual working memory. These results demonstrate that the electrophysiological basis of the bilateral field advantage in visual working memory is both in the changes in attentional deployment and enhanced interareal integration.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The Implicit Prosody Hypothesis (IPH) posits that individuals generate internal prosodic representations during silent reading, mirroring those produced in spoken language. While converging behavioral evidence supports the IPH, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain largely unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the neurophysiological markers of sensitivity to speech rhythm cues during silent word reading. Methods: EEGs were recorded while participants silently read four-word sequences, each composed of either trochaic words (stressed on the first syllable) or iambic words (stressed on the second syllable). Each sequence was followed by a target word that was either metrically congruent or incongruent with the preceding rhythmic pattern. To investigate the effects of metrical expectancy and lexical stress type, we examined single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) and time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency representations (TFRs) time-locked to target words. Results: The results showed significant differences based on the stress pattern expectancy and type. Specifically, words that carried unexpected stress elicited larger ERP negativities between 240 and 628 ms after the word onset. Furthermore, different frequency bands were sensitive to distinct aspects of the rhythmic structure in language. Alpha activity tracked the rhythmic expectations, and theta and beta activities were sensitive to both the expected rhythms and specific locations of the stressed syllables. Conclusions: The findings clarify neurocognitive mechanisms of phonological and lexical mental representations during silent reading using a conservative data-driven approach. Similarity with neural response patterns previously reported for spoken language contexts suggests shared neural networks for implicit and explicit speech rhythm processing, further supporting the IPH and emphasizing the centrality of prosody in reading.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by progressive impairment of neuronal transmission due to focal demyelination. The most common form is RRMS (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis), which, under the influence of certain factors, can progress to SPMS (secondary progressive multiple sclerosis). Our study aimed to validate the criteria proposed by a working group of the Romanian Society of Neurology versus the criteria proposed by a group of experts from Spain, Karolinska, and Croatia concerning the progression from RRMS to SPMS. Methods: This was done by gathering epidemiological data (age, gender) and by applying clinical tests such as the 9HPT (9-hole peg test), 25FWT (25-foot walk test), and EDSS (expanded disability status scale) tests and the SDMT test (symbol digit modalities test). The present research is a cohort study that included a number of 120 patients diagnosed with MS according to the McDonald Diagnostic Criteria 2017. The study was carried out between January 2023 and April 2024, including patients hospitalized in the Neurology Clinic of the Clinical Rehabilitation Hospital from Iasi, Romania. The data were collected at baseline (T0) and at a 12-month interval (T1). Results: The statistical analysis was conducted using Kaiser&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer&amp;amp;ndash;Olkin analysis, which indicated a value of 0.683, thus validating the clinical tests used. The correlation matrix and the linear regression for all the tests showed highly significant statistical results. Furthermore, the ROC curve analysis of the criteria suggested by the working group of the Romanian Society of Neurology demonstrated that the EDSS, 9HPT, and 25FWT are highly sensitive in diagnosing SPMS, an opinion that is shared with the Spanish experts, but not with the Karolinska expert panel. Using the criteria given by the Croatian expert group in the ROC curve analysis showed that only the EDSS was strongly significant for the progression to the SPMS phase. Conclusions: In conclusion, all clinical methods used demonstrated that they are valid and can contribute to identifying patients with an increased risk of progression. The model proposed by the Romanian Society of Neurology working group is similar to other countries&amp;amp;rsquo; expert opinions and can be used to detect the risk of disease progression and establish a more tailored therapeutic management of SPMS.</p>

	<p>Background: Adolescence is an important point in the emotional development of young people. It is a time when young people are characterised by a high degree of emotional instability and seek effective ways to regulate their emotions. One of the frequent methods they use to cope with emotional tension is self-injurious behaviour. Methods: In the context of the rising incidence of self-harm among adolescents, this study aims to understand the association of temperament with the experience of tension and self-injurious behaviour along with the mediating role of perfectionism among 366 adolescents aged 15 to 20 years (Mage = 17.98, SD = 1.302, 52.7% female). Participants completed questionnaires on temperament traits, level of perfectionism, and experience of tension and self-injurious behaviour. Results: The results show that traits such as perfectionism, sensory sensitivity and emotional reactivity increase the risk of self-injurious behaviour. Maladaptive perfectionism partially mediates the relationship between these traits and the tendency to experience emotional tension. A temperament profile with a protective role was also identified. Conclusions: The results of the study highlight the importance of innate traits as well as environmental and cognitive influences, and may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to self-injurious behaviour and strategies aimed at its prevention.</p>

                Background Glioma is the second most common type of brain tumor, accounting for 24% of all brain tumor cases. The current diagnostic procedure is through an invasive tissue sampling to obtain histopathological analysis, however, not all patients are able to undergo a high-risk procedure. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as promising biomarkers for glioma due to their sensitivity, specificity, and non-invasive properties. There is currently no defined miRNA profile that contributes to determining the grade of glioma. This study aims to find the answer for “Is there any significant miRNA that able to distinguish different grades of glioma?”. Methods This study was conducted to compare the expression of miRNAs between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG). Eighteen blood plasma samples from glioma patients and 6 healthy controls were analyzed for 798 human miRNA profiles using NanoString nCounter Human v3 miRNA Expression Assay. The differential expressions of miRNAs were then analyzed to identify the differences in miRNA expression between LGG and HGG. Results Analyses showed significant expressions in 12 miRNAs between LGG and HGG, where all of them were downregulated. Out of these significant miRNAs, miR-518b, miR-1271-3p, and miR-598-3p showed the highest potential for distinguishing HGG from LGG, with area under curve (AUC) values of 0.912, 0.889, and 0.991, respectively. Conclusion miR-518b, miR-1271-3p, and miR-598-3p demonstrate significant potentials in distinguishing LGG and HGG.

                Abstract Climate change is rapidly transforming ecosystems and reshaping the landscapes of animal health, with profound consequences for public health, food security, and biodiversity. Rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters are driving the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, particularly zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. These environmental shifts endanger the health and welfare of animals and the delicate balance between human populations, livestock, and wildlife. As the stewards of animal health, veterinarians are uniquely positioned to lead the change in addressing these complex challenges at the nexus of human, animal, and environmental health and well-being. This article calls for urgent actions to integrate climate adaptation and mitigation strategies into veterinary practice and education. It underscores the critical need for veterinarians to embrace the One Health approach to tackle climate-driven disease outbreaks and the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance to safeguard human and animal populations while protecting natural ecosystems. The article further explores the role of veterinarians in fostering sustainable agricultural practices, reducing the environmental impact of livestock production, conserving biodiversity and advocating for policy reforms that protect both animal and planetary health. As we face an era of unprecedented climate disruption, this call to action aims to inspire the global veterinary community to actively get involved in combating climate change and its worst impacts. By building climate-resilient practices, enhancing disease surveillance, and championing environmental stewardship, veterinarians can contribute significantly to a healthier, more sustainable future for all species on Earth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1359/v1?src=rss">De-ethnicizing Ethiopian higher education leadership: the quest for merit-based governance [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the growing trend of ethnicized leadership in Ethiopian higher education institutions and advocates for a shift toward merit-based governance to improve institutional integrity and performance. Since 1991, with the introduction of ethnic federalism, leadership appointments in Ethiopian universities have increasingly been based on ethnic identity rather than qualifications. This has led to governance challenges, weakened academic standards, and reduced institutional efficiency. The study highlights the need for governance reforms prioritizing meritocracy to enhance the quality and sustainability of Ethiopia’s ethnically diverse higher education system. Methods The study utilizes a qualitative research approach, combining both primary and secondary data. Primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews with university administrators, faculty, and governance experts, while secondary data were gathered from institutional reports, government policies, and academic literature. Institutional theory, principal-agent theory, and meritocratic theory frame the analysis, providing insights into how ethnic-based leadership appointments affect university governance and performance. Results The findings reveal that ethnicized leadership has eroded governance structures, lowered academic quality, and compromised institutional efficiency. Leadership appointments based on ethnicity rather than merit have led to poor decision-making, weakened accountability, and reduced transparency. In contrast, merit-based governance improves accountability, decision-making, and institutional performance. The study emphasizes that transitioning to a meritocratic leadership model is vital for restoring institutional integrity and academic excellence in Ethiopian universities. Conclusions Ethnic federalism, while initially designed to empower regions, has politicized federal institutions, including universities, reducing them to regional entities rather than national institutions. This system of ethnicized leadership has fostered a culture of favoritism, rampant corruption, and ineffective governance, ultimately weakening Ethiopia’s higher education system. Recommendations Governance reforms that prioritize merit-based appointments are urgently needed. Legal reforms, transparent leadership selection processes, depoliticization efforts, and capacity-building initiatives are recommended to foster a meritocratic culture and improve institutional performance in Ethiopian universities.

                Background Traditional dietary assessments are often inaccurate and prone to self-reporting biases. Tracking the physiological responses associated with eating and digestion events via wearable technologies may provide an effective approach for continuously monitoring food intake and estimating energy consumption. Eating and digestion are accompanied by a series of changes in the heart rate, skin temperature, blood oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. These changes can be tracked by wearable devices, such as smartwatches, which have been widely accepted in the market. This systematic review is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of tracking such physiological biomarkers in differentiating between high- and low-calorie meals, potentially paving the way for more accurate dietary monitoring. Methods Following the PRISMA-P guidelines, we will conduct a systematic literature search through MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed for clinical trials that investigated physiological responses following meal intake in healthy subjects. Two independent reviewers will screen and select articles based on pre-defined eligibility criteria, with a third review to resolve any discrepancies. This will be followed by data extraction and quality assessment of the included studies. Statistical analyses, including meta-analyses, will be performed using R Studio software. Our primary outcome will be the comparison of physiological biomarkers before and after meal intake, while secondary outcomes will include comparisons of physiological biomarkers between high- and low-calorie meal consumption and the correlation between the caloric content of consumed meals and postprandial physiological changes. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will identify physiological indicators for eating events and inform the design of wearable sensors that estimate food intake in healthy subjects.

                Background Breast cancer has become the most prevalent disease and its incidence has almost doubled in the Indian population. This increased burden demands new targeted therapies with novel compounds either synthetically produced or derived from indigenous plants, which could be a promising approach for the development of drugs. Euphorbia thymifolia L is a widely growing tropical herb that has been reported to have various ethnopharmacological properties. Although Euphorbia genus is reported to have anticancer properties, E. thymifolia is not reported to have anticancer properties to date. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to screen the phytoconstituents and identify the active compounds present in the methanolic extract of E. thymifolia (ME.ET) as ligands to inhibit human cancer cell lines with special reference to potential protein targets implicated in breast cancer using an In-silico approach. Methods ME.ET was subjected to GC-MS analysis to screen the phytoconstituents, and the identified compounds were docked with protein targets such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1), a serine/threonine kinase-1(AKT1), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), polo-like kinase-1(PLK1), and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK6). Compounds with good docking scores were further subjected to dynamic studies to understand the protein ligand binding stability, ligand pathway calculation, and molecular mechanics energies combined with Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) calculations using the Schrodinger suite. Results GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 245 phytoconstituents, 219 of which were unique. When subjected to docking, these phytocompounds, namely 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl dibenzoate (TTDB) and succinic acid, 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl 4-isopropylphenyl ester (SADPE), showed good docking scores. Molecular dynamics studies showed a high affinity and low binding energy for TTDB with HER2, ERK1, and SADPE with ER. Conclusions Hence, in this study, we identified two lead compounds in E.thymifolia linn. Further invitro and invivo anticancer studies can be performed to confirm these results and to understand the molecular mechanism by which they exhibit anticancer activity against breast cancer.
