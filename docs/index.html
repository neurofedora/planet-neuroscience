              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pinging the brain to reveal the hidden attentional priority map</a></h4>

              
                Priority maps are winner-take-all neural mechanisms that are thought to guide the allocation of attention. Within these maps, attentional priority is coded as weights on a topographic representation of physical space. Research has shown that these weights are not just influenced by the current stimuli presented but also by selection episodes that occurred in the past - called selection history. The current study demonstrates, for the first time, that these latent, implicitly-learned spatial biases can be visualized by "pinging" the brain (a technique previously used to study activity-silent working memory). By briefly flashing high-contrast, task-irrelevant visual stimuli in the inter-stimulus interval between searches, participants current history-trained latent attentional priority could be decoded via scalp encephalography. Our findings not only offer a novel method of visualising this latent attentional priority map, but also shed light on the underlying mechanisms allowing our past experiences to influence future behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of the parietal lobe in task-irrelevant suppression during learning</a></h4>

              
                Background: Attention optimizes the selection of visual information, while suppressing irrelevant visual input through cortical mechanisms that are still unclear. We set to investigate these processes using an attention task with an embedded to-be-ignored interfering visual input. Objective: We delivered electrical stimulation to attention-related brain areas to modulate these facilitatory/inhibitory attentional mechanisms. We asked whether training on a task while being simultaneously exposed to visual features from a different task tested at baseline and post-training might influence performance on the baseline task. Methods: In Experiment one, subjects performed an orientation discrimination (OD) task using a pair of gratings presented at individual's psychophysical threshold. We then trained participants over multiple sessions on a temporal order judgment task (TOJ), using the exact same gratings but presented with different time offsets. On the last session we re-tested OD. We coupled training with transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over the parietal cortex, the human middle temporal area or sham, in three separate groups. In Experiment two, subjects performed the same OD task at baseline and post-training, while tRNS was delivered at rest during training. Results: Results showed that tRNS over parietal cortex facilitated learning of the trained task. Moreover, we found a detrimental effect on OD when subjects received parietal tRNS coupled with training, but a benefit on OD when subjects received stimulation while at rest. Conclusions: These results clearly indicate that task-irrelevant information is actively suppressed during learning, and that this prioritization mechanism of selection likely resides in the parietal cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural signature of reward</a></h4>

              
                Using a neurometric approach, we identify and validate a neural signature of reward encoded in a distributed pattern of brain activity using data collected from 21 different studies (N = 2,691). Our model can discriminate between receiving rewards from punishments in completely independent data with 99% accuracy and includes weights located in regions containing a high density of D2/D3 receptors. The model exhibits strong generalizability across a range of tasks probing reward, and a high degree of specificity for reward compared to non-reward constructs. We demonstrate several applications of how this model can infer psychological states of positive affect in the absence of self report. The model is sensitive to changes in brain activity following causal manipulations of homeostatic states, can uncover individual preferences for loss-aversion, and can be used to identify positive affective experiences when watching a television show. Our results suggest that there is a shared neural signature of reward elicited across these different task contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in information processing predict sleep-based memory consolidation of complex rules</a></h4>

              
                Memory is critical for many cognitive functions, from remembering facts, to learning complex environmental rules. While memory encoding occurs during wake, memory consolidation is associated with sleep-related neural activity. Further, research suggests that individual differences in the alpha frequency band (~ 7 - 13 Hz) modulate memory processes, with higher individual alpha frequency (IAF) associated with greater memory performance. However, the relationship between wake-related EEG individual differences, such as IAF, and sleep-related neural correlates of memory consolidation has been largely unexplored, particularly in a complex rule-based memory context. Here, we aimed to investigate whether IAF and sleep neurophysiology interact to influence rule learning in a sample of 36 healthy adults (16 male; mean age = 25.4, range: 18 - 40). Participants learned rules of a modified miniature language prior to either 8hrs of sleep or wake, after which they were tested on their knowledge of the rules in a grammaticality judgement task. Results indicated that sleep and IAF modulate memory for complex linguistic rules. Phase-amplitude coupling between slow oscillations and spindles during non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep also promoted memory for rules that were analogous to the canonical English word order. As an exploratory analysis, we found that theta activity during rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep predicted rule learning. Taken together, the current study provides behavioural and electrophysiological evidence for a complex role of NREM and REM sleep neurophysiology and IAF in the consolidation of rule-based information.

	<p>Tropomyosin 4 (TPM4) has been reported as an oncogenic gene across different malignancies. However, the role of TPM4 in glioma remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the clinical characterization and prognostic value of TPM4 in gliomas. Transcriptome expression and clinical information were collected from the CGGA and TCGA datasets, which included 998 glioma patients. ScRNA-seq data were obtained from CGGA. R software was utilized for statistical analyses. There was a positive correlation between TPM4 and WHO grades. IDH-wildtype and mesenchymal subtype gliomas were accompanied by TPM4 upregulation. GO and GSEA analysis suggested that TPM4 was profoundly associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Subsequent GSVA revealed a robust correlation between TPM4 and three signaling pathways of EMT (hypoxia, TGF-&amp;amp;beta;, PI3K/AKT). Furthermore, TPM4 showed a synergistic effect with mesenchymal biomarkers, particularly with N-cadherin, Slug, Snail, TWIST1, and vimentin. ScRNA-seq analysis suggested that higher TPM4 was mainly attributed to tumor cells and macrophages and associated with tumor cell progression and macrophage polarization. Finally, high TPM4 was significantly associated with unfavorable outcomes. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TPM4 is significantly correlated with more malignant characteristics of gliomas, potentially through involvement in EMT. TPM4 could predict worse survival for patients with glioma.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons are generated from a ventral midbrain progenitor zone over a time span of several days [embryonic day 10.0 (E10.0) to E14.5 in mouse]. Within this neurogenic period, a progressively changing fate potential of mDA progenitors could contribute to the generation of diverse mDA neuronal subpopulations. To test this idea, we combined inducible genetic fate mapping and intersectional labeling approaches to trace the lineage of cells expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR4. The <I>Cxcr4</I> transcript is expressed in mDA progenitors and precursors, but not in differentiated mDA neurons. <I>Cxcr4</I>-expressing mDA progenitors/precursors labeled at E11.5 develop into a broad range of mDA neurons, whereas labeling of the <I>Cxcr4</I> lineage at later time points (E12.5&ndash;E15.5) results in an increasingly restricted contribution to mDA neurons proceeding from lateral to medial in the substantia nigra and from dorsal to ventral in the ventral tegmental area. In parallel, the innervation of dopaminergic projection targets by mDA neurons derived from <I>Cxcr4</I>-expressing cells is becoming more restricted: the late-generated mDA neurons innervate only the medial&ndash;rostral regions in the dorsal striatum and only the medial shell in the nucleus accumbens. Our results suggest that mDA progenitor cells become increasingly restricted in their cell fate potential over time.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics of Temporal Integration in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Before visual information from the retina reaches primary visual cortex (V1), it is dynamically filtered by the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, the first location within the visual hierarchy at which nonretinal structures can significantly influence visual processing. To explore the form and dynamics of geniculate filtering we used data from monosynpatically connected pairs of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and LGN relay cells in the cat that, under anesthetized conditions, were stimulated with binary white noise and/or drifting sine-wave gratings to train models of increasing complexity to predict which RGC spikes were relayed to cortex, what we call "relay status." In addition, we analyze and compare a smaller dataset recorded in the awake state to assess how anesthesia might influence our results. Consistent with previous work, we find that the preceding retinal interspike interval (ISI) is the primary determinate of relay status with only modest contributions from longer patterns of retinal spikes. Including the prior activity of the LGN cell further improved model predictions, primarily by indicating epochs of geniculate burst activity in recordings made under anesthesia, and by allowing the model to capture gain control-like behavior within the awake LGN. Using the same modeling framework, we further demonstrate that the form of geniculate filtering changes according to the level of activity within the early visual circuit under certain stimulus conditions. This finding suggests a candidate mechanism by which a stimulus specific form of gain control may operate within the LGN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">DLBS3233 reduces inflammatory marker on kidney by increasing expression GLUT1 and GLUT2 in diabetic rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), as a diabetes mellitus type 2 (DMT2) complications, is getting more prevalent nowadays. Inflammation is one of the renal injury mechanisms evaluated through the surge in in TNF-α and NF-κβ expression. Impaired expression of gluten transporter 1 (GLUT1) and GLUT2 reduces glucose uptake. DBLS3233 is a novel anti-diabetes agent and Indonesian herbal product responsible for glucose control and upregulation of insulin signal transduction. We performed an experiment on DLBS3233 to examine the response of TNF-α and NF-κβ and the expression of GLUT 1 and GLUT2. Methods: A total of 30 adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (n=5 per group): nondiabetic rats in the control group (group 1); untreated diabetic rats (group 2); diabetic rats treated with DLBS3233 4,5mg/kgBW (group 3); 9mg/kgBW (group 4); 18mg/kgBW (group 5), and diabetic rats treated with pioglitazone (group 6). Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT2 in the pancreas and expression of TNF-α and NF-κβ in the kidney. The data was then analyzed by ANOVA. Results: In the DBLS3233 group, reduced expression of both TNF-α and NF-κβ was seen through immunohistochemistry, whereas GLUT1 and GLUT2 were intensified compared to untreated groups. From statistical analysis, we obtained significantly lower expression of TNF-α and NF-κβ, as well as enhanced GLUT1 and GLUT2 expression compared to untreated groups (p<0.05). Conclusions: DBLS3233 significantly reduces the inflammatory process and enhances the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT2 diabetic rats.

[version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nanoparticles are globally synthesized for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, catalytic, magnetic, optical, and electronic properties that have put them at the forefront of a wide variety of studies. Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) has received much consideration due to its technological and medicinal applications. In this study, we report on the synthesis process of ZnO nanoparticles using Athrixia phylicoides DC natural extract as a reducing agent.   Methods: Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used to identify the compounds responsible for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles. Structural, morphological and optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles have been characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).   Results: LC-MS results showed that different flavonoids and polyphenols, as well as Coumarin, an aromatic compound, reacted with the precursor to form ZnO nanoparticles. XRD and UV-Vis analysis confirmed the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles, with a spherical shape showed in SEM images. The quasi-spherical ZnO crystals had an average crystallite size of 24 nm. EDS and FTIR analysis confirmed that the powders were pure with no other phase or impurity.   Conclusions: This study successfully demonstrated that the natural plant extract of A. phylicoides DC. can be used in the bio-reduction of zinc nitrate hexahydrate to prepare pure ZnO nanoparticles, thus, extending the use of this plant to an industrial level.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the 5C scale to identify factors associated with COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in Cape Town, South Africa – a protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare workers are at an increased risk of acquiring vaccine-preventable diseases and are known to be reliable sources of information for the patients and their relatives. Knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers about vaccines are thus important determinants of their own vaccination uptake and their intention to recommend vaccinations to their patients. However, culturally adapted tools and studies to address vaccine uptake and hesitancy as well as related behaviors among healthcare workers in the Global South are limited. Methods: We propose a mixed methods project to understand the extent and determinants of vaccination hesitancy among healthcare workers and construct a validated scale to measure this complex and context-specific phenomenon in Cape Town. We will summarize responses as counts and percentages for categorical variables and means with standard deviations (or medians with inter quartile ranges) for continuous variables. We will run the Shapiro-Wilks test to assess the normality. Analysis of the variance, chi-square tests, and equivalents will be conducted as appropriate for group comparisons. Logistic regression models will also be performed to assess association between variables. We will focus on the seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. We will use an existing tool developed and validated in Germany and the United States of America to measure five psychological determinants of vaccination (referred to as the 5C scale), as the basis to develop and validate a scale to measure the scope and determinants of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among healthcare workers in Cape Town. Discussion and conclusion: Through this study, we hope to expand the scientific evidence base on vaccination acceptance and demand among healthcare workers in South Africa and build resources to enable better understanding of, detection, and response to vaccination hesitancy in Cape Town.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Subunit promotion energies for channel opening in heterotetrameric olfactory CNG channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jana Schirmeyer, Thomas Eick, Eckhard Schulz, Sabine Hummert, Christian Sattler, Ralf Schmauder, Klaus Benndorf</p>

Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels of olfactory sensory neurons contain three types of homologue subunits, two CNGA2 subunits, one CNGA4 subunit and one CNGB1b subunit. Each subunit carries an intracellular cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) whose occupation by up to four cyclic nucleotides evokes channel activation. Thereby, the subunits interact in a cooperative fashion. Here we studied 16 concatamers with systematically disabled, but still functional, binding sites and quantified channel activation by systems of intimately coupled state models transferred to 4D hypercubes, thereby exploiting a weak voltage dependence of the channels. We provide the complete landscape of free energies for the complex activation process of heterotetrameric channels, including 32 binding steps, in both the closed and open channel, as well as 16 closed-open isomerizations. The binding steps are specific for the subunits and show pronounced positive cooperativity for the binding of the second and the third ligand. The energetics of the closed-open isomerizations were disassembled to elementary subunit promotion energies for channel opening, ΔΔGfpn, adding to the free energy of the closed-open isomerization of the empty channel, <i>E</i><sub>0</sub>. The ΔΔGfpn values are specific for the four subunits and presumably invariant for the specific patterns of liganding. In conclusion, subunit cooperativity is confined to the CNBD whereas the subunit promotion energies for channel opening are independent.

We propose a novel, non-discriminatory classification of monkeypox virus. Together with the World Health Organization, we named three clades (I, IIa and IIb) in order of detection. Within IIb, the cause the current global outbreak, we identified multiple lineages (A.1, A.2, A.1.1 and B.1) to support real-time genomics surveillance.

The current nomenclature for monkeypox virus is stigmatising and misleading. This Perspective article proposes a practical and neutral system of nomenclature that will allow efficient communication without the risk of further misconceptions, discrimination and stigmatisation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Individuality and ethnicity eclipse a short-term dietary intervention in shaping microbiomes and viromes</a></h4>

Many diseases linked with ethnic health disparities associate with changes in microbial communities in the United States, but the causes and persistence of ethnicity-associated microbiome variation are not understood. For instance, microbiome studies that strictly control for diet across ethnically diverse populations are lacking. Here, we performed multiomic profiling over a 9-day period that included a 4-day controlled vegetarian diet intervention in a defined geographic location across 36 healthy Black and White females of similar age, weight, habitual diets, and health status. We demonstrate that individuality and ethnicity account for roughly 70% to 88% and 2% to 10% of taxonomic variation, respectively, eclipsing the effects a short-term diet intervention in shaping gut and oral microbiomes and gut viromes. Persistent variation between ethnicities occurs for microbial and viral taxa and various metagenomic functions, including several gut KEGG orthologs, oral carbohydrate active enzyme categories, cluster of orthologous groups of proteins, and antibiotic-resistant gene categories. In contrast to the gut and oral microbiome data, the urine and plasma metabolites tend to decouple from ethnicity and more strongly associate with diet. These longitudinal, multiomic profiles paired with a dietary intervention illuminate previously unrecognized associations of ethnicity with metagenomic and viromic features across body sites and cohorts within a single geographic location, highlighting the importance of accounting for human microbiome variation in research, health determinants, and eventual therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sleep loss leads to the withdrawal of human helping across individuals, groups, and large-scale societies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eti Ben Simon, Raphael Vallat, Aubrey Rossi, Matthew P. Walker</p>

Humans help each other. This fundamental feature of homo sapiens has been one of the most powerful forces sculpting the advent of modern civilizations. But what determines whether humans choose to help one another? Across 3 replicating studies, here, we demonstrate that sleep loss represents one previously unrecognized factor dictating whether humans choose to help each other, observed at 3 different scales (within individuals, across individuals, and across societies). First, at an individual level, 1 night of sleep loss triggers the withdrawal of help from one individual to another. Moreover, fMRI findings revealed that the withdrawal of human helping is associated with deactivation of key nodes within the social cognition brain network that facilitates prosociality. Second, at a group level, ecological night-to-night reductions in sleep across several nights predict corresponding next-day reductions in the choice to help others during day-to-day interactions. Third, at a large-scale national level, we demonstrate that 1 h of lost sleep opportunity, inflicted by the transition to Daylight Saving Time, reduces real-world altruistic helping through the act of donation giving, established through the analysis of over 3 million charitable donations. Therefore, inadequate sleep represents a significant influential force determining whether humans choose to help one another, observable across micro- and macroscopic levels of civilized interaction. The implications of this effect may be non-trivial when considering the essentiality of human helping in the maintenance of cooperative, civil society, combined with the reported decline in sufficient sleep in many first-world nations.

                Background. Certain conditions can stimulate stem cells to produce secretory factors that differ from each condition, such as hypoxia. Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells have been known to have higher proliferation rates, plasticity, and better self-improvement ability than MSCs from other sources.  The objective was to analyze the secreting proteins in the Conditioned Medium - Umbilical cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (CM-UCMSCs) which potentially has a role in the chondrogenesis of cartilage defect.  Methods. We used SDS PAGE combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using mass spectrometer to perform a proteomic analysis of CM-UCMSCs which conditioned in a state of fasting (without serum albumin). Then, we continue to analyze to identify proteins of interest using Mascot sequence matching software. Then Analyzed using in silico / molecular docking to know the interaction of each protein with the cartilage repair factor.  Results. SDS PAGE performed on all secreted products in CM-UCMSCs. We found one dominant band, then we used Mass Spectrometry continued Mascot sequencing protein that band, conclude that the protein was a D4A9T1/ RNF-111/ Arkadia Protein. And then using in silico/ molecular docking method analyzed that Arkadia Protein worked synergistically with TGF-β1 Protein through activation of TGF-β1 receptors to induce the chondrogenesis.  Conclusions. Our results show that the fasting state on CM-UCMSCs promoted secreted Arkadia protein. From in silico model prediction, this protein suspects to have an important role in the process of repairing cartilage defects. However, further research is needed before feasible and safe for the clinical application of CM-UCMSCs in cartilage repair.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A systematic literature review on cybercrime legislation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cybercrime is a fast-growing digital crime and legislation falling behind with the fast-moving advancement of technology. One important factor projected by literature in combating cybercrime is legislation. In order to combat cybercrime, the role of cybercrime legislation is a challenge that has not been clearly studied before. This paper thus aims to recapitulate the literature on cybercrime legislation in combating cybercrime. The literature in this context emphasises on existing studies relating to cybercrime legislation and addressing the importance of adequate and efficient responses in place in order to combat cybercrime efficiently. Methods: This paper finds an extensive literature review using the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” method based on legislation to combat cybercrime and explains a systematic analysis of the legislation in most advanced countries in both technology and legal framework. The study was done by selecting keywords, validated by the experts to discover research trends of cybercrime legislation. A search was then run across seven academic databases, including the ACM Digital Library, Emerald, Hein Online, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Westlaw Asia. Initially, five hundred and forty-eight articles were retrieved and out of which seventy-two studies met the inclusion criteria and were fully reviewed. Results: The findings of the study revealed that comprehensive cybercrime legislation plays a vital role in combating cybercrime and cybercrime legislation should be strengthened, enhanced, and made up to date with the rapid advancement of technology in order to address the rising number of cybercrime. Discussion: This systematic review is timely and highlights future research directions to improve a comprehensive legal framework to combat the rising of cybercrime effectively. To fill the research gap, the findings also have fundamental practical implications for the policy makers, in enacting an up to date cybercrime legislation by highlighting the role of legislation in combating cybercrime.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of medication-related burden among a sample of Iraqi patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and its relationship with disease activity: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with high morbidity and disability. The routines involved in taking medications, side effects, the nature of medicines, difficulties with the healthcare system, and disruptions to social activities all contribute to patients frequently experiencing medication-related burdens (MRB). The current study aimed to assess the perceived MRB among a sample of SLE patients from Iraq and to look for any possible relationship between MRB and disease activity. Methods: The current study was cross-sectional on diagnosed SLE patients who arrived at Baghdad Teaching Hospital/Medical City/Rheumatology department from September 2021 to January 2022. MRB was measured using the Living with Medicines Questionnaire (LMQ). Results: The study recruited 156 SLE patients. The patients were 35.8 ±11.7 years old on average. Great majority of them were women (96.8 %). The average LMQ score was 117.30± 18.37. The results showed that most patients (69.87%) experienced a moderate level of burden, followed by a low level (19.87%), high level (7.69%), and no burden at all (2.56%). No patients experienced an extremely high level of burden (0.0%). The mean burden scores for two LMQ domains—relationships with health care professionals (HCPs) and effectiveness of prescription medications—were the lowest (below average). Conclusions: Many of the SLE patients in this study reported experiencing MRB. Healthcare professionals should implement strategies to reduce this burden, particularly for low-income patients.

                We recognize each other by relying on our face uniqueness. However, there are humans with uncanny resemblance. Joshi et al. reported that look-alike pairs identified by facial recognition algorithms share genotypes but not DNA methylomes and microbiomes. The identified SNPs also provide a readout of other anthropomorphic and behavioral characteristics.

                Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) basket cells are prominent but elusive cortical interneurons, inhibiting the soma of principal neurons. Koukouli et al. show that CB1+ interneurons exhibit specific connectivity properties in distinct visual cortical areas and differently control the activity and coordination of primary (V1) and associative (V2M) visual areas.

                Valero et al. examine the influence of inhibition on place fields. They show that hippocampal neurons are dominated by inhibitory conductances during theta oscillations. A transient increase of excitation and drop of inhibition mediates place field emergence in simulations. Consistently, chemogenetic activation of interneurons deteriorates place cell properties in vivo.

Cingulate astrocytes demonstrate decreased calcium signaling, while neurons are hyperactive. Restoring the regulatory activity of astrocytes recovers neuronal hyperactivity, cingulate connectivity, and behavior deficits, suggesting that astrocytes represent a major player in early Alzheimer’s disease.

                Mukherjee et al. show that during WNT-induced differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells, SOX transcription factors can recruit β-catenin to lineage-specific enhancers independent of TCFs, the commonly accepted β-catenin binding partner. This helps explain how WNT signaling can regulate different transcriptional programs in different biological contexts.

                Chromatin accessibility in yeast is regulated by nucleosome-displacing-factors (NDFs) and chromatin remodelers (CRs). Chen et al. show that NDFs first invade into nucleosomes and then recruit CRs to modulate the NDR length. NDF-specific and NDR length-dependent recruitment of CRs allow partitioned usage of CRs by NDFs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternation emerges as a multi-modal strategy for turbulent odor navigation</a></h4>

              
                Foraging mammals exhibit a familiar yet poorly characterized phenomenon, 'alternation', a pause to sniff in the air preceded by the animal rearing on its hind legs or raising its head. Rodents spontaneously alternate in the presence of airflow, suggesting that alternation serves an important role during plume-tracking. To test this hypothesis, we combine fully-resolved simulations of turbulent odor transport and Bellman optimization methods for decision-making under partial observability. We show that an agent trained to minimize search time in a realistic odor plume exhibits extensive alternation together with the characteristic cast-and-surge behavior observed in insects. Alternation is linked with casting and occurs more frequently far downwind of the source, where the likelihood of detecting airborne cues is higher relative to ground cues. Casting and alternation emerge as complementary tools for effective exploration with sparse cues. A model based on marginal value theory captures the interplay between casting, surging and alternation.

                Complex mechanisms regulate gene dosage throughout eukaryotic life cycles. Mechanisms controlling gene dosage have been extensively studied in animals, however it is unknown how generalizable these mechanisms are to diverse eukaryotes. Here, we use the haploid plant <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> to assess gene dosage control in its short-lived diploid embryo. We show that throughout embryogenesis, paternal chromosomes are repressed resulting in functional haploidy. The paternal genome is targeted for genomic imprinting by the Polycomb mark H3K27me3 starting at fertilization, rendering the maternal genome in control of embryogenesis. Maintaining haploid gene dosage by this new form of imprinting is essential for embryonic development. Our findings illustrate how haploid-dominant species can regulate gene dosage through paternal chromosome inactivation and initiates the exploration of the link between life cycle history and gene dosage in a broader range of organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">BehaviorDEPOT is a simple, flexible tool for automated behavioral detection based on markerless pose tracking</a></h4>

              
                Quantitative descriptions of animal behavior are essential to study the neural substrates of cognitive and emotional processes. Analyses of naturalistic behaviors are often performed by hand or with expensive, inflexible commercial software. Recently, machine learning methods for markerless pose estimation enabled automated tracking of freely moving animals, including in labs with limited coding expertise. However, classifying specific behaviors based on pose data requires additional computational analyses and remains a significant challenge for many groups. We developed BehaviorDEPOT (DEcoding behavior based on POsitional Tracking), a simple, flexible software program that can detect behavior from video timeseries and can analyze the results of experimental assays. BehaviorDEPOT calculates kinematic and postural statistics from keypoint tracking data and creates heuristics that reliably detect behaviors. It requires no programming experience and is applicable to a wide range of behaviors and experimental designs. We provide several hard-coded heuristics. Our freezing detection heuristic achieves above 90% accuracy in videos of mice and rats, including those wearing tethered head-mounts. BehaviorDEPOT also helps researchers develop their own heuristics and incorporate them into the software’s graphical interface. Behavioral data is stored framewise for easy alignment with neural data. We demonstrate the immediate utility and flexibility of BehaviorDEPOT using popular assays including fear conditioning, decision-making in a T-maze, open field, elevated plus maze, and novel object exploration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Satellite glia modulate sympathetic neuron survival, activity, and autonomic function</a></h4>

              
                Satellite glia are the major glial cells in sympathetic ganglia, enveloping neuronal cell bodies. Despite this intimate association, the extent to which sympathetic functions are influenced by satellite glia <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear. Here, we show that satellite glia are critical for metabolism, survival, and activity of sympathetic neurons and modulate autonomic behaviors in mice. Adult ablation of satellite glia results in impaired mTOR signaling, soma atrophy, reduced noradrenergic enzymes, and loss of sympathetic neurons. However, persisting neurons have elevated activity, and satellite glia-ablated mice show increased pupil dilation and heart rate, indicative of enhanced sympathetic tone. Satellite glia-specific deletion of Kir4.1, an inward-rectifying potassium channel, largely recapitulates the cellular defects observed in glia-ablated mice, suggesting that satellite glia act in part via K<sup>+</sup>-dependent mechanisms. These findings highlight neuron-satellite glia as functional units in regulating sympathetic output, with implications for disorders linked to sympathetic hyper-activity such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">β-cell deletion of the PKm1 and PKm2 isoforms of pyruvate kinase in mice reveal their essential role as nutrient sensors for the KATP channel</a></h4>

              
                Pyruvate kinase (PK) and the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle play key roles in nutrient-stimulated K<sub>ATP</sub> channel closure and insulin secretion. To identify the PK isoforms involved, we generated mice lacking β-cell PKm1, PKm2, and mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase (PCK2) that generates mitochondrial PEP. Glucose metabolism generates both glycolytic and mitochondrially-derived PEP, which triggers K<sub>ATP</sub> closure through local PKm1 and PKm2 signaling at the plasma membrane. Amino acids, which generate mitochondrial PEP without producing glycolytic fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to allosterically activate PKm2, signal through PKm1 to raise ATP/ADP, close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and stimulate insulin secretion. Raising cytosolic ATP/ADP with amino acids is insufficient to close K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in the absence of PK activity or PCK2, indicating that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are primarily regulated by PEP that provides ATP via plasma membrane-associated PK, rather than mitochondrially-derived ATP. Following membrane depolarization, the PEP cycle is also involved in an 'off-switch' that facilitates K<sub>ATP</sub> channel reopening and Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion, as shown by PK activation experiments and β-cell PCK2 deletion, which prolongs Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and increases insulin secretion. In conclusion, the differential response of PKm1 and PKm2 to the glycolytic and mitochondrial sources of PEP influences the β-cell nutrient response, and controls the oscillatory cycle regulating insulin secretion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of putative enhancer-like elements predicts regulatory networks active in planarian adult stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Planarians have become an established model system to study regeneration and stem cells, but the regulatory elements in the genome remain almost entirely undescribed. Here, by integrating epigenetic and expression data we use multiple sources of evidence to predict enhancer elements active in the adult stem cell populations that drive regeneration. We have used ChIP-seq data to identify regions with histone modifications consistent with enhancer identity and activity, and ATAC-seq data to identify accessible chromatin. Overlapping these signals allowed for the identification of a set of high confidence candidate enhancers predicted to be active in planarian adult stem cells. These enhancers are enriched for predicted transcription factor (TF) binding sites for TFs and TF families expressed in planarian adult stem cells. Foot-printing analyses provided further evidence that these potential TF binding sites are potentially occupied in adult stem cells. We integrated these analyses to build testable hypotheses for the regulatory function of transcription factors in stem cells, both with respect to how pluripotency might be regulated, and to how lineage differentiation programs are controlled. We found that our predicted GRNs were independently supported by existing TF RNAi/RNA-seq data sets, providing further evidence that our work predicts active enhancers regulating adult stem cells and regenerative mechanisms.

                Finding the conditions to stabilize a macromolecular target for imaging remains the most critical barrier to determining its structure by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). While automation has significantly increased the speed of data collection, specimens are still screened manually, a laborious and subjective task that often determines the success of a project. Here, we present SmartScope, the first framework to streamline, standardize, and automate specimen evaluation in cryo-EM. SmartScope employs deep-learning-based object detection to identify and classify features suitable for imaging, allowing it to perform thorough specimen screening in a fully automated manner. A web interface provides remote control over the automated operation of the microscope in real time and access to images and annotation tools. Manual annotations can be used to re-train the feature recognition models, leading to improvements in performance. Our automated tool for systematic evaluation of specimens streamlines structure determination and lowers the barrier of adoption for cryo-EM.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Species-specific chromatin landscape determines how transposable elements shape genome evolution</a></h4>

              
                Transposable elements (TEs) are selfish genetic parasites that increase their copy number at the expense of host fitness. The ‘success’, or genome-wide abundance, of TEs differs widely between species. Deciphering the causes for this large variety in TE abundance has remained a central question in evolutionary genomics. We previously proposed that species-specific TE abundance could be driven by the inadvertent consequences of host-direct epigenetic silencing of TEs—the spreading of repressive epigenetic marks from silenced TEs into adjacent sequences. Here, we compared this TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks, or ‘the epigenetic effect of TEs’, in six species in the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> subgroup to dissect step-by-step the role of such effect in determining genomic TE abundance. We found that TE-mediated local enrichment of repressive marks is prevalent and substantially varies across and even within species. While this TE-mediated effect alters the epigenetic states of adjacent genes, we surprisingly discovered that the transcription of neighboring genes could reciprocally impact this spreading. Importantly, our multi-species analysis provides the power and appropriate phylogenetic resolution to connect species-specific host chromatin regulation, TE-mediated epigenetic effects, the strength of natural selection against TEs, and genomic TE abundance unique to individual species. Our findings point toward the importance of host chromatin landscapes in shaping genome evolution through the epigenetic effects of a selfish genetic parasite.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Infrared videography of a subcutaneous knee tattoo as a simple and inexpensive method to overcome skin motion artifact in rodent kinematics</a></h4>

              
                Kinematic analyses of rodent behavior are frequently used in neuroscience research, and commonly in spinal cord injury (SCI) studies. Unfortunately, skin motion artifact introduces significant errors into these data, because the skin is only loosely coupled to the underlying skeleton by connective tissue. In rats, these errors can be as large as 50-75%, as quantified by past work using x-ray fluoroscopy. Here we show that infrared videography of a subcutaneous tattoo can overcome skin motion artifact in rodent kinematics. The method yields data similar to gold standard x-ray fluoroscopy systems at a fraction of the cost, does not affect the animals' locomotion, and results in markers that persist for at least 10 weeks. We found that, compared to a gold-standard x-ray fluoroscopy study that directly tracked the skeleton, our method reduced the error in mean hip angle from 17 {+/-} 6.0 to 3.1 {+/-} 2.4 degrees (mean {+/-} SEM), and the root-mean-square (RMS) error across the mean hip angle waveform from 20 to 5.3 degrees (n=4 rats). The knee joint angle waveform derived from infra-red imaging tightly matched the shape of the x-ray waveform after allowing for a constant offset, having RMS error reduced from 8.1 to 1.2 degrees. The method stands to significantly reduce between-animal errors, and hence between laboratory errors, in these ubiquitous model systems, especially important in SCI studies where individuals are assigned to different treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A layered, hybrid machine learning analytic workflow for mouse risk assessment behavior</a></h4>

              
                Accurate and efficient quantification of animal behavior facilitates the understanding of the brain. An emerging approach within machine learning (ML) field is to combine multiple ML-based algorithms to quantify animal behavior. These so-called hybrid models have emerged because of limitations associated with supervised (e.g., random forest, RF) and unsupervised (e.g., hidden Markov model, HMM) ML classifiers. For example, RF models lack temporal information across video frames, and HMM latent states are often difficult to interpret. We sought to develop a hybrid model, and did so in the context of a study of mouse risk assessment behavior. We utilized DeepLabCut to estimate the positions of mouse body parts. Positional features were calculated using DeepLabCut outputs and were used to train RF and HMM models with equal number of states, separately. The per-frame predictions from RF and HMM models were then passed to a second HMM model layer ("reHMM"). The outputs of the reHMM layer showed improved interpretability over the initial HMM output. Finally, we combined predictions from RF and HMM models with selected positional features to train a third HMM model ("reHMM+"). This reHMM+ layered hybrid model unveiled distinctive temporal and human-interpretable behavioral patterns. We applied this workflow to investigate risk assessment to trimethylthiazoline and snake feces odor, finding unique behavioral patterns to each that were separable from attractive and neutral stimuli. We conclude that this layered, hybrid machine learning workflow represents a balanced approach for improving the depth and reliability of ML classifiers in chemosensory and other behavioral contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of a cardiac glycoside exhibiting favorable brain bioavailability and potency for reducing levels of the cellular prion protein</a></h4>

              
                Several strands of investigation have established that a reduction in the levels of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a promising avenue for the treatment of prion diseases. We recently described an indirect approach for reducing PrPC levels that targets Na,K-ATPases (NKAs) with cardiac glycosides (CGs), causing cells to respond with the degradation of these pumps and nearby molecules, including PrPC. Because the therapeutic window of widely used CGs is narrow and their brain bioavailability is low, we set out to identify a CG with improved pharmacological properties for this indication. Starting with the CG known as oleandrin, we combined in silico modeling of CG binding poses within human NKA folds, CG structure-activity relationship (SAR) data, and predicted blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrance scores to identify CG derivatives with improved characteristics. Focusing on C4'-dehydro-oleandrin as a chemically accessible shortlisted CG derivative, we show that it reaches four times higher levels in the brain than in the heart one day after subcutaneous administration, exhibits promising pharmacological properties, and suppresses steady-state PrPC levels by 84% in immortalized human cells that have been differentiated to acquire neural or astrocytic characteristics. Finally, we validate that the mechanism of action of this approach for reducing cell surface PrPC levels requires C4'-dehydro-oleandrin to engage with its cognate binding pocket within the NKA  subunit. The improved brain bioavailability of C4'-dehydro-oleandrin, combined with its relatively low toxicity, make this compound an attractive lead for brain CG indications and recommends its further exploration for the treatment of prion diseases.

                Life expectancy has steadily increased for over a century; we thus live longer and are more likely to experience cognitive difficulties such as increased distractibility which can hamper autonomy. This cross-sectional behavioral study aimed to characterize the decline of the cognitive components of distractibility during typical aging, and the onset of this decline. 191 participants from 21 to 86 years old, distributed within seven age groups, were tested using the Competitive Attention Test. Results indicate that cognitive components contributing to distractibility follow different trajectories with aging: voluntary orienting remains stable from 21 to 86 years old, sustained attention decreases while distraction increases between 26 and 86 years old, finally, impulsivity is lower in older compared to younger adults. Increased distractibility in older adults thus seems to result from a dominance of involuntary over voluntary attention processes, whose detrimental effect on performance is partly compensated by enhanced recruitment of motor control.

                Periodic features of neural time series data, such as local field potentials (LFP), are often quantified using power spectra. While the aperiodic exponent of spectra is typically disregarded, it is nevertheless modulated in a physiologically-relevant manner and was recently hypothesised to reflect excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in neuronal populations. Here, we used a cross-species in vivo electrophysiological approach to test the E/I hypothesis in the context of experimental and idiopathic Parkinsonism. We demonstrate in dopamine-depleted rats that aperiodic exponents and power at 30-100 Hz in subthalamic nucleus (STN) LFPs reflect defined changes in basal ganglia network activity; higher aperiodic exponents tally with lower levels of STN neuron firing and a balance tipped towards inhibition. Using STN-LFPs recorded from awake Parkinson's patients, we show that higher exponents accompany dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS) of STN, consistent with untreated Parkinson's manifesting as reduced inhibition and hyperactivity of STN. These results suggest that the aperiodic exponent of STN-LFPs in Parkinsonism reflects E/I balance, and might be a candidate biomarker for adaptive DBS.

                Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in a disruption of information between the brain and the spinal locomotor circuit. Although the spinal cord contains all the neural circuits to generate locomotion, people with SCI are unable to walk due to the absence of descending commands from the brain. Electrical stimulation of supraspinal locomotor centers, such as the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR), can promote locomotor recovery in acute and chronic SCI rodent models. Although clinical trials are currently underway in SCI patients, there is still debate about the organization of this supraspinal locomotor center and which anatomical correlate of the MLR should be targeted to promote functional recovery. Combining kinematics, electromyographic recordings, anatomical analysis, and mouse genetics, our study reveals that glutamatergic neurons of the cuneiform nucleus contribute to locomotor recovery by enhancing motor efficacy in flexor and extensor hindlimb muscles, and by increasing locomotor rhythm and speed on a treadmill, over ground, and during swimming in mice with chronic SCI. In contrast, glutamatergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus slow down locomotion. Therefore, our study identifies the cuneiform nucleus and its glutamatergic neurons as a therapeutical target to improve locomotor recovery in patients living with SCI.

                An early symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an impaired sense of smell, for which the molecular basis remains elusive. Here, we generated human olfactory neurosphere-derived (ONS) cells from people with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and performed global RNA sequencing to determine gene expression changes. ONS cells expressed markers of neuroglial differentiation, providing a unique cellular model to explore early AD-associated disease pathways. Our transcriptomics data from ONS cells revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cognitive processes in AD cells compared to MCI, or matched healthy controls (HC). A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 6 (AKAP6) was the most significantly altered gene in AD compared to both MCI and HC, and has been linked to cognitive function. The greatest change in gene expression of all DEGs occurred between AD and MCI. Gene pathway analysis revealed defects in multiple cellular processes with aging, intellectual deficiency and alternative splicing being the most significantly dysregulated in AD ONS cells. Our results demonstrate that ONS cells can provide a cellular model for AD that recapitulates disease-associated differences. We have revealed potential novel genes, including AKAP6 that may have a role in AD, particularly MCI to AD transition, and should be further examined.

                Attention reorienting is a critical cognitive function which drives how we respond to novel and unexpected stimuli. In recent years, arousal has been linked to attention reorienting. The timing and spatial organization of the interactions between the arousal and reorienting systems, however, remain only partially revealed. Here, we investigate the dynamics between the two systems through simultaneous recordings of pupillometry, EEG, and fMRI of healthy human subjects while they performed an auditory target detection task. We used pupil diameter and activity in the noradrenergic locus coeruleus to infer arousal, and found these measures linked to distinct cortical activity at various temporal stages of the reorienting response. Specifically, our results provide the first demonstration in humans of how phasic pupil-linked arousal relates to the reduction of response inhibition, an inference which otherwise would remain hidden without the help of simultaneous multi-modal acquisitions.

                Although it is widely accepted that data quality for event-related potential (ERP) components varies considerably across studies and across participants within a study, ERP data quality has not received much systematic analysis. The present study used a recently developed metric of ERP data quality-the standardized measurement error (SME)-to examine how data quality varies across different ERP paradigms, across individual participants, and across different procedures for quantifying amplitude and latency values. The EEG recordings were taken from the ERP CORE, which includes data from 40 neurotypical college students for seven widely studied ERP components: P3b, N170, mismatch negativity, N400, error-related negativity, N2pc, and lateralized readiness potential. Large differences in data quality were observed across the different ERP components, and very large differences in data quality were observed across participants. Data quality also varied depending on the algorithm used to quantify the amplitude and especially the latency of a given ERP component. These results provide an initial set of benchmark values that can be used for comparison with previous and future ERP studies. They also provide useful information for predicting effect sizes and statistical power in future studies, even with different numbers of trials. More broadly, this study provides a general approach that could be used to determine which specific experimental designs, data collection procedures, and data processing algorithms lead to the best data quality.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of Aging on Cortical Representations of Continuous Speech</a></h4>

              
                Understanding speech in a noisy environment is crucial in day-to-day interactions, and yet becomes more challenging with age, even for healthy aging. Age-related changes in the neural mechanisms that enable speech-in-noise listening have been investigated previously; however, the extent to which age affects the timing and fidelity of encoding of target and interfering speech streams are not well understood. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we investigated how continuous speech is represented in auditory cortex in the presence of interfering speech, in younger and older adults. Cortical representations were obtained from neural responses that time-locked to the speech envelopes using speech envelope reconstruction and temporal response functions (TRFs). TRFs showed three prominent peaks corresponding to auditory cortical processing stages: early (~50 ms), middle (~100 ms) and late (~200 ms). Older adults showed exaggerated speech envelope representations compared to younger adults. Temporal analysis revealed both that the age-related exaggeration starts as early as ~50 ms, and that older adults needed a substantially longer integration time window to achieve their better reconstruction of the speech envelope. As expected, with increased speech masking, envelope reconstruction for the attended talker decreased and all three TRF peaks were delayed, with aging contributing additionally to the reduction. Interestingly, for older adults the late peak was delayed, suggesting that this late peak may receive contributions from multiple sources. Together these results suggest that there are several mechanisms at play compensating for age-related temporal processing deficits at several stages, but which are not able to fully reestablish unimpaired speech perception.

                Using functional resonance imaging (fMRI), we studied the relationship between perceptual organization and network topology within the primary visual cortex (V1). Twenty-six humans (male and female) were recorded during active observation of two Global and Local Navon letters. Correlations between fMRI fluctuations from different V1 sites were measured (after removing stimulus-evoked signals) in windows specific to each condition. Intra-V1, like brain-wide networks, presented an overall decrease of correlations during stimulation compared to baseline but with increased statistical dimensionality. Massive edgewise testing and network based-statistics (both corrected by FDR) identified differences in connection strengths between stimuli that were mapped to the visual field. Global letters elicited long links mainly connecting V1 sites mapping the lower left/right visual quadrants. Shorter links were associated with local letters, primarily mapped within the lower-left visual quadrant. These connections were not observed in the time-locked (feedforward) responses shared across participants, and their lengths exceeded V1 population receptive field sizes. Thus, these networks reflect activity idiosyncratic to each participant, possibly generated by interactions within or feedback to V1. Perception would sculpt V1 connectivity, with specific increases in link strengths (in a background of decreases). These findings could help shed light on V1 as a "cognitive blackboard".

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TAOK2β represses translation via phosphorylation of eEF2 and ameliorates exaggerated protein synthesis in a mouse model of 16p11.2 microdeletion-driven autism</a></h4>

              
                Microdeletions in the 16p11.2 region of the human genome are frequently associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), but how these genomic rearrangements cause ASD remains unclear. Here, we reveal that TAOK2{beta}, a protein isoform encoded by the human TAOK2 gene located in the 16p11.2 locus, regulates mRNA translation. To identify key functional interaction partners of TAOK2{beta}, we performed proteomic screening from Neuro-2a (N2a) cells, mouse cortices, and cultured neurons. This revealed translation factors to be a major class of enriched interacting proteins. Consistently, TAOK2{beta} is present in mouse cortical polyribosomes and cortices from Taok2 knockout mice show increased ribosome density on mRNAs and enhanced protein synthesis. Several lines of evidence support an effect of TAOK2{beta} on translation elongation via phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF2). TAOK2 can directly phosphorylate eEF2 on Threonine 56 and this phosphorylation is reduced in cortices from Taok2 knockout mice. TAOK2{beta} WT overexpression increased eEF2 phosphorylation levels and reduced protein synthesis, whereas a kinase-dead allele of TAOK2{beta} showed opposite effects. Finally, we show that cortices derived from the mouse model of the human 16p11.2 microdeletion have increased polysome/monosome (P/M) ratios and protein synthesis, phenocopying Taok2 loss of function. Importantly, defective translation phenotypes observed in the mouse 16p11.2 microdeletion model of ASD could be normalized either by reintroducing Taok2 in vivo or by delivering TAOK2{beta} to cultured cortical neurons derived from the 16p11.2 microdeletion mice. Our results uncover a critical role of TAOK2{beta} as a regulator of protein synthesis and support the idea that translational control is a common endpoint of ASD-associated signaling pathways.

                Dopamine-modified hyaluronic acid (DA-HA) has been initially developed as an efficient coating and adhesion material for industrial uses. However, the biological activity and safety of DA-HA in the brain have not been explored yet. Here, we report a series of evidence that DA-HA exhibits similar functionality as dopamine (DA), but with much lower toxicity arising from autoxidation. DA-HA shows very little autoxidation even after 48-hour incubation. This is profoundly different from DA and its derivatives including L-DOPA, which all induce severe neuronal death after pre-autoxidation, indicating that autoxidation is the cause of neuronal death. Furthermore, in vivo injection of DA-HA induces significantly lower toxicity compared to 6-OHDA, a well-known oxidized and toxic form of DA, and alleviates the apomorphine-induced rotational behavior in the 6-OHDA animal model of Parkinson's disease. Our study proposes that DA-HA with DA-like functionalities and minimal toxicity can be an effective therapeutic substitute for L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease.

	<p>Background: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the sensory thalamus has been proposed for 40 years to treat medically refractory neuropathic pain, but its efficacy remains partial and unpredictable. Recent pilot studies of DBS targeting the ACC, a brain region involved in the integration of the affective, emotional, and cognitive aspects of pain, may improve patients suffering from refractory chronic pain. ACC-DBS could be complementary to thalamic DBS to treat both the sensory-discriminative and the affective components of chronic pain, but the safety of combined DBS, especially on cognition and affects, has not been studied. Methods: We propose a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and bicentric study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bilateral ACC-DBS combined with unilateral thalamic DBS in adult patients suffering from chronic unilateral neuropathic pain, refractory to medical treatment. After a study period of six months, there is a cross-over randomized phase to compare the efficacy (evaluated by pain intensity and quality of life) and safety (evaluated by repeated neurological examination, psychiatric assessment, cognitive assessment, and assessment of affective functions) of combined ACC-thalamic DBS and thalamic DBS only, respectively. Discussion: The EMOPAIN study will show if ACC-DBS is a safe and effective therapy for patients suffering from chronic unilateral neuropathic pain, refractory to medical treatment. The design of the study will, for the first time, assess the efficacy of ACC-DBS combined with thalamic DBS in a blinded way.</p>

	<p>Endogenous host-derived molecules named damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can induce excessive non-sterile inflammatory responses on recognition of specific membrane-tethered receptors. Here in this study, we aimed to explore the role of DAMP molecule HMGB1 in astrocyte-mediated sterile neuroinflammation and the resultant influences on neurons. In vitro cultured astrocytes were challenged with rHMGB1 and then harvested at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h, respectively. The astrocytic CD24 expression was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B) binding activity was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and the proinflammatory factors, tumor necrosis factor-&amp;amp;alpha; (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), and interleukin 1&amp;amp;beta; (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;), were measured by qPCR. The neuronal morphology was assessed with phase-contrast microscopy. The results showed that astrocytic mRNA and protein CD24 expression began to rise at 24 h, peaked at 36 h, and remained elevated at 48 h after rHMGB1 stimulation, accompanied with enhanced NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B binding activity and augmented expression of TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; and IL-1&amp;amp;beta;. Furthermore, rHMGB1 caused cocultured neuron damage and was aggregated upon CD24 knockdown. Taken together, these novel findings suggested that rHMGB1 could promote astrocytic CD24 expression, the inhibition of which could aggregate neuronal damage.</p>

	<p>Objective: Attachment and rumination were examined as the intermediary variables on post-traumatic stress disorder and medication compliance in stroke or TIA patients. Methods: A total of 300 participants with stroke or TIA from the Second Hospital of Hebei Province were selected. Patients accomplished NIHSS, ABCD2, ECR, RSQ, and RRS on admission. After 3 months, the PCL-C and MMAS were collected. Results: In the stroke or TIA patients, the incident of PTSD was 7.7%; PTSD scores were significantly associated with attachment anxiety (r = 0.225, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), symptom rumination (r = 0.197, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), and obsessive thinking (r = 0.187, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). After the Sobel test analysis and verification by the Baron and Kenny&amp;amp;rsquo;s stepwise approach we found that ruminant mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and PTSD; obsessive thinking mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and PTSD. Conclusions: The relationship between attachment anxiety and PTSD was positively predicted by rumination and obsessive thinking. Adult attachment style, rumination, and PTSD scores may not predict medication compliance.</p>

	<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a chronic debilitating condition resulting in behavioral and intellectual impairments and is considered the most prevalent form of preventable mental retardation in the industrialized world. We previously reported that 2-year-old offspring of vervet monkey (Chlorocebus sabeus) dams drinking, on average, 2.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.49 g ethanol per Kg maternal body weight 4 days per week during the last third of pregnancy had significantly lower numbers of CA1 (&amp;amp;minus;51.6%), CA2 (&amp;amp;minus;51.2%) and CA3 (&amp;amp;minus;42.8%) hippocampal neurons, as compared to age-matched sucrose controls. Fetal alcohol-exposed (FAE) offspring also showed significantly lower volumes for these structures at 2 years of age. In the present study, we examined these same parameters in 12 FAE offspring with a similar average but a larger range of ethanol exposures (1.01&amp;amp;ndash;2.98 g/Kg/day; total ethanol exposure 24&amp;amp;ndash;158 g/Kg). Design-based stereology was performed on cresyl violet-stained and doublecortin (DCX)-immunostained sections of the hippocampus. We report here significant neuronal deficits in the hippocampus with a significant negative correlation between daily dose and neuronal population in CA1 (r2 = 0.486), CA2 (r2 = 0.492), and CA3 (r2 = 0.469). There were also significant correlations between DCX population in the dentate gyrus and daily dose (r2 = 0.560). Both correlations were consistent with linear dose-response models. This study illustrates that neuroanatomical sequelae of fetal ethanol exposure are dose-responsive and suggests that there may be a threshold for this effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The implementation of a competency-based nursing curriculum in a developing country: A qualitative descriptive study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Competency-based nursing curricula prepare nurse graduates with the required competencies to function effectively in a rapidly changing and increasingly complex healthcare environment. Implementation of a competency-based curriculum requires considerable investment in time and resources, and this process has not been described in Vietnam, a developing country. This research explores nurse educators' experiences from six Vietnamese nursing schools regarding implementing a competency-based nursing curriculum through the lens of McGrath’s Input-Process-Output model. Methods: A qualitative descriptive method was used. A total of 11 participants were nurse academics purposively chosen from six nursing schools where a competency-based nursing curriculum has been implemented, and 11 in-depth interviews were conducted. Results: Participants identified various issues in implementing a competency-based nursing curriculum, including the need for curriculum redesign, required improvements in teaching and learning, and resistance from teaching staff. Adequate human resources and the availability of infrastructure facilitated the process. Simultaneously, barriers to implementation included nurse educators with poor preparation for a new curriculum, inadequate infrastructure, limited equipment, and no policies that support a competency-based curriculum. Conclusions: The study findings describe the process of moving to a competency-based nursing curriculum implementation in a low to the middle-income country from the perspective of nurse educators and indicate critical success factors in facilitating the process in similar environments.

                We report the observation of a 31-year-old patient followed for a nasopharyngeal carcinoma since 2009, treated by locoregional radiotherapy, with a cumulative dose of 70 Gray.  This case presented all ocular complications of radiotherapy; radiation retinopathy (RR), which is the most severe complication, could be diagnosed earlier and have a better prognosis if optic coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was performed. She presented with a progressive decline in bilateral visual acuity. Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral posterior subcapsular cataract, radiation retinopathy, and optic neuropathy. The OCT B-scan showed more pronounced macular edema in the right eye.  The OCTA revealed enlargement of the central avascular zone and loss of the deep and superficial retinal vascular network. The patient received three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), without improvement in visual acuity. The aim of this case report is to present the contribution of OCT-A in the diagnosis of radiation maculopathy, and attribute these changes to ischemia at the level of the retinal vascular network.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SPEACH_AF: Sampling protein ensembles and conformational heterogeneity with Alphafold2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Richard A. Stein, Hassane S. Mchaourab</p>

The unprecedented performance of Deepmind’s Alphafold2 in predicting protein structure in CASP XIV and the creation of a database of structures for multiple proteomes and protein sequence repositories is reshaping structural biology. However, because this database returns a single structure, it brought into question Alphafold’s ability to capture the intrinsic conformational flexibility of proteins. Here we present a general approach to drive Alphafold2 to model alternate protein conformations through simple manipulation of the multiple sequence alignment via <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis. The approach is grounded in the hypothesis that the multiple sequence alignment must also encode for protein structural heterogeneity, thus its rational manipulation will enable Alphafold2 to sample alternate conformations. A systematic modeling pipeline is benchmarked against canonical examples of protein conformational flexibility and applied to interrogate the conformational landscape of membrane proteins. This work broadens the applicability of Alphafold2 by generating multiple protein conformations to be tested biologically, biochemically, biophysically, and for use in structure-based drug design.

                <p>by Alina Batzilla, Junyan Lu, Jarno Kivioja, Kerstin Putzker, Joe Lewis, Thorsten Zenz, Wolfgang Huber</p>

The development of cancer therapies may be improved by the discovery of tumor-specific molecular dependencies. The requisite tools include genetic and chemical perturbations, each with its strengths and limitations. Chemical perturbations can be readily applied to primary cancer samples at large scale, but mechanistic understanding of hits and further pharmaceutical development is often complicated by the fact that a chemical compound has affinities to multiple proteins. To computationally infer specific molecular dependencies of individual cancers from their <i>ex vivo</i> drug sensitivity profiles, we developed a mathematical model that deconvolutes these data using measurements of protein-drug affinity profiles. Through integrating a drug-kinase profiling dataset and several drug response datasets, our method, DepInfeR, correctly identified known protein kinase dependencies, including the EGFR dependence of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, the FLT3 dependence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with <i>FLT3</i>-ITD mutations and the differential dependencies on the B-cell receptor pathway in the two major subtypes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Furthermore, our method uncovered new subgroup-specific dependencies, including a previously unreported dependence of high-risk CLL on Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1). The method also produced a detailed map of the kinase dependencies in a heterogeneous set of 117 CLL samples. The ability to deconvolute polypharmacological phenotypes into underlying causal molecular dependencies should increase the utility of high-throughput drug response assays for functional precision oncology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical modeling of the molecular switch of TNFR1-mediated signaling pathways applying Petri net formalism and in silico knockout analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leonie K. Amstein, Jörg Ackermann, Jennifer Hannig, Ivan Đikić, Simone Fulda, Ina Koch</p>

The paper describes a mathematical model of the molecular switches of cell survival, apoptosis, and necroptosis in cellular signaling pathways initiated by tumor necrosis factor 1. Based on experimental findings in the literature, we constructed a Petri net model based on detailed molecular reactions of the molecular players, protein complexes, post-translational modifications, and cross talk. The model comprises 118 biochemical entities, 130 reactions, and 299 edges. We verified the model by evaluating invariant properties of the system at steady state and by <i>in silico</i> knockout analysis. Applying Petri net analysis techniques, we found 279 pathways, which describe signal flows from receptor activation to cellular response, representing the combinatorial diversity of functional pathways.120 pathways steered the cell to survival, whereas 58 and 35 pathways led to apoptosis and necroptosis, respectively. For 65 pathways, the triggered response was not deterministic and led to multiple possible outcomes. We investigated the <i>in silico</i> knockout behavior and identified important checkpoints of the TNFR1 signaling pathway in terms of ubiquitination within complex I and the gene expression dependent on NF-κB, which controls the caspase activity in complex II and apoptosis induction. Despite not knowing enough kinetic data of sufficient quality, we estimated system’s dynamics using a discrete, semi-quantitative Petri net model.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">How growers make decisions impacts plant disease control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rachel E. Murray-Watson, Frédéric M. Hamelin, Nik J. Cunniffe</p>

While the spread of plant disease depends strongly on biological factors driving transmission, it also has a human dimension. Disease control depends on decisions made by individual growers, who are in turn influenced by a broad range of factors. Despite this, human behaviour has rarely been included in plant epidemic models. Considering Cassava Brown Streak Disease, we model how the perceived increase in profit due to disease management influences participation in clean seed systems (CSS). Our models are rooted in game theory, with growers making strategic decisions based on the expected profitability of different control strategies. We find that both the information used by growers to assess profitability and the perception of economic and epidemiological parameters influence long-term participation in the CSS. Over-estimation of infection risk leads to lower participation in the CSS, as growers perceive that paying for the CSS will be futile. Additionally, even though good disease management can be achieved through the implementation of CSS, and a scenario where all controllers use the CSS is achievable when growers base their decision on the average of their entire strategy, CBSD is rarely eliminated from the system. These results are robust to stochastic and spatial effects. Our work highlights the importance of including human behaviour in plant disease models, but also the significance of how that behaviour is included.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Different forms of superspreading lead to different outcomes: Heterogeneity in infectiousness and contact behavior relevant for the case of SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elise J. Kuylen, Andrea Torneri, Lander Willem, Pieter J. K. Libin, Steven Abrams, Pietro Coletti, Nicolas Franco, Frederik Verelst, Philippe Beutels, Jori Liesenborgs, Niel Hens</p>

Superspreading events play an important role in the spread of several pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. While the basic reproduction number of the original Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be about 3 for Belgium, there is substantial inter-individual variation in the number of secondary cases each infected individual causes—with most infectious individuals generating no or only a few secondary cases, while about 20% of infectious individuals is responsible for 80% of new infections. Multiple factors contribute to the occurrence of superspreading events: heterogeneity in infectiousness, individual variations in susceptibility, differences in contact behavior, and the environment in which transmission takes place. While superspreading has been included in several infectious disease transmission models, research into the effects of different forms of superspreading on the spread of pathogens remains limited. To disentangle the effects of infectiousness-related heterogeneity on the one hand and contact-related heterogeneity on the other, we implemented both forms of superspreading in an individual-based model describing the transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a synthetic Belgian population. We considered its impact on viral spread as well as on epidemic resurgence after a period of social distancing. We found that the effects of superspreading driven by heterogeneity in infectiousness are different from the effects of superspreading driven by heterogeneity in contact behavior. On the one hand, a higher level of infectiousness-related heterogeneity results in a lower risk of an outbreak persisting following the introduction of one infected individual into the population. Outbreaks that did persist led to fewer total cases and were slower, with a lower peak which occurred at a later point in time, and a lower herd immunity threshold. Finally, the risk of resurgence of an outbreak following a period of lockdown decreased. On the other hand, when contact-related heterogeneity was high, this also led to fewer cases in total during persistent outbreaks, but caused outbreaks to be more explosive in regard to other aspects (such as higher peaks which occurred earlier, and a higher herd immunity threshold). Finally, the risk of resurgence of an outbreak following a period of lockdown increased. We found that these effects were conserved when testing combinations of infectiousness-related and contact-related heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An evaluation of the three measurable cardinal objectives of the National Youth Service Corps programme: a survey dataset [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The National Youth Service Corps programme is, among other targets, aimed at promoting national inclusiveness and tolerance in a culturally heterogeneous society. Despite the importance of this programme, little has been done to evaluate its degree of success. Where evaluations are done, they are never made public. There is a need for the NYSC programme, just like all other public programmes, to be evaluated for transparency, accountability and decision-making. From an evaluation of the three measurable objectives of the NYSC programme, this dataset bridges this gap. Methods: This dataset was collected from Nigerian graduates that completed their national service between 2012 and 2021. The data was collected through an electronic survey posted to various online platforms hosting National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members of the various sets and batches. The data collection aimed to evaluate the three cardinal objectives of the programme. After three years of data collection (from 2019 to 2021), responses were obtained from 19,278 participants that met the eligibility criteria. The data is an Excel (.xlsx) document with 19,278 cases and 95 variables. Descriptive statistics such as frequency counts and simple percentages were used to summarise the data. However, charts are further used to illustrate the demographic attributes of the respondents. The dataset is broad and covers all the 36 states in Nigeria plus the Federal Capital Territory. Results: The data set has many reuse potentials because it contains information on camp activities (such as parades, military drills, redeployment, quality of food, and facilities, among others), primary assignments and community service engagements of corps members. Conclusions: The data can offer a complete evaluation of how the (NYSC) has attained three of its four cardinal objectives. A series of relationships can further be determined and tested using inferential statistics among the variables included in the dataset.

                Neutralizing antibodies are essential for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wang et al. demonstrate dramatic changes of antibody repertoire in a COVID-19 patient throughout the whole disease process and reveal a key mutation within HCDR1 for the development of P2C-1F11-like nAbs.

                Dendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in anti-tumor immunity by inducing T cell differentiation. Herein, we found that the DC mechanical sensor Piezo1 stimulated by mechanical stiffness or inflammatory signals directs the reciprocal differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>1 and regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells in cancer. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 in DCs inhibited the generation of T<sub>H</sub>1 cells while driving the development of T<sub>reg</sub> cells in promoting cancer growth in mice. Mechanistically, Piezo1-deficient DCs regulated the secretion of the polarizing cytokines TGFβ1 and IL-12, leading to increased TGFβR2-p-Smad3 activity and decreased IL-12Rβ2-p-STAT4 activity while inducing the reciprocal differentiation of T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>H</sub>1 cells. In addition, Piezo1 integrated the SIRT1-hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1α)-dependent metabolic pathway and calcium-calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway to orchestrate reciprocal T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>reg</sub> lineage commitment through DC-derived IL-12 and TGFβ1. Our studies provide critical insight for understanding the role of the DC-based mechanical regulation of immunopathology in directing T cell lineage commitment in tumor microenvironments.

                Replay, the sequential reactivation within a neuronal ensemble, is a central hippocampal mechanism postulated to drive memory processing. While both rate and place representations are used by hippocampal place cells to encode behavioral episodes, replay has been largely defined by only the latter – based on the fidelity of sequential activity across neighboring place fields. Here we show that dorsal CA1 place cells in rats can modulate their firing rate between replay events of two different contexts. This experience-dependent phenomenon mirrors the same pattern of rate modulation observed during behavior and can be used independently from place information within replay sequences to discriminate between contexts. Our results reveal the existence of two complementary neural representations available for memory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A regeneration-triggered metabolic adaptation is necessary for cell identity transitions and cell cycle re-entry to support blastema formation and bone regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Regeneration depends on the ability of mature cells at the injury site to respond to injury, generating tissue-specific progenitors that incorporate the blastema and proliferate to reconstitute the original organ architecture. The metabolic microenvironment has been tightly connected to cell function and identity during development and tumorigenesis. Yet, the link between metabolism and cell identity at the mechanistic level in a regenerative context remains unclear. The adult zebrafish caudal fin, and bone cells specifically, have been crucial for the understanding of mature cell contribution to tissue regeneration. Here, we use this model to explore the relevance of glucose metabolism for the cell fate transitions preceding new osteoblast formation and blastema assembly. We show that injury triggers a modulation in the metabolic profile at early stages of regeneration to enhance glycolysis at the expense of mitochondrial oxidation. This metabolic adaptation mediates transcriptional changes that make mature osteoblast amenable to be reprogramed into pre-osteoblasts and induces cell cycle re-entry and progression. Manipulation of the metabolic profile led to severe reduction of the pre-osteoblast pool, diminishing their capacity to generate new osteoblasts, and to a complete abrogation of blastema formation. Overall, our data indicate that metabolic alterations have a powerful instructive role in regulating genetic programs that dictate fate decisions and stimulate proliferation, thereby providing a deeper understanding on the mechanisms regulating blastema formation and bone regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Epac2 in midbrain dopamine neurons contributes to cocaine reinforcement via facilitation of dopamine release</a></h4>

              
                Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse results in an upregulation of cAMP signaling in the mesolimbic dopamine system, a molecular adaptation thought to be critically involved in the development of drug dependence. Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac2) is a major cAMP effector abundantly expressed in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether Epac2 contributes to cocaine reinforcement. Here, we report that Epac2 in the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes cocaine reinforcement via enhancement of dopamine release. Conditional knockout of Epac2 from midbrain dopamine neurons (Epac2-cKO) and the selective Epac2 inhibitor ESI-05 decreased cocaine self-administration in mice under both fixed-ratio and progressive-ratio reinforcement schedules and across a broad range of cocaine doses. In addition, Epac2-cKO led to reduced evoked dopamine release, whereas Epac2 agonism robustly enhanced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens <i>in vitro</i>. This mechanism is central to the behavioral effects of Epac2 disruption, as chemogenetic stimulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via deschloroclozapine (DCZ)-induced activation of Gs-DREADD increased dopamine release and reversed the impairment of cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice. Conversely, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons with Gi-DREADD reduced dopamine release and cocaine self-administration in wild-type mice. Epac2-mediated enhancement of dopamine release may therefore represent a novel and powerful mechanism that contributes to cocaine reinforcement.

                The neocortex is organized around layered microcircuits consisting of a variety of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal types which perform rate- and oscillation-based computations. Using modeling, we show that both superficial and deep layers of the primary mouse visual cortex implement two ultrasensitive and bistable switches built on mutual inhibitory connectivity motives between somatostatin, parvalbumin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide cells. The switches toggle pyramidal neurons between high and low firing rate states that are synchronized across layers through translaminar connectivity. Moreover, inhibited and disinhibited states are characterized by low- and high-frequency oscillations, respectively, with layer-specific differences in frequency and power which show asymmetric changes during state transitions. These findings are consistent with a number of experimental observations and embed firing rate together with oscillatory changes within a switch interpretation of the microcircuit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Botulinum neurotoxin accurately separates tonic vs phasic transmission and reveals heterosynaptic plasticity rules in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In developing and mature nervous systems, diverse neuronal subtypes innervate common targets to establish, maintain, and modify neural circuit function. A major challenge towards understanding the structural and functional architecture of neural circuits is to separate these inputs and determine their intrinsic and heterosynaptic relationships. The <i>Drosophila</i> larval neuromuscular junction is a powerful model system to study these questions, where two glutamatergic motor neurons, the strong phasic-like &lt;strong&gt;Is&lt;/strong&gt; and weak tonic-like &lt;strong&gt;Ib&lt;/strong&gt;, co-innervate individual muscle targets to coordinate locomotor behavior. However, complete neurotransmission from each input has never been electrophysiologically separated. We have employed a botulinum neurotoxin, BoNT-C, that eliminates both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission without perturbing synaptic growth or structure, enabling the first approach that accurately isolates input-specific neurotransmission. Selective expression of BoNT-C in Is or Ib motor neurons disambiguates the functional properties of each input. Importantly, the blended values of Is+Ib neurotransmission can be fully recapitulated by isolated physiology from each input. Finally, selective silencing by BoNT-C does not induce heterosynaptic structural or functional plasticity at the convergent input. Thus, BoNT-C establishes the first approach to accurately separate neurotransmission between tonic vs phasic neurons and defines heterosynaptic plasticity rules in a powerful model glutamatergic circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effective sound localization coding by noisy populations of mouse inferior colliculus neurons revealed by fast volumetric imaging</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian inferior colliculus (IC) is thought to encode sound location. However, large-scale simultaneous recordings are lacking to characterise the underlying neuronal population code. Using volumetric two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice, here we simultaneously recorded the activity of ~1,000 IC neurons in response to sounds delivered from 13 different frontal horizontal locations (azimuths). The population responses showed marked trial-to-trial variability and revealed the recruitment of distinct groups of noise-correlated IC neurons as a function of stimulus azimuth. We tested decoding model performance on our data and found that template matching outperformed previously proposed models, where noise correlations helped improve the decoding accuracy. Finally, our volumetric imaging approach revealed that both the central nucleus and dorsal cortex of IC contribute to sound location coding. These findings indicate that noise correlations, together with azimuth tuning, play a key role in shaping the population code for sound location in the mammalian IC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting Dementia Severity by Merging Anatomical and Diffusion MRI with Deep 3D Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Machine learning methods have been used for over a decade for staging and subtyping a variety of brain diseases, offering fast and objective methods to classify neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD). Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have also been used to infer dementia severity and predict future clinical decline. Most CNN-based deep learning models use T1-weighted brain MRI scans to identify predictive features for these tasks. In contrast, we examine the added value of diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) - a variant of MRI, sensitive to microstructural tissue properties - as an additional input in CNN-based models of dementia severity. dMRI is sensitive to microstructural brain abnormalities not evident on standard anatomical MRI. By training CNNs on combined anatomical and diffusion MRI, we hypothesize that we could boost performance when predicting widely used clinical assessments of dementia severity, such as individuals scores on the ADAS11, ADAS13, and MMSE (mini-mental state exam) clinical scales. For benchmarking, we evaluate CNNs that use T1-weighted MRI and dMRI to estimate brain age - the task of predicting a persons chronological age from their neuroimaging data. To assess which dMRI-derived maps were most beneficial, we computed DWI-derived diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) maps of mean and radial diffusivity (MD/RD), axial diffusivity (AD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) for 1198 elderly subjects (age: 74.35 +/- 7.74 yrs.; 600 F/598 M, with a distribution of 636 CN/421 MCI/141 AD) from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We tested both 2D Slice CNN and 3D CNN neural network models for the above predictive tasks. Our results suggest that for at least some deep learning architectures, diffusion-weighted MRI may enhance performance for several AD-relevant deep learning tasks relative to using T1-weighted images alone.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evidence for a travel direction signal in humans that is independent of head direction</a></h4>

              
                We often assume that travel direction is redundant with head direction, but from first principles these two factors provide differing spatial information. Although head direction has been found to be a fundamental component of human navigation, it is unclear how self-motion signals for travel direction contribute to forming a travel trajectory. Employing a novel motion adaptation paradigm from visual neuroscience designed to preclude a contribution of head direction, we found high-level aftereffects of perceived travel direction, indicating that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, we discovered a higher frequency of reporting perceived travel toward the adapted direction compared to a no-adapt control: an aftereffect that runs contrary to low-level motion aftereffects. This travel aftereffect was maintained after controlling for possible response biases and approaching effects, and it scaled with adaptation duration. These findings demonstrate the first evidence of how a pure travel direction signal might be represented in humans, independent of head direction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Valproic acid exposure alters social visual lateralization and asymmetric gene expression in zebrafish larvae</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral asymmetry is a fundamental aspect of brain organization. Abnormal language hemispheric activation and differences in the prevalence of handedness have been observed in individuals with ASD, suggesting atypicality in cerebral structure and lateralization. Zebrafish are increasingly emerging among the key model species to study brain lateralization, with asymmetric development of the epithalamus as a model to investigate the relationship between brain asymmetry and behavior. We exposed zebrafish embryos at 5 hour post-fertilization to one micromolar dosage of valproic acid for 24 and 48 hours, assessed social interaction and visual lateralization in a social task, the mirror test, and measured gene expression changes in the thalamus and the telencephalon. We show that after exposure to valproic acid, zebrafish exhibit social deficits and alterations in lateralized social responses to their own reflected image. Valproic acid also induced changes in the asymmetric gene expression of the thalamic marker kctd12.1/leftover and had a significant effect on the expression of telencephalic genes known to be asymmetrically expressed in adult fish. Our data indicate that one micromolar doses of VPA are sufficient to neutralize both the visual field bias and the asymmetric epithalamic gene expression, opening new perspectives to investigate brain lateralization and its link to ASD in a zebrafish model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Role of Objecthood and Animacy in Apparent Movement Processing</a></h4>

              
                Movement perception involves both motion and form processing. Previous research has shown that processing along the motion pathway requires a familiar but not necessarily a human shape. However, the role of objecthood and animacy in the form pathway is less clear. Here, we used EEG frequency tagging to study how objecthood and animacy influence both posture processing and the integration of postures into movements. Specifically, we measured brain responses to repeating sequences of well-defined or pixelated images (objecthood) of human or corkscrew agents (animacy) performing fluent or non-fluent movements (movement fluency). The results revealed that movement processing was sensitive to objecthood but not to animacy, whereas posture processing was sensitive to both. Thus, our results indicate that movement processing in the form pathway requires a familiar shape, but not necessarily a human shape. Instead, stimulus animacy appears to be relevant only for posture processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The absence of gastrointestinal redox dyshomeostasis in the brain-first rat model of Parkinson's disease induced by bilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine</a></h4>

              
                The gut-brain axis plays an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD) by acting as a route for vagal propagation of aggregated -synuclein in the gut-first endophenotype and as a mediator of gastrointestinal dyshomeostasis via the nigro-vagal pathway in the brain-first endophenotype of the disease. One important mechanism by which the gut-brain axis may promote PD is by regulating gastrointestinal redox homeostasis as overwhelming evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a key role in the etiopathogenesis and progression of PD and the gastrointestinal tract maintains redox homeostasis of the organism by acting as a critical barrier to environmental and microbiological electrophilic challenges. The present aim was to utilize the bilateral intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) brain-first PD model to study the effects of isolated central pathology on redox homeostasis of the gastrointestinal tract. Three-month-old male Wistar rats were either not treated (intact controls; CTR) or treated bilaterally intrastriatally with vehicle (CIS) or 6-OHDA (6-OHDA). Motor deficits were assessed with the rotarod performance test and the duodenum, ileum, and colon were dissected for biochemical analyses 12 weeks after the treatment. Lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity, low-molecular thiols, and protein sulfhydryls, the activity of total and Mn/Fe superoxide dismutases, and total and azide-insensitive catalase/peroxidase were measured. Univariate and multivariate models of redox biomarkers provide solid evidence against the existence of pronounced gastrointestinal redox dyshomeostasis. The results indicate that the dysfunction of the nigro-vagal system and not motor deficit may be a key mediator of gastrointestinal dyshomeostasis in brain-first 6-OHDA-induced rodent models of PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical interneuron development is affected in leukodystrophy 4H</a></h4>

              
                4H leukodystrophy is a rare genetic disorder classically characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. With the discovery that 4H is caused by mutations that affect RNA polymerase III, mainly involved in the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, also patients with atypical presentations with mainly a neuronal phenotype were identified. Pathomechanisms of 4H brain abnormalities are still unknown and research is hampered by a lack of preclinical models. We aimed to identify cells and pathways that are affected by 4H mutations using induced pluripotent stem cell models. RNA sequencing analysis on induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebellar cells revealed several differentially expressed genes between 4H patients and control samples, including reduced ARX expression. As ARX is involved in early brain and interneuron development, we studied and confirmed interneuron changes in primary tissue of 4H patients. Subsequently, we studied interneuron changes in more depth and analyzed induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neuron cultures for changes in neuronal morphology, synaptic balance, network activity and myelination. We showed a decreased percentage of GABAergic synapses in 4H, which correlated to increased neuronal network activity. Treatment of cultures with GABA antagonists led to a significant increase in neuronal network activity in control cells but not in 4H cells, also pointing to lack of inhibitory activity in 4H. Myelination and oligodendrocyte maturation in cultures with 4H neurons was normal, and treatment with sonic hedgehog agonist SAG did not improve 4H related neuronal phenotypes. qPCR analysis revealed increased expression of parvalbumin interneuron marker ERBB4, suggesting that the development rather than generation of interneurons may be affected in 4H. Together, these results indicate that interneurons are involved, possibly parvalbumin interneurons, in disease mechanisms of 4H leukodystrophy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No evidence for cognitive impairment in an experimental rat model of knee osteoarthritis and associated chronic pain</a></h4>

              
                Although chronic pain states have been associated with impaired cognitive functions, including memory and cognitive flexibility, the cognitive effects of osteoarthritis (OA) pain remain to be clarified. The aim of this study was to measure cognitive function in the mono-iodoacetate (MIA) rat model of chronic OA-like knee pain. We used young adult male Lister hooded rats, which are well suited for cognitive testing. Rats received either a unilateral knee injection of MIA (3mg/50uL) or saline as control. Joint pain at rest was assessed for up to 12 weeks using weight-bearing asymmetry, and referred pain at a distal site using determination of hindpaw withdrawal thresholds (PWT). The watermaze delayed-matching-to-place (DMP) test of rapid place learning, novel object recognition (NOR) memory assay and an operant response-shift and -reversal task were used to measure memory and behavioural flexibility. Open field locomotor activity, startle response, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) were also measured for comparison. MIA-injected rats showed markedly reduced weight-bearing on the injured limb, as well as pronounced cartilage damage and synovitis, but interestingly no changes in PWT. Rearing was reduced, but otherwise locomotor activity was normal and no changes in startle and PPI were detected. MIA-injected rats had intact watermaze DMP performance, suggesting no substantial change in hippocampal function, and there were no changes in NOR memory or performance on the operant task of behavioural flexibility. Our finding that OA-like pain does not alter hippocampal function, unlike other chronic pain conditions, is consistent with human neuroimaging findings.

                Background: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have impaired general motor skills compared to typically developed (TD) individuals. Aims: To gain knowledge on how young adults with DS learn and retain new motor skills. Methods and Procedures: A DS-group (mean age = 23.9 +/- 3 years, N = 11), and an age-matched TD-group (mean age 22.8 +/- 1.8, N= 14) were recruited. The participants practiced a sequence visuomotor accuracy tracking task (VATT). Online and offline effects of practice were assessed in immediate and 7-day retention tests. Participants practiced the task in seven blocks (10.6 minutes). Outcomes and Results: The TD-group performed better than the DS-group in all blocks (all P < 0.001). Both groups improved VATT-performance online from baseline to immediate retention (all P < 0.001). The DS-groups' performance at 7-day retention was at the same level as the immediate retention tests ({Delta}DS). An offline decrease in performance was found in the TD-group ({Delta}TD, P < 0.001). A between-group difference was observed in the offline effect on the sequence task ({Delta}TD - {Delta}DS, P = 0.04). Conclusions and Implications: The motor performance of adults with DS is lower compared to their TD peers. However, adults with DS display significant online performance improvement during training, and offline consolidation following motor learning.

                Neurodegeneration is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its effect on neural activity dynamics underlying memory deficits is unclear. Here, we studied the effects of synaptic degeneration on neural activities associated with memory recall, memory rescue by slow-gamma stimulation, and learning a new memory, in an integrate-and-fire neuronal network. Our results showed that reducing connectivity decreases the neuronal synchronisation of memory neurons at slow-gamma frequencies and impairs memory recall performance. Although slow-gamma stimulation rescued memory recall and slow-gamma oscillations, the rescue with reduced connectivity caused a side effect of activating mixed memories. During the learning of a new memory, reducing connectivity caused an impairment in storing the new memory, but did not affect previously stored memories. Our results reveal potential computational mechanisms underlying the memory deficits caused by synaptic degeneration in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual risk attitudes arise from noise in neurocognitive magnitude representations</a></h4>

              
                Humans are generally risk averse: they prefer options with smaller certain outcomes over those with larger uncertain ones. This risk aversion is classically explained with a concave utility function, meaning that successive increases in monetary payoffs should increase subjective valuations by progressively smaller amounts. Here, we provide neural and behavioural evidence that risk aversion may also arise from a purely perceptual bias: The noisy logarithmic coding of numerical magnitudes can lead individuals to underestimate the size of larger monetary payoffs, leading to apparent risk aversion even when subjective valuation increases linearly with the estimated amount. A formal model of this process predicts that risk aversion should systematically increase when individuals represent numerical magnitudes more noisily. We confirmed this prediction by measuring both the mental and neural acuity of magnitude representations during a purely perceptual task and relating these measures to individual risk attitudes during separate financial decisions. Computational model fitting suggested that subjects based both types of choices on similar mental magnitude representations, with correlated precision across the separate perceptual and risky choices. Increased stimulus noise due to the presentation format of risky outcomes led to increased risk aversion, just as predicted by the model. The precision of the underlying neural magnitude representations was estimated with a numerical population receptive field model fitted to the fMRI data of the perceptual task. Subjects with more precise magnitude representations in parietal cortex indeed showed less variable behaviour and less risk-aversion in the separate financial choices. Our results highlight that individual patterns of economic behaviour may, at least partially, be determined by capacity limitations in perceptual processing rather than by processes that assign subjective values to monetary rewards.

                Parkinson Disease (PD) is characterized by multiple symptoms including olfactory dysfunction, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we explored pathological changes in the olfactory pathway of transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the human A30P mutant alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) (alpha-syn-Tg mice) at 6-7 and 12-14 months of age, representing early and late-stages of motor progression, respectively. alpha-Syn-Tg mice at late stages exhibited olfactory behavioral deficits, which correlated with severe alpha-syn pathology in projection neurons of the olfactory pathway. In parallel, olfactory bulb (OB) neurogenesis in alpha-syn-Tg mice was reduced in the OB granule cells at 6-7 months, and OB periglomerular cells at 12-14 months, respectively, both of which could contribute to olfactory dysfunction. Proteomic analyses showed a disruption in endo- and exocytic pathways in the OB during the early stages which appeared exacerbated at the synaptic terminals when the mice developed olfactory deficits at 12-14 months. Our data suggest that, 1) the alpha-syn-Tg mice recapitulate the olfactory functional deficits seen in PD; 2) olfactory structures exhibit spatiotemporal disparities for vulnerability to alpha-syn pathology; 3) alpha-syn pathology is restricted to projection neurons in the olfactory pathway; 4) neurogenesis in adult alpha-syn-Tg mice is reduced in the OB; and 5) synaptic endo- and exocytosis defects in the OB may further explain olfactory deficits.

                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in rodents holds great potential for advancing our understanding of brain networks. However, rodent fMRI lags the human community with regards to the availability of image processing softwares to support reproducibility, a significant challenge facing neuroimaging. To address these shortcomings, we introduce RABIES, a novel pipeline designed along best practices for reproducibility and transparency handling processing stages from image registration to data quality assessment during analysis. First, we present a robust registration workflow validated across both acquisition sites and species. Leveraging insights from the human literature, we introduce a novel framework for data quality assessment of single scans and during group-level network analysis. This framework will support the development of standardized high-quality acquisition protocols and harmonization of findings between studies. Taken together, the RABIES software will allow the emerging community to adopt reproducible practices and foster progress in translational neuroscience.

                Neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) have been traditionally viewed as a homogenous population. Recent studies are beginning to uncover heterogeneous molecular phenotypes and projection targets in this nucleus, but how such heterogeneity is ultimately manifested in neuronal physiology and function is largely unknown. We took an orthogonal approach to directly assess the physiological and functional heterogeneity in the LC. By identifying noradrenergic neurons using a genetic-based tagging approach, our study revealed a subset of neurons exhibiting a distinctive narrow spike waveform and lacking the prolonged after-hyperpolarization. We further provided evidence establishing a link between the proximity of LC neurons and their response latency, where putatively proximal neurons tended to have a long latency to optogenetic activation. Finally, we found that response latency of LC neurons was correlated with their burst firing and distinct relationship with pupil diameter. Together, our study presents novel evidence to reveal and link LC heterogeneity at the physiological level to that at the functional level.

                The discrete behavioral events captured on the smartphone touchscreen may help unravel real-world neural processing. We find that neural signals (EEG) surrounding a touchscreen event show peculiarly contralateral motor preparation, visual processing, and the consolidation of information. We leveraged these events in conjunction with kinematic recordings of the thumb and an artificial neural network to separate highly similar movements according to whether they resulted in a smartphone touch (goal-directed) or not (non-goal-directed). Despite their kinematic similarity underscored by the model, the signatures of neural control of movement and the post-movement processing were substantially dampened for the non-goal-directed movements, and these movements uniquely evoked error-related signals. We speculate that these unnecessary movements are common in the real world and although inconsequential the brain still provides limited motor preparation and tracks the action outcome. Real-world behavior is composed of neural processes that are difficult to capture in conventional laboratory-based tasks.

                Left inattention is common in individuals following right cerebrovascular accident (RCVA). In neurotypical adults, we have previously found prolonged rightward visual attention resulted in a subsequent increase in leftward attention. Here we applied the same method in neurological patients with RCVA and found improved post-intervention attention both to the left and right of visual fixation in participants with mild to no leftward inattention in comparison to a control. No such benefit was detected in participants with more pronounced leftward inattention. Given the feasibility of the intervention which leverages performance in the right unaffected visual space, future studies should examine the longevity and generalizability of such an intervention to other attention demanding tasks.

                Pain affects over 50% of US adults. Opioids are potent analgesics used to treat pain symptoms but are highly prone to abuse, creating a major dilemma for public health. Evidence suggests that the proclivity for opioid abuse under pain conditions varies between sexes. However, the neural mechanisms underlying sex-specific effects of pain on opioid use are largely unclear. Here, we recapitulate clinical findings and demonstrate that pain increases self-administration of the widely abused opioid, fentanyl, selectively in male rats. These behavioral effects develop over time and are paralleled by sex- and pain-specific effects on fentanyl-evoked ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neuron activity, a critical mediator of motivation and reward. Using in vivo fiber photometry, we show that tonic VTA DA neuron activity is attenuated in males with pain. In contrast, phasic VTA DA neuron responses to self-administered fentanyl increase in magnitude at later timepoints and correspond with increases in fentanyl intake. The protracted increase in fentanyl-evoked VTA DA activity is necessary for pain to enhance fentanyl self-administration in males because chemogenetic inhibition of VTA DA neurons normalized fentanyl intake and associated fentanyl-evoked VTA DA neuron responses. These findings reveal time-dependent and sex-specific pain-induced adaptations to VTA DA neuron function that underlie maladaptive patterns of opioid use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual projection neuron convergence and compensation in developing sensorimotor circuits in the Drosophila optic glomeruli</a></h4>

              
                Visual features detected by the early visual system must be combined into higher order representations to guide behavioral decision. Although key developmental mechanisms that enable the separation of visual feature channels in early visual circuits have been discovered, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that underlie their convergence in later stages of visual processing. Here we explore the development of a functionally well-characterized sensorimotor circuit in Drosophila melanogaster, the convergence of visual projection neurons (VPNs) onto the dendrites of a large descending neuron called the giant fiber (GF). We find two VPNs encoding different visual features that target the same giant fiber dendrite establish their territories on the dendrite, in part, through sequential axon arrival during development prior to synaptogenesis. Physical occupancy is important to maintain territories, as we find the ablation of one VPN results in expanded dendrite territory of the remaining VPN, and that this compensation enables the GF to remain responsive to ethologically relevant visual stimuli. Our data highlight temporal mechanisms for visual feature convergence and promote the GF circuit, and the Drosophila optic glomeruli where VPN to GF connectivity resides, as an ideal developmental model for investigating complex wiring programs and plasticity in visual feature convergence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model based control can give rise to devaluation insensitive choice</a></h4>

              
                Influential recent work aims to ground psychiatric dysfunction in the brain's basic computational mechanisms. For instance, compulsive symptoms as in drug abuse have been argued to arise from an imbalance between multiple systems for instrumental learning. Computational models suggest that such multiplicity arises because the brain adaptively simplifies laborious "model-based" deliberation by sometimes relying on a cheaper, more habitual "model-free" shortcut. Support for this account comes in part from failures to appropriately change behaviour in light of new events. Notably, instrumental responding can, in some circumstances, persist despite reinforcer devaluation, perhaps reflecting control by model-free mechanisms that are driven by past reinforcement rather than knowledge of the (now devalued) outcome. However, another important line of theory, heretofore mostly studied in Pavlovian conditioning, posits a different mechanism that can also modulate behavioural change. It concerns how animals identify different rules or contingencies that may apply in different circumstances, by covertly clustering experiences into distinct groups identified with different "latent causes" or contexts. Such clustering has been used to explain the return of Pavlovian responding following extinction. Here we combine both lines of theory to investigate the consequences of latent cause inference on instrumental sensitivity to reinforcer devaluation. We show that because segregating events into different latent clusters prevents generalization between them, instrumental insensitivity to reinforcer devaluation can arise in this theory even using only model-based planning, and does not require or imply any habitual, model-free component. In simulations, these ersatz habits (like laboratory ones) emerge after overtraining, interact with contextual cues, and show preserved sensitivity to reinforcer devaluation on a separate consumption test, a standard control. While these results do not rule out a contribution of model-free learning per se, they point to a subtle and important role of state inference in instrumental learning and highlight the need for caution in using reinforcer devaluation procedures to rule in (or out) the contribution of different learning mechanisms. They also offer a new perspective on the neurocomputational substrates of drug abuse and the relevance of laboratory reinforcer devaluation procedures to this phenomenon.

                The sense of direction is critical for survival in changing environments and relies on flexibly integrating self-motion signals with external sensory cues. While the anatomical substrates involved in head direction (HD) coding are well known, the mechanisms by which visual information updates HD representations remain poorly understood. Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) plays a key role in forming coherent representations of space in mammals and it encodes a variety of navigational variables, including HD. Here, we use simultaneous two-area tetrode recording to show that RSC HD representation is nearly synchronous with that of the anterodorsal nucleus of thalamus (ADn), the obligatory thalamic relay of HD to cortex, during rotation of a prominent visual cue. Moreover, coordination of HD representations in the two regions is maintained during darkness. We further show that anatomical and functional connectivity are consistent with a strong feedforward drive of HD information from ADn to RSC, with surprisingly little reciprocal drive in the corticothalamic direction. Together, our results provide direct evidence for a concerted global HD reference update across cortex and thalamus, and establish the underlying functional connectivity that supports this coordination.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical Betz cells analogue in songbirds utilizes Kv3.1 to generate ultranarrow spikes</a></h4>

              
                Complex motor skills in vertebrates require specialized upper motor neurons with precise action potential (AP) firing. To examine how diverse populations of upper motor neurons subserve distinct functions and the specific repertoire of ion channels involved, we conducted a thorough study of the excitability of upper motor neurons controlling somatic motor function in the zebra finch. We found that robustus arcopallialis projection neurons (RAPNs), key command neurons for song production, exhibit ultranarrow spikes and higher firing rates compared to neurons controlling non-vocal somatic motor functions (AId neurons). This striking difference was primarily due to the expression of a high threshold, fast-activating voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv3.1 (KCNC1). RAPN properties thus mirror those of the sparse, specialized Betz cells in the motor cortex of humans and other primates, which also fire ultranarrow spikes enabled by Kv3.1 expression. These large layer 5 pyramidal neurons are involved in fine digit control and are notably absent in rodents. Our study thus provides evidence that songbird RAPNs and primate Betz cells have convergently evolved the use of Kv3.1 to ensure precise, rapid AP firing required for fast and complex motor skills.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex, stress and UCP2: mitochondria illuminate microglial identity beyond the dichotomy</a></h4>

              
                Environmental cues influence microglial interaction with their neuronal landscape, often causing changes in microglial functional identity. This process demands rapid energy production, which is supported by an optimized mitochondrial network. Whether mitochondrial adaptations define a microglial functional state is unknown due to limitations in mitochondrial visualization and manipulation within their microenvironment. Here, we investigate the mitochondrial network of individual microglia in physiological and dysfunctional conditions during a naive or injury-induced mouse retinal environment. After optic nerve crush (ONC) injury, we identify mitochondrial and microglial phenotypic remodeling that is distinct from the naive environment. Remarkably, knockout of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) causes transient, stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion only in males after ONC, even though both sexes suffer from increased intrinsic stress levels. When we compare key metabolic genes between sexes in physiological conditions, only males exhibit a metabolic transition towards glycolysis in the injury-induced environment, which attenuates in UCP2 knockout resulting in acutely accelerated retinal ganglion cell death. Our data shows that the cell-extrinsic ONC environment and cell-intrinsic UCP2KO manipulation triggers several microglial states distinguishable by mitochondrial networks that are heavily influenced by sex and injury-induced stress.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Magnetogenetic closed-loop reduction of seizure activity in a rat model of epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                On-demand neurostimulation has shown success in epilepsy patients with pharmacoresistant seizures. Seizures produce magnetic fields that can be recorded using magnetoencephalography. We developed a new closed-loop approach to control seizure activity based on magnetogenetics using the electromagnetic perceptive gene (EPG) that encodes a protein that responds to magnetic fields. The EPG transgene was expressed in inhibitory interneurons under hDlx promoter and kainic acid was used to induce acute seizures. In vivo electrophysiological signals were recorded. We found that hDlx EPG rats exhibited a significant delay in the onset of first seizure (1142.72 {+/-} 186.35s) compared to controls (644.03 {+/-} 15.06s) and significantly less seizures (4.11 {+/-} 1.03) compared to controls (8.33 {+/-} 1.58). These preliminary findings suggest that on-demand activation of EPG expressed in inhibitory interneurons suppress seizure activity, and magnetogenetics via EPG may be an effective strategy to alleviate seizure severity in a minimally invasive, closed-loop and cell-specific fashion.

                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable, polygenic neuropsychiatric disease, which disables the patients as well as decreases their life expectancy and quality of life. Common and Rare variants studies on SCZ subjects have provided more than 100 genomic loci that hold importance in the context of SCZ pathophysiology. Transcriptomic studies from clinical samples have informed about the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and non-coding RNAs in SCZ patients. Despite these advancements, no causative genes for SCZ were found and hence SCZ is difficult to recapitulate in animal models. In the last decade, induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)-based models have helped in understanding the neural phenotypes of SCZ by studying patient iPSC-derived 2D neuronal cultures and 3D brain organoids. Here, we have aimed to provide a simplistic overview of the current progress and advancements after synthesizing the enormous literature on SCZ genetics and SCZ iPSC-based models. Although further understanding of SCZ genetics and mechanisms using these technological advancements is required, the recent approaches have allowed to delineate important cellular mechanisms and biological pathways affected in SCZ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-dependent role of hypocretin/orexin neurons in social behavior</a></h4>

              
                Intraspecies social interactions are integral for survival and maintenance of society among all mammalian species. Yet, our understanding of the neural systems and mechanisms involved in the establishment of social connectedness are limited. Since their initial discovery as regulators of sleep/wakefulness and appetite in the brain, the hypocretin/orexin neurons have also been shown to play an essential role in modulating energy homeostasis, motivated and emotional behavior. These neurons are located exclusively in the hypothalamus which, regulates complex and goal-directed behaviors. The hypothalamus also plays an important role in the modulation of social behavior by encoding internal states. However, our understanding of the role of hypocretin neurons in social behavior is currently limited. To address this knowledge gap, we infused AAV encoding GCaMP6s into the lateral hypothalamus of female and male HcrtIRES-Cre mice and performed fiber photometry to record the activity of hypocretin neuron population during social interaction. We then applied optogenetic inhibition of hypocretin neurons to determine the necessity of these neurons for social behavior. Our results indicate that hypocretin neurons exhibit a robust increase in activity in response to social interaction in both female and male mice. We demonstrate the hypocretin neuron population is differentially activated during interaction between familiar and stranger conspecifics. The optogenetic inhibition of hypocretin neuron activity during social behavior leads to a reduction in the amount of time mice are engaged in social interaction in males but not in females. Together, these data implicate the lateral hypothalamus hypocretin neurons as a key regulator within the larger network of neural systems involved in social behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increasing the efficacy of exposure using a whole brain approach to real-time fMRI neurofeedback among female victims of interpersonal violence</a></h4>

              
                Individuals who experience interpersonal violence (IPV) and poly-victimization have an increased likelihood of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and statistically, women are more likely than men to be victims of IPV, experience poly-victimization, and develop PTSD. Current gold-standard PTSD treatments utilize exposure, a key mechanism of change; however, exposure-based treatments suffer from moderate remission rates. This outcome underscores the importance of utilizing knowledge of neural mechanisms to increase treatment effectiveness and PTSD remission rates. The current study used a symptom provocation paradigm, which is conceptually similar to exposure, and whole brain multivariate pattern classifiers (MVPC) to provide participants with neurofeedback on their ability to regulate their brain-states. In the MRI scanner, women (N = 21; control n = 11, PTSD n = 10) completed a symptom provocation paradigm. The MVPC was constructed during the first two runs and neurofeedback was given during the third and fourth run. During all four runs, participants were instructed to increase or decrease their emotional engagement with their stress/trauma script and during the last two runs, participants were provided visual feedback indicating their performance in regulating brain states. Skin conductance response was utilized as an independent measure of physiological arousal. Generalized linear models indicated a significant interaction effect of feedback and condition as well as feedback and group. Generalized linear models of skin conductance response largely mirrored these findings. Results indicate neurofeedback of whole brain activation can be utilized to increase engagement with trauma memories. Thus, exposure-based treatments, possibly with refractory cases of PTSD, may be improved with neurofeedback by providing the therapist and patient insight into their brain-state during exposure which may increase the effectiveness of exposure-based treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-dependent changes in the dynamic functional organization of the brain at rest - a cross - cultural replication approach</a></h4>

              
                Age-associated changes in brain function play an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Although previous work has examined age-related changes in static functional connectivity (FC), accumulating evidence suggests that advancing age is especially associated with alterations in the dynamic interactions and transitions between different brain states, which hitherto has received less attention. Moreover, conclusions of previous studies in this domain are limited by suboptimal replicability of resting state fMRI and culturally homogenous cohorts. Here, we investigate the robustness of age-associated changes in dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) by capitalizing on the availability of fMRI cohorts from two cultures (Western European and Chinese). In both cohorts we consistently identify two distinct connectivity states: a more frequent segregated within-network connectivity state (state I) and a less frequent integrated between-network connectivity state (state II). In both cohorts, older (55-80 years) compared to younger participants (20-35 years) exhibited lower occurrence of and spent less time in state I. Moreover, older participants tended to exhibit more transitions between networks and greater variance in global efficiency. Overall, our cross-cultural replication of age-associated changes in key dFC metrics implies that advancing age is robustly associated with a reorganization of dynamic brain activation that favors the use of less functionally-specific networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HArtMuT - Modeling eye and muscle contributors in neuroelectric imaging</a></h4>

              
                Magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measurements record a mix of signals from the brain, eyes, and muscles. These signals can be disentangled for artifact cleaning e.g. using spatial filtering techniques. However, correctly localizing and identifying these components relies on head models that so far only take brain sources into account. We thus developed the Head Artefact Model using Tripoles (HArtMuT). This volume conduction head model extends to the neck and includes brain sources as well as sources representing eyes and muscles that can be modeled as single dipoles, symmetrical dipoles, and tripoles. We compared a HArtMuT 4-layer Boundary Element Model (BEM) with the EEGLAB standard head model on their localization accuracy and residual variance (RV) using a HArtMuT Finite Element Model as ground truth. We also evaluated the RV on real-world data of mobile participants, comparing different HArtMuT BEM types with the EEGLAB standard head model. We found that HArtMuT improves localization for all sources, especially non-brain, and localization error and RV of non-brain sources were in the same range as those of brain sources. The best results were achieved by using cortical dipoles, muscular tripoles, and ocular symmetric dipoles, but dipolar sources alone can already lead to convincing results. We conclude that HArtMuT is well suited for modeling eye and muscle contributions to the M/EEG signal. It can be used to localize sources and to identify brain, eye, and muscle components. HArtMuT is freely available and can be integrated into standard software.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal regulation of ZBTB16 expression by glucocorticoids alters human cortical neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Glucocorticoids are important for proper organ maturation1. Increased exposure to these hormones during pregnancy, as a result of commonly prescribed synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone in preterm births2, has been associated with lasting effects on the offspring, including on neurodevelopment and neuropsychiatric disease risk3. While the consequences of glucocorticoid excess in term and especially adult brain have been extensively studied, mainly in rodents4, studies on their effects during early human cortical development are absent. Here we use human cerebral organoids and mice to study cell-type specific effects of glucocorticoids on neurogenic processes. We show that glucocorticoid administration during neurogenesis alters the cellular architecture of the developing cortex by increasing a specific type of gyrencephalic species-enriched basal progenitors that co-express PAX6 and EOMES. This effect is mediated via the glucocorticoid-responsive transcription factor ZBTB16 as shown with overexpression, genetic knock-down and reporter assays experiments in organoids and embryonic mouse models and leads to increased production of deep-layer neurons. A phenome-wide mendelian randomization analysis of a genetic intronic enhancer variant that moderates glucocorticoid-induced ZBTB16 levels, as shown with enhancer assays and enhancer-editing in organoids, reveals potential causal relationships with increased educational attainment as well as neuroimaging phenotypes in adults. In this study we provide a cellular and molecular pathway for the effects of glucocorticoids on human neurogenesis that potentially explains postnatal phenotypes and may be used to refine treatment guidelines.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Texture Coding In Higher Order Somatosensory Cortices</a></h4>

              
                Our sense of touch confers to us the ability to perceive textural features over a broad range of spatial scales and material properties, giving rise to a complex sensory experience. To understand the neural basis of texture perception requires that somatosensory neurons be stimulated with textures that tile the space of spatial scales and material properties experienced during everyday interactions with objects. We have previously shown that neurons in early stages of somatosensory processing - the nerves and somatosensory cortex (S1) - are highly sensitive to texture and carry a representation of texture that is highly informative about the surface but also predicts the evoked sensory experience. In contrast, the texture signals in higher order areas - secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and the parietal ventral area (PV) - have never been investigated with a rich and naturalistic textural set. To fill this gap, we recorded single-unit activity in S2/PV of macaques while they performed a texture discrimination task. We then characterized the neural responses to texture and compared these to their counterparts in somatosensory cortex (S1). We found that texture responses in S2/PV differ from their S1 counterparts in several ways. First, texture responses are far sparser in S2/PV than in S1: While individual S1 neurons respond promiscuously to most textures, S2/PV neurons tend to respond to only a few textures. Second, S2/PV responses co-vary only weakly with roughness, the dominant perceptual axis of texture. Third, S2/PV signals carry information about task variables - the animal's perceptual decision. Fourth, the millisecond scale temporal patterning in the texture response observed in S1 has all but disappeared in S2/PV.

	<p>Despite the fact that the urge to investigate bilingualism and neurodevelopmental disorders as continuous indices rather than categorical ones has been well-voiced among researchers with respect to research methodological approaches, in the recent literature, when it comes to examining language, cognitive skills and neurodivergent characteristics, it is still the case that the most prevalent view is the categorisation of adults or children into groups. In other words, there is a categorisation of individuals, e.g., monolingual vs. bilingual children or children with typical and atypical/non-typical/non-neurotypical development. We believe that this labelling is responsible for the conflicting results that we often come across in studies. The aim of this review is to bring to the surface the importance of individual differences through the study of relevant articles conducted in bilingual children and children with autism, who are ideal for this study. We concur with researchers who already do so, and we further suggest moving away from labels and instead shift towards the view that not everything is either white or black. We provide suggestions as to how this shift could be implemented in research, while mostly aiming at starting a discourse rather than offering a definite path.</p>

	<p>Research on the experiences of Arab families of children with autism living in non-Arab countries is scarce. A survey investigated the support needs, psychological distress, and parental relationships of Arab parents (n = 100) of children with autism living in the United Kingdom (UK). The survey consisted of five main questionnaires: a demographic questionnaire, the GO4KIDDS Brief Adaptive Scale, the Family Needs Survey, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Descriptive analysis indicated that the most frequently identified support needs were information, community services, and explaining to others. Parents reported high levels of psychological distress, a high level of parental relationship satisfaction with their spouse, and few parental disagreements about their child with autism. Regression analyses showed that increased child behavior problems predicted more total family needs. Higher levels of child prosocial behavior, the better health status of parents, and a larger number of children in the family were associated with lower levels of parental psychological distress. A longer time living in the UK was associated with more parental disagreement over issues related to the child with ASD. Reducing child behavior problems and increasing child prosocial behavior may be important targets for support and intervention to improve outcomes for Arab parents of autistic children.</p>

	<p>Current findings on brain structural alterations in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) are heterogenous and controversial. This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the significant gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities between patients with CRPS and healthy controls (HCs). A systematic search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE databases was performed, updated through 27 January 2022. A total of five studies (93 CRPS patients and 106 HCs) were included. Peak coordinates and effect sizes were extracted and meta-analyzed by anisotropic effect size&amp;amp;ndash;signed differential mapping (AES-SDM). Heterogeneity, sensitivity, and publication bias of the main results were checked by the Q test, jackknife analysis, and the Egger test, respectively. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the potential impact of risk factors on GMV alterations in patients with CRPS. The main analysis exhibited that patients with CRPS had increased GMV in the left medial superior frontal gyrus (SFGmedial.L), left striatum, and an undefined area (2, 0, &amp;amp;minus;8) that may be in hypothalamus, as well as decreased GMV in the corpus callosum (CC) (extending to right supplementary motor area (SMA.R), right median cingulate/paracingulate gyri (MCC.R)), and an undefined area (extending to the right caudate nucleus (CAU.R), and right thalamus (THA.R)). Meta-regression analysis showed a negative relationship between increased GMV in the SFGmedial.L and disease duration, and the percentage of female patients with CRPS. Brain structure abnormalities in the sensorimotor regions (e.g., SFGmedial.L, SMA.R, CAU.R, MCC.R, and THA.R) may be susceptible in patients with CRPS. Additionally, sex differences and disease duration may have a negative effect on the increased GMV in SFGmedial.L.</p>

     alt="Analysis of the distribution of vagal afferent projections from different peripheral organs to the nucleus of the solitary tract in rats"/>
<p>We injected retrograde pseudotyped adeno-associated viruses into different peripheral organs and mapped the axonal projections of vagal viscerosensory neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We observed no obvious viscerotopy, with axons from different organs overlapping in NTS subnuclei and with NTS neurons of different neurochemical phenotype. The implications for deciphering this viscerosensory code are discussed.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anatomical tracing studies examining the vagal system can conflate details of sensory afferent and motor efferent neurons. Here, we used a serotype of adeno-associated virus that transports retrogradely and exhibits selective tropism for vagal afferents, to map their soma location and central termination sites within the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). We examined the vagal sensory afferents innervating the trachea, duodenum, stomach, or heart, and in some animals, from two organs concurrently. We observed no obvious somatotopy in the somata distribution within the nodose ganglion. The central termination patterns of afferents from different organs within the NTS overlap substantially. Convergence of vagal afferent inputs from different organs onto single NTS neurons is observed. Abdominal and thoracic afferents terminate throughout the NTS, including in the rostral NTS, where the 7th cranial nerve inputs are known to synapse. To address whether the axonal labeling produced by viral transduction is so widespread because it fills axons traveling to their targets, and not just terminal fields, we labeled pre and postsynaptic elements of vagal afferents in the NTS . Vagal afferents form multiple putative synapses as they course through the NTS, with each vagal afferent neuron distributing sensory signals to multiple second-order NTS neurons. We observe little selectivity between vagal afferents from different visceral targets and NTS neurons with common neurochemical phenotypes, with afferents from different organs making close appositions with the same NTS neuron. We conclude that specific viscerosensory information is distributed widely within the NTS and that the coding of this input is probably determined by the intrinsic properties and projections of the second-order neuron.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurogenic induction by Ngfr reduces reactive astrocytic Lcn2/Slc22a17 signalling, amyloid deposition and Tau phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Defects in neurogenic ability in humans could be a culprit of the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Enhancing the neurogenic outcome in humans could enhance resilience to counteract neurodegeneration. However, molecular mechanisms that enhance neural stem cell neurogenic potential are largely unknown. We previously showed that zebrafish uses nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) signalling to enhance pathology-induced neurogenesis. Here, we show that induction of NGFR signalling in mouse astroglia also induce proliferative and neurogenic capacity in the APP/PS1dE9 AD mouse model. Single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown experiments showed that NGFR suppressed reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2). Blockage of Lcn2 receptor, Slc22a17, recapitulated the neurogenic effects of NGFR, and long-term NGFR expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Immunostaining on postmortem human hippocampi with AD or primary age-related Tauopathy and 3D human astroglial cultures showed elevated LCN2 levels correlate with gliosis. Our study link the regulatory role of an autocrine molecular mechanism in astroglia to the neurogenic ability and modulatory effects on pathological hallmarks of AD, supporting the promise of neurogenesis-oriented therapeutic approaches as potential clinical interventions for this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pre-symptomatic reduction of individuality in the App NL-F knock-in model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                While one third of the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained by environment and lifestyle, AD pathology also affects individual lifestyle, possibly long before clinical manifestation of dementia. To study this hidden disease effect with its potentially large impact on coping with AD, we examined in mice how the App NL-F/NL-F (NL-F) knock-in mutation affects the pre-symptomatic response to environmental enrichment (ENR). We assessed the emergence of inter-individual phenotypic variation while both genetic background and the shared environment were held constant, thereby isolating the contribution of individual behavior ('non-shared environment'). After 4 months of ENR, in NL-F both mean and variability of plasma ApoE were increased, suggesting a pre-symptomatic variation in pathogenic processes. Roaming entropy (RE) as a measure of behavioral activity was continuously assessed with radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology and revealed reduced habituation and variance in NL-F compared to controls. Intra-individual variation decreased but behavioral predictability and stability were reduced in NL-F. Seven months after discontinuation of ENR we found no difference in plaque size and number, but ENR increased variance in hippocampal plaque counts in NL-F. A reactive increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in NL-F, known from other models, was normalized by ENR. Our data suggest that, while NL-F has early effects on individual behavioral patterns in response to ENR, there are lasting effects at the level of cellular plasticity even after discontinuation of ENR. Hence, early behavior matters for maintaining individual behavioral trajectories and brain plasticity even under maximally constraint conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">3D reconstruction of the cerebellar germinal layer reveals intercytoplasmic connections between developing granule cells</a></h4>

              
                The difficulty of retrieving high-resolution, in vivo evidence of the proliferative- and migratory processes occurring in neural germinal zones has limited our understanding of neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Here, we employed a connectomic approach using a high-resolution, serial-sectioning scanning electron microscopy volume to investigate the laminar cytoarchitecture of the transient external granular layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum, where granule cells coordinate a series of mitotic and migratory events. By integrating image segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and deep learning approaches, we discovered and characterized anatomically complex intercellular connections bridging pairs of cerebellar granule cells throughout the EGL. Connected cells were either mitotic, migratory, or transitioning between these two cell stages, displaying a chronological continuum of proliferative and migratory events never previously observed in vivo at this resolution. This unprecedented ultra-structural characterization poses intriguing hypotheses about intercellular connectivity between developing progenitors, and its possible role in the development of the central nervous system (CNS).

	<p>Introduction: Non-invasive brain stimulation seems to be beneficial for DPD patients. However, the sites used in previous studies were empirical. Exploring new stimulation locations via functional magnetic resonance imaging may improve the efficacy. Objectives: The objective was to find potential locations for non-invasive brain stimulation on the depersonalization-derealization disorder. Methods: We explored the potential brain surface regions from three pipelines: pipeline 1: activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis (five studies with 36 foci included); pipeline 2: functional connectivity analysis based on DPD-network (76 subjects included); and pipeline 3: functional connectivity analysis based on DPD regions of interest from the meta-analysis. Potential targets were the 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 system coordinates for brain surface regions. Results: We identified several potential brain surface regions, including the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, superior parietal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as potential sites. Conclusion: Our findings of the potential stimulation targets might help clinicians optimize the application of non-invasive brain stimulation therapy in individuals with DPD.</p>

	<p>Dynamic changes in the oral microbiome have gained attention due to their potential diagnostic role in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, but no studies have examined the changes in oral microbiome during the acute stage of TBI using a clinically translational pig model. Crossbred piglets (4&amp;amp;ndash;5 weeks old, male) underwent either a controlled cortical impact (TBI, n = 6) or sham surgery (sham, n = 6). The oral microbiome parameters were quantified from the upper and lower gingiva, both buccal mucosa, and floor of the mouth pre-surgery and 1, 3, and 7 days post-surgery (PS) using the 16S rRNA gene. Faith&amp;amp;rsquo;s phylogenetic diversity was significantly lower in the TBI piglets at 7 days PS compared to those of sham, and beta diversity at 1, 3, and 7 days PS was significantly different between TBI and sham piglets. However, no significant changes in the taxonomic composition of the oral microbiome were observed following TBI compared to sham. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential diagnostic role of the oral microbiome during the chronic stage of TBI with a larger number of subjects.</p>

	<p>The technological revolution has led to the birth of new diagnoses, such as gaming disorder. When any addiction, including this one, is associated with other mental disorders, it is considered a dual diagnosis. The objectives of this current work were to estimate the prevalence of dual diagnoses in the adolescent general population while also considering the problematic use of video games and substance addiction and assessing its psychosocial risk factors. Thus, we carried out a cross-sectional study with a sample of 397 adolescents; 16.4% presented problematic videogame use and 3% presented a dual diagnosis. Male gender increased the probability of both a dual diagnosis (OR [95% CI] = 7.119 [1.132, 44.785]; p = 0.036) and problematic video game use (OR [95% CI] = 9.85 [4.08, 23.77]; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Regarding personality, low conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness scores were predictors of a dual diagnosis and problematic videogame use, while emotional stability predicted a dual diagnosis (OR [95% CI] = 1.116 [1.030, 1.209]; p = 0.008). Regarding family dynamics, low affection and communication increased both the probability of a dual diagnosis (OR [95% CI] = 0.927 [0.891, 0.965]; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and problematic video game use (OR [95% CI] = 0.968 [0.945, 0.992]; p = 0.009). Regarding academic performance, bad school grades increased the probability of a dual diagnosis. In summary, male gender, certain personality traits, poor communication, and poor affective family dynamics should be interpreted as red flags that indicate an increased risk of a dual diagnosis in adolescents, which could require early intervention through specific detection programs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Prognostic Discussion for Infants with Neurologic Conditions: Qualitative Analysis of Family Conferences</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We characterize the content and role of prognostic discussion for infants with neurologic conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this descriptive qualitative study, we prospectively enrolled infants (age &lt; 1 year) in the intensive care unit with a neurologic condition anticipated to have ≥1 family conference about prognosis or goals of care. We audiorecorded family conferences as they occurred. We used a rapid-cycle qualitative approach to identify and refine themes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty infants and 61 parents were enrolled; 68 family conferences occurred for 24 infants. The majority of infant cases (n = 23/24, 96%) and conferences (n = 64/68, 94%) included discussion of neurologic prognosis. Common infant diagnoses included prematurity (n = 12, 52%), genetic conditions (n = 9, 35%), and brain malformations (n = 7, 30%). We identified 2 themes relating to the characterization of the infant's prognosis: (1) predictions of impairment and (2) rationale for prognostic predictions. We identified 3 themes characterizing the role of prognostic discussion: (1) aligning parent and clinician understanding of infant outcome, (2) influencing decision-making, and (3) preparing for life at home. We identified 2 themes characterizing discussion of prognostic uncertainty: (1) multilayered types of uncertainty and (2) holding space for hope alongside uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this cohort of infants with neurologic conditions and their parents, we identified salient themes characterizing the content and role of discussion about neurologic outcome. Our findings highlight that prognostic discussion focuses on anticipated impairments, informs decision-making, and helps families prepare for home life. Future work should characterize whether these findings align with parent preferences for prognostic disclosure. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>NOTCH1 belongs to the NOTCH family of proteins that regulate cell fate and inflammatory responses. Somatic and germline <i>NOTCH1</i> variants have been implicated in cancer, Adams-Oliver syndrome, and cardiovascular defects. We describe 7 unrelated patients grouped by the presence of leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and heterozygous de novo gain-of-function variants in <i>NOTCH1</i>. Immunologic profiling showed upregulated CSF IP-10, a cytokine secreted downstream of NOTCH1 signaling. Autopsy revealed extensive leukoencephalopathy and microangiopathy with vascular calcifications. This evidence implicates that heterozygous gain-of-function variants in <i>NOTCH1</i> lead to a chronic central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response resulting in a calcifying microangiopathy with leukoencephalopathy<i>.</i> ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

     alt="Quantification of functional recovery in a larval zebrafish model of spinal cord injury"/>
<p>New open-source software allowed measurement of trunk curvature during dark-evoked larval zebrafish movements following spinal cord transection. Motor deficits caudal to the lesion recovered incompletely, even after regeneration of spinal axons, suggesting that evaluation of function will be critical to understand restoration of circuitry in this central nervous system injury model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Human spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by permanent loss of damaged axons, resulting in chronic disability. In contrast, zebrafish can regenerate axonal projections following central nervous system injury and re-establish synaptic contacts with distant targets; elucidation of the underlying molecular events is an important goal with translational potential for improving outcomes in SCI patients. We generated transgenic zebrafish with GFP-labeled axons and transected their spinal cords at 10 days post-fertilization. Intravital confocal microscopy revealed robust axonal regeneration following the procedure, with abundant axons bridging the transection site by 48 h post-injury. In order to analyze neurological function in this model, we developed and validated new open-source software to measure zebrafish lateral trunk curvature during propulsive and turning movements at high temporal resolution. Immediately following spinal cord transection, axial movements were dramatically decreased caudal to the lesion site, but preserved rostral to the injury, suggesting the induction of motor paralysis below the transection level. Over the subsequent 96 h, the magnitude of movements caudal to the lesion recovered to baseline, but the rate of change of truncal curvature did not fully recover, suggesting incomplete restoration of caudal strength over this time course. Quantification of both morphological and functional recovery following SCI will be important for the analysis of axonal regeneration and downstream events necessary for restoration of motor function. An extensive array of genetic and pharmacological interventions can be deployed in the larval zebrafish model to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Predicting Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson’s disease through incentive biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To evaluate if the feedback related negativity (FRN) –a neurophysiological marker of incentive processing- can be used to predict the development of impulse control disorders (ICD) in Parkinson’s disease (PD)</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Longitudinal cohort of consecutive non-demented Parkinson’s disease patients with no ICD history. We recorded FRN signals while they performed a gambling task. We calculated the mean amplitude difference between losses and gains (FRNdiff) to be used as a predictor of future ICD development. We performed prospective biannual follow-up assessments for 30 months to detect incident ICD. Finally, we evaluated how basal FRNdiff was associated to posterior development of ICD using survival models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between October 7, 2015 and December 16, 2016, we screened 120 patients. Among them, 94 patients performed the gambling and 92 completed the follow up. Eighteen patients developed ICD during follow up while 74 remained free of ICD. Baseline FRNdiff was greater in patients who developed ICD than in those who did not (-2.33 μV vs -0.84μV, p=0.001). No other significant baseline differences were found. The FRNdiff was significantly associated with ICD development in the survival models both when not adjusted (HR of 0.73, CI95% 0.58-0.91, p=0.006) and when controlling for dopamine replacement therapy, sex and age (HR 0.74, CI95% 0.55-0.97, p= 0.035). None of the impulsivity measures evaluated was related to ICD development.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Reward processing differences measured by FRN signals precede ICD development in Parkinson’s disease. This neurophysiological marker permits to identify patients with high risk of ICD development.</p>

	<p>This study investigated the quantitative distribution of cerebral venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) based on quantitative sensitivity mapping (QSM) and determined its prognostic value in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). A retrospective study was conducted on 39 hospitalized patients. Reconstructed QSM was used to calculate the cerebral SvO2 of each region of interest (ROI) in the ischemic hemisphere. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland&amp;amp;ndash;Altman analysis were conducted to define the best resolution of the distribution map. The correlation between the cerebral SvO2 in hypoxic regions (SvO2ROI &amp;amp;lt; 0.7) and clinical scores was obtained by Spearman and power analysis. The associations between cerebral SvO2 and unfavorable prognosis were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Excellent agreement was found between the cerebral SvO2 in hypoxic regions with a resolution of 7.18 &amp;amp;times; 7.18 &amp;amp;times; 1.6 mm3 and asymmetrically prominent cortical veins regions (ICC: 0.879 (admission), ICC: 0.906 (discharge)). The cerebral SvO2 was significantly negative with clinical scores (all |r| &amp;amp;gt; 0.3). The cerebral SvO2 and its changes at discharge were significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis (OR: 0.812 and 0.866). Therefore, the cerebral SvO2 in hypoxic regions measured by the quantitative distribution map can be used as an indicator for evaluating the early prognosis of AIS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Network States Classification based on Local Field Potential Recordings in the Awake Mouse Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent studies using intracellular recordings in awake behaving mice revealed that cortical network states, defined based on membrane potential features, modulate sensory responses and perceptual outcomes. Single-cell intracellular recordings are difficult and have low yield compared to extracellular recordings of population signals, such as local field potentials (LFPs). However, it is currently unclear how to identify these behaviorally-relevant network states from the LFP. We used simultaneous LFP and intracellular recordings in the somatosensory cortex of awake mice to design a network state classification from the LFP, the Network State Index (NSI). We used the NSI to analyze the relationship between single-cell (intracellular) and population (LFP) signals over different network states of wakefulness. We found that graded levels of population signal faithfully predicted the levels of single-cell depolarization in nonrhythmic regimes whereas, in  ([2&ndash;4 Hz]) oscillatory regimes, the graded levels of rhythmicity in the LFP mapped into a stereotypical oscillatory pattern of membrane potential. Finally, we showed that the variability of network states, beyond the occurrence of slow oscillatory activity, critically shaped the average correlations between single-cell and population signals. Application of the LFP-based NSI to mouse visual cortex data showed that this index increased with pupil size and during locomotion and had a U-shaped dependence on population firing rates. NSI-based characterization provides a ready-to-use tool to understand from LFP recordings how the modulation of local network dynamics shapes the flexibility of sensory processing during behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Measures of Spatial Orientation: Spatial Bias Analogs in Visual and Haptic Tasks</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The primary sensory modality for probing spatial orientation can vary among psychophysical tasks. In the subjective visual vertical (SVV) task, a visual stimulus is used to measure perceived vertical orientation, while a haptic stimulus is used in the subjective haptic vertical (SHV) task. Here we examined disparity in SHV and SVV task results and asked whether it could be related to biases in probing different spatial estimates by each task. Forty-two healthy volunteers (mean &plusmn; SD age, 25 &plusmn; 10 years; 19 females; 21 left handed) were recruited. The effect of a task to measure spatial orientation was calculated as the difference between SHV and SVV values, and with the head upright and tilted 20&deg; laterally. There was a task bias regardless of head position related to hand use in the haptic task but not handedness (mean head upright &plusmn; SEM: left hand, &ndash;3.7 &plusmn; 1.1&deg;; right hand, 7.9 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;). When this task bias was subtracted out, there was a similar spatial bias using each hand in the SHV task that was also comparable to the SVV task (mean head with left tilt: left hand, 3.9 &plusmn; 0.7&deg;; right hand, 4.4 &plusmn; 0.7&deg;; SVV, 4.9 &plusmn; 0.7&deg;; mean head with right tilt: left hand, &ndash;4.6 &plusmn; 0.9&deg;; right hand, &ndash;4.6 &plusmn; 0.8&deg;; SVV, &ndash;4.7 &plusmn; 1.0&deg;). These findings show that the disparity in visual and haptic measures of spatial orientation is primarily related to a modality-specific bias, and once the effect of hand use is removed from the haptic measurements, the spatial bias becomes comparable to the visual task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Detecting Spontaneous Neural Oscillation Events in Primate Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Electrophysiological oscillations in the brain have been shown to occur as multicycle events, with onset and offset dependent on behavioral and cognitive state. To provide a baseline for state-related and task-related events, we quantified oscillation features in resting-state recordings. We developed an open-source wavelet-based tool to detect and characterize such oscillation events (OEvents) and exemplify the use of this tool in both simulations and two invasively-recorded electrophysiology datasets: one from human, and one from nonhuman primate (NHP) auditory system. After removing incidentally occurring event-related potentials (ERPs), we used OEvents to quantify oscillation features. We identified ~2 million oscillation events, classified within traditional frequency bands: , , &alpha;, &beta;, low , , and high . Oscillation events of 1&ndash;44 cycles could be identified in at least one frequency band 90% of the time in human and NHP recordings. Individual oscillation events were characterized by nonconstant frequency and amplitude. This result necessarily contrasts with prior studies which assumed frequency constancy, but is consistent with evidence from event-associated oscillations. We measured oscillation event duration, frequency span, and waveform shape. Oscillations tended to exhibit multiple cycles per event, verifiable by comparing filtered to unfiltered waveforms. In addition to the clear intraevent rhythmicity, there was also evidence of interevent rhythmicity within bands, demonstrated by finding that coefficient of variation of interval distributions and Fano factor (FF) measures differed significantly from a Poisson distribution assumption. Overall, our study provides an easy-to-use tool to study oscillation events at the single-trial level or in ongoing recordings, and demonstrates that rhythmic, multicycle oscillation events dominate auditory cortical dynamics.</p>
