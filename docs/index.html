              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Revealing druggable cryptic pockets in the Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 and other β-coronaviruses by simulations and crystallography</a></h4>

              
                Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) is a main pathogenicity factor of α<i>-</i> and β<i>-</i>coronaviruses. Nsp1 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suppresses the host gene expression by sterically blocking 40S host ribosomal subunits and promoting host mRNA degradation. This mechanism leads to the downregulation of the translation-mediated innate immune response in host cells, ultimately mediating the observed immune evasion capabilities of SARS-CoV-2. Here, by combining extensive molecular dynamics simulations, fragment screening and crystallography, we reveal druggable pockets in Nsp1. Structural and computational solvent mapping analyses indicate the partial crypticity of these newly discovered and druggable binding sites. The results of fragment-based screening via X-ray crystallography confirm the druggability of the major pocket of Nsp1. Finally, we show how the targeting of this pocket could disrupt the Nsp1-mRNA complex and open a novel avenue to design new inhibitors for other Nsp1s present in homologous β<i>-</i>coronaviruses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global hypo-methylation in a proportion of glioblastoma enriched for an astrocytic signature is associated with increased invasion and altered immune landscape</a></h4>

              
                We describe a subset of glioblastoma, the most prevalent malignant adult brain tumour, harbouring a bias towards hypomethylation at defined differentially methylated regions. This epigenetic signature correlates with an enrichment for an astrocytic gene signature, which together with the identification of enriched predicted binding sites of transcription factors known to cause demethylation and to be involved in astrocytic/glial lineage specification, point to a shared ontogeny between these glioblastomas and astroglial progenitors. At functional level, increased invasiveness, at least in part mediated by SRPX2, and macrophage infiltration characterise this subset of glioblastoma.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bundling and segregation affect pheromone deposition, but not choice, in an ant</a></h4>

              
                Behavioural economists have identified many psychological manipulations which affect perceived value. A prominent example of this is bundling, in which several small gains (or costs) are experienced as more valuable (or costly) than if the same total amount is presented together. While extensively demonstrated in humans, to our knowledge this effect has never been investigated in an animal, let alone an invertebrate. We trained individual <i>Lasius niger</i> workers to two of three conditions in which either costs (travel distance), gains (sucrose reward), or both were either bundled or segregated: (1) both costs and gains bundled, (2) both segregated, and (3) only gains segregated. We recorded pheromone deposition on the ants’ return trips to the nest as measure of perceived value. After training, we offer the ants a binary choice between odours associated with the treatments. While bundling treatment did not affect binary choice, it strongly influenced pheromone deposition. Ants deposited c. 80% more pheromone when rewards were segregated but costs bundled as compared with both costs and rewards being bundled. This pattern is further complicated by the pairwise experience each animal made, and which of the treatments it experiences first during training. This demonstrates that even insects are influenced by bundling effects. We propose that the deviation between binary choice and pheromone deposition in this case may be due to a possible linearity in distance perception in ants, while almost all other sensory perception in animals is logarithmic.

	<p>How speech prosody is processed in the brain during language production remains an unsolved issue. The present work used the phrase-recall paradigm to analyze brain oscillation underpinning rhythmic processing in speech production. Participants were told to recall target speeches aloud consisting of verb&amp;amp;ndash;noun pairings with a common (e.g., [2+2], the numbers in brackets represent the number of syllables) or uncommon (e.g., [1+3]) rhythmic pattern. Target speeches were preceded by rhythmic musical patterns, either congruent or incongruent, created by using pure tones at various temporal intervals. Electroencephalogram signals were recorded throughout the experiment. Behavioral results in 2+2 target speeches showed a rhythmic priming effect when comparing congruent and incongruent conditions. Cerebral-acoustic coherence analysis showed that neural activities synchronized with the rhythmic patterns of primes. Furthermore, target phrases that had congruent rhythmic patterns with a prime rhythm were associated with increased theta-band (4&amp;amp;ndash;8 Hz) activity in the time window of 400&amp;amp;ndash;800 ms in both the 2+2 and 1+3 target conditions. These findings suggest that rhythmic patterns can be processed online. Neural activities synchronize with the rhythmic input and speakers create an abstract rhythmic pattern before and during articulation in speech production.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Rapid review on monkeypox policies among the G20 nations: relevance to policy and practitioner [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Monkeypox has been declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the WHO Director General (WHO-DG). Most of the G20 nations have reported Monkeypox outbreak. Policies developed and implemented in G20 countries for the prevention and control of monkeypox preparedness and response have global consequences. This rapid review aimed to map the monkeypox prevention and control policies planned and implemented in G20 nations in line with temporary recommendations issued by the WHO-DG. Methods: We mapped monkeypox prevention and control policies in G20 nations based on the WHO-DG recommendations. Medline (through PubMed), Scopus, and ProQuest Health and Medical Complete were searched to understand G20 preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic policies. We also performed an extensive gray literature search through the Ministry of Health websites and newspaper through Google.  The documents/ studies that had an information on prevention, control and management guidelines/policies and published through journal, news articles and health ministry websites of G20 nations on monkeypox were included. We excluded the editorials, opinion, and perspective papers and studies published prior to May 6, 2022. Results: We obtained 671 articles with 10 articles included in the review. Additionally, we identified 55 documents from the gray literature. We included national guidelines of the 18 countries on the control, prevention, and management of monkeypox. National guidelines were compared with the WHO guidelines in terms of implementing coordinated response, engaging and protecting communities, surveillance and public health measures and international travel, clinical management and infection, prevention and control (IPC) measures and medical countermeasures research. Depending on the availability of resources, some recommendations are followed by nations while others are not. Conclusions: Coordinated response among states is key to contain the transmission of monkeypox. To bring a coordinated response, G20 nations are following temporary recommendations that are context specific to their nation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Students’ Satisfaction Of Online Learning In Oman [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to the development facilitated by modern technology, the world has become a small village with instantly changing methods of education. Online education has become an alternative method for course delivery used by colleges and universities globally.   Methods: The population of this study was N=564 students enrolled in asynchronous online learning at the College of Sharia Sciences in the Sultanate of Oman for the academic year 2020-2021. The survey instruments from “The Student Satisfaction Survey” developed by Strachota (2006) were utilized in this study. The survey included items in the following categories: demographics, learner instructor's interaction, learner-peer interaction, and lastly general satisfaction. The researcher reformulated the questions to suit the target group and some questions were changed to suit the target audience.  Results: Remarkably, the data show that there is no direct relationship between demographic factors and student satisfaction with asynchronous online learning. On the other hand, there is a strong and noticeable relationship between students' satisfaction with asynchronous online learning and student-instructor interaction. There is also a correlation between students' satisfaction with asynchronous online learning and student-peer interaction.   Conclusions: The students of the College of Sharia Sciences are on the whole very satisfied with asynchronous online learning; they consider it a very successful experience and recommend its use by students in other educational institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Explaining the unexpected COVID-19 trends and potential impact across Africa. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Official COVID-19 case counts and mortality rates across Africa are lower than had been anticipated. Research reports, however, indicate far higher exposure rates than the official counts in some countries. Particularly in Western and Central Africa, where mortality rates are disproportionately lower than the rest of the continent, this occurrence may be due to immune response adaptations resulting from (1) frequent exposure to certain pro-inflammatory pathogens, and (2) a prevalence of low-grade inflammation coupled with peculiar modifications to the immune response based on one’s immunobiography. We suggest that the two factors lead to a situation where post infection, there is a rapid ramp-up of innate immune responses, enough to induce effective defense and protection against plethora pathogens. Alongside current efforts at procuring and distributing vaccines, we draw attention to the need for work towards appreciating the impact of the apparently widespread, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections on Africa’s populations vis a vis systemic inflammation status and long-term consequences for public health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of a peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes: protocol for a randomised controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Frequent positional changes and movements during labour is one of the recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO) to prevent prolonged labour, thereby avoiding cesarean sections. However, labour induction, continuous fetal monitoring in supine position and immobilising the women during labour are standard practices in most private hospitals. To combat these problems and to implement WHO recommendations, the peanut ball is an effective device through which frequent positional changes will be achieved without disrupting the labour procedures. The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the peanut ball device during labour on maternal and neonatal outcomes and assess the stress response induced by labour in terms of maternal and neonatal cortisol in low-risk primigravid women. The study is a prospective, block randomised controlled trial with parallel arms. A total of 768 study participants will be randomised to the peanut-ball group (intervention) and standard care group (control). The intervention group will receive different peanut ball positions during labour at or after 4 cm of cervical dilatation. The primary outcomes of the study are maternal outcome that includes measurement of duration of the active and the second stage of labour, stress level as measured by serum cortisol level at 3–4 cm and at 10 cm of cervical dilatation, mode of delivery, perception of pain, behavioural response during the active stage of labour and neonatal outcomes, which includes the pattern of fetal heart rate, APGAR score, birth injuries, and umbilical serum and salivary cortisol level. The collected data will be compared between the intervention and control groups.  Trial Registration: This research is registered under the CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry of India) (CTRI/2019/08/020802) (21/8/2019).

This study was conducted to compare the impact of mobile health education messages verses face-to-face consultation on weight reduction among overweight female university students. Methods: This Quasi-experimental study comprised three groups: a control group, a group receiving mobile health education, and a group receiving face-to-face consultation. Each group contained 26 participants taking part over a period of 12 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up thereafter. The data analysis used two-way repeated measures ANOVA with least significant difference testing. The study was ethically approved at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Results: The results revealed that the intervention found significant results in weight reduction among the respondents (p < 0.05). In addition, both intervention groups significantly improved their health belief, social support, and health behavior scores in comparison to the control group (p < 0.001). The results show that the average scores for social support for eating and exercise at baseline were significantly lower than at post-intervention or follow-up (p < 0.001). In addition, the results of both aspects of social support showed that the average social support score at post-intervention was significantly higher than at follow-up. Furthermore, the health behavior score measured post-intervention was higher than at follow-up. There was a statistically significant difference in average metabolism during physical activity (p < 0.001) but no statistical difference in average eating behavior score. Conclusion: The study found that the use of mobile health education to deliver health programs facilitates communication between the healthcare provider and individual, and can empower adolescent females in their pursuit of weight loss by improving their attitudes and knowledge, leading to better health behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Trends in prevalence and patterns of use of a heated tobacco product (IQOS™) in Japan: A three-year repeated cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Numerous smoke-free tobacco or nicotine-containing product (TNP) alternatives have been introduced to support individual- and population-level harm reduction relative to continued cigarette smoking. This article details the nationwide prevalence and patterns of TNP use between 2016 and 2019 in Japan following the commercialization of IQOS™, a smoke-free heated tobacco product (HTP). Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted over a period of three study years (2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019) in representative samples of the Japanese general adult population and samples of Japanese adult IQOS users registered in the IQOS owner database of Philip Morris International’s affiliate in Japan. Results: Across the three study years (Y1-Y3), the prevalence of overall current TNP use (Y1-Y3: 18.5%, 18.9%, and 18.2%) and overall TNP use by age and sex remained similar. However, there was a growing shift from cigarette smoking to smoke-free TNP use across the three study years. While the cigarette smoking prevalence (Y1-Y3: 17.6%, 17.3%, and 16.0%) decreased, the use prevalence of smoke-free TNPs, including the HTP IQOS™ (Y1-Y3: 1.8%, 3.2%, and 3.3%) and e-cigarettes (Y1-Y3, 0.7%, 1.6%, and 2.0%) increased. At the same time, TNP initiation, TNP relapse, and TNP reinitiation with IQOS were all very low across the three study years. Across Y1-Y3, exclusive use of only one type of TNP (Y1-Y3: 82.3%, 75.0%, and 70.4%) decreased, while dual use of two types of TNPs (Y1-Y3: 14.3%, 17.2%, and 16.7%) increased, and poly-TNP use (Y1-Y3: 2.1%, 6.1%, and 10.0%) increased markedly. Moreover, the majority of adult IQOS users were exclusive IQOS users. Conclusions: These trends in IQOS use behavior suggest that IQOS™ has the potential to switch adult smokers from cigarettes to smoke-free tobacco products, which presents a harm reduction opportunity, and that HTPs are effective tools for complementing current tobacco control measures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The circadian clock mediates the response to oxidative stress in a cone photoreceptor‒like (661W) cell line via regulation of glutathione peroxidase activity [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The mammalian retina contains an autonomous circadian clock that controls many physiological functions within this tissue. Our previous studies have indicated that disruption of this circadian clock by removing Bmal1 from the retina affects the visual function, retinal circuitry, and cone photoreceptor viability during aging. In the present study, we employed a mouse-derived cone photoreceptor‒like cell, 661W, to investigate which molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock may modulate cone photoreceptor viability during aging. Methods: Bmal1 knockout (BKO) cells were generated from 661W cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tool. Deletion of Bmal1 from 661W was verified by western blot and monitoring Per2-luc bioluminescence circadian rhythms. To investigate the effect of Bmal1 removal on an oxidative stress challenge, cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2,1 mM) for two hours and then cell viability was assessed. Cells were also cultured and harvested for gene expression analysis and antioxidant assay. Results: Our data indicated that 661W cells contain a functional circadian clock that mediates the response to an oxidative stress challenge in vitro and that such a response is no longer present in the BKO cell. We also hypothesized that the effect was due to the circadian regulation of the intracellular antioxidant defense mechanism. Our results revealed that in 661W cells, the antioxidant defense mechanism showed time dependent variation , whereas in BKO cells, there was an overall reduction in this antioxidant defense mechanism, and it no longer showed time dependent variation. Conclusions: Our work supported the notion that the presence of a functional circadian clock and its ability to modulate the response to an oxidative stress is the underlying mechanism that may protect cones during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nutritional status, nutrient imbalances, food-related behaviors and dietary supplements use among patients with celiac disease on a gluten free diet in Lebanon: a national cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, that occurs in susceptible individuals and is associated with dietary restriction and subsequent nutritional deficiencies. This study investigated the diet quality, nutrition imbalances and nutrition status among young children,adolescents and adults with CD who followed a gluten free diet an who were referred to several hospitals in Lebanon. Methods: A cross-sectional study in 50 individuals (31.74 ± 15.64 years) with CD was conducted, using biochemical parameters, anthropometric measurements, dietary and physical activity assessments. Results: Of the 50 participants, 38% and 16% were presenting low serum levels of iron and vitamin B12, respectively. The majority of participants were physically inactive and around 40% of them had low muscle mass. A weight loss of 10% to 30% indicating mild to moderate malnutrition was shown in 14% of individuals. The assessment of food-related behaviors shows that 80% of participants were reading nutrition labels and 96% of them were following gluten-free diets. Some barriers including family ignorance (6%), language of the nutrition labels (20%) and expensive GF products (78%) were limiting the adherence to GFD. The inadequacy of the daily energy intake along with insufficient intakes of calcium and vitamin D were remarked among individuals with CD. However, protein and iron intake were exceeding the recommendations among all age groups, except in males aged 4-8 years and 19-30 years. Half the study participants were using dietary supplements where 38%, 10%, 46%, 18%, 16% and 4% used vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, folate and probiotics, respectively. Conclusion: GFD is the key treatment for CD. However, it is not without inadequacies and may cause certain deficiencies such as calcium and vitamin D leading to reduced bone density. This underlines the critical role of dietitians in education and maintenance of healthy GFD among individuals with CD.

                Gaultheria nummularioides D.Don 1825 (Ericaceae) is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The complete chloroplast genome of G. nummularioides has been sequenced and assembled. The genome is 176,207 bp in total with one large single copy (LSC: 107,726 bp), one small single copy (SSC: 3,389 bp), and two inverted repeat regions (IRa and IRb; each 32,546 bp). The chloroplast genome encoded a total of 110 unique genes; the GC content of these genes is 36.6%. The results based on phylogenetic analysis confirmed that G. nummularioides diverged later than G. praticola, and the sister-group relationship between G. nummularioides and the clade comprising G. fragrantissima Wall. 1820 and G. hookeri C.B.Clarke 1882 was strongly supported, revealing the phylogenetic position of G. nummularioides. This work provides additional information for studying the genetic diversity of G. nummularioides and its closely related taxa, as well as further exploration of chloroplast genomes in the Ericaceae family.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Criminalistic and criminological analysis of the Thomas Restobar case in Peru in the context of sanitary measures by COVID-19: A case study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The aim of this study was to collect and analyze the experiences in regard to the application of criminalistic and criminological protocols and procedures, which were used to carry out the intervention in the premises of Thomas Restobar in Peru, in the context of the declaration of sanitary measures to control COVID 19. This police intervention resulted in the death of 13 people. Methods: For the collection of information, we used the focus group technique, for which a script was designed and validated by five experts, considering six major subcategories: C1SC1: Joint investigation and prosecution work, C1SC2: Protocols and guidelines, C1SC3: Chain of custody (police, experts, and prosecutor), C1SC4: Quality of results; C2SC1: Participation of agents of Thomas Restobar and the municipality, C2SC2: Compliance with DIGESA-DIRIS health regulations. The study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee of the Universidad Norbert Wiener, with approval file N°864-2021. Results: From the criminological analysis it became evident that the deficiencies identified in the six structured subcategories have led to the tragic death of thirteen people from asphyxiation. The people who attended this bar did not comply with the sanitary norms, exposing the health and life of their relatives and other people. The security agents of the premises and of the Municipality of Los Olivos did not comply with the norms of supervision and control, which finally led to the unfortunate death of 13 people from asphyxiation, closely related to the case of Utopia, in 2002. Conclusions: When evaluated by the experts of the focus group, it has generated two emerging categories: creation of a School of Experts and the categorization of the experience, which would prevent cases like Utopia and Thomas Restobar from happening again.

                <p>by Alexander Klug, Joachim Krug</p>

Understanding the benefits and costs of recombination under different scenarios of evolutionary adaptation remains an open problem for theoretical and experimental research. In this study, we focus on finite populations evolving on neutral networks comprising viable and unfit genotypes. We provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of recombination by jointly considering different measures of evolvability and mutational robustness over a broad parameter range, such that many evolutionary regimes are covered. We find that several of these measures vary non-monotonically with the rates of mutation and recombination. Moreover, the presence of unfit genotypes that introduce inhomogeneities in the network of viable states qualitatively alters the effects of recombination. We conclude that conflicting trends induced by recombination can be explained by an emerging trade-off between evolvability on the one hand, and mutational robustness on the other. Finally, we discuss how different implementations of the recombination scheme in theoretical models can affect the observed dependence on recombination rate through a coupling between recombination and genetic drift.

The field of optimal experimental design uses mathematical techniques to determine experiments that are maximally informative from a given experimental setup. Here we apply a technique from artificial intelligence—reinforcement learning—to the optimal experimental design task of maximizing confidence in estimates of model parameter values. We show that a reinforcement learning approach performs favourably in comparison with a one-step ahead optimisation algorithm and a model predictive controller for the inference of bacterial growth parameters in a simulated chemostat. Further, we demonstrate the ability of reinforcement learning to train over a distribution of parameters, indicating that this approach is robust to parametric uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Social dilemmas of sociality due to beneficial and costly contagion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel B. Cooney, Dylan H. Morris, Simon A. Levin, Daniel I. Rubenstein, Pawel Romanczuk</p>

Levels of sociality in nature vary widely. Some species are solitary; others live in family groups; some form complex multi-family societies. Increased levels of social interaction can allow for the spread of useful innovations and beneficial information, but can also facilitate the spread of harmful contagions, such as infectious diseases. It is natural to assume that these contagion processes shape the evolution of complex social systems, but an explicit account of the dynamics of sociality under selection pressure imposed by contagion remains elusive. We consider a model for the evolution of sociality strategies in the presence of both a beneficial and costly contagion. We study the dynamics of this model at three timescales: using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model to describe contagion spread for given sociality strategies, a replicator equation to study the changing fractions of two different levels of sociality, and an adaptive dynamics approach to study the long-time evolution of the population level of sociality. For a wide range of assumptions about the benefits and costs of infection, we identify a social dilemma: the evolutionarily-stable sociality strategy (ESS) is distinct from the collective optimum—the level of sociality that would be best for all individuals. In particular, the ESS level of social interaction is greater (respectively less) than the social optimum when the good contagion spreads more (respectively less) readily than the bad contagion. Our results shed light on how contagion shapes the evolution of social interaction, but reveals that evolution may not necessarily lead populations to social structures that are good for any or all.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused both a health and economic crisis around the world. Its papain-like protease (PLpro) is one of the protein targets utilized in designing new drugs that would aid vaccines in the fight against the virus. Although there are already several potential candidates for a good inhibitor of this protein, the degree of variability of the protein itself is not taken into account. As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 can mutate to a high degree, but PLpro variability has not been studied to date. Based on sequence data available in databases, we analyzed the mutational potential of this protein. We focused on the effect of observed mutations on inhibitors’ binding mode and their efficacy as well as protein’s activity. Our analysis identifies five mutations that should be monitored and included in the drug design process: P247S, E263D-Y264H and T265A-Y268C.

In response to the imperfections of current sequence alignment methods, originated from the inherent serialism within their corresponding electrical systems, a few optical approaches for biological data comparison have been proposed recently. However, due to their low performance, raised from their inefficient coding scheme, this paper presents a novel all-optical high-throughput method for aligning DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, named HELIOS. The HELIOS method employs highly sophisticated operations to locate character matches, single or multiple mutations, and single or multiple indels within various biological sequences. On the other hand, the HELIOS optical architecture exploits high-speed processing and operational parallelism in optics, by adopting wavelength and polarization of optical beams. For evaluation, the functionality and accuracy of the HELIOS method are approved through behavioral and optical simulation studies, while its complexity and performance are estimated through analytical computation. The accuracy evaluations indicate that the HELIOS method achieves a precise pairwise alignment of two sequences, highly similar to those of Smith-Waterman, Needleman-Wunsch, BLAST, MUSCLE, ClustalW, ClustalΩ, T-Coffee, Kalign, and MAFFT. According to our performance evaluations, the HELIOS optical architecture outperforms all alternative electrical and optical algorithms in terms of processing time and memory requirement, relying on its highly sophisticated method and optical architecture. Moreover, the employed compact coding scheme highly escalates the number of input characters, and hence, it offers reduced time and space complexities, compared to the electrical and optical alternatives. It makes the HELIOS method and optical architecture highly applicable for biomedical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Coupling and heterogeneity modulate pacemaking capability in healthy and diseased two-dimensional sinoatrial node tissue models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chiara Campana, Eugenio Ricci, Chiara Bartolucci, Stefano Severi, Eric A. Sobie</p>

Both experimental and modeling studies have attempted to determine mechanisms by which a small anatomical region, such as the sinoatrial node (SAN), can robustly drive electrical activity in the human heart. However, despite many advances from prior research, important questions remain unanswered. This study aimed to investigate, through mathematical modeling, the roles of intercellular coupling and cellular heterogeneity in synchronization and pacemaking within the healthy and diseased SAN. In a multicellular computational model of a monolayer of either human or rabbit SAN cells, simulations revealed that heterogenous cells synchronize their discharge frequency into a unique beating rhythm across a wide range of heterogeneity and intercellular coupling values. However, an unanticipated behavior appeared under pathological conditions where perturbation of ionic currents led to reduced excitability. Under these conditions, an intermediate range of intercellular coupling (900–4000 MΩ) was beneficial to SAN automaticity, enabling a very small portion of tissue (3.4%) to drive propagation, with propagation failure occurring at both lower and higher resistances. This protective effect of intercellular coupling and heterogeneity, seen in both human and rabbit tissues, highlights the remarkable resilience of the SAN. Overall, the model presented in this work allowed insight into how spontaneous beating of the SAN tissue may be preserved in the face of perturbations that can cause individual cells to lose automaticity. The simulations suggest that certain degrees of gap junctional coupling protect the SAN from ionic perturbations that can be caused by drugs or mutations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictive factors for hypothyroidy after hemithyroidectomy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hemithyroidectomy is one of the most common procedures performed. It is used to treat patients with benign unilateral nodules. Hemithyroidectomy results in fewer risks of hypothyroidism and the need for thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The present study was designed to identify potential clinicopathologic risk factors associated with the onset of biochemical hypothyroidism. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent hemithyroidectomy between 2004 and 2019. Hypothyroidism was defined as a serum thyrotropin level greater than 5 mIU/L. The patients were analyzed for age, sex, preoperative and postoperative thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), state, side, and volume of the remaining lobe, and histologic diagnosis. Results: Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 30.8% of 214 patients. This complication appeared in the first year in 83.3% of the cases. A preoperative TSH level greater than 1.32 mIU/l, a remaining volume of the lobe less than 3 ml, and the presence of thyroiditis were associated with a significant increase in the risk of developing hypothyroidism (p<0.01). There were no significant differences in age, sex, state, and side of the remaining lobe. The mean thyroxine dose was 57 ± 26 micrograms. Conclusions: The risk of hypothyroidism after hemithyroidectomy should be assessed prior to surgery. Close monitoring is recommended in patients at high risk of developing this complication. However, all patients who undergo hemithyroidectomy should be monitored at least for the first year.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cashew apple in Tanzania: status of utilization, challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Cashew apples, although widely available and rich in nutrients are still underutilized after harvest in Tanzania. Approximately 2,327,000 metric tonnes of cashew apples are lost each year. Their counterpart, the cashew nut is highly appreciated and successfully contributes to the national economy. The huge underutilization of cashew apples is a challenge that requires urgent attention in order to achieve both national and global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Improvement of the cashew apple sector could have a positive impact on global SDGs 1, 2, and 3 targets of no poverty, zero hunger, and good health and well-being respectively. At national level, this sector could contribute to the goals of the Tanzania Development Vision (TDV) 2025, namely: high quality livelihood, particularly food self-sufficiency and food security; and a strong and competitive economy, particularly a diversified and semi-industrialized economy with a substantial industrial sector comparable to typical middle-income countries. In addition, the country’s Third Five Year Development Plan III (FYDP III) 2021/22 – 2025/26 has established key strategic interventions, notably those related to competitive industrialization, energy, and food and nutrition security to ultimately achieve the goals of the TDV 2025. To be effective, however, these strategic interventions require continued strong central and local government support and active involvement of stakeholders to ensure program effectiveness yielded towards efficient utilization of widely available natural resources such as cashew apples which has cross-cutting benefits in food, agriculture, health, energy, and economic perspectives. Therefore, the work provides evidence on the utilization status, challenges, and opportunities for sustainable development in Tanzania.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Nigerian youth and their positive attitude towards the national drive against the spread of COVID-19: A cross-sectional online survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The global impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)has led to the need to prioritise public health campaign by all stakeholders among diverse population groups. This study investigated the dispositions of Nigerian adolescents towards the prevention of the spread of COVID-19.  Methods: The young adolescents (n=1,529) included in this study, were between the ages of 15 and 26 years from Afe Babalola University. Students were contacted through their various colleges and residential hostels to complete the questionnaire via a shared link. All students included, voluntarily participated in this cross-sectional study by completing the adapted COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) questionnaire. The collected data were analysed to show the level of knowledge, attitude and preventative practices and also to test for significant association between gender and variables for the study. The study was conducted between March 23-April 25, 2021. Results: The outcome of the findings showed that students with families with 5-10 members showed significant association with knowledge accuracy on COVID-19 (χ2 = 6.077, p = 0.044). There was a significant association between gender and the need to report the suspected case of COVID-19 infection to the health authorities (χ2 = 14.075, p = 0.001) with more females likely to report a suspected case. More females (59.2%) were significantly (χ2 = 8.904, p = 0.012) involved in the practice of social distancing or home quarantine as a preventive measure. Conclusions: This study showed evidence of high prevalence of knowledge related to COVID-19 in majority of the study participants. This is a pointer to the efficacy and success of present public health campaigns in Nigeria.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anti-angiogenic effect of the combination of low-dose sorafenib and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Sorafenib is a standard drug used for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma but is often resistant and toxic. Its combination with epigallo-3-catechin gallate leads to reduced resistance and toxicity but an equally effective anti-angiogenic effect.Therefore, this study aims to assess the anti-angiogenic effect of standard-dose Sorafenib compared to the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate. Methods:  We conducted an animal study and double-blind, randomized controlled trials. A total of 25 male Wistar rats (7-weeks-old) were randomly divided into four groups, namely Sham (K), Control (O), a combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate group (X1), and standard-dose Sorafenib group (X2). All groups were injected with N-Nitrosodiethylamine 70 mg/kg body weight (BW) intraperitoneally for ten weeks, except the Sham group. After the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, X1 and X2 were treated for two weeks. Subsequently, liver tissues were examined for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level and microvascular density expression. Results: There was a significant difference (p=0.007) in the level of VEGF between group X1 (low dose Sorafenib + EGCG) and X2 (Standard dose Sorafenib). However, the differences in VEGF levels of group X1 and X2 compared to group O(Control) were significantly lower, with values p=0.000136 and p=0.019, respectively. The expression of microvascular density between groups X1 and X2  was not entirely different. Meanwhile, a significant difference (p<0.05) was discovered when both groups were compared with the control group. Conclusion: The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with epigallo-3-catechin gallate is superior in reducing the level of VEGF compared to standard-dose Sorafenib and is better than the control. Standard-dose Sorafenib and the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate have similar effectivity in reducing the expression of microvascular density and could prevent resistance and lower toxicity effects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of the effects of therapeutic exercise with either an educational booklet or vitamin-D3 supplement in the management of chronic low back pain: study protocol for an assessor blinded multicenter randomized clinical trial [version 1; peer review:</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is important to know the best intervention approach to replenish serum vitamin D levels along with therapeutic interventions for chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. From the researcher’s knowledge, no study compared “vitamin D supplement” or “booklet education on sun exposure, nutrition and lifestyle” with therapeutic exercise for CLBP cases. Researchers hypothesize that multidimensional comprehensive management of therapeutic exercise and an education booklet (TEB) on sun exposure, nutrition, and lifestyle might be superior to therapeutic exercise and oral vitamin D supplement (TED) for CLBP patients with vitamin D deficiency. Methods: We planned for an assessor-blinded two-arm multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) protocol to compare the efficacy of TEB compared to TED for CLBP patients with vitamin D deficiency at 2 months and 6 months after baseline recruitment in designated centers in Dhaka city. The primary outcome measures will include pain by Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and serum vitamin D3 level and secondary outcome measures will include disability by Ronald Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Discussion: This study will provide evidence for an appropriate prescription for the management of CLBP patients having vitamin D deficiency. Registration: Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2022/11/047074).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution and regulation of microbial secondary metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Microbes have disproportionate impacts on the macroscopic world. This is in part due to their ability to grow to large populations that collectively secrete massive amounts of secondary metabolites and alter their environment. Yet, the conditions favoring secondary metabolism despite the potential costs for primary metabolism remain unclear. Here we investigated the biosurfactants that the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> makes and secretes to decrease the surface tension of surrounding liquid. Using a combination of genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and mathematical modeling we show that the ability to make surfactants from glycerol varies inconsistently across the phylogenetic tree; instead, lineages that lost this ability are also worse at reducing the oxidative stress of primary metabolism on glycerol. Experiments with different carbon sources support a link with oxidative stress that explains the inconsistent distribution across the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> phylogeny and suggests a general principle: <i>P. aeruginosa</i> lineages produce surfactants if they can reduce the oxidative stress produced by primary metabolism and have excess resources, beyond their primary needs, to afford secondary metabolism. These results add a new layer to the regulation of a secondary metabolite unessential for primary metabolism but important to change physical properties of the environments surrounding bacterial populations.

                Detection of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors has been explained by the presence of T cells primed by other coronaviruses. However, based on the relative high frequency and prevalence of cross-reactive T cells, we hypothesized CMV may induce these cross-reactive T cells. Stimulation of pre-pandemic cryo-preserved PBMCs with SARS-CoV-2 peptides revealed that frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were higher in CMV-seropositive donors. Characterization of these T cells demonstrated that membrane-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells originate from cross-reactive CMV-specific T cells. Spike-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide FVSNGTHWF (FVS) and dissimilar CMV pp65 peptide IPSINVHHY (IPS) presented by HLA-B*35:01. These dual IPS/FVS-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were found in multiple donors as well as severe COVID-19 patients and shared a common T cell receptor (TCR), illustrating that IPS/FVS-cross-reactivity is caused by a public TCR. In conclusion, CMV-specific T cells cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, despite low sequence homology between the two viruses, and may contribute to the pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Collateral deletion of the mitochondrial AAA+ ATPase ATAD1 sensitizes cancer cells to proteasome dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                The tumor suppressor gene <i>PTEN</i> is the second most commonly deleted gene in cancer. Such deletions often include portions of the chromosome 10q23 locus beyond the bounds of <i>PTEN</i> itself, which frequently disrupts adjacent genes. Coincidental loss of <i>PTEN</i>-adjacent genes might impose vulnerabilities that could either affect patient outcome basally or be exploited therapeutically. Here we describe how the loss of <i>ATAD1</i>, which is adjacent to and frequently co-deleted with <i>PTEN</i>, predisposes cancer cells to apoptosis triggered by proteasome dysfunction and correlates with improved survival in cancer patients. ATAD1 directly and specifically extracts the pro-apoptotic protein BIM from mitochondria to inactivate it. Cultured cells and mouse xenografts lacking ATAD1 are hypersensitive to clinically used proteasome inhibitors, which activate BIM and trigger apoptosis. This work furthers our understanding of mitochondrial protein homeostasis and could lead to new therapeutic options for the hundreds of thousands of cancer patients who have tumors with chromosome 10q23 deletion.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">m6A modification of U6 snRNA modulates usage of two major classes of pre-mRNA 5' splice site</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing of messenger RNAs is associated with the evolution of developmentally complex eukaryotes. Splicing is mediated by the spliceosome, and docking of the pre-mRNA 5' splice site into the spliceosome active site depends upon pairing with the conserved ACAGA sequence of U6 snRNA. In some species, including humans, the central adenosine of the ACAGA box is modified by <i>N<sup>6</sup></i> methylation, but the role of this m<sup>6</sup>A modification is poorly understood. Here we show that m<sup>6</sup>A modified U6 snRNA determines the accuracy and efficiency of splicing. We reveal that the conserved methyltransferase, FIO1, is required for Arabidopsis U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification. Arabidopsis <i>fio1</i> mutants show disrupted patterns of splicing that can be explained by the sequence composition of 5' splice sites and cooperative roles for U5 and U6 snRNA in splice site selection. U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A influences 3' splice site usage. We generalise these findings to reveal two major classes of 5' splice site in diverse eukaryotes, which display anti-correlated interaction potential with U5 snRNA loop 1 and the U6 snRNA ACAGA box. We conclude that U6 snRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification contributes to the selection of degenerate 5' splice sites crucial to alternative splicing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SRSF6 balances mitochondrial-driven innate immune outcomes through alternative splicing of BAX</a></h4>

              
                To mount a protective response to infection while preventing hyperinflammation, gene expression in innate immune cells must be tightly regulated. Despite the importance of pre-mRNA splicing in shaping the proteome, its role in balancing immune outcomes remains understudied. Transcriptomic analysis of murine macrophage cell lines identified Serine/Arginine Rich Splicing factor 6 (SRSF6) as a gatekeeper of mitochondrial homeostasis. SRSF6-dependent orchestration of mitochondrial health is directed in large part by alternative splicing of the pro-apoptosis pore-forming protein BAX. Loss of SRSF6 promotes accumulation of BAX-k, a variant that sensitizes macrophages to undergo cell death and triggers upregulation of interferon stimulated genes through cGAS sensing of cytosolic mitochondrial DNA. Upon pathogen sensing, macrophages regulate SRSF6 expression to control the liberation of immunogenic mtDNA and adjust the threshold for entry into programmed cell death. This work defines BAX alternative splicing by SRSF6 as a critical node not only in mitochondrial homeostasis, but also in the macrophage’s response to pathogens.

                The clinical and largely unpredictable heterogeneity of phenotypes in patients with mitochondrial disorders demonstrates the ongoing challenges in the understanding of this semi-autonomous organelle in biology and disease. Previously, we used the gene-breaking transposon to create 1200 transgenic zebrafish strains tagging protein-coding genes (<i>1</i>), including the <i>lrpprc</i> locus. Here we present and characterize a new genetic revertible animal model that recapitulates components of Leigh Syndrome French Canadian Type (LSFC), a mitochondrial disorder that includes diagnostic liver dysfunction. LSFC is caused by allelic variations in the <i>LRPPRC</i> gene, involved in mitochondrial mRNA polyadenylation and translation. <i>lrpprc</i> zebrafish homozygous mutants displayed biochemical and mitochondrial phenotypes similar to clinical manifestations observed in patients, including dysfunction in lipid homeostasis. We were able to rescue these phenotypes in the disease model using a liver-specific genetic model therapy, functionally demonstrating a previously under-recognized critical role for the liver in the pathophysiology of this disease.

                As an organism ages, its health-state is determined by a balance between the processes of damage and repair. Measuring these processes requires longitudinal data. We extract damage and repair transition rates from repeated observations of binary health attributes in mice and humans to explore robustness and resilience, which respectively represent resisting or recovering from damage. We assess differences in robustness and resilience using changes in damage rates and repair rates of binary health attributes. We find a conserved decline with age in robustness and resilience in mice and humans, implying that both contribute to worsening aging health – as assessed by the frailty index (FI). A decline in robustness, however, has a greater effect than a decline in resilience on the accelerated increase of the FI with age, and a greater association with reduced survival. We also find that deficits are damaged and repaired over a wide range of timescales ranging from the shortest measurement scales towards organismal lifetime timescales. We explore the effect of systemic interventions that have been shown to improve health, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and voluntary exercise for mice. We have also explored the correlations with household wealth for humans. We find that these interventions and factors can affect both damage and repair rates, and hence robustness and resilience, in age and sex-dependent manners.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning Fast and Slow: Increased cortical plasticity leads to memory interference and enhanced hippocampal-cortical interactions</a></h4>

              
                Our brain is continuously challenged by daily experiences. Thus, how to avoid systematic erasing of previously encoded memories? While it has been proposed that a dual-learning system with "slow" learning in the cortex and "fast" learning in the hippocampus could protect previous knowledge from interference, this has never been observed in the living organism. Here, we report that increasing plasticity via the viral-induced overexpression of RGS14414 in the prelimbic cortex leads to better one-trial memory, but that this comes at the price of increased interference in semantic-like memory. Indeed, electrophysiological recordings showed that this manipulation also resulted in shorter NonREM-sleep bouts, smaller delta-waves and decreased neuronal firing rates. In contrast, hippocampal-cortical interactions in form of theta coherence during wake and REM-sleep as well as oscillatory coupling during NonREM-sleep were enhanced. Thus, we provide the first experimental evidence for the long-standing and unproven fundamental idea that high thresholds for plasticity in the cortex protects preexisting memories and modulating these thresholds affects both memory encoding and consolidation mechanisms.

                Humans extract information from the key features of the physical word, namely space and time. However, while much is known about the neural processing of visuospatial patterns, there is little information on the hierarchical brain mechanisms underlying conscious recognition of auditory sequences extended over time and their associated prediction errors. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we studied the brain activity of 83 participants during recognition of original and varied auditory sequences. Results showed a network comprising auditory, ventro-medial prefrontal and inferior temporal cortices, hippocampus, and medial cingulate gyrus underlying sequence processing. The hierarchical pathway from auditory cortex to hippocampus and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex was associated with both originals and variations, but its temporal dynamics crucially differed. Recognition of original versus varied sequences elicited stronger gamma power. Our results complement the knowledge on neural processing of visuospatial patterns by providing the hierarchical brain mechanisms underlying auditory, temporal sequence recognition.

                Proper animal conditioning is a key factor in the quality and success of preclinical neuroimaging applications. We introduce an open-source easy-to modify multi-modal 3D printable design for rodent conditioning for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other imaging modalities. Our design can be used for brain imaging in anesthetized or awake mice and anesthetized rats. We show ease-of-use and reproducibility of subject conditioning with anatomical T2-weighted imaging for both mice and rats. We also demonstrate application of our design for awake fMRI in mice using both visual evoked potential and olfactory stimulation paradigms. In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed cradle design can be extended to multiple imaging modalities combining MRI, Positron emission tomography and X-ray computed tomography.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A shared neural code for the physics of actions and object events</a></h4>

              
                Observing others' actions recruits frontoparietal and posterior temporal brain regions - also called the action observation network. It is typically assumed that these regions support recognizing actions of animate entities (e.g., person jumping over a box). However, objects can also participate in events with rich meaning and structure (e.g., ball bouncing over a box). So far, it has not been clarified which brain regions encode information specific to goal-directed actions or more general information that also defines object events. Here, we revealed a shared neural code for visually presented actions and object events throughout the action observation network. We argue that this neural representation captures the structure and physics of events regardless of animacy. We find that lateral occipitotemporal cortex encodes information about events that is also invariant to stimulus modality. Our results shed new light onto the representational profiles of posterior temporal and frontoparietal cortices, and their roles in encoding event information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-resolution image reconstruction with latent diffusion models from human brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Reconstructing visual experiences from human brain activity offers a unique way to understand how the brain represents the world, and to interpret the connection between computer vision models and our visual system. While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector of image Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straightforward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-State fMRI reveals Longitudinal Alterations in Brain Network Connectivity in a Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease is an autosomal, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of the CAG repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. Neuronal degeneration and dysfunction that precedes regional atrophy result in the impairment of striatal and cortical circuits that affect the brain's large-scale network functionality. However, the evolution of these disease-driven, large-scale connectivity alterations is still poorly understood. Here we used resting-state fMRI to investigate functional connectivity changes in a mouse model of Huntington's disease in several relevant brain networks and how they are affected at different ages that follow a disease-like phenotypic progression. Towards this, we used the heterozygous (HET) form of the zQ175DN Huntington's disease mouse model that recapitulates aspects of human disease pathology. Seed- and Region-based analyses were performed at different ages, on 3-, 6-, 10-, and 12-month-old HET and age-matched wild-type mice. Our results demonstrate decreased connectivity starting at 6 months of age, most prominently in regions such as the retrosplenial and cingulate cortices, pertaining to the default mode-like network and auditory and visual cortices, part of the associative cortical network. At 12 months, we observe a shift towards decreased connectivity in regions such as the somatosensory cortices, pertaining to the lateral cortical network, and the caudate putamen, a constituent of the subcortical network. Moreover, we assessed the impact of distinct Huntington's Disease-like pathology of the zQ175DN HET mice on age-dependent connectivity between different brain regions and networks where we demonstrate that connectivity strength follows a nonlinear, inverted U-shape pattern, a well-known phenomenon of development and normal aging. Conversely, the neuropathologically driven alteration of connectivity, especially in the default mode and associative cortical networks, showed diminished age-dependent evolution of functional connectivity. These findings reveal that in this Huntington's disease model, altered connectivity starts with cortical network aberrations which precede striatal connectivity changes, which appear only at a later age. Taken together, these results suggest that the age-dependent cortical network dysfunction seen in rodents could represent a relevant pathological process in Huntington's disease progression.

	<p>The complex structure of the brain supports high-order cognition, which is crucial for mastering chess. Surface-based measures, including the fractional dimension (FD) and gyrification index (GI), may be more sensitive in detecting cortical changes relative to volumetric indexes. For this reason, structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 29 chess experts and 29 novice participants were analyzed using the CAT12 toolbox. FD and GI for each brain region were compared between the groups. A multivariate model was used to identify surface-based brain measures that can predict chess expertise. In chess experts, FD is increased in the left frontal operculum (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), and this change correlates with the starting age of chess practice (&amp;amp;rho; = &amp;amp;minus;0.54, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). FD is decreased in the right superior parietal lobule (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Chess expertise is predicted by the FD in a network of fronto-parieto-temporal regions and is associated with GI changes in the middle cingulate gyrus (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and the superior temporal sulcus (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Our findings add to the evidence that chess expertise is based on the complex properties of the brain surface of a network of transmodal association areas important for flexible high-level cognitive functions. Interestingly, these changes are associated with long-lasting practice, suggesting that neuroplastic effects develop over time.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. As acute stroke patients often lose decision-making capacity, acute management is fraught with complicated decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment (LST). We aimed to explore (1) the perspectives and experiences of clinicians regarding the use of predictive scores for LST decision making in severe acute stroke, and (2) clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; awareness of their own cognitive biases in this context. Methods: Four focus groups (FGs) were conducted with 21 physicians (13 residents and 8 attending physicians); two FGs in a university hospital and two in a regional hospital in French-speaking Switzerland. Discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed thematically. Two of the four transcripts were double coded to establish coding framework consistency. Results: Participants reported that predictive tools were not routinely used after severe stroke, although most knew about such scores. Scores were reported as being useful in quantifying prognosis, advancing scientific evidence, and minimizing potential biases in decisions. Their use is, however, limited by the following barriers: perception of inaccuracy, general disbelief in scoring, fear of self-fulfilling prophecy, and preference for clinical judgement. Emotional and cognitive biases were common. Emotional biases distort clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; knowledge and are notably: bias of personal values, negative experience, and cultural bias. Cognitive biases, such as availability, confirmation, and anchoring biases, that produce systematic deviations from rational thinking, were also identified. Conclusions: The results highlight opportunities to improve decision making in severe stroke through the promotion of predictive tools, strategies for communicating prognostic uncertainty, and minimizing cognitive biases among clinicians, in order to promote goal-concordant care.</p>

	<p>Sexualized substance use (SSU) is the practice of psychotropic substance use before or during sex to increase sexual pleasure. The growing use of SSU has a strong association with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Community health mobilizers (CHMs) are agents who assist in decreasing the global burden of disease in the communities they serve. They work as unit managers, counselors, or field workers. The managers and counselors have a minimum of a bachelor&amp;amp;rsquo;s degree, and field workers have a minimum of a higher secondary education. This study aimed to qualitatively assess the knowledge gaps regarding SSU among CHMs. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted in New Delhi, India with nineteen CHMs. Majority of the CHMs were men (n = 9, 47%) followed by transgender (TG) persons (TG females n = 5, 26.3%; TG males n = 1, 5.2%), and women (n = 4, 21.1%). Knowledge gaps were identified among the CHMs regarding different types of sexualized substances, drug procurement, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection prevention, and complex health issues associated with SSU. It suggested the need for periodic workshops and training for upgradation of existing knowledge and practices among the CHMs. This formative research may help social scientists to develop protocols for conducting multi-centric, community-based studies across the country for further validation and exploration.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improved high-dimensional multivariate autoregressive model estimation of human electrophysiological data using fMRI priors</a></h4>

              
                Multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model estimation enables assessment of causal interactions in brain networks. However, accurately estimating MVAR models for high-dimensional electrophysiological recordings is challenging due to the extensive data requirements. Hence, the applicability of MVAR models for study of brain behavior over hundreds of recording sites has been very limited. Prior work has focused on different strategies for selecting a subset of important MVAR coefficients in the model and is motivated by the potential of MVAR models and the data requirements of conventional least-squares estimation algorithms. Here we propose incorporating prior information, such as fMRI, into MVAR model estimation using a weighted group LASSO regularization strategy. The proposed approach is shown to reduce data requirements by a factor of two relative to the recently proposed group LASSO method of Endemann et al. (2022) while resulting in models that are both more parsimonious and have higher fidelity to the ground truth. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using simulation studies of physiologically realistic MVAR models derived from iEEG data. The robustness of the approach to deviations between the conditions under which the prior information and iEEG data is obtained is illustrated using models from data collected in different sleep stages. This approach will allow accurate effective connectivity analyses over short time scales, facilitating investigations of causal interactions in the brain underlying perception and cognition during rapid transitions in behavioral state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stability of neural representations in the auditory midbrain across the lifespan despite age-related brainstem delays</a></h4>

              
                The extent to which aging of the central auditory pathway impairs auditory perception in the elderly independent of peripheral cochlear decline is debated. To cause auditory deficits in normal hearing elderly, central aging needs to degrade neural sound representations at some point along the auditory pathway. However, inaccessible to psychophysical methods, the level of the auditory pathway at which aging starts to effectively degrade neural sound representations remains poorly differentiated. Here we tested how potential age-related changes in the auditory brainstem affect the stability of spatiotemporal multiunit complex speech-like sound representations in the auditory midbrain of old normal hearing CBA/J mice. Although brainstem conduction speed slowed down in old mice, the change was limited to the sub-millisecond range and only minimally affected temporal processing in the midbrain (i.e. gaps-in-noise sensitivity). Importantly, besides the small delay, multiunit complex temporal sound representations in the auditory midbrain did not differ between young and old mice. This shows that although small age-related neural effects in simple sound parameters in the lower brainstem may be present in aging they do not effectively deteriorate complex neural population representations at the level of the auditory midbrain when peripheral hearing remains normal. This result challenges the widespread belief of pure central auditory decline as an automatic consequence of aging. However, the stability of midbrain processing in aging emphasizes the role of undetected 'hidden' peripheral damage and accumulating effects in higher cortical auditory-cognitive processing explaining perception deficits in 'normal hearing' elderly.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Switching state-space modeling of neural signal dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Linear parametric state-space models are a ubiquitous tool for analyzing neural time series data, providing a way to characterize the underlying brain dynamics with much greater statistical efficiency than non-parametric data analysis approaches. However, neural time series data are frequently non-stationary, exhibiting rapid changes in dynamics, with transient activity that is often the key feature of interest in the data. Stationary methods can be adapted to time-varying scenarios by employing fixed-duration windows under an assumption of quasi-stationarity. But time-varying dynamics can be explicitly modeled by switching state-space models, i.e., by using a pool of state-space models with different properties selected by a probabilistic switching process. Unfortunately, unlike linear state-space models, exact solutions for state inference and parameter learning with switching state-space models are intractable. Here we derive a solution to the inference problem for a general probabilistic switching state-space framework based on a variational approximation on the joint posterior distribution of the underlying states and the switching process. We then use this state-inference solution within a generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the model parameters of the linear state-space models and the switching process. We perform extensive simulations in different settings to benchmark the performance of our method against existing switching inference methods. We also demonstrate the robustness of our switching inference to characterize dynamics outside the generative switching model class. In addition, we introduce a novel initialization strategy for the expectation step of the generalized EM algorithm using a leave-one-out strategy to compare among candidate models, which significantly improves performance compared to existing switching methods that employ deterministic annealing. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method for the problem of sleep spindle detection, showing how switching state-space models can be used to detect and extract transient spindles from human sleep electroencephalograms in an unsupervised manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generation of a hybrid AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F xThy1-GCaMP6s+/- Alzheimer disease mouse mitigates the behavioral and hippocampal encoding deficits of APP knock-in mutations of AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice</a></h4>

              
                In contrast to most transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD), knock-in mice expressing familial AD-linked mutations of the amyloid precursor protein (App) gene exhibit stereotypical age-dependent amyloid beta (A{beta}) pathology and cognitive impairment without physiologically unrealistic App overexpression. This study investigated the effect of familial AD-linked App mutations on hippocampal CA1 neuronal activity and function. To enable calcium imaging of neuronal activity, AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in (APPki) mice were crossed with Thy1-GCaMP6s+/- (C-TG) mice to generate AppNL-G-F/NL-G-FxThy1-GCaMP6s+/- (A-TG) mice, which were characterized at 12 months of age. A-TG mice exhibited A{beta} pathology in the hippocampus. In several configurations of an air-induced running task, A-TG mice and C-TG mice were equally successful in learning to run or to stay immobile. In the Morris water place test, A-TG mice were impaired, but learned the task. Comparisons of hippocampal CA1 neuronal activity in the air-induced running task showed that A-TG mice displayed neuronal hypoactivity both during movement and immobility. A-TG mice and C-TG CA1 neuronal encoding of distance or time in the air induced running task were not different. These results suggest that knock-in of familial AD-linked mutations in A-TG mice results in A{beta} pathology, neuronal hypoactivity, and cognitive impairment without severely affecting CA1 neuronal encoding. In comparison to APPki mice, A-TG mice had less severe AD-like memory impairments at 12 months of age (Saito et al., 2014; Mehla et al., 2019), suggesting that the disease onset was delayed in A-TG mice. The effect of APP mutations may have been mitigated through genetic mechanisms when APPKi mice were crossed with C-TG mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterisation and automated quantification of induced seizure-related behaviours in Xenopus laevis tadpoles</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy, a clinical diagnosis characterized by paroxysmal episodes known as seizures, affects 1% of people worldwide. An estimated 30% of patients continue to have seizures even on medication, and adverse effects are common. Safe and patient-specific treatment is vital and can be achieved by the development of rapid pre-clinical models of for identified epilepsy genes. Epilepsy can result from either brain injury or gene mutations, and can also be induced chemically. Xenopus laevis tadpoles could be a useful model for confirmation of variants of unknown significance found in epilepsy patients, and for drug re-purposing screens that could eventually lead to benefits for patients. Here, we characterise and quantify seizure-related behaviours in X. laevis tadpoles arrayed in 24-well plates. To provoke acute seizure behaviours, tadpoles were chemically induced with either pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). To test the capacity to adapt this method for drug testing, we also exposed induced tadpoles to the anti-seizure drug valproate (VPA). Four induced seizure-like behaviours were described and manually quantified, and two of these (darting, circling) could be accurately detected automatically, using the video analysis software TopScan. Additionally, we recorded swimming trajectories and mean swimming velocity. Automatic detection showed that either PTZ or 4-AP induced darting behaviour and increased mean swimming velocity compared to untreated controls. Both parameters were significantly reduced in the presence of VPA. In particular, darting behaviour was a shown to be a sensitive measure of epileptic seizure activity. While we could not automatically detect the full range of seizure behaviours, this method shows promise for future studies, since X. laevis is a well-characterised and genetically tractable model organism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">THE ROLE OF ALPHA- AND BETA-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS ONCOMPULSION-LIKE ALCOHOL DRINKING</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) is characterized by compulsion-like alcohol drinking (CLAD), and this intake despite negative consequences can be a major clinical obstacle. With the quite limited treatment options available for AUD, there is a significant and critical unmet need for novel therapies. The noradrenergic system is an important hub for the stress response as well as maladaptive drives for alcohol, and pre-clinical (including our own) and clinical studies have shown that drugs targeting the 1 adrenenergic receptors (ARs) may represent a pharmacological treatment for pathological drinking. However, the involvement of {beta} ARs for treating human drinking AUD has received somewhat scant investigation, and we sought to provide pre-clinical validation for possible AR utility for CLAD. Thus, we first examined whether {beta} AR antagonist propranolol, betaxolol ({beta}1), and ICI, 118 551 ({beta}2) impacted compulsion-like intake and alcohol-only drinking (AOD) in male Wistar rats through systemic injections. The systemic highest dose of propranolol (10mg/kg) reduced both AOD and CLAD. 5mg/kg propranolol affected CLAD more than AOD, with no effects of 2.5mg/kg. Similar to propranolol, betaxolol also only decreased CLAD at the lower dose (2.5mg/kg). ICI 118.551 had no effects, suggesting propranolol regulates alcohol intake through {beta}1. Also, while AR compounds might have utility for AUD, these compounds can also lead to undesirable cardiovascular system side effects; thus, any strategy incorporating lower doses of these compounds to reduce drinking could have broad utility. Importantly, here we found that a combination of ineffective doses of 2 propranolol and prazosin administrated together did reduce both CLAD and AOD. Finally, we investigated the effect of propranolol and betaxolol into two brain areas related to pathological drinking, the anterior insula (aINS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Surprisingly, propranolol (1-10g) in aINS or mPFC did not affect CLAD or AOD (although with a trend for aINS betaxolol to impact CLAD), suggesting propranolol regulation of alcohol drinking through a target other than aINS and mPFC. Together, our findings provide new pharmacological insights into noradrenergic regulation of alcohol consumption, which may inform AUD therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mesoscopic patterns of functional connectivity alterations in autism by contrast subgraphs</a></h4>

              
                Despite the breakthrough achievements in understanding structural and functional connectivity alterations that underlie autism spectrum disorder (ASD), the exact nature and type of such alterations are not yet clear due to conflicting reports of hyper-connectivity, hypo-connectivity, and --in some cases-- combinations of both. In this work, we approach the debate about hyper- vs hypo-connectivity in ASD using a novel network comparison technique designed to capture mesoscopic-scale differential structures. In particular, we build on recent algorithmic advances in the sparsification of functional connectivity matrices, in the extraction of contrast subgraphs, and in the computation of statistically significant maximal frequent itemsets, and develop a method to identify mesoscale structural subgraphs that are maximally dense and different in terms of connectivity levels between the different sets of networks. We apply our method to analyse brain networks of typically developed individuals and ASD patients across different developmental phases and find a set of altered cortical-subcortical circuits between healthy subjects and patients affected by ASD. Specifically, our analysis highlights in ASD patients a significantly larger number of functional connections among regions of the occipital cortex and between the left precuneus and the superior parietal gyrus. At the same time, reduced connectivity characterised the superior frontal gyrus and the temporal lobe regions. More importantly, we can simultaneously detect regions of the brain that show hyper and hypo-connectivity in ASD in children and adolescents, recapitulating within a single framework multiple previous separate observations.

	<p>The present review aims to explore the use of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in the treatment of visual perception in Unilateral Spatial Neglect (USN) after a stroke. PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Pedro databases were searched, from inception to 1 February 2022. All studies that investigated the effect of IVR on USN, such as outcome in the stroke population, have been included. The current comprehensive systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations and was registered in the PROSPERO database [CRD42022311284]. Methodological quality was assessed through JBI critical appraisal tool. A total of 436 articles were identified through the database searches. A total of 10 articles, with a heterogeneous study design, which involved 77 patients with USN with low-to-moderate methodological quality, have been selected. Five out the included studies tested usability of IVR for assessed or treated visual perception deficits in USN, comparing the results with 134 healthy subjects. In the rest of studies that tested IVR such as treatment, three showed statistical positive results (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in visual perception outcome. To date, the literature has suggested the potential benefits in the use of IVR for the treatment of visual perception disorders in USN. Interestingly, IVR motivates patients during the rehabilitation process improving compliance and interest. The heterogeneity in the studies&amp;amp;rsquo; design and in IVR treatments indicate the need of future investigations in the consideration of potentiality and low-cost of this technology.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease aged 75 years and older. Methods: From March 2013 to June 2021, 27 patients with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (&amp;amp;ge;75 years old) who underwent DBS surgery at the First Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital were selected. The Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale Part 3 (UPDRS-III), 39-item Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living (BI) scores were used to evaluate motor function and quality of life before surgery and during on and off periods of DBS at 1 year post operation and at the final follow-up. A series of non-motor scales were used to evaluate sleep, cognition, and mood, and the levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was also assessed. Adverse events related to surgery were noted. Results: The average follow-up time was 55.08 (21&amp;amp;ndash;108) months. Symptoms were significantly improved at 1 year post operation. The median UPDRS-III score decreased from 35 points (baseline) to 19 points (improvement of 45.7%) in the stimulation-on period at 1 year post operation (t = 19.230, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and to 32 points (improvement of 8.6%) at the final follow-up (t = 3.456, p = 0.002). In the stimulation-off period, the median score of UPDRS-III increased from 35 points to 39 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;11.4%) at 1 year post operation (Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.030, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and 45 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;28.6%) at the final follow-up (Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.207, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The PDQ-39 overall scores decreased from 88 points (baseline) to 55 points (improvement of 37.5%) in the stimulation-on period at 1 year post operation (t = 11.390, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and 81 points (improvement of 8.0%) at the final follow-up (t = 2.142, p = 0.044). In the stimulation-off period, the median PDQ-39 score increased from 88 points to 99 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;12.5%) at the final follow-up (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.801, p = 0.005). The ADL-Barthel Index score increased from 25 points (baseline) to 75 points (improvement of 66.7%) at 1 year post operation (Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.205, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and to 35 points (improvement of 28.6%) at the final follow-up (Z = &amp;amp;minus;4.034, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In the stimulation-off period, BI scores decreased from 25 points to 15 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;40%) at 1 year post operation (Z = &amp;amp;minus;3.225, p = 0.01) and to 15 points (deterioration of &amp;amp;minus;40%) at the final follow-up (Z = &amp;amp;minus;3.959, p = 0.001). Sleep, cognition, and mood were slightly improved at 1 year post operation (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and LEDD was reduced from 650 mg (baseline) to 280 mg and 325 mg at 1 year post operation and the final follow-up, respectively (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). One patient had a cortical hemorrhage in the puncture tract on day 2 after surgery, five patients had hallucinations in the acute stage after surgery, and one patient had an exposed left-brain electrode lead at 4 months post operation; there were no infections or death. Conclusion: DBS showed efficacy and safety in treating older patients (&amp;amp;ge;75 years old) with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Motor function, quality of life, activities of daily living, LEDD, and sleep all showed long-term improvements with DBS; short-term improvements in emotional and cognitive function were also noted.</p>

	<p>Patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) seropositive for autoantibodies against nodal and paranodal proteins display distinct clinical presentations. In the latest study, CIDP with autoantibodies against paranodal proteins was defined as autoimmune nodopathy (AN). We herein present a case of 39-year-old male with anti- neurofascin (NF) 155 and NF186 IgG4 antibody with gait disturbance and tremor, who was followed up for 4 months and demonstrated clinical improvements after apparently effective rituximab therapy. In addition, a literature review was conducted to investigate the clinical characteristics of anti-NF155/NF186-positive AN.</p>

	<p>Previous research reported significant relationship between Big Five personality traits and aggression in both adolescent&amp;amp;rsquo;s and adult population. However, it is unclear about whether similar connection exist in early age. This study investigated how personality traits and family environment influence the development of aggression in school aged Saudi children. A sample of 315 school going children were recruited voluntarily to complete a set of measures examining Big Five personality factors, family environment and aggression. Correlation analysis were employed to evaluate association between Big Five personality traits, family environment and aggression. The results showed a significant relationship of Big Five personality factors and family environment factors to aggression. The findings of the study revealed that amongst the Big Five personality traits conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism were strongest antecedents of childhood aggression. Family environment characterized by family cohesion, expressiveness and conflict were appeared to be significant antecedents of aggressive behavior in children. This study expands our knowledge about the intervention strategies of aggression from Big Five traits and family environment perspectives.</p>

	<p>The aim of this review is to draw attention to neurosurgical approaches for treating chronic and opioid-resistant pain. In a first chapter, an up-to-date overview of the main pathophysiological mechanisms of pain has been carried out, with special emphasis on the details in which the surgical treatment is based. In a second part, the principal indications and results of different surgical approaches are reviewed. Cordotomy, Myelotomy, DREZ lesions, Trigeminal Nucleotomy, Mesencephalotomy, and Cingulotomy are revisited. Ablative procedures have a limited role in the management of chronic non-cancer pain, but they continues to help patients with refractory cancer-related pain. Another ablation lesion has been named and excluded, due to lack of current relevance. Peripheral Nerve, Spine Cord, and the principal possibilities of Deep Brain and Motor Cortex Stimulation are also revisited. Regarding electrical neuromodulation, patient selection remains a challenge.</p>

	<p>Events linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) influence psychological and physical health through the generation, exacerbation, and maintenance of symptoms such as anxiety, hyperarousal, and avoidance. Depending upon circumstance, traumatic events may also contribute to the onset of tinnitus, post-traumatic headache, and memory problems. PTSD should be considered a psychological injury, andwhile tinnitus is a symptom, its onset and sound quality may be connected in memory to the injury, thereby evincingthe capacity to exacerbate the trauma&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects. The myriad attributes, psychological and mechanistic, shared by tinnitus and PTSD offer tinnitus investigators the opportunity to draw from the rich and long-practiced strategies implemented for trauma counseling. Mechanisms and interventions understood through the lens of traumatic exposures may inform the clinical management of tinnitus disorder, and future studies may assess the effect of PTSD intervention on co-occurring conditions. This brief summary considered literature from both the hearing and trauma disciplines, with the goal of reviewing mechanisms shared between tinnitus and PTSD, as well as clinical reports supporting mutual reinforcement of both their symptoms and the effects of therapeutic approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A managed care system with telemedicine support for neurological emergencies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Telemedicine is frequently used to provide remote neurological expertise for acute stroke workup and was associated with better functional outcomes when combined with a stroke unit system-of-care. We investigated whether such system-of-care yields additional benefits when implemented on top of neurological competence already available onsite.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Quality improvement measures were implemented within a "hub-and-spoke" teleneurology network in 11 hospitals already provided with onsite or telestroke expertise. Measures included dedicated units for neurological emergencies, standardization of procedures, multiprofessional training, and quality-of-care monitoring. Intervention effects were investigated in a controlled study enrolling patients insured at three participating statutory health insurances diagnosed with acute stroke or other neurological emergencies. Outcomes during the intervention period between November 2017 and February 2020 were compared with those pre-intervention between October 2014 and March 2017. To control for temporal trends, we compared outcomes of patients with respective diagnoses in 11 hospitals of the same region. Primary outcome was the composite of up-to-90-day death, new disability with the need of ambulatory or nursing home care, expressed by adjusted hazard ratio (aHR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 1,418 patients post-implementation (55% female, mean age 76.7±12.8y) and 2,306 patients pre-implementation (56%, 75.8±13.0y, respectively). The primary outcome occurred in 479/1,418 (33.8%) patients post-implementation and in 829/2,306 (35.9%) pre-implementation. Adjusted HR for the primary outcome was 0.89 (95%-CI: 0.79–0.99, p=0.04) with no improvement seen in non-participating hospitals between post- versus pre-implementation periods (aHR 1.04; 95%-CI: 0.95–1.15).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Implementation of a multicomponent system-of-care was associated with a lower risk of poor outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Dimethyl fumarate delays multiple sclerosis in radiologically isolated syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) represents the earliest detectable pre-clinical phase of multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the impact of therapeutic intervention in preventing first symptom manifestation at this stage in the disease spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study involving people with RIS. Individuals without clinical symptoms typical of MS but with incidental brain MRI anomalies consistent with CNS demyelination were included. Within 12 MS centers in the U.S., participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to oral dimethyl fumarate (DMF) 240mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was the time to onset of clinical symptoms attributable to a CNS demyelinating event within a follow-up period of 96 weeks. An intention-to-treat analysis was applied to all participating individuals in the primary and safety investigations. The study is registered at <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, NCT02739542 (ARISE).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants from 12 centers were recruited from March 9, 2016 to October 31, 2019 with 44 people randomized to dimethyl fumarate and 43 to placebo. Following DMF treatment, the risk of a first clinical demyelinating event during the 96-week study period was highly reduced in the unadjusted Cox proportional-hazards regression model (hazard ratio (HR)=0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.05-0.63, p=0.007). More moderate adverse reactions were present in the DMF (34 (32%)) than placebo groups (19 (21%)) but severe events were similar (DMF, 3 (5%); placebo, 4 (9%)).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first randomized clinical trial demonstrating the benefit of a disease-modifying therapy in preventing a first acute clinical event in people with RIS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-specific transcriptomic profiling of reward and sensory brain areas in perinatal fentanyl exposed juvenile mice</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Use of the synthetic opioid fentanyl increased ~300% in the last decade, including among women of reproductive ages. Adverse neonatal outcomes and long-term behavioral disruptions are associated with perinatal opioid exposure. Our previous work demonstrated that perinatal fentanyl exposed (PFE) mice displayed enhanced negative affect and somatosensory circuit and behavioral disruptions during adolescence. However, little is known about molecular adaptations across brain regions that underlie these outcomes. We performed RNA-sequencing across three reward and two sensory brain areas to study transcriptional programs in PFE juvenile mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 pregnant dams received 10ug/ml fentanyl in the drinking water from embryonic day 0 (E0) through gestational periods until weaning at postnatal day 21 (P21). RNA was extracted from nucleus accumbens (NAc), prelimbic cortex (PrL), ventral tegmental area (VTA), somatosensory cortex (S1) and ventrobasal thalamus (VBT) from PFE mice of both sexes at P35. RNA-sequencing was performed, followed by analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene co-expression networks. RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis revealed sex-specific DEGs and gene modules significantly associated with PFE. The VTA had the most DEGs, while pronounced gene enrichment occurred in NAc. Genes enriched in mitochondrial respiration were pronounced in NAc and VTA of PFE males, extracellular matrix (ECM) and neuronal migration enrichment were pronounced in NAc and VTA of PFE males, while genes associated with vesicular cycling and synaptic signaling were markedly altered in NAc of PFE female mice. In sensory areas from PFE females, we found alterations in mitochondrial respiration, synaptic and ciliary organization processes. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate sex-specific neuroadaptations in PFE mice. Our studies identify distinct transcriptomes across reward and sensory brain regions that may underlie disrupted behavioral and circuit states in PFE mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interferon-gamma Elicits Pathological Hallmarks of ALS in Human Motor Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is an established factor contributing to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology, implicating the possible detrimental effects of inflammatory cytokines to motor neurons. The RNA/DNA-binding protein TDP-43 has emerged as a pivotal actor in ALS, because TDP-43 mutations cause familial ALS and loss of nuclear TDP-43, associated with its redistribution into cytoplasmic aggregates (TDP-43 proteinopathy), in motor neurons occurs in 97% of ALS cases. However, mechanisms linking neuroinflammation to TDP-43 mis-localization have not been described. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune-modulatory protein, highly expressed on cell surfaces following acute inflammatory stress. To determine which inflammatory cytokines might impact motor neuron function, seven cytokines known to be elevated in ALS patients' cerebrospinal fluid were tested for their effects on PD-L1 expression in human iPSC-derived motor neurons. Among the tested cytokines, only interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was found to strongly promote PD-L1 expression. Thus, we hypothesized that excessive exposure to IFN-gamma may contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS. We observed that neuronal populations exposed to IFN-gamma exhibited severe TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation and excitotoxic behavior correlated with impaired neural firing activity, hallmarks of ALS pathology, in both normal and ALS mutant (TARDBPQ331K+/-) neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed possible mechanisms for these effects. Motor neurons exposed to IFN-gamma exhibited an extensive shift of their gene expression profile toward a neurodegenerative phenotype. Notably, IFN-gamma treatment induced aberrant expression levels for 70 genes that are listed in the recent literature as being dysregulated in ALS. Additionally, we found that genes related to neuronal electrophysiology, protein aggregation, and TDP-43 mis-regulation were abnormally expressed in IFN-gamma-treated cells. Moreover, IFN-gamma induced a significant reduction in the expression of genes that encode indispensable proteins for neuromuscular synapse development and maintenance, implying that cytokine exposure could directly impair signal transmission between motor axons and muscle membranes. Our findings suggest that IFN-gamma could be a potent upstream pathogenic driver of ALS and provide potential candidates for future therapeutic targets to treat sporadic forms of ALS, which account for roughly 90% of reported cases.

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the association between high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) and stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Methods: AIS patients were enrolled in two centers. The serum samples were collected within the first 24 h after admission, and HMGB1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of SAP for HMGB1 concentrations. Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were performed to explore the shapes of the association between HMGB1 concentrations and SAP. Results: From January 2022 to May 2022, a total of 420 AIS patients were enrolled. Ninety-six (22.9%) patients develop SAP. The levels of HMGB1 in the SAP group were higher than those in the non-SAP group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Using the first quartile of HMGB1 group as a reference, patients in the fourth quartile of HMGB1 group had the highest likelihood of experiencing SAP in the unadjusted model (OR = 3.687; 95% CI: 1.851&amp;amp;ndash;7.344), age- and sex-adjusted model (OR = 3.511; 95% CI: 1.725&amp;amp;ndash;7.147), and multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 2.701; 95% CI: 1.045&amp;amp;ndash;6.981). HMGB1 was also independently associated with SAP as a continuous variable in the unadjusted model (OR = 1.132; 95% CI: 1.069&amp;amp;ndash;1.199), age- and sex-adjusted model (OR = 1.131; 95% CI: 1.066&amp;amp;ndash;1.200), and multivariable-adjusted model (OR = 1.096; 95% CI: 1.011&amp;amp;ndash;1.188). RCS showed a linear association between HMGB1 and SAP (p for linear trend = 0.008) Conclusions: HMGB1 might be able to act as a potential biomarker of SAP in AIS patients.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder often associated with pre-motor symptoms involving both gastrointestinal and olfactory tissues. PD patients frequently suffer from hyposmia, hyposalivation, dysphagia and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. During the last few years it has been speculated that microbial agents could play a crucial role in PD. In particular, alterations of the microbiota composition (dysbiosis) might contribute to the formation of misfolded &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein, which is believed to be the leading cause of PD. However, while several findings confirmed that there might be an important link between intestinal microbiota alterations and PD onset, little is known about the potential contribution of the nasal microbiota. Here, we describe the latest findings on this topic by considering that more than 80% of patients with PD develop remarkable olfactory deficits in their prodromal disease stage. Therefore, the nasal microbiota might contribute to PD, eventually boosting the gut microbiota in promoting disease onset. Finally, we present the applications of the seed amplification assays to the study of the gut and olfactory mucosa of PD patients, and how they could be exploited to investigate whether pathogenic bacteria present in the gut and the nose might promote &amp;amp;alpha;-synuclein misfolding and aggregation.</p>

	<p>Engaging in musical activities throughout the lifespan may protect against age-related cognitive decline and modify structural and functional connectivity in the brain. Prior research suggests that musical experience modulates brain regions that integrate different modalities of sensory information, such as the insula. Most of this research has been performed in individuals classified as professional musicians; however, general musical experiences across the lifespan may also confer beneficial effects on brain health in older adults. The current study investigated whether general musical experience, characterized using the Goldsmith Music Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI), was associated with functional connectivity in older adults (age = 65.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.4, n = 69). We tested whether Gold-MSI was associated with individual differences in the functional connectivity of three a priori hypothesis-defined seed regions in the insula (i.e., dorsal anterior, ventral anterior, and posterior insula). We found that older adults with more musical experience showed greater functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior insula and the precentral and postcentral gyrus, and between the ventral anterior insula and diverse brain regions, including the insula and prefrontal cortex, and decreased functional connectivity between the ventral anterior insula and thalamus (voxel p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01, cluster FWE p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Follow-up correlation analyses showed that the singing ability subscale score was key in driving the association between functional connectivity differences and musical experience. Overall, our findings suggest that musical experience, even among non-professional musicians, is related to functional brain reorganization in older adults.</p>

	<p>The Zero-P spacer was primarily developed aiming to reduce the morbidity associated with the traditional anterior cervical plate. During the past decade, many authors have reported the use of Zero-P spacers for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) of one or two segments. Nevertheless, there is still a paucity of knowledge on the safety and feasibility of using Zero-P spacers for 3-level fixation. The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical and radiological outcomes, with a focus on the sagittal alignment reconstruction of 3-level ACDF surgery using Zero-P spacers versus those using a traditional plate and cage system. From Sep 2013 to Aug 2016, a total of 44 patients who received 3-level ACDF surgery due to cervical spondylotic myelopathy were recruited. The Zero-P spacer was used in 23 patients (group ZP) and the traditional plate and cage system in 21 (group PC). Clinical outcomes were analyzed by Neck Disability Index (NDI) and Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores, and dysphagia was evaluated using the Bazaz score. Radiological outcomes, including fusion rate, adjacent segment degeneration (ASD), and especially changes in cervical sagittal alignment, were analyzed. The NDI and JOA scores did not differ significantly between the two groups postoperatively (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05); however, there was significantly less dysphagia in patients using Zero-P spacers at the 3- and 6-month follow-up (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). At the 24-month follow-up, the fusion rate and ASD were similar between the two groups (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Interestingly, patients using Zero-P spacers had a significantly lower postoperative C2-7 Cobb angle and fused segment Cobb angle, compared to those using a traditional plate and cage system (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05); meanwhile, the fused segment disc wedge was also found to be significantly smaller in patients using Zero-P spacers after surgery (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, we further divided patients into subgroups according to their cervical lordosis. In patients with a preoperative C2-7 Cobb angle &amp;amp;le; 10&amp;amp;deg;, significantly less cervical and local lordosis, as well as disc wedge, were seen in group ZP after surgery (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while in others with a preoperative C2-7 Cobb angle &amp;amp;gt; 10&amp;amp;deg;, no significant difference in postoperative changes of the cervical sagittal alignment was seen between group ZP and group PC (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Zero-P spacers used in 3-level ACDF surgery could provide equivalent clinical outcomes and a lower rate of postoperative dysphagia, compared to the traditional plate and cage system. However, our results showed that it was inferior to the cervical plate in terms of sagittal alignment reconstruction for 3-level fixation. We recommend applying Zero-P spacers for 3-level ACDF in patients with good preoperative cervical lordosis (C2-7 Cobb angle &amp;amp;gt; 10&amp;amp;deg;), in order to restore and maintain physiological curvature of the cervical spine postoperatively.</p>

	<p>Recreational drug intake may be associated with a range of medical untoward consequences, including male infertility. However, as the related evidence is still limited, the main outcome of this review is to provide a better understanding of the existence of any association between recreational drug misuse and male fertility levels&amp;amp;rsquo; decline. Whilst searching the MEDLINE/PubMed, a comprehensive overview of the literature regarding male infertility and substances of abuse (e.g., phytocannabinoids, opiates/opioids, stimulants, &amp;amp;lsquo;herbal highs&amp;amp;rsquo;, psychedelics, and &amp;amp;lsquo;novel psychoactive substances) was here undertaken. Due to the paucity of robust, high-quality, empirical, human studies, a narrative strategy was here preferred over a systematic approach. Relevant data are qualitatively analyzed and presented in a table. Although most available evidence is in support of a detrimental role of cannabis on human spermatogenesis, a few remaining studies failed to document any effect of this drug on seminal quality, and it is not clear to which extent this drug impacts fertility rates/time to pregnancy. The current understanding of the impact of opiate-, cocaine- and amphetamine/stimulant-misuse on human reproduction is widely unknown, and most studies dealing with this matter represent only an extrapolation of data derived from specific clinical circumstances. Although the message of &amp;amp;lsquo;no smoking, no alcohol and no street drugs&amp;amp;rsquo; should always be offered as good health advice to all patients seeking medical help for fertility issues, robust scientific clinical evidence in support of a direct detrimental impact of recreational drugs on spermatogenesis is scant to date.</p>

	<p>Inhibition of reaching and grasping actions as an element of cognitive control and executive function is a vital component of sensorimotor behaviour that is often impaired in patients who have lost sensorimotor function following a stroke. To date, there are few kinematic studies detailing the fine spatial and temporal upper limb movements associated with the millisecond temporal trajectory of correct and incorrect responses to visually driven Go/No-Go reaching and grasping tasks. Therefore, we aimed to refine the behavioural measurement of correct and incorrect inhibitory motor responses in a Go/No-Go task for future quantification and personalized rehabilitation in older populations and those with acquired motor disorders, such as stroke. An exploratory study mapping the kinematic profiles of hand movements in neurotypical participants utilizing such a task was conducted using high-speed biological motion capture cameras, revealing both within and between subject differences in a sample of healthy participants. These kinematic profiles and differences are discussed in the context of better assessment of sensorimotor function impairment in stroke survivors.</p>

	<p>Neuroprostheses are neuroengineering devices that have an interface with the nervous system and supplement or substitute functionality in people with disabilities. In the collective imagination, neuroprostheses are mostly used to restore sensory or motor capabilities, but in recent years, new devices directly acting at the brain level have been proposed. In order to design the next-generation of neuroprosthetic devices for brain repair, we foresee the increasing exploitation of closed-loop systems enabled with neuromorphic elements due to their intrinsic energy efficiency, their capability to perform real-time data processing, and of mimicking neurobiological computation for an improved synergy between the technological and biological counterparts. In this manuscript, after providing definitions of key concepts, we reviewed the first exploitation of a real-time hardware neuromorphic prosthesis to restore the bidirectional communication between two neuronal populations in vitro. Starting from that &amp;amp;lsquo;case-study&amp;amp;rsquo;, we provide perspectives on the technological improvements for real-time interfacing and processing of neural signals and their potential usage for novel in vitro and in vivo experimental designs. The development of innovative neuroprosthetics for translational purposes is also presented and discussed. In our understanding, the pursuit of neuromorphic-based closed-loop neuroprostheses may spur the development of novel powerful technologies, such as &amp;amp;lsquo;brain-prostheses&amp;amp;rsquo;, capable of rewiring and/or substituting the injured nervous system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">BDNF as a potential predictive biomarker for patients with pediatric cerebral palsy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in children, which is instigated by damage to the developing brain that affects the ability to control the muscles. The main types of CP are spastic CP, dyskinesia CP and mixed CP. The aim of this work was to estimate the concentrations of complete blood count (CBC), erythrocytic sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in children with CP compared to the control group. Methods: A total of 75 Egyptian children were enrolled in this study, 45 had CP and 30 were controls. CBC, ESR, CRP, BDNF, and TNF-α were assessed. Results: The ESR, CRP and TNF-α levels showed statistically significant increases in cases compared with controls. While the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and the BDNF levels were significantly lower in CP compared with the controls. When comparing the different groups of CP with each other; there were no significant differences. Regarding the correlation of BDNF and different studied parameters, our study showed a positive correlation between BDNF and TNF levels only within the group with spastic CP. Conclusions: BDNF may be considered as a biomarker or treatment target for CP to avoid further complications as still there is insufficient progress in the prediction, early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CP. Furthermore, searching for novel strategies to increase BDNF levels may open a new opportunity for the treatment of CP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Stage 1 Registered Report: Refinement of tickling protocols to improve positive animal welfare in laboratory rats [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Rat tickling is a heterospecific interaction for experimenters to mimic the interactions of rat play, where they produce 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalisations (USV), symptoms of positive affect; tickling can improve laboratory rat welfare. The standard rat tickling protocol involves gently pinning the rat in a supine position. However, individual response to this protocol varies. This suggests there is a risk that some rats may perceive tickling as only a neutral experience, while others as a positive one, depending on how tickling is performed. Based on our research experiences of the standard tickling protocol we have developed a playful handling (PH) protocol, with reduced emphasis on pinning, intended to mimic more closely the dynamic nature of play. We will test whether our PH protocol gives rise to more uniform increases in positive affect across individuals relative to protocols involving pinning. We will compare the response of juvenile male and female Wistar rats as: Control (hand remains still against the side of the test arena), P0 (PH with no pinning), P1 (PH with one pin), P4 (PH with four pins). P1 and P4 consist of a background of PH, with treatments involving administration of an increasing dosage of pinning per PH session. We hypothesise that rats exposed to handling protocols that maximise playful interactions (where pinning number per session decreases) will show an overall increase in total 50 kHz USV as an indicator of positive affect, with less variability. We will explore whether behavioural and physiological changes associated with alterations in PH experience are less variable. We propose that maximising the numbers of rats experiencing tickling as a positive experience will reduce the variation in response variables affected by tickling and increase the repeatability of research where tickling is applied either as a social enrichment or as a treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A scoping review protocol on diagnostic and treatment costs of cardiovascular disease management in India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality in India. Economic threats due to CVDs have surged, as diagnostic and treatment costs are out-of-pocket expenses. The increasing prevalence of CVDs in India is due to globalization, industrialization, aging, tobacco and alcohol consumption, diet, and sleep patterns. This scoping review provides a summary of the costs incurred in diagnosing and treating CVDs in India. Methods: The JBI updated methodology aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will guide this scoping review. Searches will be conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, Econ Papers, and ProQuest databases. Google Scholar and Shodhganga will be used to search for relevant gray literature. Bibliographic mining will be performed to identify additional relevant studies. The literature published from 2000 onwards will be the primary focus. All direct and indirect costs for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs across various levels of healthcare settings will be included. A two-stage independent screening, consisting of title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening, will be conducted to identify eligible articles. Data will be extracted from full-text studies using a customized data extraction form. The results will be compiled and presented in the scoping review performed. Ethics and dissemination: A conference presentation and scientific peer-reviewed journal publication will be the sources for disseminating the review results. This study does not require an ethics review because publicly available sources were used to retrieve data.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Multiple institutions’ research findings using the National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mesothelioma remains an under-researched cancerous disease due to the lack of high-quality patient samples and clinical information especially outcomes and asbestos exposure data. The National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank (NMVB) is a biobank in which mesothelioma annotated biospecimens can be made widely available to the research community. Here, we summarized the significant research findings from 20 publications that utilized the NMVB samples for novel biomarker and therapeutic discoveries. The results showed that the use of the NMVB resource was dispersed among a variety of basic science topics including, but not limited to, biomarkers, abnormal gene expression, and potential therapeutic targets. Positive biomarkers included several miRNAs and antibodies, HMGB1, ATG5, PIAS3, pancytokeratin and GATA3. Genes that had mutations or high/low levels of expression were BAP1, a human control gene of importance in this disease, as well as various cytokines, and checkpoint inhibitors TM4SF1, PKM2, ARHGDIA, COBLL1, WT1, FOXM1, and CD30. Treatments investigated include thiostrepton, interferon-�� gene, and Brentuximab. Publications reviewed indicated a significant impact of the NMVB resource utilized in significant studies focusing on biomarker and therapeutic discoveries, which can act as a model for rare diseases, especially in oncology.

                Background: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast is a rare variant of invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC), with most cases characterized by lymph node metastasis and lymphatic vascular invasion. It is a ductal breast cancer subtype with a very high risk of recurrence and therefore requires special attention from breast cancer physicians and radiologists. Case: We present a case of an IMPC that has been followed up for two years since diagnosis and management. Based on clinical breast examination, ultrasound, and mammography, the initial diagnosis was a suspicious mass that required further investigation. Radiological and histological findings informed the diagnosis of a highly suspicious lesion, which turned out to be IMPC. The patient underwent surgery, left mastectomy with nodal dissection. During the 24-month follow-up, ultrasound and mammography revealed no evidence of local recurrence or involvement of the contralateral breast. Conclusions: This case reveals that invasive micropapillary carcinoma is a distinct but poorly recognized variant and subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma.

                <p>by David Arredondo, Matthew R. Lakin</p>

Adapting one’s behavior to environmental conditions and past experience is a key trait of living systems. In the biological world, there is evidence for adaptive behaviors such as learning even in naturally occurring, non-neural, single-celled organisms. In the bioengineered world, advances in synthetic cell engineering and biorobotics have created the possibility of implementing lifelike systems engineered from the bottom up. This will require the development of programmable control circuitry for such biomimetic systems that is capable of realizing such non-trivial and adaptive behavior, including modification of subsequent behavior in response to environmental feedback. To this end, we report the design of novel stochastic chemical reaction networks capable of probabilistic decision-making in response to stimuli. We show that a simple chemical reaction network motif can be tuned to produce arbitrary decision probabilities when choosing between two or more responses to a stimulus signal. We further show that simple feedback mechanisms from the environment can modify these probabilities over time, enabling the system to adapt its behavior dynamically in response to positive or negative reinforcement based on its decisions. This system thus acts as a form of operant conditioning of the chemical circuit, in the sense that feedback provided based on decisions taken by the circuit form the basis of the learning process. Our work thus demonstrates that simple chemical systems can be used to implement lifelike behavior in engineered biomimetic systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sleep prevents catastrophic forgetting in spiking neural networks by forming a joint synaptic weight representation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ryan Golden, Jean Erik Delanois, Pavel Sanda, Maxim Bazhenov</p>

Artificial neural networks overwrite previously learned tasks when trained sequentially, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, the brain learns continuously, and typically learns best when new training is interleaved with periods of sleep for memory consolidation. Here we used spiking network to study mechanisms behind catastrophic forgetting and the role of sleep in preventing it. The network could be trained to learn a complex foraging task but exhibited catastrophic forgetting when trained sequentially on different tasks. In synaptic weight space, new task training moved the synaptic weight configuration away from the manifold representing old task leading to forgetting. Interleaving new task training with periods of off-line reactivation, mimicking biological sleep, mitigated catastrophic forgetting by constraining the network synaptic weight state to the  previously learned manifold, while allowing the weight configuration to converge towards the intersection of the manifolds representing old and new tasks. The study reveals a possible strategy of synaptic weights dynamics the brain applies during sleep to prevent forgetting and optimize learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Hypermutator strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveal novel pathways of resistance to combinations of cephalosporin antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Augusto Dulanto Chiang, Prashant P. Patil, Lidia Beka, Jung-Ho Youn, Adrien Launay, Robert A. Bonomo, Pavel P. Khil, John P. Dekker</p>

Hypermutation due to DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies can accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. Whether hypermutators generate resistance through predominantly similar molecular mechanisms to wild-type (WT) strains is not fully understood. Here, we show that MMR-deficient <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> can evolve resistance to important broad-spectrum cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotics through novel mechanisms not commonly observed in WT lineages. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and transcriptional profiling of isolates that underwent in vitro adaptation to ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA), we characterized the detailed sequence of mutational and transcriptional changes underlying the development of resistance. Surprisingly, MMR-deficient lineages rapidly developed high-level resistance (>256 μg/mL) largely without corresponding fixed mutations or transcriptional changes in well-established resistance genes. Further investigation revealed that these isolates had paradoxically generated an early inactivating mutation in the <i>mexB</i> gene of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, a primary mediator of CZA resistance in <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>, potentially driving an evolutionary search for alternative resistance mechanisms. In addition to alterations in a number of genes not known to be associated with resistance, 2 mutations were observed in the operon encoding the RND efflux pump MexVW. These mutations resulted in a 4- to 6-fold increase in resistance to ceftazidime, CZA, cefepime, and ceftolozane-tazobactam when engineered into a WT strain, demonstrating a potentially important and previously unappreciated mechanism of resistance to these antibiotics in <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i>. Our results suggest that MMR-deficient isolates may rapidly evolve novel resistance mechanisms, sometimes with complex dynamics that reflect gene inactivation that occurs with hypermutation. The apparent ease with which hypermutators may switch to alternative resistance mechanisms for which antibiotics have not been developed may carry important clinical implications.

<p>Genetic studies of individuals with dystonia and/or Leigh(-like) syndromes identified unrelated patients with biallelic variants in <i>NUP54</i>, a gene not previously associated with monogenic diseases; the patients displayed shared features of early-onset dystonia with striatal signal-changes and variable neurodevelopmental comorbidities. All variants disrupted conserved amino-acids in the C-terminal protein–protein interaction domain of NUP54, involved in structural stabilization of parts of the nuclear-pore complex. Protein-modeling and patient fibroblast-based studies indicated partial loss of protein function as the most likely mechanism of pathogenicity.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Infantile striatonigral degeneration is caused by a homozygous variant of the nuclear-pore complex (NPC) gene <i>NUP62</i>, involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. By querying sequencing-datasets of patients with dystonia and/or Leigh(-like) syndromes, we identified 3 unrelated individuals with biallelic variants in <i>NUP54</i>. All variants clustered in the C-terminal protein region that interacts with NUP62. Associated phenotypes were similar to those of <i>NUP62</i>-related disease, including early-onset dystonia with dysphagia, choreoathetosis, and T2-hyperintense lesions in striatum. In silico and protein-biochemical studies gave further evidence for the argument that the variants were pathogenic. We expand the spectrum of NPC component-associated dystonic conditions with localized basal-ganglia abnormalities. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor differentially controls mossy cell activity across the dentate gyrus longitudinal axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Understanding the role of dentate gyrus (DG) mossy cells (MCs) in learning and memory has rapidly evolved due to increasingly precise methods for targeting MCs and for in vivo recording and activity manipulation in rodents. These studies have shown MCs are highly active in vivo, strongly remap to contextual manipulation, and that their inhibition or hyperactivation impairs pattern separation and location or context discrimination. Less well understood is how MC activity is modulated by neurohormonal mechanisms, which might differentially control the participation of MCs in cognitive functions during discrete states, such as hunger or satiety. In this study, we demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a neuropeptide produced in the gut and the brain that regulates food consumption and hippocampal-dependent mnemonic function, might regulate MC function through expression of its receptor, GLP-1R. RNA-seq demonstrated that most, though not all, <i>Glp1r</i> in hippocampal principal neurons is expressed in MCs, and in situ hybridization revealed strong expression of <i>Glp1r</i> in hilar neurons. <i>Glp1r-ires-Cre</i> mice crossed with Ai14D reporter mice followed by co-labeling for the MC marker GluR2/3 revealed that almost all MCs in the ventral DG expressed <i>Glp1r</i> and that almost all <i>Glp1r</i>-expressing hilar neurons were MCs. However, only ~60% of dorsal DG MCs expressed <i>Glp1r</i>, and <i>Glp1r</i> was also expressed in small hilar neurons that were not MCs. Consistent with this expression pattern, peripheral administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (5 μg/kg) increased cFos expression in ventral but not dorsal DG hilar neurons. Finally, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from ventral MCs showed that bath application of exendin-4 (200 nM) depolarized MCs and increased action potential firing. Taken together, this study adds to known MC activity modulators a neurohormonal mechanism that may preferentially affect ventral DG physiology and may potentially be targetable by several GLP-1R pharmacotherapies already in clinical use.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal responses to electrical stimulation of the major input pathways are modulated by dentate spikes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dentate gyrus (DG) is important for pattern separation and spatial memory, and it is thought to gate information flow to the downstream hippocampal subregions. Dentate spikes (DSs) are high-amplitude, fast, positive local-field potential events taking place in the DG during immobility and sleep, and they have been connected to memory consolidation in rodents. DSs are a result of signaling from the entorhinal cortex (EC) to the DG, and they suppress firing of pyramidal cells in the CA3 and CA1. To study the effects of DSs to signaling in the hippocampal tri-synaptic loop, we electrically stimulated the afferent fibers of the DG, CA3, and CA1 in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats at different delays from DSs. Responses to stimulation were increased in the EC-DG synapse during DSs, and the effect was amplified after theta-burst stimulation. We concluded that DSs strengthen the excitatory signal from the EC to the DG, which is reinforced by synapse potentiation and increased excitability of granule cells after theta-burst stimulation. This signal boosting may function in enhancing plastic changes in the DG-CA3 synapse. As responses in the CA3 and CA1 remained unaffected by the DS, the DS-contingent silencing of pyramidal cells seems to be a result of a decrease in excitatory input rather than a decrease in the excitability of the pyramidal cells themselves. In addition, we found that the DSs occur asynchronously in the left and right hippocampi, giving novel evidence of lateralization of the rodent hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Obese male Zucker rats exhibit dendritic remodeling in neurons of the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit as well as spatial memory deficits</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obesity is characterized by excessive fat accumulation. The Zucker rat displays genetic obesity due to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene; this model is of great interest because of its similarity to human obesity. Brain regions may be affected by obesity, but detailed information is lacking. In the present study, we analyzed the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit as well as the spatial memory of obese Zucker rats. We performed two experiments. Each experiment contained two experimental groups: the control group (male Long Evans rats) and the study group (obese male Zucker rats). We monitored the body weights of all rats over 4 weeks. In the first experiment, we analyzed the morphology of hippocampal neurons. Under anesthesia, we measured the abdominal and hip circumferences and collected at least 1 ml of blood to assess serum glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TGC), and cholesterol (COL) concentrations. We perfused the brains of these rats with 0.9% saline solution, incubated the brains in Golgi-Cox solution, and subsequently evaluated the morphology of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (the CA1-CA3 regions) and the entorhinal cortex as well as the morphology of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus. In the second experiment, we assessed the spatial memory of animals with the Morris water maze. The Zucker rats had an obese phenotype, as indicated by their elevated body weight and increased abdominal and hip circumferences as well as elevated GLU, COL, and TGC concentrations. Analysis of neurons from the specified regions in obese male Zucker rats indicated reduced dendritic arborization and reduced dendritic spine density. In terms of spatial learning and memory, the obese Zucker rats exhibited intact spatial learning (i.e., of platform location) but deficits in spatial memory. These data provide evidence that obesity alters the morphology and function of hippocampal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal neurogenesis promotes effortful responding but does not regulate effort‐based choice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A fundamental trait of depression is low motivation. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been associated with motivational deficits but detailed evidence on how it regulates human-relevant behavioral traits is still missing. We used the hGFAP-TK rat model to deplete actively dividing neural stem cells in the rat hippocampus. Use of the effort-discounting operant task allowed us to identify specific and detailed deficits in motivation behavior. In this task, rats are given a choice between small and large food rewards, where 2–20 lever presses are required to obtain the large reward (four sugar pellets) versus one press to receive the smaller reward (two sugar pellets). We found that depleting adult neurogenesis did not affect effort-based choice or general motivation to complete the task. However, lack of adult neurogenesis reduced the pressing rate and thus increased time to complete the required presses to obtain a reward. In summary, the present study finds that adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically reduces response vigor to obtain rewards and thus deepens our understanding in how neurogenesis shapes depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal cellular functional organization for fear memory: Effects of sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory is vital to our daily existence. Although a large number of studies have suggested that the hippocampus is dedicated to long-term memory, understanding how memory is anatomically encoded within the hippocampal neuronal network is still lacking. Previously our laboratory showed that hippocampal pyramidal cells are organized in cell clusters to encode both spatial and episodic memory. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that “cluster-type” is a functional organization principal in the hippocampus to encode all types of memory. Here, we tested whether contextual fear, another hippocampus-dependent memory, is also organized in cell clusters. We further investigated the possibility that post-learning sleep may affect functional organization. Cluster formation was examined by assessing the topographic localization of active cells using immediate early gene (IEG, Zif268) imaging methods. The first experiment provides evidence of a cluster-type organization in the hippocampus for fear memory by showing a spatial distribution of adjacent Zif268 positive cells. Exposure to the context itself, without electric shocks, induced a similar cellular formation; however, the degree of clustering was significantly lower. The second experiment provides evidence that sleep plays a role in the refinement and long-term stability of the clusters. The present results confirm the existence of a cluster-type topographic functional neuronal organization in the hippocampus for memory, and further suggest that post-learning sleep enhances the cluster-type organization.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Where is the error? Hierarchical predictive coding through dendritic error computation</a></h4>

              
                Top-down feedback in cortex is critical for guiding sensory processing, which has prominently been formalized in the theory of hierarchical predictive coding (hPC). However, experimental evidence for error units, which are central to the theory, is inconclusive and it remains unclear how hPC can be implemented with spiking neurons. To address this, we connect hPC to existing work on efficient coding in balanced networks with lateral inhibition and predictive computation at apical dendrites. Together, this work points to an efficient implementation of hPC with spiking neurons, where prediction errors are computed not in separate units, but locally in dendritic compartments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hedgehog regulation of epithelial cell state and morphogenesis in the larynx</a></h4>

              
                The larynx enables speech while regulating swallowing and respiration. Larynx function hinges on the laryngeal epithelium which originates as part of the anterior foregut and undergoes extensive remodeling to separate from the esophagus and form vocal folds that interface with the adjacent trachea. Here we find that Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is essential for epithelial integrity in the mouse larynx as well as the anterior foregut. During larynx-esophageal separation, low <i>Shh</i> expression marks specific domains of actively remodeling epithelium that undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by the induction of N-Cadherin and movement of cells out of the epithelial layer. Consistent with a role for SHH signaling in regulating this process, <i>Shh</i> mutants undergo an abnormal EMT throughout the anterior foregut and larynx, marked by a cadherin switch, movement out of the epithelial layer and cell death. Unexpectedly, <i>Shh</i> mutant epithelial cells are replaced by a new population of FOXA2-negative cells that likely derive from adjacent pouch tissues and form a rudimentary epithelium. These findings have important implications for interpreting the etiology of HH-dependent birth defects within the foregut. We propose that SHH signaling has a default role in maintaining epithelial identity throughout the anterior foregut and that regionalized reductions in SHH trigger epithelial remodeling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Sugar sensation and mechanosensation in the egg-laying preference shift of Drosophila suzukii</a></h4>

              
                The agricultural pest <i>Drosophila suzukii</i> differs from most other <i>Drosophila</i> species in that it lays eggs in ripe, rather than overripe, fruit. Previously, we showed that changes in bitter taste sensation accompanied this adaptation (Dweck et al., 2021). Here, we show that <i>D. suzukii</i> has also undergone a variety of changes in sweet taste sensation. <i>D. suzukii</i> has a weaker preference than <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for laying eggs on substrates containing all three primary fruit sugars: sucrose, fructose, and glucose. Major subsets of <i>D. suzukii</i> taste sensilla have lost electrophysiological responses to sugars. Expression of several key sugar receptor genes is reduced in the taste organs of <i>D. suzukii</i>. By contrast, certain mechanosensory channel genes, including <i>no mechanoreceptor potential C</i>, are expressed at higher levels in the taste organs of <i>D. suzukii</i>, which has a higher preference for stiff substrates. Finally, we find that <i>D. suzukii</i> responds differently from <i>D. melanogaster</i> to combinations of sweet and mechanosensory cues. Thus, the two species differ in sweet sensation, mechanosensation, and their integration, which are all likely to contribute to the differences in their egg-laying preferences in nature.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Munc13 supports fusogenicity of non-docked vesicles at synapses with disrupted active zones</a></h4>

              
                Active zones consist of protein scaffolds that are tightly attached to the presynaptic plasma membrane. They dock and prime synaptic vesicles, couple them to voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and direct neurotransmitter release towards postsynaptic receptor domains. Simultaneous RIM+ELKS ablation disrupts these scaffolds, abolishes vesicle docking and removes active zone-targeted Munc13, but some vesicles remain releasable. To assess whether this enduring vesicular fusogenicity is mediated by non-active zone-anchored Munc13 or is Munc13-independent, we ablated Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 in addition to RIM+ELKS in mouse hippocampal neurons. The hextuple knockout synapses lacked docked vesicles, but other ultrastructural features were near-normal despite the strong genetic manipulation. Removing Munc13 in addition to RIM+ELKS impaired action potential-evoked vesicle fusion more strongly than RIM+ELKS knockout by further decreasing the releasable vesicle pool. Hence, Munc13 can support some fusogenicity without RIM and ELKS, and presynaptic recruitment of Munc13, even without active zone-anchoring, suffices to generate some fusion-competent vesicles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Development of visual cortex in human neonates is selectively modified by postnatal experience</a></h4>

              
                Experience-dependent cortical plasticity is a pivotal process of human brain development and essential for the formation of most cognitive functions. Although studies found that early visual experience could influence the endogenous development of visual cortex in animals, little is known about such impact on human infants. Using the multimodal MRI data from the developing human connectome project, we characterized the early structural and functional maps in the ventral visual cortex and their development during neonatal period. Particularly, we found that postnatal time selectively modulated the cortical thickness in the ventral visual cortex and the functional circuit between bilateral primary visual cortices. But the cortical myelination and functional connections of the high-order visual cortex developed without significant influence of postnatal time in such an early period. The structure–function analysis further revealed that the postnatal time had a direct influence on the development of homotopic connection in area V1, while gestational time had an indirect effect on it through cortical myelination. These findings were further validated in preterm-born infants who had longer postnatal time but shorter gestational time at birth. In short, these data suggested in human newborns that early postnatal time shaped the structural and functional development of the visual cortex in selective and organized patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Discovery of a new class of reversible TEA-domain transcription factor inhibitors with a novel binding mode</a></h4>

              
                The TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factor forms a transcription co-activation complex with the key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, YAP/TAZ. TEAD-YAP controls the expression of Hippo-responsive genes involved in cell proliferation, development, and tumorigenesis. Hyperactivation of TEAD-YAP activities is observed in many human cancers, and is associated with cancer cell proliferation, survival and immune evasion. Therefore, targeting the TEAD-YAP complex has emerged as an attractive therapeutic approach. We previously reported that the mammalian TEAD transcription factors (TEAD1-4) possess auto-palmitoylation activities and contain an evolutionarily conserved palmitate-binding pocket (PBP), which allows small molecule modulation. Since then, several reversible and irreversible inhibitors have been reported by binding to PBP. Here, we report a new class of TEAD inhibitors with a novel binding mode. Representative analog TM2 shows potent inhibition of TEAD auto-palmitoylation both <i>in vitro</i> and in cells. Surprisingly, the co-crystal structure of the human TEAD2 YAP-binding domain (YBD) in complex with TM2 reveals that TM2 adopts an unexpected binding mode by occupying not only the hydrophobic PBP, but also a new side binding pocket formed by hydrophilic residues. RNA-seq analysis shows that TM2 potently and specifically suppresses TEAD-YAP transcriptional activities. Consistently, TM2 exhibits strong anti-proliferation effects as a single agent or in combination with a MEK inhibitor in YAP-dependent cancer cells. These findings establish TM2 as a promising small molecule inhibitor against TEAD-YAP activities and provide new insights for designing novel TEAD inhibitors with enhanced selectivity and potency.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mettl3-mediated m6A modification of Fgf16 restricts cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide due to the inability of adult heart to regenerate after injury. <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3) plays an important role in various physiological and pathological bioprocesses. However, the role of m<sup>6</sup>A in heart regeneration remains largely unclear. To study m<sup>6</sup>A function in heart regeneration, we modulated Mettl3 expression in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of <i>Mettl3</i> significantly increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and accelerated heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice. However, <i>Mettl3</i> overexpression decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice. Conjoint analysis of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA-seq identified <i>Fgf16</i> as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification during postnatal heart regeneration. RIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Mettl3 negatively regulates <i>Fgf16</i> mRNA expression in an m<sup>6</sup>A-Ythdf2-dependent manner. The silencing of <i>Fgf16</i> suppressed the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. However, the overexpression of ΔFgf16, in which the m<sup>6</sup>A consensus sequence was mutated, significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice compared with wild-type Fgf16. Our data demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces <i>Fgf16</i> mRNA levels through an m<sup>6</sup>A-Ythdf2-dependen pathway, thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A role for the centrosome in regulating the rate of neuronal efferocytosis by microglia in vivo</a></h4>

              
                During brain development, many newborn neurons undergo apoptosis and are engulfed by microglia, the tissue-resident phagocytes of the brain, in a process known as efferocytosis. A hallmark of microglia is their highly branched morphology characterized by the presence of numerous dynamic extensions that these cells use for scanning the brain parenchyma and engulfing unwanted material. The mechanisms driving branch formation and apoptotic cell engulfment in microglia are unclear. By taking a live-imaging approach in zebrafish, we show that while microglia generate multiple microtubule-based branches, they only successfully engulf one apoptotic neuron at a time. Further investigation into the mechanism underlying this sequential engulfment revealed that targeted migration of the centrosome into one branch is predictive of phagosome formation and polarized vesicular trafficking. Moreover, experimentally doubling centrosomal numbers in microglia increases the rate of engulfment and even allows microglia to remove two neurons simultaneously, providing direct supporting evidence for a model where centrosomal migration is a rate-limiting step in branch-mediated efferocytosis. Conversely, light-mediated depolymerization of microtubules causes microglia to lose their typical branched morphology and switch to an alternative mode of engulfment, characterized by directed migration towards target neurons, revealing unexpected plasticity in their phagocytic ability. Finally, building on work focusing on the establishment of the immunological synapse, we identified a conserved signalling pathway underlying centrosomal movement in engulfing microglia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FreiBox: A versatile open-source behavioral setup for investigating the neuronal correlates of behavioral flexibility via 1-photon imaging in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                To survive in a complex and changing environment, animals must adapt their behavior. This ability is called behavioral flexibility and is classically evaluated by a reversal learning paradigm. During such a paradigm, the animals adapt their behavior according to a change of the reward contingencies. To study these complex cognitive functions (from outcome evaluation to motor adaptation), we developed a versatile, low-cost, open-source platform, allowing us to investigate the neuronal correlates of behavioral flexibility with 1-photon calcium imaging. This platform consists of FreiBox, a novel low-cost Arduino behavioral setup, as well as further open-source tools which we developed and integrated into our framework. FreiBox is controlled by a custom Python interface and integrates a new licking sensor (Strain Gauge lickometer) for controlling spatial licking behavioral tasks. In addition to allowing both discriminative and serial reversal learning, the Arduino can track mouse licking behavior in real time to control task events in a sub-millisecond timescale. To complete our setup, we also developed and validated an affordable commutator, crucial for recording calcium imaging with the Miniscope V4 in freely moving mice. Further, we demonstrated that FreiBox can be associated with 1-photon imaging and other open-source initiatives (e.g., Open Ephys), to form a versatile platform for exploring the neuronal substrates of licking based behavioral flexibility in mice. The combination of the FreiBox behavioral setup and our low-cost commutator represents a highly competitive and complementary addition to the recently emerging battery of open-source initiatives.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hungry for compliments? Ghrelin is not associated with neural responses to social rewards or their pleasantness</a></h4>

              
                The stomach-derived hormone ghrelin motivates food search and stimulates food consumption, with highest plasma concentrations before a meal and lowest shortly after. However, ghrelin also appears to affect the value of non-food rewards such as interaction with rat conspecifics, and monetary rewards in humans. The present pre-registered study investigated how nutritional state and ghrelin concentrations are related to the subjective and neural responses to social and non-social rewards.

In a cross-over feed- and-fast design, 67 healthy volunteers (20 women) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a hungry state and after a meal with repeated plasma ghrelin measurements. In task 1, participants received social rewards in the form of approving expert feedback, or non-social computer reward. In task 2, participants rated the pleasantness of compliments and neutral statements.

Nutritional state and ghrelin concentrations did not affect the response to social reward in task 1. In contrast, ventromedial prefrontal cortical activation to non-social rewards was reduced when the meal strongly suppressed ghrelin. In task 2, fasting increased activation in the right ventral striatum during all statements, but ghrelin concentrations were neither associated with brain activation nor with experienced pleasantness. Complementary Bayesian analyses provided moderate evidence for a lack of correlation between ghrelin concentrations and behavioral and neural responses to social rewards, but moderate evidence for an association between ghrelin and non-social rewards.

This suggests that ghrelins influence may be restricted to non-social rewards. Social rewards implemented via social recognition and affirmation may be too abstract and complex to be susceptible to ghrelins influence. In contrast, the non-social reward was associated with the expectation of a material object that was handed out after the experiment. This may indicate that ghrelin might be involved in anticipatory rather than consummatory phases of reward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deducing ensemble dynamics and information flow from the whole-brain imaging data</a></h4>

              
                Recent development of large-scale activity imaging of neuronal ensembles provides opportunities for understanding how activity patterns are generated in the brain and how information is transmitted between neurons or neuronal ensembles. However, methodologies for extracting the component properties that generate overall dynamics are still limited. In this study, the results of time-lapse 3D imaging (4D imaging) of head neurons of the nematode C. elegans were analyzed by hitherto unemployed methodologies.

By combining time-delay embedding with independent component analysis, the whole-brain activities were decomposed to a small number of component dynamics. Results from multiple samples, where different subsets of neurons were observed, were further combined by matrix factorization, revealing common dynamics from neuronal activities that are apparently divergent across sampled animals. By this analysis, we could identify components that show common relationships across different samples and those that show relationships distinct between individual samples.

We also constructed a network model building on time-lagged prediction models of synaptic communications. This was achieved by dimension reduction of 4D imaging data using the general framework gKDR (gradient kernel dimension reduction). The model is able to decompose basal dynamics of the network. We further extended the model by incorporating probabilistic distribution, resulting in models that we call gKDR-GMM and gKDR-GP. The models capture the overall relationships of neural activities and reproduce the stochastic but coordinated dynamics in the neural network simulation. By virtual manipulation of individual neurons and synaptic contacts in this model, information flow could be estimated from whole-brain imaging results.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory Reweighting: A Common Mechanism for Subjective Visual Vertical and Cybersickness Susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                The malaise symptoms of cybersickness are thought to be related to the sensory conflict present in the exposure to virtual reality (VR) content. When there is a sensory mismatch in the process of sensory perception, the perceptual estimate has been shown to change based on a reweighting mechanism between the relative contributions of the individual sensory signals involved. In this study, the reweighting of vestibular and body signals was assessed before and after exposure to different typical VR experiences and sickness severity was measured to investigate the relationship between susceptibility to cybersickness and sensory reweighting. Participants reported whether a visually presented line was rotated clockwise or counterclockwise from vertical while laying on their side in a subjective visual vertical (SVV) task. Task performance was recorded prior to VR exposure and after a low and high intensity VR game. The results show that the SVV was significantly shifted away from the body representation of upright and towards the vestibular signal after exposure to the high intensity VR game. Cybersickness measured using the fast motion sickness (FMS) scale found that sickness severity ratings were higher in the high intensity compared to the low intensity experience. The change in SVV from baseline after each VR exposure modelled using a simple 3-parameter gaussian regression fit was found to explain 49.5% of the variance in the FMS ratings. These results highlight the aftereffects of VR for sensory perception and suggests a potential relationship between the susceptibility to cybersickness and sensory reweighting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Geometry of population activity in spiking networks with low-rank structure</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent network models are instrumental in investigating how behaviorally-relevant computations emerge from collective neural dynamics. A recently developed class of models based on low-rank connectivity provides an analytically tractable framework for understanding of how connectivity structure determines the geometry of low-dimensional dynamics and the ensuing computations. Such models however lack some fundamental biological constraints, and in particular represent individual neurons in terms of abstract units that communicate through continuous firing rates rather than discrete action potentials. Here we examine how far the theoretical insights obtained from low-rank rate networks transfer to more biologically plausible networks of spiking neurons. Adding a low-rank structure on top of random excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, we systematically compare the geometry of activity in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons to rate networks with statistically equivalent low-rank connectivity. We show that the mean-field predictions of rate networks allow us to identify low-dimensional dynamics at constant population-average activity in spiking networks, as well as novel non-linear regimes of activity such as out-of-phase oscillations and slow manifolds. We finally exploit these results to directly build spiking networks that perform nonlinear computations.

Author summaryBehaviorally relevant information processing is believed to emerge from interactions among neurons forming networks in the brain, and computational modeling is an important approach for understanding this process. Models of neuronal networks have been developed at different levels of detail, with typically a trade off between analytic tractability and biological realism. The relation between network connectivity, dynamics and computations is best understood in abstract models where individual neurons are represented as simplified units with continuous firing activity. Here we examine how far the results obtained in a specific, analytically-tractable class of rate models extend to more biologically realistic spiking networks where neurons interact through discrete action potentials. Our results show that abstract rate models provide accurate predictions for the collective dynamics and the resulting computations in more biologically faithful spiking networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Effect of Intracerebroventricular Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 on gene expression in the Rats' Hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a key regulator of systemic phosphate homeostasis, but also an interplay with glucose metabolism has been suggested. Several studies implicate a function of FGF23 in the brain, and indeed we have recently identified FGF23 protein in several brain areas in rats, such as the hypothalamus, third ventricle and choroid plexus. In the current study, we aimed to determine the effect of an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of FGF23 in the third ventricle of rats on hypothalamic genes involved in glucose regulation. In addition, we assessed whether glycerol can be used safely for icv injections as glycerol is used as a stabilizing compound for FGF23 protein.

Adult Wistar rats received an icv injection of recombinant rat FGF23 or vehicle. Dose dependent behavioral changes, suggestive of stress, were observed directly after infusion of FGF23. After 60 min animals were sacrificed and the arcuate nucleus, lateral hypothalamus and choroid plexus were isolated. In these brain regions gene expression was determined of the FGF23 receptor complex (FGFR1, Klotho), NPY, POMC, phosphate transporters (SLC20 and SLC34 families) and markers of cellular ER stress (ATF4 and the ratio of spliced/unspliced XBP1).

We showed that glycerol is well tolerated as stabilizer for icv injections. In FGF23-treated animals, cellular ER stress markers were increased in the arcuate nucleus. FGF23 injection did not affect expression of its receptor complex, NPY, POMC, or phosphate transporters. Future studies are warranted to investigate the effect of FGF23 in the brain on the protein level and on neuronal activation.

                A neurons input-output function is commonly understood in terms of the fluctuation-driven and mean-driven regimes. Here we investigate how active dendrites falling in either regime shape the input-output function and find that dendritic input primarily controls interspike interval dispersion, a prediction that is validated with dual patch clamp recordings. This phenomenon can be understood by considering that neurons display not two, but three fundamental operating regimes, depending on whether dendritic spikes or the somatic input reach threshold.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cystatin F (Cst7) drives sex-dependent changes in microglia in an amyloid-driven model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Microglial endolysosomal (dys)function is strongly implicated in neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic studies show that a microglial state characterised by a set of genes involved in endolysosomal function is induced in both mouse Alzheimers Disease (AD) models and in human AD brain and that the onset of this state is emphasized in females. Cst7 (encoding protein Cystatin F) is among the most highly upregulated genes in these microglia. However, despite such striking and robust upregulation, the sex-specific function of Cst7 in neurodegenerative disease is not understood. Here, we crossed Cst7-/- mice with the AppNL-G-F mouse to test the role of Cst7 in a model of amyloid-driven AD. Surprisingly, we found that Cst7 plays a sexually dimorphic role regulating microglia in this model. In females, Cst7-deficient microglia had greater endolysosomal gene expression, lysosomal burden, and amyloid beta (A{beta}) burden in vivo and were more phagocytic in vitro. However, in males, Cst7-deficient microglia were less inflammatory and had a reduction in lysosomal burden but had no change in A{beta} burden. This study has important implications for AD research, confirming the functional role of a gene which is commonly upregulated in disease models, but also raising crucial questions on sexual dimorphism in neurodegenerative disease and the interplay between endolysosomal and inflammatory pathways in AD pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phencyclidine disrupts neural coordination and cognitive control by dysregulating translation</a></h4>

              
                Phencyclidine (PCP) causes psychosis, is abused with increasing frequency, and was extensively used in antipsychotic drug discovery, but how this uncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist impairs cognition remains unknown. Using rats and mice, we report that, consistent with ionotropic actions, PCP discoordinated hippocampus CA1 action potential discharge and impaired a well-learned hippocampus-dependent active place avoidance that requires cognitive control. However, consistent with metabotropic actions, PCP exaggerated protein-synthesis dependent DHPG-induced mGluR-LTD. Pretreatment with anisomycin or the group I mGluR antagonist MPEP, both of which repress translation, prevented the discoordination and PCP-induced cognitive and sensorimotor impairments. Both PCP and the NR2A-containing NMDA-receptor antagonist NVP-AAM077 unbalanced translation that engages the AKT, mTOR and 4EBP1 translation machinery and increased protein synthesis, whereas the NR2B-containing antagonist Ro25-6981 did not. We conclude that PCP dysregulates translation acting through NR2A receptor subtypes recruiting group 1 mGluR signaling pathways, leading to the neural discoordination that is central to the cognitive and sensorimotor impairments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subcellular proteome of radial glia reveals non-muscle myosins control basal endfeet to mediate interneuron organization</a></h4>

              
                Radial glial cells (RGCs) are essential for the generation and organization of neurons in the cerebral cortex. RGCs have an elongated bipolar morphology with basal and apical endfeet which reside in distinct niches. Yet, how this subcellular compartmentalization of RGCs controls cortical development is largely unknown. Here, we employ in vivo proximity labeling using unfused BirA to generate the first subcellular proteome of RGCs and uncover new principles governing local control of cortical development. We discover a cohort of proteins that are significantly enriched in RGC basal endfeet, with MYH9 and MYH10 among the most abundant. Myh9 and Myh10 transcripts also localize to endfeet with distinct temporal dynamics. Although they each encode isoforms of non-muscle myosin II heavy chain, Myh9 and Myh10 have drastically different requirements for RGC integrity. Myh9 loss from RGCs decreases branching complexity and causes endfoot protrusion through the basement membrane. In contrast, Myh10 controls endfoot adhesion, as mutants have unattached apical and basal endfeet. Finally, we show that Myh9- and Myh10-mediated regulation of RGC complexity and endfoot position non-cell autonomously controls interneuron number and organization in the marginal zone. Our study demonstrates the utility of in vivo proximity labeling for dissecting local control of complex systems, and reveals new mechanisms for dictating RGC integrity and cortical architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Compensation and conversation in autism: atypical connectivity supports typical behavior</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundIt is well-established that individuals with autism show atypical functional brain connectivity. However, the role this plays in behavior, especially in naturalistic social settings, has remained unclear. Some atypical patterns may reflect core deficits, while others may instead compensate for deficits and promote adaptive behavior. Distinguishing these possibilities requires measuring the  typicality of spontaneous behavior and determining which connectivity patterns correlate with it.

MethodsThirty-nine male participants (19 autism, 20 typically-developed) engaged in 115 spontaneous conversations with an experimenter during fMRI scanning (Jasmin, et al., 2019, Brain). A classifier algorithm was trained to distinguish participants by diagnosis based on 81 semantic, affective and linguistic dimensions derived from their use of language. The algorithms certainty that a participant was in either the autism or typical group was used as a measure of task performance and compared with functional connectivity levels.

ResultsThe algorithm accurately classified participants (74%, P = .002), and its scores correlated with clinician-observed autism signs (ADOS) (rs = .56, P = .03). In support of a compensatory role, greater functional connectivity, most prominently between left-hemisphere social communication regions and right inferior frontal cortex, correlated with more typical language behaviour, only for the autism group (rs = .56, P = .01).

ConclusionWe report a simple and highly generalizable method for quantifying behavioral performance and neural compensation during complex spontaneous social behavior, without the need for an a priori benchmark. The findings suggest that functional connectivity increases in autism during communication reflect a neural compensation strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuroprotective potential of an Ayurvedic compound "Ras Sindoor" on Drosophila melanogaster model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting 1-2% of the global population with no cure to date. PD is characterized by accumulation of Lewy Bodies (LBs), which are caused due to aggregation of incorrectly folded -Synuclein, (SNCA). Another form of PD manifestation is characterized by loss of function of parkin, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Despite extensive research, the cause for onset and progression of PD remains unknown and current therapeutics mainly help manage the disease. An alternative line of treatment can be useful.

In this study, we have employed two different genetic models of Drosophila to screen for Ayurvedic compounds and found an Ayurvedic mercury based organo-metallic drug Ras-Sindoor has neuroprotective function. Our data indicate that characteristic locomotory dysfunction phenotype of PD is restored upon administration of the compound. Interestingly, RS fed flies also exhibit reduced transcript levels of initiator caspase dronc, which possibly prevents cell death in dopaminergic neurons. Additionally, RS fed PD model flies exhibit an enhanced life span. Our studies emphasize beneficial use of traditional Ayurvedic compounds as a holistic cure for PD like multifactorial diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics of temporal attention and expectation revealed by continuous tracking of visual cortical responses</a></h4>

              
                In processing a stream of visual information, visual perception is improved by temporal expectation, the timing predictability of sensory events, and by voluntary temporal attention, the prioritization of sensory events at behaviorally relevant time points. Although temporal expectation and attention are often treated as a single process, they can be dissociated and may be supported by distinct neural mechanisms. Here, we manipulated temporal attention while holding expectation constant and used concurrent MEG to disentangle their effects on visual cortical dynamics. Human observers attended to one of two sequentially presented visual targets embedded in flickering noise on each trial. Using the intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) of visually responsive channels as a measure of cortical response reliability, we found two neural signatures of temporal expectation and attention in visual cortical responses. First, a ramping increase in ITPC anticipated the temporally expected onset of visual targets whether attended or not, with the slope of the ramp modulated by temporal attention. Second, the transient evoked ITPC response to the first visual target was larger when that target was temporally attended. These data reveal distinct and complementary impacts of temporal attention and expectation on visual cortical responses across time.

                The striatum integrates dense neuromodulatory inputs from many brain regions to coordinate complex behaviors. This integration relies on the coordinated responses from distinct striatal cell types. While previous studies have characterized the cellular and molecular composition of the striatum using single-cell RNA-sequencing at distinct developmental timepoints, the molecular changes spanning embryonic through postnatal development at the single-cell level have not been examined. Here, we combine published mouse striatal single-cell datasets from both embryonic and postnatal timepoints to analyze the developmental trajectory patterns and transcription factor regulatory networks within striatal cell types. Using this integrated dataset, we found that dopamine receptor-1 expressing spiny projection neurons have an extended period of postnatal development with greater transcriptional complexity compared to dopamine receptor-2 expressing neurons. Moreover, we found the transcription factor, FOXP1, exerts indirect changes to oligodendrocytes. These data can be accessed and further analyzed through an interactive website (https://cells-test.gi.ucsc.edu/?ds=mouse-striatal-dev).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quadratic computations maintain neural specificity to natural stimuli across stages of visual processing</a></h4>

              
                Despite recent successes in machine vision, artificial recognition systems continue to be less robust than biological systems. The brittleness of artificial recognition system has been attributed to the linearity of the core operation that matches inputs to target patterns at each stage of the system. Here we analyze responses of neurons from the visual areas V1, V2, and V4 of the brain using the framework that incorporates quadratic computations into multi-stage models. These quadratic computations make it possible to capture local recurrent computation, and in particular, nonlinear suppressive interactions between visual features. We find that incorporating quadratic computation not only strongly improved predictive power of the resulting model, but also revealed several computation motifs that increased the selectivity of neural responses to natural stimuli. These motifs included the organization of excitatory and suppressive features along mutually exclusive hypotheses about incoming stimuli, such as orthogonal orientations or opposing motion directions. The balance between excitatory and suppressive features was largely maintained across brain regions. These results emphasize the importance and properties of quadratic computations that are necessary for achieving robust object recognition.

                Theoretical studies have long proposed that adaptation allows the brain to effectively use the limited response range of sensory neurons to encode widely varying natural inputs. However, despite this influential view, experimental studies have exclusively focused on how the neural code adapts to a range of stimuli lying along a single feature axis, such as orientation or contrast. Here, we performed electrical recordings in macaque visual cortex (area V4) to reveal significant adaptive changes in the neural code of single cells and populations across multiple feature axes. Both during free viewing and passive fixation, populations of cells improved their ability to encode image features after rapid exposure to stimuli lying on orthogonal feature axes even in the absence of initial tuning to these stimuli. These results reveal a remarkable adaptive capacity of visual cortical populations to improve network computations relevant for natural viewing despite the modularity of the functional cortical architecture.

                Experiments in flies, mice and humans suggest a significant role of impaired axonal transport in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD), however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown1,2. We report that the Swedish familial AD (FAD) mutation perturbs fast anterograde axonal transport of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by altering directionality of its movement. APP thus spends more time in retrograde movement and accumulates in the soma. We found that the Swedish mutation enhances recruitment of dynactin 1 to the APP transport assemblies. Given that dynactin 1 activates the retrograde motor dynein3, this hampers physiological anterograde axonal transport of APP. We last show that the Swedish mutation perturbs also the axonal transport of early endosomes, which rely on the same molecular motors as APP. Our findings reveal extensive impairment of the axonal transport pathways by a FAD mutation, which reflects dysregulation of the cargo motor assemblies.

                The recognition of objects is strongly facilitated when they are presented in the context of other objects (Biederman, 1972). Such contexts facilitate perception and induce expectations of context-congruent objects (Trapp & Bar, 2015). The neural mechanisms underlying these facilitatory effects of context on object processing, however, are not yet fully understood. In the present study, we investigate how context-induced expectations affect subsequent object processing. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and measured repetition suppression, a proxy for prediction error processing, for pairs of alternating or repeated object images, preceded by context-congruent, context-incongruent or neutral cues. We found a stronger repetition suppression in congruent as compared to incongruent or neutral cues in the object sensitive lateral occipital cortex. Interestingly, this effect was driven by enhanced responses to alternating stimulus pairs in the congruent contexts. In addition, in the congruency condition, we discovered significant functional connectivity between object-responsive and frontal cortical regions, as well as between object-responsive regions and the fusiform gyrus. Our findings unravel the neural mechanisms underlying context facilitation.

                Here we report SUPPORT (Statistically Unbiased Prediction utilizing sPatiOtempoRal information in imaging daTa), a self-supervised learning method for removing Poisson-Gaussian noise in voltage imaging data. SUPPORT is based on the insight that a pixel value in voltage imaging data is highly dependent on its spatially neighboring pixels in the same time frame, even when its temporally adjacent frames do not provide useful information for statistical prediction. Such spatiotemporal dependency is captured and utilized to accurately denoise voltage imaging data in which the existence of the action potential in a time frame cannot be inferred by the information in other frames. Through simulation and experiments, we show that SUPPORT enables precise denoising of voltage imaging data while preserving the underlying dynamics in the scene.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Measuring the non-selective effects of motor inhibition using isometric force recordings</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition is a key cognitive control mechanism. When rapidly exerted, inhibitory control has broad, non-selective motor effects, typically demonstrated using cortico-spinal excitability measurements (CSE) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For example, during rapid action-stopping, CSE is suppressed at both stopped and task-unrelated muscles. While such TMS-based CSE measurements provide crucial insights into the fronto-basal ganglia circuitry underlying non-selective inhibition, they have several downsides. TMS is contraindicated in many populations (e.g., epilepsy, deep-brain stimulation patients), has limited temporal resolution, produces distracting auditory and haptic stimulation, is difficult to combine with other imaging methods, and necessitates expensive, immobile equipment. Here, we attempted to measure the non-selective motor effects of inhibitory control using a method unaffected by these shortcomings. 30 participants exerted isometric force on a hand-held force transducer while performing a foot-response stop-signal task. Indeed, when foot movements were stopped, force output at the task-irrelevant hand was suppressed as well. Moreover, this non-selective reduction of isometric force was highly correlated with stop-signal performance and showed frequency dynamics similar to established inhibitory signatures typically found in neural and muscle recordings. Together, we demonstrate that isometric force recordings capture the non-selective effects of motor inhibition, enabling many applications that are impossible with TMS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural remodeling of peripheral taste neurons is fast and independent of taste cell turnover</a></h4>

              
                Taste bud cells are constantly replaced in taste buds as old cells die and new cells migrate into the bud. The perception of taste relies on new taste bud cells integrating with existing neural circuitry, yet how these new cells connect with a taste neuron is unknown. Do taste neurons remodel to accommodate taste bud cell renewal? If so, how much of the taste axon structure is fixed and how much remodels? We measured the motility and branching of individual taste arbors (the portion of the axon innervating taste buds) over time with two-photon in vivo microscopy. Terminal branches of taste arbors continuously and rapidly remodel within the taste bud. This remodeling is faster than predicted by taste bud cell renewal, with terminal branches added and lost concurrently. Surprisingly, ablating new taste cells with chemotherapeutic agents revealed that remodeling of the terminal branches of taste arbors does not rely of the renewal of taste bud cells. Although the arbor structure remodeling was fast and intrinsically controlled, no new arbors were added, and few were lost over 100 days. Taste neurons maintain a stable number of nerve arbors that are each capable of high-speed remodeling. Arbor structural plasticity would permit arbors to locate new taste bud cells, while stability of arbor number could support constancy in the degree of connectivity and function for each neuron over time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amyloid-beta peptides 40 and 42 employ distinct molecular pathways for cell entry and intracellular transit at the BBB endothelium</a></h4>

              
                Blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical portal regulating the bidirectional transport of amyloid beta (A{beta}) proteins between blood and brain. Disrupted trafficking at the BBB may not only promote the build-up of A{beta} plaques in the brain parenchyma, but also facilitate A{beta} accumulation within the BBB endothelium, which aggravates BBB dysfunction. Soluble A{beta}42:A{beta}40 ratios in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid have been reported to decrease during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Our previous publications demonstrated that trafficking of A{beta}42 and A{beta}40 at the BBB is distinct and is disrupted under various pathophysiological conditions. However, the intracellular mechanisms that allow BBB endothelium to differentially handle A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we identified mechanisms of fluorescently labeled A{beta} (F-A{beta}) endocytosis in polarized human cerebral microvascular endothelial (hCMEC/D3) cell monolayers using pharmacological inhibition and siRNA knock-down approaches. Further, intracellular transit of F-A{beta} following endocytosis was tracked using live cell imaging. Our studies demonstrated that both F-A{beta} peptides were internalized by BBB endothelial cells via energy, dynamin and actin dependent endocytosis. Interestingly, endocytosis of F-A{beta}40 is found to be clathrin-mediated, whereas F-A{beta}42 endocytosis is caveolae-mediated. Following endocytosis, both isoforms were sorted by the endo-lysosomal system. While A{beta}42 was shown to accumulate more in the lysosome which could lead to its higher degradation and/or aggregation at lower lysosomal pH, A{beta}40 demonstrated robust accumulation in recycling endosomes which may facilitate its transcytosis across the BBB. These results provide a mechanistic insight into the selective ability of BBB endothelium to transport A{beta}40 versus A{beta}42. This knowledge contributes to the understanding of molecular pathways underlying A{beta} accumulation in the BBB endothelium and associated cerebrovascular dysfunction as well as amyloid deposition in the brain parenchyma which are implicated in AD pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural noise is associated with age-related neural dedifferentiation</a></h4>

              
                Age-related neural dedifferentiation - reductions in the selectivity and precision of neural representations - contributes to cognitive aging and is thought to result from age increases in neural noise. This research has primarily used fMRI to examine age-related reductions in neural selectivity for different categories of visual stimuli. The present experiment used EEG to examine the link between neural noise and age-related neural dedifferentiation indexed by the scene-selective (P200) and face-selective (N170) ERP components. Young and older adults viewed images of scenes, objects, and faces during a 1-back task. Whereas both the P200 and N170 showed age-related slowing of peak latency, only the P200 showed age-related reductions in amplitude that were independent of visual and contrast acuity. We also examined the relationship between the ERP peak measures and an index of neural noise, namely the 1/f exponent of the frequency power spectrum. For the P200 amplitude, higher levels of neural noise were associated with smaller P200 amplitudes in young, but not older adults. In contrast, there was an age-invariant relationship between neural noise and N170 amplitude in the left hemisphere with higher levels of neural noise being associated reduced N170 amplitudes. While the present findings provide novel empirical evidence broadly consistent with predictions from computational models of neural dedifferentiation, the results also highlight potential limitations of the computational model that necessitate revision. The results also suggest that, at least for the P200, maintaining levels of neural noise similar to young adults might preserve levels of neural selectivity.

                Excitatory projections from the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) to the lateral habenula (LHb) drive aversive responses. We used Patch-seq guided multimodal classification to define the structural and functional heterogeneity of the LHA- LHb pathway. Our classification identified six glutamatergic neuron types with unique electrophysiological properties, molecular profiles, and projection patterns. We found that genetically-defined LHA-LHb neurons signal distinct aspects of emotional or naturalistic behaviors: Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons induce aversion, whereas Npy+ LHA-LHb neurons control rearing behavior. Repeated optogenetic drive of Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons induces a behaviorally persistent aversive state, and large-scale recordings showed a region-specific neural representation of the aversive state in the prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex. We further found that exposure to unpredictable mild shocks induced a sex- specific sensitivity to develop a stress state in female mice, which was associated with a specific shift in the intrinsic properties of bursting-type Esr1+ LHA-LHb neurons. In summary, we describe the diversity of LHA-LHb neuron types, and provide evidence for the role of Esr1+ neurons in aversion and sexually dimorphic stress sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network plasticity in the honey bee antennal lobe during odor presentation</a></h4>

              
                Odorant processing presents multiple parallels across animal species, and insects became relevant models for the study of olfactory coding because of the tractability of the underlying neural circuits. Within the insect brain, odorants are received by olfactory sensory neurons and processed by the antennal lobe network. Such a network comprises multiple nodes, named glomeruli, that receive sensory information and are interconnected by local interneurons participating in shaping the neural representation of an odorant. The study of functional connectivity between the nodes of a sensory network in vivo is a challenging task that requires simultaneous recording from multiple nodes at high temporal resolutions. Here, we used fast two-photon microscopy to follow the calcium dynamics of antennal lobe glomeruli and applied Granger causality analysis to assess the functional directed connectivity among network nodes during and after olfactory stimulation. Our findings show that there is a significant causal coupling between network nodes also in the absence of olfactory stimulation. However, connectivity patterns change upon odorant arrival, showing an increase in connection density and conveying odorant-specific information. Furthermore, we show that causal functional connectivity is unique in individual subjects, and cannot be detected upon artificial glomerular scrambling across individuals. This demonstrates that network states do not consist solely of correlations of mean glomerular responses, which are known to be conserved across bees.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep deprivation measured by voice analysis</a></h4>

              
                Using our voice represent an exquisitely intricate act, recruiting a host of cognitive and motor functions. As such, the voice is bound to reflect many aspects of the internal state of the speaker: personality, infections, stress, emotions. Here, we investigate whether sleep deprivation in otherwise normal and healthy persons can be detected through machine-learning analysis of vocal recordings. In contrast to previous approaches, we use fully generic acoustic features, derived from auditory-inspired models of sound processing, together with recently-developed machine learning interpretation techniques. Our results show that sleep deprivation can be accurately detected from generic acoustic features of vocal recordings. Two main different types of features were impacted by sleep deprivation: one related to speech rhythms, the other related to the timbre of the voice. We speculate that these features reflect two distinct physiological processes: the cognitive control of speech production and an inflammatory effect of the vocal apparatus. Crucially, the relative balance of these two effects varied widely for each individual, suggesting that the voice may be used as a "sleep stethoscope" to better understand the variety of idiosyncratic responses to sleep deprivation. Moreover, the method we outline is fully general and could be applied to the future investigation of any type of vocal biomarkers using machine-learning techniques.

                Barrel cortex integrates contra- and ipsilateral whiskers' inputs. While contralateral inputs depend on the thalamocortical innervation, ipsilateral ones are thought to rely on callosal axons. These are more abundant in the barrel cortex region bordering with S2 and containing the row A-whiskers representation, the row lying nearest to the facial midline. Here we ask what role this callosal axonal arrangement plays in ipsilateral tactile signalling. We found that novel object exploration with ipsilateral whiskers confines c-Fos expression within the highly callosal subregion. Targeting this area with in vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed neurons with uniquely strong ipsilateral responses dependent on the corpus callosum, as assessed by tetrodotoxin silencing and by optogenetic activation of the contralateral hemisphere. Still, in this area, stimulation of contra- or ipsilateral row A-whiskers evoked an indistinguishable response in some neurons, mostly located in layers 5/6, indicating their involvement in the midline representation of the whiskers' sensory space.

                Brain networks exist within the confines of resource limitations. As a result, a brain network must overcome metabolic costs of growing and sustaining the network within its physical space, while simultaneously implementing its required information processing. To observe the effect of these processes, we introduce the spatially-embedded recurrent neural network (seRNN). seRNNs learn basic task-related inferences while existing within a 3D Euclidean space, where the communication of constituent neurons is constrained by a sparse connectome. We find that seRNNs, similar to primate cerebral cortices, naturally converge on solving inferences using modular small-world networks, in which functionally similar units spatially configure themselves to utilize an energetically-efficient mixed-selective code. As all these features emerge in unison, seRNNs reveal how many common structural and functional brain motifs are strongly intertwined and can be attributed to basic biological optimization processes. seRNNs can serve as model systems to bridge between structural and functional research communities to move neuroscientific understanding forward.

                Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a conserved sexually dimorphic system regulating behaviors and physiologies. Decades of research concludes that AVP sex differentiation in mice occurs around birth when a gonadal surge of testosterone is converted to estrogen in male sexual dimorphic brain regions. We discovered that AVP neurons in the murine hypothalamus are sexually dimorphic much earlier than this surge, with male mice displaying more AVP neurons than females during neurogenesis at E11. In utero exposure to a pan-ER antagonist blocked AVP masculinization in males, whereas embryonic exogenous 17beta-estradiol or xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA) masculinized female AVP neurons, causing permanent masculinization effects on adult female AVP cell numbers, projections and intrinsic neuronal properties. Our data reveal that sexual dimorphism of hypothalamic AVP neurons is present from the earliest stages of their differentiation and challenges current dogma that masculinization of the male brain occurs around birth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A deep residual model for characterization of 5D spatiotemporal network dynamics reveals widespread spatiodynamic changes in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a severe brain disorder with serious symptoms including delusions, disorganized speech, and hallucinations that can have a long-term detrimental impact on different aspects of a patient's life. It is still unclear what the main cause of schizophrenia is, but a combination of altered brain connectivity and structure may play a role. Neuroimaging data has been useful in characterizing schizophrenia, but there has been very little work focused on voxel-wise changes in multiple brain networks over time, despite evidence that functional networks exhibit complex spatiotemporal changes over time within individual subjects. Recent studies have primarily focused on static (average) features of functional data or on temporal variations between fixed networks; however, such approaches are not able to capture multiple overlapping networks which change at the voxel level. In this work, we employ a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN) model to extract 53 different spatiotemporal networks each of which captures dynamism within various domains including subcortical, cerebellar, visual, sensori-motor, auditory, cognitive control, and default mode. We apply this approach to study spatiotemporal brain dynamism at the voxel level within multiple functional networks extracted from a large functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset of individuals with schizophrenia (N=708) and controls (N=510). Our analysis reveals widespread group level differences across multiple networks and spatiotemporal features including voxel-wise variability, magnitude, and temporal functional network connectivity in widespread regions expected to be impacted by the disorder. We compare with typical average spatial amplitude and show highly structured and neuroanatomically relevant results are missed if one does not consider the voxel-wise spatial dynamics. Importantly, our approach can summarize static, temporal dynamic, spatial dynamic, and spatiotemporal dynamics features, thus proving a powerful approach to unify and compare these various perspectives. In sum, we show the proposed approach highlights the importance of accounting for both temporal and spatial dynamism in whole brain neuroimaging data generally, shows a high-level of sensitivity to schizophrenia highlighting global but spatially unique dynamics showing group differences, and may be especially important in studies focused on the development of brain-based biomarkers.

	<p>The potential for the misdiagnosis of giftedness as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been well documented, as has the clinical diagnostic profile of individuals with both giftedness and ADHD. This study aimed to examine parents&amp;amp;rsquo; and teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; responses to the Conners 3 behavioral rating scale of gifted students with ADHD compared to gifted students without ADHD and non-gifted students with ADHD. Ninety-two children aged 6 to 12 years were included in the study. On the basis of clinical assessments utilizing the K-SADS, the WISC-V, and other neurocognitive tests, the students were split into three groups: gifted/ADHD (n = 35), ADHD (n = 35), and gifted (n = 22). The results revealed that mothers&amp;amp;rsquo;, fathers&amp;amp;rsquo;, and teachers&amp;amp;rsquo; responses to the Conners 3 rating scale distinguished well between the gifted group and the other two groups, but not between the gifted/ADHD and ADHD groups. The learning difficulties observed by teachers was the most significant element that distinguished gifted/ADHD students from non-gifted ADHD students. Other results indicated that mothers and fathers reported more inattention problems in their gifted/ADHD children than teachers. Additionally, mothers tended to observe more learning and executive function problems in their gifted/ADHD children than teachers did. These findings highlight the importance of multiple informants complementing each other in the assessment process for ADHD in a gifted context to counteract the masking effect between giftedness and ADHD.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep is considered an essential component related to physiological and psychological recovery in athletes and particularly in basketball, given the impact of condensed travel and game schedules on player health and performance. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to examine studies published to date on sleep and basketball performance. Methodology: All scientific articles that reported a relationship between sleep and its possible impact on performance in basketball are included. The research processes followed the PRISMA criteria, and the relevant articles were extracted (PubMed, WOS, Scopus) as of December 31, 2021. Results: Twenty-eight articles were selected for inclusion and data extraction, with 27 demonstrating that sleep is a vital component in the recovery of basketball players and their corresponding on-court performance. Three central themes that we identified: (1) the quality and extension of sleep (the better quality and more extension of sleep, better performance and lower probability of injury); (2) influence of the players circadian rhythm (travel and game scheduling do not currently facilitate or take this into account); and (3) higher training loads and/or increased stress may jeopardize a subsequent good night&amp;amp;rsquo;s sleep, which should be taken into account when scheduling practices and workouts. Conclusion: The current systematic review regarding sleep and basketball performance and highlights that there is a strong relationship between both variables. Collectively, the evidence supports the critical influence of sleep on player recovery and basketball performance and risk for injury.</p>

	<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS) on the primary motor cortex (M1) has been reported to be effective in fibromyalgia (FM). Our previous works have shown hypometabolism of motor networks in FM using Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), which could contribute to pain symptoms. To investigate if a single Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) session can restore the reduced metabolism expected in FM patients, we compared metabolic activity in FM patients and controls during a finger-tapping task in basal condition, sham condition, and under anodal TDCS on M1. During the finger tapping task, a continuous wave 20 channel fNIRS system was placed across the bilateral central-frontal areas in 22 healthy controls and 54 FM patients. Subjects were randomly assigned to real TDCS or sham stimulation. The finger-tapping slowness did not change after real and sham stimulation. After real TDCS stimulation, FM patients showed an increased activation of cortical motor regions (t-statistic = &amp;amp;minus;2.5246, p-value = 0.0125 for the stimulated hemisphere and t-statistic = &amp;amp;minus;4.6638, p-value = 0.0001 for the non-stimulated hemisphere). The basal differences between FM and controls reverted after real TDCS, while this effect was not observed for sham stimulation. A single TDCS session of the cortical motor network seemed able to restore basic cortical hypometabolism in FM patients. Further studies could clarify the long-term effect of M1 stimulation on cortical metabolism, and its relevance in pain processing and clinical features.</p>

	<p>Children and youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) display difficulties recognizing and interacting with behavioral expressions of emotion, a deficit that makes social interaction problematic. Social skills training is foundational to the treatment of ASD, yet this intervention is costly, time-consuming, lacks objectivity, and is difficult to deliver in real-world settings. This pilot project investigated the use of an immersive virtual reality (IVR) headset to simulate real-world social interactions for children/youth with ASD. The primary objective was to describe gaze fixation and visual search behaviors during the simulated activity. Ten participants were enrolled and completed one social-skills training session in the IVR. The results demonstrate differential patterns between participants with mild, moderate, and severe ASD in the location and duration of gaze fixation as well as the patterns of visual searching. Although the results are preliminary, these differences may shed light on phenotypes within the continuum of ASD. Additionally, there may be value in quantifying gaze and visual search behaviors as an objective metric of interventional effectiveness for social-skills training therapy.</p>

	<p>Objective: Higher fasting glucose is thought to be associated with adverse outcome in patients receiving endovascular treatment (EVT), while the effect of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) on outcome is controversial. We combined fasting blood glucose (FBG) with HbA1c and evaluated their relationship with the three-month functional outcome in patients who underwent EVT. Methods: Data from 739 consecutive ischemic stroke patients who underwent EVT from April 2015 to August 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. HbA1c was used to estimate the chronic glucose level according to the following formula: chronic glucose level (mg/dL) = 28.7 &amp;amp;times; HbA1c (%) &amp;amp;minus; 6.7. Patients were split into two groups in accordance with the three-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were utilized to investigate the association of outcome with blood glucose and to identify other predictors of prognosis. Results: Patients with poor outcome had significantly higher FBG, chronic glycemia, FBG/chronic glycemic ratio, and difference between FBG and chronic glycemia (&amp;amp;Delta;A-C). FBG, the FBG/chronic glycemic ratio, and &amp;amp;Delta;A-C remained to be associated with poor outcome after adjustment. We then established a glycemia-based nomogram with a concordance index of 0.841, and it showed favorable clinical utility according to decision curve analysis. Conclusions: Glycemia after EVT was connected with the functional outcome and a nomogram based on glycemia may be used to predict prognosis in stroke patients treated with EVT.</p>

	<p>The perception of physical exertion is the cognitive sensation of work demands associated with voluntary muscular actions. Measurements of exerted force are crucial for avoiding the risk of overexertion and understanding human physical capability. For this purpose, various physiological measures have been used; however, the state-of-the-art in-force exertion evaluation lacks assessments of underlying neurophysiological signals. The current study applied a graph theoretical approach to investigate the topological changes in the functional brain network induced by predefined force exertion levels for twelve female participants during an isometric arm task and rated their perceived physical comfort levels. The functional connectivity under predefined force exertion levels was assessed using the coherence method for 84 anatomical brain regions of interest at the electroencephalogram (EEG) source level. Then, graph measures were calculated to quantify the network topology for two frequency bands. The results showed that high-level force exertions are associated with brain networks characterized by more significant clustering coefficients (6%), greater modularity (5%), higher global efficiency (9%), and less distance synchronization (25%) under alpha coherence. This study on the neurophysiological basis of physical exertions with various force levels suggests that brain regions communicate and cooperate higher when muscle force exertions increase to meet the demands of physically challenging tasks.</p>

	<p>Many contradictory theories regarding epileptogenesis in idiopathic generalized epilepsy have been proposed. This study aims to define the network that takes part in the formation of the spike-wave discharges in patients with generalized tonic&amp;amp;ndash;clonic seizures alone (GTCSa) and elucidate the network characteristics. Furthermore, we intend to define the most influential brain areas and clarify the connectivity pattern among them. The data were collected from 23 patients with GTCSa utilizing low-density electroencephalogram (EEG). The source localization of generalized spike-wave discharges (GSWDs) was conducted using the Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) methodology. Cortical connectivity was calculated utilizing the imaginary part of coherence. The network characteristics were investigated through small-world propensity and the integrated value of influence (IVI). Source localization analysis estimated that most sources of GSWDs were in the superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate. Graph theory analysis revealed that epileptic sources created a network that tended to be regularized during generalized spike-wave activity. The IVI analysis concluded that the most influential nodes were the left insular gyrus and the left inferior parietal gyrus at 3 and 4 Hz, respectively. In conclusion, some nodes acted mainly as generators of GSWDs and others as influential ones across the whole network.</p>

	<p>According to the shallow structure hypothesis (SSH), adult L2 learners rely more on lexical-semantic and pragmatic information but less so on syntactic information in online language processing, ending up with shallower syntactic representation. To test the SSH, we conducted an eye-tracking experiment on L1-Korean L2-Chinese learners with native Chinese speakers as the baseline, investigating their processing of Chinese base-generated-topic sentences (BGT). The results show that both the intermediate and advanced Korean learners of Chinese are sensitive to and can make use of syntactic information, but only the advanced learners are sensitive to the semantic constraint when processing Chinese BGT sentences, providing evidence against the SSH.</p>

	<p>Aims: This intervention study evaluates the effect of a virtual reality cognition training system (VRCTS) on improving cognitive function and clinical symptoms in Han Chinese patients with schizophrenia in the remission stage. Methods: Sixty-eight patients with schizophrenia in the remission stage were recruited for this study and were randomly allocated to either the virtual reality training (VRT) group or the treatment-as-usual (TAU) group. For the VRT group, patients received training with the VRCTS for two weeks and antipsychotic treatment as usual, while the TAU group only received antipsychotic treatment as usual. Cognitive function and clinical symptoms before and after the two-week treatment were assessed by the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery (MCCB), positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), and personal and social performance scale (PSP). Results: The results showed that (1) VRCTS could improve MCCB composite scores and scores on 2 out of 7 cognitive domains: visual learning as well as reasoning and problem solving. It was also observed that (2) VRCTS could alleviate general psychopathology symptoms of PANSS, but did not exert effects on positive and negative symptoms among patients with schizophrenia in the remission stage. Conclusions: A therapeutic effect of VRCTS was observed in patients with schizophrenia in the remission stage. This may improve cognitive function and general psychopathological symptoms. Trial registration: China Clinical Trial Registry, ChiVTR1800016121.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of beliefs, knowledge, and attitude on herbal medicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey in Indonesia [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herbal medicines are gaining a greater degree of popularity as complementary and alternative medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, there is a lack of data concerning the rationale for and factors influencing their use. Methods: A cross-sectional community-based online study involving 1,621 participants was conducted to explore the effects of magical health beliefs, holistic health beliefs, knowledge, and pro- complementary alternative medicine (CAM) attitudes on herbal medicine use in the Indonesian population. Results: Logistic regression findings showed that knowledge about herbal medicines was independently and positively associated with herbal medicine use to a greater extent than herbal medicine non-use (adjusted odds ratio; AOR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval; CI = 1.16 to 1.24). The participants who used herbal medicines had a greater magical health belief score than herbal medicine non-users, with AOR = 1.03 and 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.06. Moreover, holistic health beliefs and pro-CAM attitudes were also found to be independently associated with herbal medicine use. Conclusion: Magical health beliefs, holistic health belief, knowledge, and attitudes are key factor in determining the herbal medicine use. Our findings offer crucial implications for health policymakers to encourage the use of herbal medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Determining staffing needs for improving primary health care service delivery in Kaduna State, Nigeria [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The equitable distribution of a skilled health workforce is critical to health service delivery. Kaduna state has taken significant steps to revamp the primary health care system to ensure access to health care for its populace. However, these investments are yet to yield the desired outcomes due to health workforce shortages and the inequitable distribution of those available. Methods: A Workload Indicator for Staffing Need (WISN) study was conducted at Kaduna state's primary health care level. The study focused on estimating staffing requirements; Nurses/Midwives and Community Health Worker practitioners, Community Health Officers, Community Health Extension Workers, and Junior Community Health Extension Workers in all government-prioritised primary health care facilities. A total of ten focal primary health care facilities in Kaduna North Local Government Area (LGA) were included in the study. Results: Findings from the study revealed a shortage of Nurses/Midwives and Community Health Workers across the study facilities. For the Nurse/Midwife staffing category, nine of the ten PHCs have a WISN ratio < 1, indicating that the number of staff in the Nurse/Midwife category is insufficient to cope with the workload. In two of the ten primary health care facilities, there is an excess in the number of CHWs available; a WISN ratio > 1 was calculated. Conclusion: The WISN study highlights staffing needs in Kaduna State's government-prioritised primary health care facilities. This evidence establishes the basis for applying an evidence-based approach to determining staffing needs across the primary health care sector in the State to guide workforce planning strategies and future investments in the health sector. The World Health Organisation (WHO) WISN tool is useful for estimating staffing needs required to cope with workload pressures, particularly in a resource-constrained environment like Kaduna State.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Outward investment of Portuguese small and medium enterprises in the Central and Eastern European countries: motivations and challenges [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper identifies the determinant factors of Portuguese investment in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. We assume that investment abroad is motivated by business opportunities, and the quality-price ratio of the workforce. Methods: To this end, we used a qualitative methodology composed of 6 case studies, based on interviews and surveys with the managers of the Portuguese firms investing in those three economies. Results: Despite the business opportunities, Portuguese investment directed towards these economies is negligible, due, in part, to the geographic and cultural distance. However, the economic and political stability, combined with market size and growth potential are undeniable attraction factors for Portuguese investors. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), due to their flexible conditions that allow changes in the activity, and the strong trend towards outsourcing, to the detriment of the manufacturing industry, are the primary focus of international investment. This trend, although common to several sectors, has shown greater dynamism in the banking and financial sector. Conclusions: The results suggest market-oriented investments aiming at growth and expansion.  The vast Polish market is the one that most attracted Portuguese investors. The hybrid feature of some strategies can align with the cautious attitude towards the investment translated into cooperation agreements with financial institutions for funding, the market learning process, and the training of the personnel. The anticipation of the installation over potential competitors, the experience in production and international markets, the price-quality ratio, the capacity of product adaptation and the design were considered important sources of competitive advantage that motivated the investment. The greatest difficulties during this process were language and the complexity of legislation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 and the role of close contact in transmission: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been reported to be associated with close contact with infected individuals. However, the mechanistic pathway for transmission in close contact settings is unclear. Our objective was to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies assessing the role of close contact in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, PubMed and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on the QUADAS-2 criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We included 278 studies: 258 primary studies and 20 systematic reviews. The settings for primary studies were predominantly in home/quarantine facilities (39.5%) and acute care hospitals (12%). The overall reporting quality of the studies was low-to-moderate. There was significant heterogeneity in design and methodology. The frequency of attack rates (PCR testing) varied between 2.1-75%; attack rates were highest in prison and wedding venues, and in households. The frequency of secondary attack rates was 0.3-100% with rates highest in home/quarantine settings. Three studies showed no transmission if the index case was a recurrent infection. Viral culture was performed in four studies of which three found replication-competent virus; culture results were negative where index cases had recurrent infections. Eighteen studies performed genomic sequencing with phylogenetic analysis – the completeness of genomic similarity ranged from 77-100%. Findings from systematic reviews showed that children were significantly less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 and household contact was associated with a significantly increased risk of infection. Conclusions: The evidence from published studies demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in close contact settings. The risk of transmission is greater in household contacts. There was a wide variation in methodology. Standardized guidelines for reporting transmission in close contact settings should be developed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Saudi Arabian students in postgraduate dental programs: Investigating factors associated with burnout [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burnout related to emotional and physical study or work demands affects an individual’s performance and wellbeing. This study focused on Saudi Arabian dental residents studying in the United States and the United Kingdom who are faced with many challenges in the pursuit of a higher education degree.  Methods: A survey including demographic and Maslach Burnout inventory (MBI) questions was distributed to assess this population’s level of burnout. The MBI has been widely used in the literature to assess three components of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DEP), and (diminished) personal accomplishment (PA). Potential predictors of burnout level, tested for statistical significance, included: (1) country (US vs UK), (2) hours of work, (3) sponsorship status, (4) marital status (5) gender, and (6) prior work experience.  Results: The number of participants from the UK was 29 and from the US was 64 (n=93). The total number of participants who completed the survey was 87. Using multiple regression analyses, those found to predict EE included hours of work, sponsorship status, and gender. Only gender was found to predict PA. None of the variables were predictive of DEP. Moreover, after controlling for the demographic variables, the country where studying did not help account for the level of burnout.  Conclusion: In the literature, burnout was found to be prevalent among dental postgraduate students. This study suggests that Saudi Arabian dental residents experience high burnout due to emotional exhaustion when compared to other medical professionals. Moreover, Female residents are more likely to report experiencing burnout than their male counterparts. Limitations of the study, implications for practice and suggestions for further research are offered in the discussion.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring a spatial code of cell-cell interactions across a whole animal body</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erick Armingol, Abbas Ghaddar, Chintan J. Joshi, Hratch Baghdassarian, Isaac Shamie, Jason Chan, Hsuan-Lin Her, Samuel Berhanu, Anushka Dar, Fabiola Rodriguez-Armstrong, Olivia Yang, Eyleen J. O’Rourke, Nathan E. Lewis</p>

Cell-cell interactions shape cellular function and ultimately organismal phenotype. Interacting cells can sense their mutual distance using combinations of ligand-receptor pairs, suggesting the existence of a spatial code, i.e., signals encoding spatial properties of cellular organization. However, this code driving and sustaining the spatial organization of cells remains to be elucidated. Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions from the transcriptomes of the cell types across the whole body of a multicellular organism. As core of this framework, we introduce our tool <i>cell2cell</i>, which uses the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs to compute the potential for intercellular interactions, and we test it across the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>’ body. Leveraging a 3D atlas of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>’ cells, we also implement a genetic algorithm to identify the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells across the whole body. Validating the spatial code extracted with this strategy, the resulting intercellular distances are negatively correlated with the inferred cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, for selected cell-cell and ligand-receptor pairs, we experimentally confirm the communicatory behavior inferred with <i>cell2cell</i> and the genetic algorithm. Thus, our framework helps identify a code that predicts the spatial organization of cells across a whole-animal body.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Soft disorder modulates the assembly path of protein complexes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Beatriz Seoane, Alessandra Carbone</p>

The relationship between interactions, flexibility and disorder in proteins has been explored from many angles over the years: folding upon binding, flexibility of the core relative to the periphery, entropy changes, etc. In this work, we provide statistical evidence for the involvement of highly mobile and disordered regions in complex assembly. We ordered the entire set of X-ray crystallographic structures in the Protein Data Bank into hierarchies of progressive interactions involving identical or very similar protein chains, yielding 40205 hierarchies of protein complexes with increasing numbers of partners. We then examine them as proxies for the assembly pathways. Using this database, we show that upon oligomerisation, the new interfaces tend to be observed at residues that were characterised as softly disordered (flexible, amorphous or missing residues) in the complexes preceding them in the hierarchy. We also rule out the possibility that this correlation is just a surface effect by restricting the analysis to residues on the surface of the complexes. Interestingly, we find that the location of soft disordered residues in the sequence changes as the number of partners increases. Our results show that there is a general mechanism for protein assembly that involves soft disorder and modulates the way protein complexes are assembled. This work highlights the difficulty of predicting the structure of large protein complexes from sequence and emphasises the importance of linking predictors of soft disorder to the next generation of predictors of complex structure. Finally, we investigate the relationship between the Alphafold2’s confidence metric pLDDT for structure prediction in unbound versus bound structures, and soft disorder. We show a strong correlation between Alphafold2 low confidence residues and the union of all regions of soft disorder observed in the hierarchy. This paves the way for using the pLDDT metric as a proxy for predicting interfaces and assembly paths.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational analysis of 5-fluorouracil anti-tumor activity in colon cancer using a mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chenhui Ma, Alex Almasan, Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu</p>

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a standard chemotherapeutic agent to treat solid cancers such as breast, colon, head, and neck. Computational modeling plays an essential role in predicting the outcome of chemotherapy and developing optimal dosing strategies. We developed an integrated mechanistic pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model examining the influence of 5-FU, as an S-phase specific double-strand break (DSB)-inducing agent, on tumor proliferation. The proposed mechanistic PK/PD model simulates the dynamics of critical intermediate components and provides the accurate tumor response prediction. The integrated model is composed of PK, cellular, and tumor growth inhibition (TGI) sub-models, quantitatively capturing the essential drug-related physiological processes. In the cellular model, thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition, resultant deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool imbalance, and DSB induction are considered, as well as 5-FU incorporation into RNA and DNA. The amount of 5-FU anabolites and DSBs were modeled to drive the kinetics of the pharmacological tumor response. Model parameters were estimated by fitting to literature data. Our simulation results successfully describe the kinetics of the intermediates regulating the 5-FU cytotoxic events and the pattern of tumor suppression. The comprehensive model simulated the tumor volume change under various dose regimens, and its generalizability was attested by comparing it with literature data. The potential causes of the tumor resistance to 5-FU are also investigated through Monte Carlo analysis. The simulation of various dosage regimens helps quantify the relationship between treatment protocols and chemotherapy potency, which will lead to the development of efficacy optimization.

Scientific research increasingly relies on open source software (OSS). Funding OSS development requires intentional focus on issues of scholarly credit, unique forms of labor, maintenance, governance, and inclusive community-building. Such issues cut across different scientific disciplines that make them of interest to a variety of funders and institutions but may present challenges in understanding generalized needs. Here we present 10 simple rules for investing in scientific OSS and the teams who build and maintain it.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A neurocomputational theory of action regulation predicts motor behavior in neurotypical individuals and patients with Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

Surviving in an uncertain environment requires not only the ability to select the best action, but also the flexibility to withhold inappropriate actions when the environmental conditions change. Although selecting and withholding actions have been extensively studied in both human and animals, there is still lack of consensus on the mechanism underlying these action regulation functions, and more importantly, how they inter-relate. A critical gap impeding progress is the lack of a computational theory that will integrate the mechanisms of action regulation into a unified framework. The current study aims to advance our understanding by developing a neurodynamical computational theory that models the mechanism of action regulation that involves suppressing responses, and predicts how disruption of this mechanism can lead to motor deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. We tested the model predictions in neurotypical individuals and PD patients in three behavioral tasks that involve free action selection between two opposed directions, action selection in the presence of conflicting information and abandoning an ongoing action when a stop signal is presented. Our results and theory suggest an integrated mechanism of action regulation that affects both action initiation and inhibition. When this mechanism is disrupted, motor behavior is affected, leading to longer reaction times and higher error rates in action inhibition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The pan-genome of Aspergillus fumigatus provides a high-resolution view of its population structure revealing high levels of lineage-specific diversity driven by recombination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lotus A. Lofgren, Brandon S. Ross, Robert A. Cramer, Jason E. Stajich</p>

<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> is a deadly agent of human fungal disease where virulence heterogeneity is thought to be at least partially structured by genetic variation between strains. While population genomic analyses based on reference genome alignments offer valuable insights into how gene variants are distributed across populations, these approaches fail to capture intraspecific variation in genes absent from the reference genome. Pan-genomic analyses based on de novo assemblies offer a promising alternative to reference-based genomics with the potential to address the full genetic repertoire of a species. Here, we evaluate 260 genome sequences of <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> including 62 newly sequenced strains, using a combination of population genomics, phylogenomics, and pan-genomics. Our results offer a high-resolution assessment of population structure and recombination frequency, phylogenetically structured gene presence–absence variation, evidence for metabolic specificity, and the distribution of putative antifungal resistance genes. Although <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> disperses primarily via asexual conidia, we identified extraordinarily high levels of recombination with the lowest linkage disequilibrium decay value reported for any fungal species to date. We provide evidence for 3 primary populations of <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i>, with recombination occurring only rarely between populations and often within them. These 3 populations are structured by both gene variation and distinct patterns of gene presence–absence with unique suites of accessory genes present exclusively in each clade. Accessory genes displayed functional enrichment for nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism suggesting that populations may be stratified by environmental niche specialization. Similarly, the distribution of antifungal resistance genes and resistance alleles were often structured by phylogeny. Altogether, the pan-genome of <i>A</i>. <i>fumigatus</i> represents one of the largest fungal pan-genomes reported to date including many genes unrepresented in the Af293 reference genome. These results highlight the inadequacy of relying on a single-reference genome-based approach for evaluating intraspecific variation and the power of combined genomic approaches to elucidate population structure, genetic diversity, and putative ecological drivers of clinically relevant fungi.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A qualitative study of the barriers to using blinding in in vivo experiments and suggestions for improvement</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natasha A. Karp, Esther J. Pearl, Emma J. Stringer, Chris Barkus, Jane Coates Ulrichsen, Nathalie Percie du Sert</p>

In animal experiments, blinding (also known as masking) is a methodological strategy to reduce the risk that scientists, animal care staff, or other staff involved in the research may consciously or subconsciously influence the outcome. Lack of masking has been shown to correlate with an overestimation of treatment efficacy and false positive findings. We conducted exploratory interviews across academic and a commercial setting to discuss the implementation of masking at four stages of the experiment: during allocation and intervention, during the conduct of the experiment, during the outcome assessment, and during the data analysis. The objective was to explore the awareness, engagement, perceptions, and the barriers to implementing masking in animal experiments. We conducted multiple interviews, to explore 30 different experiments, and found examples of excellent practice but also areas where masking was rarely implemented. Significant barriers arose from the operational and informatic systems implemented. These systems have prioritised the management of welfare without considering how to allow researchers to use masking in their experiments. For some experiments, there was a conflict between the management of welfare for an individual animal versus delivering a robust experiment where all animals are treated in the same manner. We identified other challenges related to the level of knowledge on the purpose of masking or the implementation and the work culture. The exploration of these issues provides insight into how we, as a community, can identify the most significant barriers in a given research environment. Here, we offer practical solutions to enable researchers to implement masking as standard. To move forward, we need both the individual scientists to embrace the use of masking and the facility managers and institutes to engage and provide a framework that supports the scientists.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Human striatal organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells recapitulate striatal development and compartments</a></h4>

The striatum links neuronal circuits in the human brain, and its malfunction causes neuronal disorders such as Huntington’s disease (HD). A human striatum model that recapitulates fetal striatal development is vital to decoding the pathogenesis of striatum-related neurological disorders and developing therapeutic strategies. Here, we developed a method to construct human striatal organoids (hStrOs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including hStrOs-derived assembloids. Our hStrOs partially replicated the fetal striatum and formed striosome and matrix-like compartments in vitro. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct striatal lineages in hStrOs, diverging from dorsal forebrain fate. Using hStrOs-derived assembloids, we replicated the striatal targeting projections from different brain parts. Furthermore, hStrOs can serve as hosts for striatal neuronal allografts to test allograft neuronal survival and functional integration. Our hStrOs are suitable for studying striatal development and related disorders, characterizing the neural circuitry between different brain regions, and testing therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">PTRN-1 (CAMSAP) and NOCA-2 (NINEIN) are required for microtubule polarity in Caenorhabditis elegans dendrites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Liu He, Lotte van Beem, Berend Snel, Casper C. Hoogenraad, Martin Harterink</p>

The neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton is key to establish axon-dendrite polarity. Dendrites are characterized by the presence of minus-end out microtubules. However, the mechanisms that organize these microtubules with the correct orientation are still poorly understood. Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> as a model system for microtubule organization, we characterized the role of 2 microtubule minus-end related proteins in this process, the microtubule minus-end stabilizing protein calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated <i>protein</i> (CAMSAP/PTRN-1), and the NINEIN homologue, NOCA-2 (noncentrosomal microtubule array). We found that CAMSAP and NINEIN function in parallel to mediate microtubule organization in dendrites. During dendrite outgrowth, RAB-11-positive vesicles localized to the dendrite tip to nucleate microtubules and function as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC). In the absence of either CAMSAP or NINEIN, we observed a low penetrance MTOC vesicles mislocalization to the cell body, and a nearly fully penetrant phenotype in double mutant animals. This suggests that both proteins are important for localizing the MTOC vesicles to the growing dendrite tip to organize microtubules minus-end out. Whereas NINEIN localizes to the MTOC vesicles where it is important for the recruitment of the microtubule nucleator γ-tubulin, CAMSAP localizes around the MTOC vesicles and is cotranslocated forward with the MTOC vesicles upon dendritic growth. Together, these results indicate that microtubule nucleation from the MTOC vesicles and microtubule stabilization are both important to localize the MTOC vesicles distally to organize dendritic microtubules minus-end out.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cbln1 regulates axon growth and guidance in multiple neural regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peng Han, Yuanchu She, Zhuoxuan Yang, Mengru Zhuang, Qingjun Wang, Xiaopeng Luo, Chaoqun Yin, Junda Zhu, Samie R. Jaffrey, Sheng-Jian Ji</p>

The accurate construction of neural circuits requires the precise control of axon growth and guidance, which is regulated by multiple growth and guidance cues during early nervous system development. It is generally thought that the growth and guidance cues that control the major steps of axon development have been defined. Here, we describe cerebellin-1 (Cbln1) as a novel cue that controls diverse aspects of axon growth and guidance throughout the central nervous system (CNS) by experiments using mouse and chick embryos. Cbln1 has previously been shown to function in late neural development to influence synapse organization. Here, we find that Cbln1 has an essential role in early neural development. Cbln1 is expressed on the axons and growth cones of developing commissural neurons and functions in an autocrine manner to promote axon growth. Cbln1 is also expressed in intermediate target tissues and functions as an attractive guidance cue. We find that these functions of Cbln1 are mediated by neurexin-2 (Nrxn2), which functions as the Cbln1 receptor for axon growth and guidance. In addition to the developing spinal cord, we further show that Cbln1 functions in diverse parts of the CNS with major roles in cerebellar parallel fiber growth and retinal ganglion cell axon guidance. Despite the prevailing role of Cbln1 as a synaptic organizer, our study discovers a new and unexpected function for Cbln1 as a general axon growth and guidance cue throughout the nervous system.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nociceptive afferents innervate the stomach and send signals centrally to the brain and locally to stomach tissues. Nociceptive afferents can be detected with a variety of different markers. In particular, substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide and is one of the most commonly used markers for nociceptive nerves in the somatic and visceral organs. However, the topographical distribution and morphological structure of SP-immunoreactive (SP-IR) axons and terminals in the whole stomach have not yet been fully determined. In this study, we labeled SP-IR axons and terminals in flat mounts of the ventral and dorsal halves of the stomach of mice. Flat-mount stomachs, including the longitudinal and circular muscular layers and the myenteric ganglionic plexus, were processed with SP primary antibody followed by fluorescent secondary antibody and then scanned using confocal microscopy. We found that (1) SP-IR axons and terminals formed an extensive network of fibers in the muscular layers and within the ganglia of the myenteric plexus of the whole stomach. (2) Many axons that ran in parallel with the long axes of the longitudinal and circular muscles were also immunoreactive for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). (3) SP-IR axons formed very dense terminal varicosities encircling individual neurons in the myenteric plexus; many of these were VAChT immunoreactive. (4) The regional density of SP-IR axons and terminals in the muscle and myenteric plexus varied in the following order from high to low: antrum-pylorus, corpus, fundus, and cardia. (5) In only the longitudinal and circular muscles, the regional density of SP-IR axon innervation from high to low were: antrum-pylorus, corpus, cardia, and fundus. (6) The innervation patterns of SP-IR axons and terminals in the ventral and dorsal stomach were comparable. Collectively, our data provide for the first time a map of the distribution and morphology of SP-IR axons and terminals in the whole stomach with single-cell/axon/synapse resolution. This work will establish an anatomical foundation for functional mapping of the SP-IR axon innervation of the stomach and its pathological remodeling in gastrointestinal diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Synaptic Loss in Frontotemporal Dementia Revealed by [11C]UCB‐J Positron Emission Tomography</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Synaptic loss is an early feature of neurodegenerative disease models, and is severe in post mortem clinical studies, including frontotemporal dementia. Positron emission tomography (PET) with radiotracers that bind to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A enables quantification of synaptic density in vivo. This study used [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET in participants with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), testing the hypothesis that synaptic loss is severe and related to clinical severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eleven participants with clinically probable bvFTD and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Participants underwent dynamic [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and a neuropsychological battery, including the revised Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination, and INECO frontal screening. General linear models compared [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential maps and gray matter volume between groups, and assessed associations between synaptic density and clinical severity in patients. Analyses were also performed using partial volume corrected [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding potential from regions of interest (ROIs).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with bvFTD showed severe synaptic loss compared to controls. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J binding was reduced bilaterally in medial and dorsolateral frontal regions, inferior frontal gyri, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex, and medial temporal lobe. Synaptic loss in the frontal and cingulate regions correlated significantly with cognitive impairments. Synaptic loss was more severe than atrophy. Results from ROI-based analyses mirrored the voxelwise results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In accordance with preclinical models, and human postmortem evidence, there is widespread frontotemporal loss of synapses in symptomatic bvFTD, in proportion to severity. [<sup>11</sup>C]UCB-J PET could support translational studies and experimental medicine strategies for new disease-modifying treatments for neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tubers affecting the fusiform face area are associated with autism diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is associated with focal brain “tubers” and a high incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The location of brain tubers associated with autism may provide insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of ASD symptoms.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We delineated tuber locations for 115 TSC participants with ASD (n = 31) and without ASD (n = 84) from the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network. We tested for associations between ASD diagnosis and tuber burden within the whole brain, specific lobes, and at eight regions of interest derived from the ASD neuroimaging literature including the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and posterior parietal cortices, the inferior frontal and fusiform gyri, the superior temporal sulcus, the amygdala, and the supplemental motor area. Next, we performed an unbiased data-driven voxel-wise lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) analysis. Finally, we calculated the risk of ASD associated with positive findings from the above analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were no significant ASD-related differences in tuber burden across the whole-brain, within specific lobes, or within <i>a priori</i> regions derived from the ASD literature. However, using VLSM analysis we found that tubers involving the right fusiform face area (FFA) were associated with a 3.7-fold increased risk of developing ASD.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>While TSC is a rare cause of ASD, there is a strong association between tuber involvement of the right FFA and ASD diagnosis. This highlights a potentially causative mechanism for developing autism in TSC that may guide research into ASD symptoms more generally.</p>
