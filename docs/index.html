              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08334">High-throughput digital twin framework for predicting neurite deterioration using MetaFormer attention</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) cover a variety of conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and epilepsy, which impair the central and peripheral nervous systems. Their high comorbidity and complex etiologies present significant challenges for accurate diagnosis and effective treatments. Conventional clinical and experimental studies are time-intensive, burdening research progress considerably. This paper introduces a high-throughput digital twin framework for modeling neurite deteriorations associated with NDDs, integrating synthetic data generation, experimental images, and machine learning (ML) models. The synthetic data generator utilizes an isogeometric analysis (IGA)-based phase field model to capture diverse neurite deterioration patterns such as neurite retraction, atrophy, and fragmentation while mitigating the limitations of scarce experimental data. The ML model utilizes MetaFormer-based gated spatiotemporal attention architecture with deep temporal layers and provides fast predictions. The framework effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and intricate morphological transformations with average errors of 1.9641% and 6.0339% for synthetic and experimental neurite deterioration, respectively. Seamlessly integrating simulations, experiments, and ML, the digital twin framework can guide researchers to make informed experimental decisions by predicting potential experimental outcomes, significantly reducing costs and saving valuable time. It can also advance our understanding of neurite deterioration and provide a scalable solution for exploring complex neurological mechanisms, contributing to the development of targeted treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18946">Unconditional stability of a recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.18946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ORGaNICs, a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16749">Inferring stochastic low-rank recurrent neural networks from neural data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.16749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed variability.

                arXiv:2501.08625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Expanding Hole Illusion is a compelling visual phenomenon in which a static, concentric pattern evokes a strong perception of continuous forward motion. Despite its simplicity, this illusion challenges our understanding of how the brain processes visual information, particularly motion derived from static cues. While the neural basis of this illusion has remained elusive, recent psychophysical studies [1] reveal that this illusion induces not only a perceptual effect but also physiological responses, such as pupil dilation. This paper presents a computational model based on Difference of Gaussians (DoG) filtering and a classical receptive field (CRF) implementation to simulate early retinal processing and to explain the underlying mechanisms of this illusion. Based on our results we hypothesize that the illusion arises from contrast-dependent lateral inhibition in early visual processing. Our results demonstrate that contrast gradients and multi-layered spatial processing contribute to the perception of expansion, aligning closely with psychophysical findings and supporting the role of retinal ganglion cells in generating this illusory motion signal. Our findings provide insights into the perceptual biases driving dynamic illusions and offer a new framework for studying complex visual phenomena.

Abstract: Self-organising maps are a powerful tool for cluster analysis in a wide range of data contexts. From the pioneer work of Kohonen, many variants and improvements have been proposed. This review focuses on the last decade, in order to provide an overview of the main evolution of the seminal SOM algorithm as well as of the methodological developments that have been achieved in order to better fit to various application contexts and users' requirements. We also highlight a specific and important application field that is related to commercial use of SOM, which involves specific data management.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08847">Automatic tuning of communication protocols for vehicular ad hoc networks using metaheuristics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) deals with a set of communicating vehicles which are able to spontaneously interconnect without any pre-existing infrastructure. In such kind of networks, it is crucial to make an optimal configuration of the communication protocols previously to the final network deployment. This way, a human designer can obtain an optimal QoS of the network beforehand. The problem we consider in this work lies in configuring the File Transfer protocol Configuration (FTC) with the aim of optimizing the transmission time, the number of lost packets, and the amount of data transferred in realistic VANET scenarios. We face the FTC with five representative state-of-the-art optimization techniques and compare their performance. These algorithms are: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Evolutionary Strategy (ES), and Simulated Annealing (SA). For our tests, two typical environment instances of VANETs for Urban and Highway scenarios have been defined. The experiments using ns- 2 (a well-known realistic VANET simulator) reveal that PSO outperforms all the compared algorithms for both studied VANET instances.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08943">Neuromorphic Retina: An FPGA-based Emulator</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.08943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implementing accurate models of the retina is a challenging task, particularly in the context of creating visual prosthetics and devices. Notwithstanding the presence of diverse artificial renditions of the retina, the imperative task persists to pursue a more realistic model. In this work, we are emulating a neuromorphic retina model on an FPGA. The key feature of this model is its powerful adaptation to luminance and contrast, which allows it to accurately emulate the sensitivity of the biological retina to changes in light levels. Phasic and tonic cells are realizable in the retina in the simplest way possible. Our FPGA implementation of the proposed biologically inspired digital retina, incorporating a receptive field with a center-surround structure, is reconfigurable and can support 128*128 pixel images at a frame rate of 200fps. It consumes 1720 slices, approximately 3.7k Look-Up Tables (LUTs), and Flip-Flops (FFs) on the FPGA. This implementation provides a high-performance, low-power, and small-area solution and could be a significant step forward in the development of biologically plausible retinal prostheses with enhanced information processing capabilities

	<p>Introduction: The cerebellum is a common lesion site in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Physiologic and anatomic studies have identified a topographic organization of the cerebellum including functionally distinct motor and cognitive areas. In this study, a recent parcellation algorithm was applied to a sample of PwMS and healthy controls to examine the relationships among specific cerebellar regions, fall status, and common clinical measures of motor and cognitive functions. Methods: Thirty-one PwMS and twenty-nine age- and sex-matched controls underwent an MRI scan and motor and cognitive testing. The parcellation algorithm was applied to all images and divided the cerebellum into 28 regions. Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U tests were used to compare cerebellar volumes among PwMS and controls, and MS fallers and MS non-fallers. Relationships between cerebellar volumes and motor and cognitive function were evaluated using Spearman correlations. Results: PwMS performed significantly worse on functional measures compared to controls. We found significant differences in volumetric measures between PwMS and controls in the corpus medullare, lobules I&amp;amp;ndash;III, and lobule V. Volumetric differences seen between the PwMS and controls were primarily driven by the MS fallers. Finally, functional performance on motor and cognitive tasks was associated with cerebellar volumes. Conclusions: Using the parcellation tool, our results showed that the volumes of motor and cognitive lobules impact both motor and cognitive performance, and that functional performance and cerebellar volumes distinguishes the MS fallers from non-fallers. Future studies should explore the potential of cerebellar imaging to predict falls in PwMS.</p>

	<p>Background: The molecular biology of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (HD) has grown substantially, with pathological considerations extending to genetic modifiers, epigenetic changes, transcriptomics, the proteome, and the metabolome. The metabolome and proteome are especially intriguing in that they most directly reflect the functional state of the cellular environment, which may involve some combination of pathology as well as compensation. Methods: We assessed CSF proteomics from eight participants by their functional severity (TFC range 3&amp;amp;ndash;13), with 47 proteins having a minimum r-value of 0.7 and nominal p-values &amp;amp;lt; 0.05. Results: Our exploratory data reveal correlations between progression and several processes including inflammation, ECM homeostasis and NAD+ metabolism. Conclusions: Consistently identified targets that correlate with phenotype or progression may have value, if validated, as enrichment tools in clinical trials and potentially as markers of therapeutic response.</p>

	<p>Backgrounds: Virtual reality (VR) has become a transformative technology with applications in gaming, education, healthcare, and psychotherapy. The subjective experiences in VR vary based on the virtual environment&amp;amp;rsquo;s characteristics, and electroencephalography (EEG) is instrumental in assessing these differences. By analyzing EEG signals, researchers can explore the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive and emotional responses to VR stimuli. However, distinguishing EEG signals recorded by two-dimensional (2D) versus three-dimensional (3D) VR environments remains underexplored. Current research primarily utilizes power spectral density (PSD) features to differentiate between 2D and 3D VR conditions, but the potential of other feature parameters for enhanced discrimination is unclear. Additionally, the use of machine learning techniques to classify EEG signals from 2D and 3D VR using alternative features has not been thoroughly investigated, highlighting the need for further research to identify robust EEG features and effective classification methods. Methods: This study recorded EEG signals from participants exposed to 2D and 3D VR video stimuli to investigate the neural differences between these conditions. Key features extracted from the EEG data included PSD and common spatial patterns (CSPs), which capture frequency-domain and spatial-domain information, respectively. To evaluate classification performance, several classical machine learning algorithms were employed: ssupport vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), naive Bayes, decision Tree, AdaBoost, and a voting classifier. The study systematically compared the classification performance of PSD and CSP features across these algorithms, providing a comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness in distinguishing EEG signals in response to 2D and 3D VR stimuli. Results: The study demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can effectively classify EEG signals recorded during watching 2D and 3D VR videos. CSP features outperformed PSD in classification accuracy, indicating their superior ability to capture EEG signals differences between the VR conditions. Among the machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy at 95.02%, followed by KNN with 93.16% and SVM with 91.39%. The combination of CSP features with RF, KNN, and SVM consistently showed superior performance compared to other feature-algorithm combinations, underscoring the effectiveness of CSP and these algorithms in distinguishing EEG responses to different VR experiences. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that EEG signals recorded during watching 2D and 3D VR videos can be effectively classified using machine learning algorithms with extracted feature parameters. The findings highlight the superiority of CSP features over PSD in distinguishing EEG signals under different VR conditions, emphasizing CSP&amp;amp;rsquo;s value in VR-induced EEG analysis. These results expand the application of feature-based machine learning methods in EEG studies and provide a foundation for future research into the brain cortical activity of VR experiences, supporting the broader use of machine learning in EEG-based analyses.</p>

                <p>Fragile X autosomal homolog 1 (FXR1), a member of the fragile X messenger riboprotein 1 family, has been linked to psychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons play critical roles in cortical processing and have been implicated in FXR1-linked mental illnesses. Targeted deletion of FXR1 from PV interneurons in mice has been shown to alter cortical excitability and elicit schizophrenia-like behavior. This indicates that FXR1 regulates behaviorally relevant electrophysiological functions in PV interneurons. We therefore expressed a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor in PV interneurons and used voltage imaging in slices of mouse somatosensory cortex to assess the impact of targeted FXR1 deletion. These experiments showed that PV interneurons lacking FXR1 had excitatory synaptic potentials with larger amplitudes and shorter latencies compared with wild type. Synaptic potential rise-times, decay-times, and half-widths were also impacted to degrees that varied between cortical layer and synaptic input. Thus, FXR1 modulates the responsiveness of PV interneurons to excitatory synaptic inputs. This will enable FXR1 to control cortical processing in subtle ways, with the potential to influence behavior and contribute to psychiatric dysfunction.</p>

                <p>A unique pool of immature glutamatergic neurons in the primate amygdala, known as the paralaminar nucleus (PL), are maturing between infancy and adolescence. The PL is a potential substrate for the steep growth curve of amygdala volume during this developmental period. A microglial component is also embedded among the PL neurons and likely supports local neuronal maturation and emerging synaptogenesis. Microglia may alter neuronal growth following environmental perturbations such as stress. Using multiple measures in rhesus macaques, we found that microglia in the infant primate PL had relatively large somas and a small arbor size. In contrast, microglia in the adolescent PL had a smaller soma and a larger dendritic arbor. We then examined microglial morphology in the PL after a novel maternal separation protocol, to examine the effects of early life stress. After maternal separation, the microglia had increased soma size, arbor size, and complexity. Surprisingly, strong effects were seen not only in the infant PL, but also in the adolescent PL from subjects who had experienced the separation many years earlier. We conclude that under normal maternal-rearing conditions, PL microglia morphology tracks PL neuronal growth, progressing to a more "mature" phenotype by adolescence. Maternal separation has long-lasting effects on microglia, altering their normal developmental trajectory, and resulting in a "hyper-ramified" phenotype that persists for years. We speculate that these changes have consequences for neuronal development in young primates.</p>

                <p>The human medial parietal cortex (MPC) is recruited during multiple cognitive processes. Previously, we demonstrated regions specific to recall of people or places and proposed that the functional organization of MPC mirrors the category selectivity defining the medial&ndash;lateral axis of the ventral&ndash;temporal cortex (VTC). However, prior work considered recall of people and places only, and VTC also shows object selectivity sandwiched between face- and scene-selective regions. Here, we tested a strong prediction of our proposal: like VTC, MPC should show a region specifically recruited during object recall, and its relative cortical position should mirror the one of VTC. While responses during people and place recall showed a striking replication of prior findings, we did not observe any evidence for object-recall effects within MPC, which differentiates it from the spatial organization in VTC. Importantly, beyond MPC, robust recall effects were observed for people, places, and objects on the lateral surface of the brain. Place-recall effects were present in the angular gyrus, frontal eye fields, and peripheral portions of the early visual cortex, whereas people recall selectively drove response in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus. Object-recall effects were largely restricted to a region posterior to the left somatosensory cortex, in the vicinity of the supramarginal gyrus. Taken together, these data demonstrate that while there are distributed regions active during recall of people, places, and objects, the functional organization of MPC does not mirror the medial&ndash;lateral axis of VTC but reflects only the most salient features of that axis&mdash;namely, representations of people and places.</p>

                Background Gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, have grim prognoses, necessitating early diagnostic and prognostic indicators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), influential in cancer research, show potential as glioma biomarkers. This systematic review aimed to examine the efficacy of miRNAs in the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies published from 2013 to 2023. The eligibility criteria included high-grade glioma, histopathological confirmation, miRNA samples from cerebrospinal fluid or plasma, and relevant outcome data. Studies were excluded if they were experimental or reviews and not in English. Results Of the 1120 initial results, 8 studies involving 660 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Several studies have assessed miRNA expression and its association with diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade gliomas. Overexpression of miR-221, miR-222, miR-210, miR-21, miR-125b, and miR-223 and under-expression of miR-15b and miR-124-3p showed significant potential in differentiating high-grade glioma patients from controls. Additionally, miRNAs are associated with distinct tumorigenic pathways. Conclusion Elevated or depressed expression levels of specific circulating miRNAs hold significant promise as noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of high-grade glioma. These miRNAs offer valuable insights into disease progression and patient outcome. Further validation through extensive clinical trials and in-depth mechanistic studies is essential to realize their full clinical utility.

                Abstract* Currently, machine learning applications in marketing allow to optimize strategies, personalize experiences and improve decision making. However, there are still several research gaps, so the objective is to examine the research trends in the use of machine learning in marketing. A bibliometric analysis is proposed to assess the current scientific activity, following the parameters established by PRISMA-2020. Machine learning applications in marketing have experienced steady growth and increased attention in the academic community. Key references, such as Miklosik and Evans, and prominent journals, such as IEEE Access and Journal of Business Research, have been identified. A thematic evolution towards big data and digital marketing is observed, and thematic clusters such as “digital marketing”, “interpretation”, “prediction”, and “healthcare" stand out. These findings demonstrate the continued importance and research potential of this evolving field.

                Background Conventional fish feed based on fish meal, meat, and soy cake presents procurement difficulties and high costs, affecting the profitability and sustainability of the aquaculture industry. Objective To evaluate the effect of hydrolyzed red worm (HRW- Eisenia foétida) in red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) diet on production parameters. Methods The study was conducted at the aquaculture farm of the Politécnico Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid (PCJIC) at 780 m.a.s.l.,with an average temperature of 28 °C. Ninety red tilapia fingerlings, averaging 7,5±0,5 g, were distributed in nine aquariums containing 75 liters of water. Fish underwentweight and size measurements at the beginning and end of the trial. They were fed experimental diets to apparent satiation three times daily. Water quality parameters and productive rates of growth and nutrient utilization were measured. The experimental design included three treatments with three replicates each: T1 (control diet, 0% hydrolysate inclusion), T2 (10% hydrolysate inclusion), and T3 (20% hydrolysate inclusion). ANOVA (p<0,05) was applied to growth and nutrient utilization variables, with mean comparisons using α<0,05 in SPSS version 25. Results Significant differences (p<0,04) were found between the control diet T1 (0% inclusion) and T2 (10% inclusion) in favor of weight gain (31,87 g). There were no statistical differences in size increase (p<0,217). As HRWinclusion increased, feed consumption decreased, likely due to higher hydrolyzed protein availability. Feed conversion rates showed significant differences (p<0,001) between T2 and T3 compared to T1, indicating better assimilation of the hydrolyzed protein. T2 and T3 also showed better protein and energy efficiency (p<0,001), demonstrating the hydrolyzed protein’s nutritional quality and assimilation. Diet cost decreased with higher hydrolyzed inclusion (p<0,034). Conclusion Inclusion 10% and 20% hydrolyzed red worms significantly improved production parameters and reduced costs, making it a viable alternative for feeding red tilapia for small and medium-scale producers.

                Background Owing to its combination of speed, tactics, and accuracy, table tennis is becoming a sport exercise that is suitable for older adults. Casual play is fun and relaxing, and more serious table tennis might further develop skills through focused practice. Methods A randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to determine how the practice of competition compared to leisure playing affects the Quality of life (QoL) of people aged 40-70. Selecting subjects at random, one group of subjects undertook a structured competitive regimen, whereas the other group was given time to play recreationally without any structured competition. QoL was measured before and after the intervention using the WHOQOL-BREF, which measures physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains. Data were analyzed using paired and independent t-test. Results The group that received structured competition reported a marked improvement in their QoL indicators, especially in physical health (p < 0.001), psychological health (p < 0.001), and social relationships (p = 0.001), when compared to the control group, which showed few improvements. No significant differences were observed in the environmental domains in either group. Conclusions Regular competitive table tennis practice improves physical condition, emotions, and social relationships, which leads to a higher QoL in older adults.

                Background Structuring data analysis projects, that is, defining the layout of files and folders needed to analyze data using existing tools and novel code, largely follows personal preferences. Open Science calls for more accessible, transparent and understandable research. We believe that Open Science principles can be applied to the way data analysis projects are structured. Methods We examine the structure of several data analysis project templates by analyzing project template repositories present in GitHub. Through visualization of the resulting consensus structure, we draw observations regarding how the ecosystem of project structures is shaped, and what salient characteristics it has. Results Project templates show little overlap, but many distinct practices can be highlighted. We take them into account with the wider Open Science philosophy to draw a few fundamental Design Principles to guide researchers when designing a project space. We present Kerblam!, a project management tool that can work with such a project structure to expedite data handling, execute workflow managers, and share the resulting workflow and analysis outputs with others. Conclusions We hope that, by following these principles and using Kerblam!, the landscape of data analysis projects can become more transparent, understandable, and ultimately useful to the wider community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/10-1230/v2?src=rss">A draft genome sequence of the common, or spectacled caiman Caiman crocodilus [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                The common, or spectacled, caiman Caiman crocodilus is an abundant, widely distributed Neotropical crocodilian exhibiting notable morphological and molecular diversification. As the type species for the Caimaninae subfamily - the sister taxa for the subfamily to which members of the genus Alligator belong - C. crocodilus occupies a key position in our understanding of crocodilian and archosaur genetics and evolution. The species also accounts by far for the largest share of crocodilian hides on the global market, with the C. crocodilus hide trade alone valued at about US$86.5 million per year. Thus, the genome sequence of C. crocodilus can potentially be of considerable use for both basic and applied research. We obtained 239,911,946 paired-end reads comprising approximately 72 G bases using Illumina TM sequencing of tissue sampled from a single Caiman crocodilus individual. These reads were de-novo assembled and progressively aligned against the genomes of increasingly related crocodilians; liftoff was used to annotate the draft C. crocodilus genome assembly based on an Alligator mississipiensis (a confamilial species) annotation. The draft C. crocodilus genome assembly and sequences reads have been deposited with the National Center for Biotechnology Information with accession numbers JAGPOW000000000.1 for the assembly, and SRR22317059 for the sequence read archives under Bioproject PRJNA716363.

                Background We present q2-boots, a QIIME 2 plugin that facilitates bootstrapped and rarefaction-based microbiome diversity analysis. This plugin provides eight new actions that allow users to apply any of thirty different alpha diversity metrics and twenty-two beta diversity metrics to bootstrapped or rarefied feature tables, using a single QIIME 2 Pipeline command, or more granular QIIME 2 Action commands. Results Given a feature table, an even sampling depth, and the number of iterations to perform (n), the command qiime boots core-metrics will resample the feature table n times and compute alpha and beta diversity metrics on each resampled table. The results will be integrated in summary data artifacts that are identical in structure and type to results that would be generated by applying diversity metrics to a single table. This enables all the same downstream analytic tools to be applied to these tables and ensures that all collected data is considered when computing microbiome diversity metrics. Conclusions A challenge of this work was deciding how to integrate distance matrices that were computed on n resampled feature tables, as a simple average of pairwise distances (median or mean) does not account for the structure of distance matrices. q2-boots provides three options, and we show here that the results of these approaches are highly correlated. q2-boots is free and open source. Source code can be found at https://github.com/caporaso-lab/q2-boots; installation instructions and a tutorial can be found in the project’s documentation at https://q2-boots.readthedocs.io.

                The emergence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens poses a significant threat to aquaculture and public health. This study presents the characterization of a novel bacteriophage, designated as Ursula, specifically targeting Citrobacter, a prominent pathogen affecting fish populations. We isolated Ursula from aquatic environments during a search for novel phages active against fish pathogens, and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its morphological, genomic, and lytic properties. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that Ursula has a myovirus morphology, being a rather large T4-like phage. Genomic sequencing identified a double-stranded linear DNA genome of approximately 183 kb, containing unique genes associated with lytic activity and host recognition. This phage is related to other T4-like Citrobacter phages, being a new species.

                <p>by Ankita Chavan, Lena Skrutl, Federico Uliana, Melanie Pfister, Franziska Brändle, Laszlo Tirian, Delora Baptista, Dominik Handler, David Burke, Anna Sintsova, Pedro Beltrao, Julius Brennecke, Madhav Jagannathan</p>

Noncoding satellite DNA repeats are abundant at the pericentromeric heterochromatin of eukaryotic chromosomes. During interphase, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins cluster these repeats from multiple chromosomes into nuclear foci known as chromocenters. Despite the pivotal role of chromocenters in cellular processes like genome encapsulation and gene repression, the associated proteins remain incompletely characterized. Here, we use 2 satellite DNA-binding proteins, D1 and Prod, as baits to characterize the chromocenter-associated proteome in <i>Drosophila</i> embryos, ovaries, and testes through quantitative mass spectrometry. We identify D1- and Prod-associated proteins, including known heterochromatin proteins as well as proteins previously unlinked to satellite DNA or chromocenters, thereby laying the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of cellular functions enabled by satellite DNA repeats and their associated proteins. Interestingly, we find that multiple components of the transposon-silencing piRNA pathway are associated with D1 and Prod in embryos. Using genetics, transcriptomics, and small RNA profiling, we show that flies lacking D1 during embryogenesis exhibit transposon expression and gonadal atrophy as adults. We further demonstrate that this gonadal atrophy can be rescued by mutating the checkpoint kinase, <i>Chk2</i>, which mediates germ cell arrest in response to transposon mobilization. Thus, we reveal that a satellite DNA-binding protein functions during embryogenesis to silence transposons, in a manner that is heritable across later stages of development.

                Background The identification of an individual after mass calamities poses challenges to experts when bones are fragmented. Dense bones, such as the maxilla, surpass this challenge and remain intact with sinuses even after incineration, thereby making the sinuses an ideal and reliable forensic science tool. No-ninvasive imaging techniques, such as Computed Tomography (CT), can be used to evaluate such cases and help detect fractures and further locate foreign bodies. This study aimed to estimate the dimensions and volumes of the frontal (FS), maxillary (MS), and sphenoidal air sinuses (SS) on CT scans and investigate age- and sex-related differences. Methods CT scans of the paranasal sinuses were acquired from 158 patients ranging in age from 19 to 73 years, and written consent was obtained from all participants. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (ethical clearance number IEC 064/2010). All parameters were statistically analyzed using SPSS 20 version and the significance level was set at p<0.05. Results The bilateral anteroposterior length and height of the FS were significantly larger in men than females (p<0.05). The overall dimensions of the MS and SS were substantially greater in males than females (P <0.05). Likewise, the overall volumes of the fFS, MS, and SS were significantly greater in males than females (p<0.05). However, no significant age-related correlation was observed in the dimensions and volumes of the sinuses. Conclusion The results of this study showed that imaging could be a reliable instrument for personal identification in forensic anthropology. Countries that do not allow autopsies may implement this method to clarify the cause of death.

                Background Anxiety and obesity can have negative impacts on the health of children. Understanding the relationship between obesity and mental disorders in children and adolescents will help develop effective prevention and intervention strategies. This research investigates the impact of anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem on obesity among Chinese children aged 6-12 in Anhui Province. Methods Utilizing a non-experimental, cross-sectional study design, data were from 136 participants collected through standardized instrument measures from Chinese children: the “Chinese screening for overweight and obesity among school-age children and adolescents” in the “Health Industry Standards of the People’s Republic of China” as the standard for identifying obesity, the Screen for Anxiety-Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) for assessing anxiety disorder, and the Children’s Self-Esteem Scale (CSES) for evaluating self-esteem. Statistical analysis, including descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple regression analyses was performed using SPSS version 26 to determine the predictive relationships between the variables. Results The analysis revealed that anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem contribute significantly to the prediction of obesity among Chinese children, accounting for a 13.7% variance. The study highlights the critical roles of anxiety-related emotional disorders and self-esteem in determining children’s obesity. It suggests that underscores the necessity for comprehensive interventions that address both physical and mental health aspects to combat childhood obesity effectively. The study concludes that addressing anxiety and self-esteem is essential for developing effective strategies to reduce obesity rates among Chinese children, meeting the research objectives, and contributing to the development of holistic health programs for children’s well-being.

The association between the CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) gene and the prevalence of ISR after coronary stenting remains controversial. Previous studies have produced conflicting results and have been limited by their small population sizes. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the association between the presence of the CYP2C19 LOF gene and the prevalence of ISR. Methods A systematic online database search was performed until April 2021. The primary outcome was ISR and assessed using OR with 95% CI. Quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. I2 was applied to examine heterogeneities among the studies. Results A total of 284 patients (four non-randomized controlled trial studies) were included in this study. Two hundred and six patients had wild-type genotypes, while 78 patients had the LOF genotype. Among the 78 patients with the LOF gene, 38 patients had an ISR. Meanwhile, of the 206 patients with a wild-type gene, 69 patients had an ISR. LOF gene was associated with a higher risk of ISR (OR 95% CI = 2.71 [1.42–5.16], P = 0.003). However, study-specific variability should be considered when applying these findings clinically. Conclusions Patients with LOF genes, regardless of the allele variation, treated with clopidogrel, had a higher likelihood of ISR after coronary stenting.

                Rhythmic neural activity is considered essential for adaptively modulating responses in the visual system. In this opinion article we posit that visual brain rhythms also serve a key function in the representation and communication of visual contents. Collating a set of recent studies that used multivariate decoding methods on rhythmic brain signals, we highlight such rhythmic content representations in visual perception, imagery, and prediction. We argue that characterizing representations across frequency bands allows researchers to elegantly disentangle content transfer in feedforward and feedback directions. We further propose that alpha dynamics are central to content-specific feedback propagation in the visual system. We conclude that considering rhythmic content codes is pivotal for understanding information coding in vision and beyond.

The results indicate an affinity-based threshold for memory B cell entry to germinal centers (GCs). GC refueling promotes the maturation of naive and less mutated B cells.

Whereas the thalamus inherits luminance-dependent functional properties from the retina, visual cortex exhibits a luminance-invariant code. The convergence of parallel afferent pathways can generate a luminance-invariant code.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96287">Complementary cognitive roles for D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs during interval timing</a></h4>

              
                The role of striatal pathways in cognitive processing is unclear. We studied dorsomedial striatal cognitive processing during interval timing, an elementary cognitive task that requires mice to estimate intervals of several seconds and involves working memory for temporal rules as well as attention to the passage of time. We harnessed optogenetic tagging to record from striatal D2-dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) in the indirect pathway and from D1-dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs (D1-MSNs) in the direct pathway. We found that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs exhibited distinct dynamics over temporal intervals as quantified by principal component analyses and trial-by-trial generalized linear models. MSN recordings helped construct and constrain a four-parameter drift-diffusion computational model in which MSN ensemble activity represented the accumulation of temporal evidence. This model predicted that disrupting either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs would increase interval timing response times and alter MSN firing. In line with this prediction, we found that optogenetic inhibition or pharmacological disruption of either D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs increased interval timing response times. Pharmacologically disrupting D2-MSNs or D1-MSNs also changed MSN dynamics and degraded trial-by-trial temporal decoding. Together, our findings demonstrate that D2-MSNs and D1-MSNs had opposing dynamics yet played complementary cognitive roles, implying that striatal direct and indirect pathways work together to shape temporal control of action. These data provide novel insight into basal ganglia cognitive operations beyond movement and have implications for human striatal diseases and therapies targeting striatal pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94045">Leveraging mobility data to analyze persistent SARS-CoV-2 mutations and inform targeted genomic surveillance</a></h4>

              
                Given the rapid cross-country spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting difficulty in tracking lineage spread, we investigated the potential of combining mobile service data and fine-granular metadata (such as postal codes and genomic data) to advance integrated genomic surveillance of the pandemic in the federal state of Thuringia, Germany. We sequenced over 6500 SARS-CoV-2 Alpha genomes (B.1.1.7) across 7 months within Thuringia while collecting patients’ isolation dates and postal codes. Our dataset is complemented by over 66,000 publicly available German Alpha genomes and mobile service data for Thuringia. We identified the existence and spread of nine persistent mutation variants within the Alpha lineage, seven of which formed separate phylogenetic clusters with different spreading patterns in Thuringia. The remaining two are subclusters. Mobile service data can indicate these clusters’ spread and highlight a potential sampling bias, especially of low-prevalence variants. Thereby, mobile service data can be used either retrospectively to assess surveillance coverage and efficiency from already collected data or to actively guide part of a surveillance sampling process to districts where these variants are expected to emerge. The latter concept was successfully implemented as a proof-of-concept for a mobility-guided sampling strategy in response to the surveillance of Omicron sublineage BQ.1.1. The combination of mobile service data and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance by genome sequencing is a valuable tool for more targeted and responsive surveillance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95842">Endocytic recycling is central to circadian collagen fibrillogenesis and disrupted in fibrosis</a></h4>

              
                Collagen-I fibrillogenesis is crucial to health and development, where dysregulation is a hallmark of fibroproliferative diseases. Here, we show that collagen-I fibril assembly required a functional endocytic system that recycles collagen-I to assemble new fibrils. Endogenous collagen production was not required for fibrillogenesis if exogenous collagen was available, but the circadian-regulated vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 33b and collagen-binding integrin α11 subunit were crucial to fibrillogenesis. Cells lacking VPS33B secrete soluble collagen-I protomers but were deficient in fibril formation, thus secretion and assembly are separately controlled. Overexpression of VPS33B led to loss of fibril rhythmicity and overabundance of fibrils, which was mediated through integrin α11β1. Endocytic recycling of collagen-I was enhanced in human fibroblasts isolated from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where VPS33B and integrin α11 subunit were overexpressed at the fibrogenic front; this correlation between VPS33B, integrin α11 subunit, and abnormal collagen deposition was also observed in samples from patients with chronic skin wounds. In conclusion, our study showed that circadian-regulated endocytic recycling is central to homeostatic assembly of collagen fibrils and is disrupted in diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95411">3D genomic features across &gt;50 diverse cell types reveal insights into the genomic architecture of childhood obesity</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing worldwide, along with the associated common comorbidities of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in later life. Motivated by evidence for a strong genetic component, our prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) efforts for childhood obesity revealed 19 independent signals for the trait; however, the mechanism of action of these loci remains to be elucidated. To molecularly characterize these childhood obesity loci, we sought to determine the underlying causal variants and the corresponding effector genes within diverse cellular contexts. Integrating childhood obesity GWAS summary statistics with our existing 3D genomic datasets for 57 human cell types, consisting of high-resolution promoter-focused Capture-C/Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq, we applied stratified LD score regression and calculated the proportion of genome-wide SNP heritability attributable to cell type-specific features, revealing pancreatic alpha cell enrichment as the most statistically significant. Subsequent chromatin contact-based fine-mapping was carried out for genome-wide significant childhood obesity loci and their linkage disequilibrium proxies to implicate effector genes, yielded the most abundant number of candidate variants and target genes at the <i>BDNF</i>, <i>ADCY3</i>, <i>TMEM18,</i> and <i>FTO</i> loci in skeletal muscle myotubes and the pancreatic beta-cell line, EndoC-BH1. One novel implicated effector gene, <i>ALKAL2</i> – an inflammation-responsive gene in nerve nociceptors – was observed at the key <i>TMEM18</i> locus across multiple immune cell types. Interestingly, this observation was also supported through colocalization analysis using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) derived from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset, supporting an inflammatory and neurologic component to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity. Our comprehensive appraisal of 3D genomic datasets generated in a myriad of different cell types provides genomic insights into pediatric obesity pathogenesis.

">Unintended bias in the pursuit of collinearity solutions in fMRI analysis</a></h4>

              
                In task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), collinearity between task regressors in a design matrix may impact power. Researchers often optimize task designs by assessing collinearity between task regressors to minimize downstream effects. However, some methods intended to reduce collinearity during optimization and data analysis may fail, in some cases introducing unintended bias into the parameter estimates. Although relevant to all task-based fMRI studies, we describe these issues and illustrate them using the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task fMRI data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD(R)) study. Specifically, we show that omitting regressors for certain task components, using impulse regressors for extended activations, and ignoring response time adjustments can bias common contrast estimates. We present a "Saturated" model that models all stimuli and response times, which minimizes bias in MID task simulations and validly estimates task-relevant whole brain activity, offering greater flexibility in studying contrasts that might otherwise be avoided due to potential biases.

">Causal Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity Prevents Assembly Fusion in Recurrent Networks</a></h4>

              
                The organization of neurons into functionally related assemblies is a fundamental feature of cortical networks, yet our understanding of how these assemblies maintain distinct identities while sharing members remains limited. Here we analyze how spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) shapes the formation and stability of overlapping neuronal assemblies in recurrently coupled networks of spiking neuron models. Using numerical simulations and an associated mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the temporal structure of the STDP rule, specifically its degree of causality, critically determines whether assemblies that share neurons maintain segregation or merge together after training is completed. We find that causal STDP rules, where potentiation/depression occurs strictly when presynaptic spikes precede/proceed postsynaptic spikes, allow assemblies to remain distinct even with substantial overlap in membership. This stability arises because causal STDP effectively cancels the symmetric correlations introduced by common inputs from shared neurons. In contrast, acausal STDP rules lead to assembly fusion when overlap exceeds a critical threshold, due to unchecked growth of common input correlations. Our results provide theoretical insight into how spike-timing-dependent learning rules can support distributed representation where individual neurons participate in multiple assemblies while maintaining functional specificity.

">Temporal and protein-specific S-palmitoylation supports synaptic and neural network plasticity</a></h4>

              
                S-palmitoylation, a dynamic post-translational modification, has long been suggested to play a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. However, its precise impact on synaptic proteins and function remains unclear. In this study, we show that acute protein depalmitoylation in the hippocampus differentially affects short- and long-term synaptic plasticity, depending on synapse type. Strikingly, depalmitoylation also reprograms neuronal spiking timing following associative network activation. Our research identifies pre- and postsynaptic proteins dynamically regulated by S-palmitoylation during synaptic plasticity and suggests this modification occurs in isolated excitatory synapses. We also demonstrate that S-palmitoylation targets specific proteins within minutes and is not proteome-wide. These findings mark a significant advance in understanding how lipid modifications drive neural adaptability, memory, and learning.

">Neurite density but not myelination of specific fiber tracts links polygenic scores to general intelligence</a></h4>

              
                White matter is fundamental for efficient and accurate information transfer throughout the human brain and thus crucial for intelligence. Previous studies often demonstrated associations between fractional anisotropy (FA) as a metric of white matter "microstructural integrity" and intelligence, but it is still unclear, whether this relation is due to greater axon density, parallel, homogenous fiber orientation distributions, or greater myelination since all of these measures influence FA. Using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and myelin water fraction (MWF) imaging data, we analyzed the microstructural architecture of intelligence in more detail in a sample of 500 healthy young adults. Furthermore, we were interested whether specific white matter microstructural indices play intermediary roles in the pathway that links genetic disposition for intelligence to phenotype. Thus, we conducted for the first time mediation analyses investigating whether neurite density (NDI), orientation dispersion (ODI), and MWF of 64 white matter fiber tracts mediate the effects of polygenic scores for intelligence (PGSGI) on general intelligence. By doing so, we showed that NDI, but not ODI or MWF of white matter fiber tracts was significantly associated with general intelligence and that the NDI of six fiber tracts mediated the relation between genetic variability and g. These findings are a crucial step forward in decoding the neurogenetic underpinnings of general intelligence, as they identify that neurite density of specific fiber tracts relates polygenic variation to g, whereas orientation dispersion and myelination did not.

">Exploring the Suitability of Piecewise-Linear Dynamical System Models for Cognitive Neural Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Dynamical system models have proven useful for decoding the current brain state from neural activity. So far, neuroscience has largely relied on either linear models or nonlinear models based on artificial neural networks. Piecewise linear approximations of nonlinear dynamics have proven useful in other technical applications, providing a clear advantage over network-based models, when the dynamical system is not only supposed to be observed, but also controlled. Here we explore whether piecewise-linear dynamical system models (recurrent Switching Linear Dynamical System or rSLDS models) could be useful for modeling brain dynamics, in particular in the context of cognitive tasks. We first generate artificial neural data based on a nonlinear computational model of perceptual decision-making and demonstrate that piecewise-linear dynamics can be successfully recovered from these observations. We then demonstrate that the piecewise-linear model outperforms a linear model in terms of predicting future states of the system and associated neural activity. Finally, we apply our approach to a publicly available dataset recorded from monkeys performing perceptual decisions. Much to our surprise, the piecewise-linear model did not provide a significant advantage over a linear model for these particular data, although linear models that were estimated from different trial epochs showed qualitatively different dynamics. In summary, we present a dynamical system modeling approach that could prove useful in situations, where the brain state needs to be controlled in a closed-loop fashion, for example, in new neuromodulation applications for treating cognitive deficits. Future work will have to show under what conditions the brain dynamics are sufficiently nonlinear to warrant the use of a piecewise-linear model over a linear one.

">Distinct modes of dopamine modulation on striatopallidal synaptic transmission</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) affects voluntary movement by modulating basal ganglia function. In the classical model, DA depletion leads to overactivity of the indirect pathway and excessively inhibits the thalamus, resulting in hypokinesia. The contribution of DA on striatopallidal synapses, an initial hub in the indirect pathway connecting the striatum to the external globus pallidus (GPe), remains poorly understood because of the sparse DA innervation. Here, we combine optogenetic projection targeting, whole cell patch clamp recordings in acute brain slices from mice, and computational modeling to overcome this limitation. We show that DA activates D2R receptors (D2Rs) and D4 receptors (D4Rs) differentially in distinct GPe subregions. In a pinwheel-like fashion, dorsolateral and ventromedial GPe expresses high levels of D2Rs, which exert presynaptic inhibition, while in dorsomedial and ventrolateral GPe D4Rs cause postsynaptic inhibition. DA depletion by 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine) reverses the region-specific effect of DA, shifting it in the opposite direction and contributing to hypokinesia. These findings reveal the mechanism by which the different modality information conveyed spatially through the indirect pathway is differentially modulated by DA at striatopallidal synapses.

">Different artificial light modalities during daytime have all positive effects on attention and alertness</a></h4>

              
                Light exposure during the day exerts acute effects on attention, such as how alert and ready a person is for solving problems and goal-oriented behavior. However, to increase the understanding of how different light modalities during daytime affect our attention, there is a need for more studies. The current study tested the acute effects of daytime exposure to four artificial light modalities on attention and alertness with the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). Healthy, young adults (N = 39; mean age: 21.7, 61.5% females) performed the PVT three times in four light modalities presented on separate days at the same time-of-day (09:00-11:00): short-wavelength light [SWL, 'blue'], long-wavelength light [LWL, 'red'], bright white light [BWL], and dim light [DL] as control. Attention and alertness measures included fluctuations in attention, quantified as the number of lapses and Reaction Time (RT) variability, mean RT, and optimum response capability (10% fastest RTs). Compared to DL, participants had significantly fewer lapses and faster mean RT during all three light conditions and enhanced optimum response capability during SWL and LWL. Light did not appear to have effects on intra-individual RT variability. Results suggest that 2 hours of exposure to artificial light during daytime can induce alerting effects and fewer attentional lapses in young, healthy adults. Surprisingly, neither SWL, LWL, nor BWL were significantly superior to one another.

">Genetic changes linked to two different syndromic forms of autism enhance reinforcement learning in adolescent male but not female mice</a></h4>

              
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by restricted and repetitive behaviors and social differences, both of which may manifest, in part, from underlying differences in corticostriatal circuits and reinforcement learning. Here, we investigated reinforcement learning in mice with mutations in either Tsc2 or Shank3, both high-confidence ASD risk genes associated with major syndromic forms of ASD. Using an odor-based two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, we tested adolescent mice of both sexes and found male Tsc2 and Shank3B heterozygote (Het) mice showed enhanced learning performance compared to their wild type (WT) siblings. No gain of function was observed in females. Using a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based computational model to infer learning rate as well as policy-level task engagement and disengagement, we found that the gain of function in males was driven by an enhanced positive learning rate in both Tsc2 and Shank3B Het mice. The gain of function in Het males was absent when mice were trained with a probabilistic reward schedule. These findings in two ASD mouse models reveal a convergent learning phenotype that shows similar sensitivity to sex and environmental uncertainty. These data can inform our understanding of both strengths and challenges associated with autism, while providing further evidence that sex and experience of uncertainty modulate autism-related phenotypes.

">Standardized and calibrated light stimuli via head-mounted displays for investigating the non-visual effects of light</a></h4>

              
                Light influences human physiology profoundly, affecting the circadian clock and suppressing the endogenous hormone melatonin. Experimental studies often employ either homogenous full-field stimulation, or overhead illumination, which are hard to standardize across studies and laboratories. Here, we present a novel technique to examine non-visual responses to light using virtual-reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) for delivering standardized and calibrated light stimuli to observers in a reproducible and controlled fashion. We find that VR HMDs are well-suited for delivering standardized stimuli defined in luminance and across time, with excellent properties up to 20 Hz. We examine melatonin suppression to continuous luminance-defined light stimuli in a sample of healthy participants (n=31, mean+/-SD age: 27.4+/-5.6), and find robust melatonin suppression in 27 out of 31 participants (87% of the sample). Our findings demonstrate that VR HMDs are well-suited for studying the mechanisms underlying human non-visual photoreception in a reproducible and standardized fashion.

">An MRI-informed histo-molecular analysis implicates ependymal cells in the pathogenesis of periventricular pathology in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                It is now widely recognized that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-adjacent brain surfaces - namely the subpial cortical region and the ependyma-adjacent periventricular region - are uniquely susceptible to a distinct, diffuse form of pathology in multiple sclerosis. So-called surface-in gradients of pathology predict future disease relapses independent of classical white matter lesions and are thought to occur as a result of cytotoxic factors in the CSF. Given the underlying mechanisms driving surface-in gradients appear to be distinct, they represent a novel treatment target. However, exactly how cytotoxic factor entry into the brain is regulated at these CSF-facing borders is not understood, particularly at the ventricular interface. Indeed, although studies have indicated that ependymal cells may be damaged in MS, there has yet to be a comprehensive assessment of cell health in the disease. We employed ultra-high-field MRI-guided immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and multiomic single nucleus RNA/ATAC sequencing to deeply phenotype human ependymal cells in MS. Our data revealed that ependymal cell pathology is a direct correlate of periventricular surface-in gradients of pathology in MS, and that the immune-responsive, reactive state assumed by ependymal cells is associated with widespread transporter and junctional protein gene dysregulation. We then further defined the gene regulatory networks underpinning the MS ependymal state, predicted ligands known to be enriched in MS CSF that could drive the emergence of this state, and tested one candidate in vivo. We found that IFN{gamma} increased murine ependymal permeability and that conditional knockout of ependymal interferon gamma receptor 1 (Ifngr1) was sufficient to reverse this effect. Our data directly implicate ependymal cell dysregulation in the emergence of periventricular pathology in MS. More widely, we denote the modulatory capacity of CSF ligands on ependymal cell function and how this may influence the inflammatory status of the periventricular region.

">Molecular hallmarks of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal resilience and resistance to Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Background: A significant proportion of individuals maintain healthy cognitive function despite having extensive Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, known as cognitive resilience. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that protect these individuals can identify therapeutic targets for AD dementia. This study aims to define molecular and cellular signatures of cognitive resilience, protection and resistance, by integrating genetics, bulk RNA, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data across multiple brain regions from AD, resilient, and control individuals. Methods: We analyzed data from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP), including bulk (n=631) and multi-regional single nucleus (n=48) RNA sequencing. Subjects were categorized into AD, resilient, and control based on {beta}-amyloid and tau pathology, and cognitive status. We identified and prioritized protected cell populations using whole genome sequencing-derived genetic variants, transcriptomic profiling, and cellular composition distribution. Results: Transcriptomic results, supported by GWAS-derived polygenic risk scores, place cognitive resilience as an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Tissue-level analysis revealed 43 genes enriched in nucleic acid metabolism and signaling that were differentially expressed between AD and resilience. Only GFAP (upregulated) and KLF4 (downregulated) showed differential expression in resilience compared to controls. Cellular resilience involved reorganization of protein folding and degradation pathways, with downregulation of Hsp90 and selective upregulation of Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp110 families in excitatory neurons. Excitatory neuronal subpopulations in the entorhinal cortex (ATP8B1+ and MEF2Chigh) exhibited unique resilience signaling through neurotrophin (modulated by LINGO1) and angiopoietin (ANGPT2/TEK) pathways. We identified MEF2C, ATP8B1, and RELN as key markers of resilient excitatory neuronal populations, characterized by selective vulnerability in AD. Protective rare variant enrichment highlighted vulnerable populations, including somatostatin (SST) inhibitory interneurons, validated through immunofluorescence showing co-expression of rare variant associated RBFOX1 and KIF26B in SST+ neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The maintenance of excitatory-inhibitory balance emerges as a key characteristic of resilience. Conclusions: We identified molecular and cellular hallmarks of cognitive resilience, an intermediate state in the AD continuum. Resilience mechanisms include preservation of neuronal function, maintenance of excitatory/inhibitory balance, and activation of protective signaling pathways. Specific excitatory neuronal populations appear to play a central role in mediating cognitive resilience, while a subset of vulnerable SST interneurons likely provide compensation against AD-associated dysregulation. This study offers a framework to leverage natural protective mechanisms to mitigate neurodegeneration and preserve cognition in AD.

">Small or absent Visual Word Form Area is a trait of dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the balance between plastic and persistent traits in the dyslexic brain is critical for developing effective interventions. This longitudinal intervention study examines the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) in dyslexic and typical readers, exploring how this key component of the brain's reading circuitry changes with learning. We found that dyslexic readers show significant differences in VWFA presence, size, and tuning properties compared to typical readers. While reading intervention improved reading skills and increased VWFA size, disparities persisted, suggesting that VWFA abnormalities are an enduring trait of dyslexia. Notably, we found that even with sufficient intervention to close the reading skill gap, dyslexic readers are still expected to have smaller VWFAs. Our results reveal intervention-driven long-term neural and behavioral changes, while also elucidating stable differences in the functional architecture of the dyslexic brain. This provides new insights into the potential and limitations of learning-induced plasticity in the human visual cortex.

">Real-time fMRI neurofeedback modulates auditory cortex activity and connectivity in schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations: A controlled study</a></h4>

              
                Background and Hypothesis We have reported previously a reduction in superior temporal gyrus (STG) activation and in auditory verbal hallucinations (AHs) after real-time fMRI neurofeedback (NFB) in schizophrenia patients with AHs. Study Design With this randomized, participant-blinded, sham-controlled trial, we expanded our previous results. Specifically, we examined neurofeedback effects from the STG, an area associated with auditory hallucinations. The effects were compared to Sham-NFB from the motor cortex, a region unrelated to hallucinations. Twenty-three adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and frequent medication-resistant hallucinations performed mindfulness meditation to ignore pre-recorded stranger's voices while receiving neurofeedback either from the STG (n=10, Real-NFB) or motor cortex (n=13 Sham-NFB). Individuals randomized to Sham-NFB received Real-NFB in a subsequent visit, providing a within-subject 'Real-after-Sham-NFB' comparison. Study Results Both groups showed reduced AHs after NFB, with no group differences. Compared to the Sham-NFB group, the Real-NFB group showed more reduced activation in secondary auditory cortex (AC) and more reduced connectivity between AC and cognitive control regions including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate. The connectivity reduction was also observed in the Real-after-Sham-NFB condition. Secondary AC-DLPFC connectivity reduction correlated with hallucination reduction in the Real-NFB group. Replicating prior results, both groups showed reduced primary auditory cortex activation, suggesting mindfulness meditation may regulate bottom-up processes involved in hallucinations. Conclusions Our findings emphasize delivering NFB from brain regions involved in medication-resistant AHs. They provide insights into auditory cortex and cognitive control network interactions, highlighting complex processing dynamics and top-down modulation of sensory information.

">One-shot normative modelling of whole-brain functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Many brain diseases and disorders lack objective measures of brain function as indicators of pathology, which has recently spurred the use of normative modelling in neuroimaging. Normative models characterize the normal variation of brain measurements given sex and age, thereby allowing identification of abnormalities as deviations from normal. Normative modelling of brain function is typically based on predicting functional connectivity (FC) between each pair of brain regions. But the human brain is an extremely integrated organ, and brain disease often has widespread effects that are not well captured by piecemeal analyses, i.e. connection by connection. We propose Functional Connectivity Integrative Normative Modelling (FUNCOIN), developing a whole-brain normative model of FC from a large resting-state fMRI data set that captures whole-network-level changes associated with sex and age. This model can significantly, and substantially, uncover abnormal FC patterns in Parkinson's disease patients even on scans up to 5.5 years before diagnosis.

	<p>Objectives: The aim of the present study was to examine the growth dynamics of the first sacral vertebra and its ossification center in the human fetus, based on their linear, planar, and volumetric parameters. Methods: The examinations were carried out on 54 human fetuses of both sexes (26 males and 28 females) aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;30 weeks of gestation, which had been preserved in 10% neutral formalin solution. Using CT, digital image analysis software, 3D reconstruction, and statistical methods, the size of the first sacral vertebra and its ossification center was evaluated. Results: The first sacral vertebra and its ossification center grew proportionately according to fetal weeks. Conclusions: The numerical data obtained from computed tomography and the growth patterns of the body of the first sacral vertebra and its ossification center may serve as age-specific normative intervals relevant for gynecologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, and radiologists during fetal ultrasound screening. Our findings on the growth of the body of the first sacral vertebra and its ossification center may be useful in daily clinical practice, particularly in ultrasonic monitoring of normal fetal growth and in screening for congenital defects and skeletal dysplasias.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Narration is a sensitive tool for the assessment of language in children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HF-ASD) since mild language deficits beyond the sentential level are not always noticeable through the administration of standardized language tests targeting the lexical or sentential level. This study investigated the narrative ability of monolingual Greek-speaking HF-ASD children in comparison to that of their typically developing (TD) peers and explored the associations between narrative variables, ADHD symptomatology, and memory skills in the participants on the autistic spectrum. Methods: The participants were 39 children aged 7 to 12 years, 19 with HF-ASD and 20 age-matched, vocabulary-matched, and cognitively matched TD peers. Results: The two groups were similar in most microstructural and macrostructural variables but differed significantly in syntactic complexity (p = 0.024; d = 0.754) and subordination (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; d = &amp;amp;minus;1.576) indices, implying that the HF-ASD group presented syntactic delay in comparison to their TD peers. The HF-ASD participants showed significantly higher heterogeneity in the amount of information generated for the story&amp;amp;rsquo;s main character (p = 0.004; d = &amp;amp;minus;0.093) in comparison to their TD peers. Significant associations were observed between verbal and visual memory, complex syntactic structures, and Theory of Mind-related internal state terms. ADHD symptomatology was negatively correlated with the generation of simple and coordinated clauses. Finally, complex syntax and delayed vSTM were correlated with retelling total scores, indicating that language ability and verbal memory compensate for narrative competence in HF-ASD children. Conclusions: The findings highlight the impact that language skills, memory ability, and ADHD symptomatology have on narrative competence in children with HF-ASD, as well as the importance of narrative use for assessing the language skills in populations with mild language impairment.</p>

	<p>The significant correlation between ancient medicinal practices and brain function marks a revolutionary frontier in the field of neuroscience. Acupuncture, a traditional oriental medicine, can affect brain regions, such as the hypothalamus, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and hippocampus, and produces specific therapeutic effects, such as pain relief, suppression of hypertension, and alleviation of drug addiction. Among the brain regions, the hypothalamus, a small yet critical region in the brain, plays a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis by regulating a wide array of physiological processes, including stress responses, energy balance, and pain modulation. Emerging evidence suggests that acupuncture may exert its therapeutic effects by modulating the activity of the hypothalamus and its associated neural circuits, particularly in relation to pain, stress, and metabolic regulation. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive review of past and current research on the role of the hypothalamus in mediating the therapeutic effects of acupuncture.</p>

	<p>Background: Clinicians are challenged by the ambiguity and uncertainty in assessing level of consciousness in individuals with disorder of consciousness (DoC). There are numerous challenges to valid and reliable neurobehavioral assessment and classification of DoC due to multiple environmental and patient-related biases including behavioral fluctuation and confounding or co-occurring medical conditions. Addressing these biases could impact accuracy of assessment and is an important aspect of the DoC assessment process. Methods: A pre-assessment checklist was developed by a group of interdisciplinary DoC clinical experts and researchers based on the existing literature, current validated tools, and expert opinions. Once finalized, the checklist was electronically distributed to clinicians with a range of experience in neurobehavioral assessment with DoC. Respondents were asked to use the checklist prior to completing a neurobehavioral assessment. A survey was also provided to respondents to obtain feedback regarding checklist feasibility and utility in optimizing the behavioral assessments. Results: Thirty-three clinicians completed the survey after using the checklist. Over half of the respondents were a combination of physicians, neuropsychologists, and physical therapists. All respondents served the adult DoC population and 42% percent had over ten years of clinical experience. Eighty percent reported they found the format of the checklist useful and easy to use. All respondents reported the checklist was relevant to preparing for behavioral assessment in the DoC population. Eighty-four percent reported they would recommend the use of the tool to other clinicians. Conclusions: The use of a pre-assessment checklist was found to be feasible and efficacious in increasing interdisciplinary clinician&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to optimize the patient and environment in preparation for neurobehavioral assessment. Initial results of clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; perception of the utility of a pre-assessment checklist were positive. However, further validation of the tool is needed with larger sample sizes to improve representation of clinical use across disciplines and care settings.</p>

                Background Disease-related malnutrition is common among hospitalised and recently discharged older adults. Consequences of malnutrition are physical limitations, negative health outcomes, decreased quality of life and increased healthcare costs. Dietetic care can counteract the effects of malnutrition by increasing protein and energy intake. The ProIntens study aims to evaluate the impact of an intensive dietetic care pathway on dietary protein intake and physical functioning in older adults during hospitalisation and after discharge. Process and economic evaluations will be performed. Methods The ProIntens study is a multicentre two-armed parallel individually randomised trial in five hospitals in the Amsterdam region. In total, 250 hospitalised older adults, aged ≥55 years and at risk of malnutrition will be randomised to receive regular care (control) or intensive dietetic care (intervention). The intervention consists of intensive personalised care which involves transmural guidance by trained dietitians, supportive materials on protein intake in a social context and a mobilization program during hospitalisation until three months after discharge. Controls will receive regular care. The primary outcome will be the between-groups difference in the mean change on the Short Physical Performance Battery three months after discharge. Secondary outcomes include dietary protein intake, body composition, physical activity, activities of daily living, quality of life and healthcare costs. Discussion The ProIntens trial will study the effects and costs of an intensive dietetic treatment on recovery outcomes in hospitalised older adults at risk of malnutrition. The intervention will result in practical tools for care professionals which aim to improve malnutrition treatment for older patients.

                Background The United Arab Emirates (UAE) construction industry has rapidly expanded, but construction work, by its nature, poses a high risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). These disorders significantly impact quality of life (QoL) and productivity and lead to disability and absenteeism. Aims and Objectives The study aims to determine the prevalence of WMSDs among UAE construction workers using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) and assess their QoL using the Short-Form (SF-36) survey. Additionally, it aims to explore factors associated with WMSDs and QoL among construction workers in the United Arab Emirates. Methods This study is a cross-sectional, survey-based design conducted from July 2023 to May 2024 in the United Arab Emirates. The study included male construction workers aged 18-50 with at least 1 year of experience. Participants were recruited using a combination of convenience and purposive sampling methods. The data were collected via paper-based forms using the SF-36 and NMQ questionnaires. The study instruments were chosen after reviewing relevant literature to ensure minimal measurement bias. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, tests for normality, and Pearson’s correlation test with a significance level of p <0.05. Results A total of 346 construction workers were accessed and the study found an 81.8% 12-month WMSD prevalence, most commonly affecting the lower back (44.8%), neck (45.1%), and shoulders (37.9%). Additionally, 70.5% reported pain-related limitations, and 63.6% experienced pain in the past week. SF-36 scores were lowest for role limitations due to physical health (30.33) and emotional problems (33.43), with an overall mean of 52.27 out of 100. Conclusion The study found a high prevalence of WMSD in construction workers and moderate quality of life scores. These findings highlight the urgent need to prioritize construction worker health through targeted interventions.

                Background Cardiovascular disease is rampant worldwide and has become the leading factor in increasing the global mortality rates. According to the World Heart Federation, death toll due to CVD has increased from 12.1 million in 1990 to around 19 million in 2019. Myocardial Infarction (MI) is a condition where the heart muscle dies due to reduced or inhibited flow of oxygenated blood. It has affected approximately 3 million people worldwide, with more than 1 million deaths in the United States annually. Such unusual proliferation in global death toll due to CVD can be reduced to a great extent by predicting the risk of CVD at an early stage. Method In this paper, several feature selection techniques including Variance-based, Mutual Information (MI), Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR), Boruta, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithms are used feature optimization. For class prediction, the Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Adaboost algorithms were implemented in their ordinary, One-vs-Rest (OVR) and One-vs-One (OVO) methods. Result The performance of Adaboost model has significantly improved by using feature selection techniques, that is, the accuracy of 74% (without any feature selection taking 5.3 seconds) is increased to 85% (with Boruta feature selection taking only 2.17 seconds training time) and 88% (with MRMR feature selection taking 1.6 seconds training time). Similarly, the DT-OVO model’s performance has improved from 84% (without any feature selection taking 1.48 seconds training time) to 86% (with Boruta feature selection taking 0.58 training time). For other models, the performance is maintained with reduced model training times. Conclusion This research paper prioritizes on feature selection in developing machine learning models for CVD prediction. This conclusion is justified by demonstrating the significant reduction in model training times for the 72 models generated while maintaining or even improving the model’s predictive performance.

                Melatonin, the “sleep hormone,” shows significant promise in dentistry owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. It is beneficial for treating periodontal disorders and aiding osseointegration of dental implants. Additionally, melatonin helps to manage dental anxiety, offering an alternative to traditional sedatives. Periodontal disease is orchestrated by bacterial plaques along with an exaggerated immune-inflammatory host response. Treatment of periodontitis not only involves the removal of plaque, but also aims to minimize the cytokine load and control the reactive oxygen species burden in the tissues, which would re-establish a healthy periodontium and a balanced bone metabolism. Melatonin is known to exert beneficial effects, such as regulation of circadian rhythm, bone remodeling, and antimicrobial effects. Recent studies have demonstrated the successful use of melatonin as an adjunct to mechanical debridement for the treatment of periodontal disease. Its various uses include systemic administration of melatonin after one-stage full-mouth Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy in healthy subjects as well as patients. This article provides a summary of the various clinical applications of melatonin, describing its mechanism of action, uses, and potential avenues for future research in dentistry.

                Tracheobronchial endoluminal hamartochondroma (HC) is a rare benign tumor, most frequently diagnosed in individuals between the sixth and seventh decades of life. The clinical presentation is usually very noisy. Here, we report two interesting cases. The first patient is a 58-year-old man who was wrongly treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. HC was in the lower third of the trachea. The second patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of bronchiectasis and right lower lobectomy. HC was in the middle lobe bronchus. The resection via rigid bronchoscopy with diode laser was successful without any complications. Only one patient keeps a small stable tumor residue. The rigid bronchoscopy with laser-application in tracheobronchial endoluminal HC is safe and effective. Flexible bronchoscopy is important during the follow-up.

                <p>by Alexander G. Ginsberg, Scott F. Lempka, Bo Duan, Victoria Booth, Jennifer Crodelle</p>

Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States alone around $600 billion in 2010. In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals. While the specific mechanisms remain unclear, allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In this work, we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn. These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia: static and dynamic. We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. Then, we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling. We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control, or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons “escape” their inhibitory control. Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur, the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism, and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia, thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom.

                <p>by Luis L. Fonseca, Lucas Böttcher, Borna Mehrad, Reinhard C. Laubenbacher</p>

This paper describes and validates an algorithm to solve optimal control problems for agent-based models (ABMs). For a given ABM and a given optimal control problem, the algorithm derives a surrogate model, typically lower-dimensional, in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), solves the control problem for the surrogate model, and then transfers it back to the original ABM. It applies to quite general ABMs and offers several options for the ODE structure, depending on what information about the ABM is to be used. There is a broad range of applications for such an algorithm, since ABMs are used widely in the life sciences, such as ecology, epidemiology, and biomedicine and healthcare, areas where optimal control is an important purpose for modeling, such as for medical digital twin technology.

                <p>by Olivia L. Calvin, Matthew T. Erickson, Cody J. Walters, A. David Redish</p>

Worrying about perceived threats is a hallmark of multiple psychological disorders including anxiety. This concern about future events is particularly important when an individual is faced with an approach-avoidance conflict. Potential goals to approach are known to be represented in the dorsal hippocampus during theta cycles. Similarly, important information that is distant from the animal’s position is represented during hippocampal high-synchrony events (HSEs), which coincide with sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). It is likely that potential future threats may be similarly represented. We examined how threats and rewards were represented within the hippocampus during approach-avoidance conflicts in rats faced with a predator-like robot guarding a food reward. We found decoding of the pseudo-predator’s location during HSEs when hesitating in the nest and during theta prior to retreating as the rats approached the pseudo-predator. After the first attack, we observed new place fields appearing at the location of the robot (not the location the rat was when attacked). The anxiolytic diazepam reduced anxiety-like behavior and altered hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs), including reducing SWRs, suggesting that one potential mechanism of diazepam’s actions may be through altered representations of imagined threat. These results suggest that hippocampal representation of potential threats could be an important mechanism that underlies worry and a potential target for anxiolytics.

                <p>by Joseph T. Ortega, Jacklyn M. Gallagher, Andrew G. McKee, Yidan Tang, Miguel Carmena-Bargueňo, Maria Azam, Zaiddodine Pashandi, Marcin Golczak, Jens Meiler, Horacio Pérez-Sánchez, Jonathan P. Schlebach, Beata Jastrzebska</p>

Pathogenic mutations that cause rhodopsin misfolding lead to a spectrum of currently untreatable blinding diseases collectively termed retinitis pigmentosa. Small molecules to correct rhodopsin misfolding are therefore urgently needed. In this study, we utilized virtual screening to search for drug-like molecules that bind to the orthosteric site of rod opsin and improve its folding and trafficking. We identified and validated the biological effects of 2 non-retinoid compounds with favorable pharmacological properties that cross the blood–retina barrier. These compounds reversibly bind to unliganded rod opsin, each with a K<sub>d</sub> comparable to 9-<i>cis</i>-retinal and improve opsin stability. By improving the internal protein structure network (PSN), these rod opsin ligands also enhanced the plasma membrane expression of total 36 of 123 tested clinical RP variants, including the most prevalent P23H variant. Importantly, these compounds protected retinas against light-induced degeneration in mice vulnerable to bright light injury and prolonged survival of photoreceptors in a retinitis pigmentosa mouse model for rod opsin misfolding.

                Background Deficits in sensorimotor gating have been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as in ASD murine models. However, this behavior has not been examined in the neuronal subset-specific (NS)-Pten knockout (KO) model of ASD. NS-Pten KO mice exhibit hyperactivity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway which is implicated in the onset of autistic deficits. This study investigates the potential relationship between PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and deficits in sensorimotor gating. Methods To assess sensorimotor gating in NS-Pten KO mice we utilized a three-day paradigm. On day 1 (habituation) the mice were administered 80 repetitions of a 120-dB startle stimulus. On day 2, prepulse inhibition was measured with 90 trials of the startle stimulus that was paired with a smaller (2, 7, or 12 dB) prepulse stimulus. Day 3 was assessed one week later, consisting of randomized startle trials and trials with no stimulus and was used to determine the startle response. Results No significant difference between NS-Pten KO or wildtype (WT) mice was found for habituation (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups when assessing the percentage of prepulse inhibition at 2, 7, and 12 dB (p > 0.05). There was also no difference in startle response between groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion Our study found that the NS-Pten KO model does not display significant deficits in sensorimotor gating processes. The present findings help to elucidate the relationship between PI3K/AKT/mTOR hyperactivation and sensory reactivity.

                Background The topic of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in civil and commercial contexts presents a contemporary legal challenge aimed at fostering equitable solutions. Among ADR methods, mediation stands out for its ability to reduce time, costs, and litigation duration. This study explores the conceptual framework, essential conditions, and procedural aspects of mediation. It evaluates the sufficiency, regulation, and effectiveness of mediation principles in conflict resolution and risk mitigation. Methods This study is conducted through a comprehensive review of current literature on Alternative Dispute Resolution methods, with a particular focus on mediation as an alternative to dispute settlement. The study utilizes qualitative analysis techniques to examine the effectiveness of mediation principles and their application in resolving civil and commercial disputes. Comparative analyses are also conducted to extract useful insights from various legal systems and authorities. Results The study provides an analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of mediation in resolving disputes, emphasizing its potential benefits in terms of time and cost savings, as well as its srole in facilitating amicable resolutions. The results of this study shall contribute to the current body of knowledge on mediation and provide practical recommendations for its application in diverse legal contexts. Conclusion In conclusion, the study proposes strategies to enhance mediation practices, promote a culture of its adoption, and integrate it more closely into the judicial system. Additionally, it anticipates the future effectiveness of mediation in jurisdictions lacking comprehensive legislation, drawing from successful Western experiences to guide potential developments in Arab legal frameworks.

">Self-organized and self-sustained ensemble activity patterns in simulation of mouse primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                The idea of self-organized signal processing in the cerebral cortex has become a focus of research since Beggs and Plentz reported avalanches in local field potential recordings from organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat somatosensory cortex. How the cortex intrinsically organizes signals remains unknown. A current hypothesis was proposed by the condensed matter physicists Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld when they conjectured that if neuronal avalanche activity followed inverse power law distributions, then brain activity may be set around phase transitions within self-organized signals. We asked if we would observe self-organized signals in an isolated slice of our data driven detailed simulation of the mouse primary motor cortex? If we did, would we observe avalanches with power-law distributions in size and duration and what would they look like? Our results demonstrate that a brief unstructured stimulus (100ms, 57A current) to a small subset of neurons (about 181 of more than 10,000) in a simulated mouse primary motor cortex slice results in self-organized and self-sustained avalanches with power-law size and duration distributions and values similar to those reported from in vivo and in vitro experiments. We observed 4 cross-layer and cross-neuron population patterns, 3 of which displayed a dominant rhythmic component. Avalanches were each composed of one or more of the 4 population patterns.

">Spatiotemporal Complexity in the Psychotic Brain</a></h4>

              
                Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, pose significant diagnostic challenges with major implications on mental health. The measures of resting-state fMRI spatiotemporal complexity offer a powerful tool for identifying irregularities in brain activity. To capture global brain connectivity, we employed information-theoretic metrics, overcoming the limitations of pairwise correlation analysis approaches. This enables a more comprehensive exploration of higher-order interactions and multiscale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in the psychotic brain. In this study, we provide converging evidence suggesting that the psychotic brain exhibits states of randomness across both spatial and temporal dimensions. To further investigate these disruptions, we estimated brain network connectivity using redundancy and synergy measures, aiming to assess the integration and segregation of topological information in the psychotic brain. Our findings reveal a disruption in the balance between redundant and synergistic information, a phenomenon we term brainquake in this study, which highlights the instability and disorganization of brain networks in psychosis. Moreover, our exploration of higher-order topological functional connectivity reveals profound disruptions in brain information integration. Aberrant information interactions were observed across both cortical and subcortical ICNs. We specifically identified the most easily affected irregularities in the sensorimotor, visual, temporal, default mode, and fronto-parietal networks, as well as in the hippocampal and amygdalar regions, all of which showed disruptions. These findings underscore the severe impact of psychotic states on multiscale critical brain networks, suggesting a profound alteration in the brain's complexity and organizational states.

">Specialized response of default mode subnetworks and multiple-demand regions to transitions of person, place and time</a></h4>

              
                This study used functional MRI data from the StudyForrest dataset to investigate the role of subnetworks of the default mode network (DMN) during naturalistic stimulus transitions of different types and magnitudes. We found distinct activation profiles within the DMN: the dmPFC subnetwork was specifically associated with character and location transitions, the MTL subnetwork preferred location and temporal transitions, while the Core DMN subnetwork responded to all three transition types. The multiple-demand network instead responded selectively to temporal transitions. These distinct response profiles appeared largely invariant to the semantic distance implied by the transitions. All subnetworks also responded significantly, and in a graded manner, to subjective event boundaries. Results suggest specific roles of the DMN subnetworks in perceiving and segmenting naturalistic events, supporting the view that DMN subnetworks cooperate in interpreting continuous external events and maintaining an updated contextual model of the world.

">Robustness of working memory to prefrontal cortex microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                Delay period activity in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been linked to the maintenance and control of sensory information in working memory. The stability of working memory related signals found in such delay period activity is believed to support robust memory-guided behavior during sensory perturbations, such as distractors. Here, we directly probed dlPFC's delay period activity with a diverse set of activity perturbations, and measured their consequences on neural activity and behavior. We applied patterned microstimulation to the dlPFC of monkeys implanted with multi-electrode arrays by electrically stimulating different electrodes in the array while the monkeys performed a memory guided saccade task. We found that the microstimulation perturbations affected spatial working memory-related signals in individual dlPFC neurons. However, task performance remained largely unaffected. These apparently contradictory observations could be understood by examining different dimensions of the dlPFC population activity. In dimensions where working memory related signals naturally evolved over time, microstimulation impacted neural activity. In contrast, in dimensions containing working memory related signals that were stable over time, microstimulation minimally impacted neural activity. This dissociation explained how working memory-related information could be stably maintained in dlPFC despite the activity changes induced by microstimulation. Thus, working memory processes are robust to a variety of activity perturbations in the dlPFC.

">The olivocerebellar system differentially encodes the effect sensory events exert on behavior</a></h4>

              
                Inferior olive neurons convey information about sensorimotor events via climbing fibers to the cerebellum, but their functional significance remains unclear. We directly imaged, with two-photon microscopy, climbing fiber axonal terminals in the cerebellum during a task that successively exposed mice to a force perturbation, a movement instruction and reward; each followed by multiple modes of motor activity. Climbing fiber activations by the sensory events were either generic or informative about the consequences the encoded event has on behavior. The number of informative cells and the information strength are regulated by event modality and functional complexity of the cell's activity. We observed an additional, previously unreported activation of climbing fibers: they carried probabilistic information on the behavioral context during idle waiting periods preceding stimulus presentation. Our findings reveal properties of olivary neurons that are key for defining their function in the cerebellum-dependent control of behavior. They suggest that the inferior olive flexibly instructs the cerebellum of any process that may shape an animal's action.

">Affiliative behaviours regulate allostasis development and shape biobehavioural trajectories in horse</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions shape both physiological and behavioural development of offspring and poor care/early caregiver loss are known to promote negative outcomes in adulthood in both animals and humans. How affiliative behaviours impact future development of offspring remains unknown. Here, we used Equus caballus (domestic horse) as a model to investigate this question. By coupling magnetic resonance imaging, longitudinal biobehavioural assessment and advanced multivariate statistical modelling we found that maternal presence during childhood promotes maturation of brain territories involved in both social behaviour (anterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex) and physiological regulation (hypothalamus, amygdala). Additionally, we found that offsprings benefiting from prolonged maternal presence showed higher default mode network (DMN) connectivity, improved social competences, more efficient feeding behaviours, and metabolic profiles. The present study underscores the salient role of social interactions for the development of allostatic regulation in offspring.

">Visuospatial computations vary by category and stream and continue to develop in adolescence</a></h4>

              
                Reading, face recognition, and navigation are supported by visuospatial computations in category-selective regions across ventral, lateral, and dorsal visual streams. However, the nature of visuospatial computations across streams and their development in adolescence remain unknown. Using fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) modeling in adolescents and adults, we estimate pRFs in high-level visual cortex and determine their development. Results reveal that pRF location, size, and visual field coverage vary across category, stream, and hemisphere in both adolescents and adults. While pRF location is mature by adolescence, pRF size and visual field coverage continue to develop - increasing in face-selective and decreasing in place-selective regions - alongside similar development of category selectivity. These findings provide a timeline for differential development of visual functions and suggest that visuospatial computations in high-level visual cortex continue to be optimized to accommodate both category and stream demands through adolescence.

">Dissociation of SYNGAP1 Enzymatic and Structural Roles: Intrinsic Excitability and Seizure Susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                SYNGAP1 is a key Ras-GAP protein enriched at excitatory synapses, with mutations causing intel-lectual disability and epilepsy in humans. Recent studies have revealed that in addition to its role as a negative regulator of G-protein signaling through its GAP enzymatic activity, SYNGAP1 plays an important structural role through its interaction with post-synaptic density proteins. Here, we reveal that intrinsic excitability deficits and seizure phenotypes in heterozygous Syngap1 knockout (KO) mice are differentially dependent on Syngap1 GAP activity. Cortical excitatory neurons in heterozy-gous KO mice displayed reduced intrinsic excitability, including lower input resistance, and in-creased rheobase, a phenotype recapitulated in GAP-deficient Syngap1 mutants. However, seizure severity and susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures were significantly elevated in heterozygous KO mice but unaffected in GAP-deficient mutants, implicating the structural rather than enzymatic role of Syngap1 in seizure regulation. These findings highlight the complex interplay between SYNGAP1 structural and catalytic functions in neuronal physiology and disease.

">Lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye-movement sleep are associated with brain atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions</a></h4>

              
                Study objectives: Sleep deficiency is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We examined the association of sleep architecture with anatomical features observed in AD: (1) atrophy of hippocampus, entorhinal, inferior parietal, parahippocampal, precuneus, and cuneus regions (AD-vulnerable regions) and (2) cerebral microbleeds. Methods: In 271 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study, we examined the association of baseline sleep architecture with anatomical features identified on brain MRI 13~17 years later. Sleep architecture was quantified as the proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS), proportion of rapid eye-movement sleep (REM), and arousals index using polysomnography. Outcomes included (1) volumetric measurements of each AD-vulnerable region and (2) the presence of any cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and that of lobar CMBs, which are more specifically associated with AD. We analyzed the association of each sleep predictor with each MRI outcome, adjusting for covariates. Results: Having less SWS was associated with smaller inferior parietal region (beta=-44.19 mm3 [95%CI=-76.63,-11.76]) and cuneus (beta=-11.99 mm3 [-20.93,-3.04]) after covariate adjustment. Having less REM was associated with smaller inferior parietal region (beta=-75.52 mm3 [-129.34, -21.70]) and precuneus (beta=-31.93 mm3 [-63.79,-0.07]). After FDR adjustments, lower SWS and REM, respectively, were associated with smaller inferior parietal region. Arousal index was not associated with the volumes of AD-vulnerable regions. None of the sleep architecture variables were associated with CMBs or lobar CMBs. Conclusions: Sleep deficiency is associated with the atrophy of the inferior parietal region, which is observed in early AD. Sleep architecture may be a modifiable risk factor for AD. Key words: sleep architecture, brain atrophy, inferior parietal region, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral microbleeds

                Background: Metabolic processes form the basis of the development, functioning and maintenance of the brain. Despite accumulating evidence of the vital role of metabolism in brain health, no study to date has comprehensively investigated the link between circulating markers of metabolic activity and in vivo brain morphology in the general population. Methods: We performed uni- and multivariate regression on metabolomics and MRI data from 24,940 UK Biobank participants, to estimate the individual and combined associations of 249 circulating metabolic markers with 91 measures of global and regional cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume. We investigated similarity of the identified spatial patterns with brain maps of neurotransmitters, and used Mendelian randomization to uncover causal relationships between metabolites and the brain. Results: Intracranial volume and total surface area were highly significantly associated with circulating lipoproteins and glycoprotein acetyls, with correlations up to .15. There were strong regional associations of individual markers with mixed effect directions, with distinct patterns involving frontal and temporal cortical thickness, brainstem and ventricular volume. Mendelian randomization provided evidence of bidirectional causal effects, with the majority of markers affecting frontal and temporal regions. Discussion: The results indicate strong bidirectional causal relationships between circulating metabolic markers and distinct patterns of global and regional brain morphology. The generated atlas of associations provides a better understanding of the role of metabolic pathways in structural brain development and maintenance, in both health and disease.

">Individualized Phenotyping of Functional ALS Pathology in Sensorimotor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons in primary motor cortex (MI), leading to muscle weakness, atrophy, and death within a median of three years. Even though ALS is characterized by different disease subtypes affecting different body parts, individiualized phenotyping of functional ALS pathology has so far not been achieved. We recorded 7 Tesla functional MRI (7T-fMRI) data while ALS patients and matched controls moved affected and non-affected body parts in the MR scanner. We applied robust Shared Response Modeling (rSRM) for capturing ALS-specific shared responses for group classification , and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression for relating the latent variables to clinical subtypes and the degree of disease progression. We show that both functional connectivity and functional activation in MI are a predictor for disease onset site. However, disease severity could best be predicted by functional connectivity rather than pure activation changes. Critically, we show that functionally disease-defining information in MI is not strongest in the area that is behaviorally first-affected, deviating from the behavioral phenotype of the patients. When computing the model weight distribution of the King stage classification and projecting them back into voxel space, the highest mean weights are present in the foot and tongue/face regions that seem to drive disease progress. Our data highlight the importance of 7T-fMRI task-based functional connectivity measures for classifying ALS-patients, and provide evidence that a single 7T-MRI scan can be used for identifying a disease signature of each individual ALS patient.

">Integrating explicit reliability for optimal choices: effect of trustworthiness on decisions and metadecisions</a></h4>

              
                In everyday life, decision-makers need to integrate information from various sources which differ in how reliable the correct information is provided. The present study addressed whether people can optimally use explicit information about the trustworthiness of the information source and whether people know how information sources affect their decisions. In each trial, we presented a sequence of six information sources which indicated a correct colour (red or blue) each with a different level of reliability. Each source was explicitly labelled the reliability percentage, i.e., the likelihood that a source provides correct information. Participants were asked to decide which colour was more likely to be correct. In the first series of three experiments, we found that participants failed to make use of explicit reliability cues optimally. In particular, participants were less able to use reliably wrong information sources (reliability below 50%) than reliably correct information sources (reliability above 50%), even though these two types of information sources were equally informative. In addition, participants failed to ignore the colour displayed by unreliable sources (50% reliability), although these sources gave just random information for a binary decision. In the second series of two experiments, we asked participants, after each choice, to report their subjective feelings of whether they followed or opposed a colour suggested by sources with a specific reliability percentage. We found that the ratings of the participants influence report tracked the amount of evidence which supported the choice they just made. Further, participants were able to introspect their own choice bias guided by unreliable information sources. These findings suggest that human choice behaviour deviates from Bayesian integration. However, people have a good metacognitive monitoring of how their decisions are driven by external stimuli.

	<p>Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a variant of Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), enables a neuroanatomical microscopic-like examination of the brain, which can detect brain damage using physical parameters. DTI&amp;amp;rsquo;s application to traumatic brain injury (TBI) has the potential to reveal radiological features that can assist in predicting the clinical outcomes of these patients. What is the ongoing role of DTI in detecting brain alterations and predicting neurological outcomes in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury and/or diffuse axonal injury? Methods: A scoping review of the PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The aim was to identify all potentially relevant studies concerning the role of DTI in TBI. From an initial pool of 3527 publications, 26 articles were selected based on relevance. These studies included a total of 729 patients with moderate to severe TBI and/or diffuse axonal injury. DTI parameters were analyzed to determine their relationship with neurological outcomes post-TBI, with assessments of several brain functions and regions. Results: The studies included various DTI parameters, identifying significant relationships between DTI variations and neurological outcomes following TBI. Multiple brain functions and regions were evaluated, demonstrating the capability of DTI to detect brain alterations with higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity than MRI alone. Conclusions: DTI is a valuable tool for detecting brain alterations in TBI patients, offering enhanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to MRI alone. Recent studies confirm its effectiveness in identifying neurological impairments and predicting outcomes in patients following brain trauma, underscoring its utility in clinical settings for managing TBI.</p>

	<p>Background: The brainstem auditory-evoked response (BAER) is an established electrophysiological measure of neural activity from the auditory nerve up to the brain stem. The BAER is used to diagnose abnormalities in auditory pathways and in neurophysiological human and animal research. However, normative data for BAERs in sheep, which represent an adequate large animal model for translational and basic otological research, are lacking. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the function of the ovine auditory nervous system by determining normative values for the BAER and to compare sheep with human BAER data. Methods: In this retrospective study, BAER data for click stimuli at a range of sound pressure levels (SPLs) were analyzed. A series of 15 samples from six sheep with a mean age of 41.8 months was included. Results: The mean BAER threshold was 45.3 dB SPL. At 100 dB SPL, the mean (&amp;amp;plusmn;standard deviation, SD) latency of wave V was 4.35 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.18) ms, that of wave III was 2.44 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.15) ms, and that of wave I was 0.88 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.13) ms. At 100 dB SPL, the mean interpeak latency of waves I&amp;amp;ndash;III was 1.56 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.18) ms, that of waves III&amp;amp;ndash;V was 1.91 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.16) ms, and that of waves I&amp;amp;ndash;V was 3.47 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.20) ms. The mean amplitudes at 100 dB SPL were 0.04 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.03) &amp;amp;micro;V for wave I, 0.50 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.24) &amp;amp;micro;V for wave III, and 0.40 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.25) &amp;amp;micro;V for wave V. Conclusions: The normative values for sheep BAERs were reproducible and similar to those of humans. The normative BAER values further support sheep as an adequate animal model for otological research.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The classification of psychological disorders has gained significant importance due to recent advancements in signal processing techniques. Traditionally, research in this domain has focused primarily on binary classifications of disorders. This study aims to classify five distinct states, including one control group and four categories of psychological disorders. Methods: Our investigation will utilize algorithms based on Granger causality and local graph structures to improve classification accuracy. Feature extraction from connectivity matrices was performed using local structure graphs. The extracted features were subsequently classified employing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and Na&amp;amp;iuml;ve Bayes classifiers. Results: The KNN classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy in the gamma band for the depression category, achieving an accuracy of 89.36%, a sensitivity of 89.57%, an F1 score of 94.30%, and a precision of 99.90%. Furthermore, the SVM classifier surpassed the other machine learning algorithms when all features were integrated, attaining an accuracy of 89.06%, a sensitivity of 88.97%, an F1 score of 94.16%, and a precision of 100% for the discrimination of depression in the gamma band. Conclusions: The proposed methodology provides a novel approach for analyzing EEG signals and holds potential applications in the classification of psychological disorders.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study aimed to address limitations of the pilot reliability study on the Sensory&amp;amp;ndash;Motor Dysfunction Questionnaire (SMD-Q) in two parts. Part 1 evaluated the intra-rater reliability of SMD-Q version 2 (V2). Part 2 addressed V2&amp;amp;rsquo;s limitations before assessing the intra-rater reliability of version 3 (V3). V2 framed questions as &amp;amp;ldquo;over the past week&amp;amp;rdquo;, whereas V3 also framed questions as &amp;amp;ldquo;in a typical/usual week&amp;amp;rdquo;. Methods: The SMD-Q was administered via QualtricsTM at baseline and 4 to 7 days later to subclinical neck pain participants, 51 in part 1 (32 F; mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; SD: 21.17 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.66 y) and 27 in part 2 (20 F; mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; SD: 21.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.81 y). Reliability statistics (quadratic weighted kappa (Kw) and Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha (&amp;amp;alpha;)) were calculated for all items (V2) and total scores (V2 and V3). Results: There was excellent agreement for V2 total scores (Kw &amp;amp;ge; 0.75), and V3 total scores for &amp;amp;ldquo;in a typical/usual week&amp;amp;rdquo; (Kw &amp;amp;ge; 0.75), but fair to good agreement for V3 total scores of &amp;amp;ldquo;over the past week&amp;amp;rdquo; (0.40 &amp;amp;lt; Kw &amp;amp;lt; 0.75). V2 had acceptable (0.7 &amp;amp;le; &amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;lt; 0.8) to good internal consistency (0.8 &amp;amp;le; &amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;lt; 0.9), while V3 had good internal consistency for both administrations. Conclusions: Versions 2 and 3 of the SMD-Q appear to reliably capture disordered sensorimotor integration in people with subclinical neck pain, with improved reliability in V3 when questions are framed as &amp;amp;ldquo;in a typical/usual week&amp;amp;rdquo;. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding.</p>

                <p>Mammalian parenting is an unusually demanding commitment. How has the reward system been co-opted to ensure parental care? Previous work has implicated the lateral habenula (LHb), an epithalamic nucleus, as a potential intersection of parenting behavior and reward. Here, we examine the role of the LHb in the maternal behavior of naturally parturient primiparous mouse dams. We show that kainic acid lesions of the LHb induced a severe maternal neglect phenotype in dams toward their biological pups. Next, we demonstrate that chronic chemogenetic inactivation of the LHb using inhibitory DREADDs impaired acquisition and performance of various maternal behaviors, such as pup retrieval and nesting. We present a random intercept model suggesting LHb inactivation prevents the acquisition of pup retrieval, a novel maternal behavior in primiparous mouse dams, and decreases nest building performance, an already-established behavior, in primiparous mouse dams. Lastly, we examine the spatial histology of kainic acid-treated dams with a random intercept model, which suggests the role of LHb in maternal behavior may be preferentially localized at the posterior aspect of this structure. Together, these findings serve to establish the LHb as required for maternal behavior in the mouse dam, thereby complementing previous findings implicating the LHb in parental behavior using pup-sensitized virgin female mice.</p>

                Background The objective of this study was to determine the conditioning factors for scientific research productivity in university students of health sciences. Scientific productivity, in addition to making visible the generation of new knowledge, contributes to the well-being of the population and provides feedback to the scientific community in terms of methodologies, perspectives and results that help to break down barriers that delimit productivity in scientific research. Methods A cross-sectional analytical observational study was conducted. The study population was 4104 students enrolled during the 2021-I semester in the Faculty of Health Sciences of a private Peruvian university. A sample size of 400 students was determined and a stratified probability sampling was used. The variables were measured through surveys. The dependent variable was scientific research productivity, and the independent variables were institutional culture, knowledge management and technological capital. Summary measures are reported according to the type of variable. The chi-square test with a significance level of p<0.05 was applied to assess the association between the variables of interest. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using the Stepwise method. Prevalence ratios (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results From the total of 400 students, 74.5% were male, 57.25% were aged between 18 and 27 years, 17% belonged to the school of human medicine and 72% were in their sixth year of studies. Scientific research productivity was associated with management commitment (PR=1.493; 95%CI: 1.077–2.068, p=0.015), sense of personal growth (PR=1.632; 95%CI: 1.041–2.558; p=0.024), recognition by the university (PR=1.385; 95%CI: 1.012–1.896; p=0.043), strategic alliances (PR=1.422; 95%CI: 1.032–1.959; p=0. 03), having research proposals (PR=1.522; 95%CI: 1.114–2.08; p=0.009), dissemination of results obtained (PR=1.542; 95%CI: 1.12–2.122; p=0.01), availability of human resources (PR=1.591; 95%CI: 1.165–2.173; p=0.004), access to equipment and software (PR=1.482; 95%CI: 1.061–2.069; p=0.018) and to laboratories (PR=1.438; 95%CI: 1.047–1.974; p=0.024). Conclusion It is concluded that the research productivity of undergraduate students of health sciences is low. It is imperative to strengthen the university research culture that empowers students as agents of change and strengthens faculty participation in scientific networks and communities.

                Background Age-related central auditory processing disorder and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be concomitant in older adults, making it difficult to communicate, especially in challenging listening conditions. This preliminary study investigated the efficacy of auditory-based cognitive training on the auditory processing abilities and cognitive functions of older adults with MCI. Methods In this randomized controlled trial twenty-two older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomly assigned to either an experimental (n=11) or a control group (n=11). The experimental group received 15 cognitive training sessions through tasks involving the auditory domain. The outcome measures of this study included auditory resolution (Temporal gap detection, frequency discrimination, and modulation detection) and cognitive measures (Trail making tests and digit recall), which were administered at three-time points (before training, post-training, and follow-up). The linear mixed model computed the effects of training on the outcome measures. Results A significant improvement was observed in the modulation detection threshold between baseline and follow-up and between post-training and follow-up sessions. However, GDT and FD thresholds did not reveal any statistically significant difference. In the trail making test, Part B showed consistent significance across the time points, whereas Part A and the delayed recall task showed no significant difference.

                Background PMS-algebras are a specific algebraic structure that generalizes a propositional algebra called BCK-algebra. This paper delves into the intricate group structure of these algebras and the concept of derivations within this framework. Methods We employ rigorous mathematical techniques to analyze the properties of derivations in P MS-algebras. This involves examining various characteristics of derivations and investigating their behavior in specific subcategories, such as torsion-free P MS-algebras. Results Our research reveals several key findings. Firstly, we establish that the set of all derivations associated with the binary operation defined on a P MS-algebra constitutes a semigroup. Secondly, we provide a comprehensive analysis of generalized derivations, d-invariant ideals, fixed sets, and torsion-free P MS-algebras within the context of P MS-algebras. Conclusions This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the algebraic structure of P MS-algebras and the role of derivations within this context. The findings presented here have implications for further research in abstract algebra and related fields.

                Abstract* The processes of industrialization and overconsumption of natural resources have resulted in significant environmental changes and degradation. Furthermore, the discrepancy between social and economic classes has resulted in the emergence of inequality among social groups. These issues have been further exacerbated by the advent of the global pandemic, with the greatest impact being observed in some nations, which has served to further widen the social and economic gaps. Consequently, world leaders are keen to take action to mitigate these impacts and disparities among different social groups, given that environmental degradation and climate change have a significant impact on human and planetary health. Furthermore, these factors impede the ability of individuals in disadvantaged social groups to exercise their right to food sovereignty. The objective of this article is to identify perspectives on food sovereignty in the context of climate change impacts through a bibliometric analysis. The analysis reveals that climate change research is an emerging field, with the United States playing a significant role in its development. The principal conclusion is that developed countries are primarily concerned with addressing the challenges posed by climate change to food sovereignty. Furthermore, a correlation was identified between regional CO₂ emissions and malnutrition rates, indicating a potential link between environmental degradation and food security.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-73/v1?src=rss">Optimizing outcomes in phacoemulsification: Addressing intraoperative and postoperative complications in a case series from Iraq [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Phacoemulsification is still considered the most performed surgery in the field of cataract extraction, boasting one of the highest successes of all surgical procedures. However, complications of posterior capsular rupture (PCR) and increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP) bear the potential for great risk, especially in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes or advanced age. Methods A retrospective analysis of 31 cases regarding patients undergoing phacoemulsification in a private ophthalmology clinic in Baghdad was done by noting intraoperative and postoperative complications. A systematic review is also carried out so that findings could be contextualized; studies have been sourced from both PubMed and Scopus databases. Our review covered studies that researched complications such as PCR, increased IOP, and corneal edema, chronicling developments in surgical techniques and patient management. Results The case series resulted in a postoperative best-corrected visual acuity of 6/6 in 35.5% of the patients in the right eye and 29% in the left eye. This series was associated with PCR and raised IOP; however, appropriate management ensured good improvement in vision for the majority of cases. The systematic review supports these findings, pointing out that contemporary surgical procedures and personalized attention can reduce complications substantially, even among high-risk patients. Conclusion Case series and systematic review bring forth the importance of meticulous surgical techniques combined with early recognition of risk factors and personalized postoperative management in attempting to minimize complications. These findings point to the implication of an ideal strategy in handling complications from phacoemulsification, but also have shown that continuing improvement in the surgical and postoperative protocols could further improve patient outcomes, especially those very highly at-risk.

                Background The opioid crisis is a public health challenge in the United States, significantly impacting mortality rates. This has been further exacerbated by COVID-19, contributing to a surge in substance use and overdose deaths. Methods Data from the CDC Wonder Database was used to identify opioid use-related deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2023. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) were calculated across different geographic and demographic groups. Temporal trends in mortality were analyzed using the Joinpoint Regression Program. Annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) in mortality rates were calculated. Results Opioid-related mortality surged during the COVID-19 period, with significant regional, racial, and state-level disparities. The Midwest region exhibited the highest AAPC from 1999 to 2023. State-specific analyses showed that West Virginia experienced the highest increase in AAMR from 1999 to 2023. Among racial groups, non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives had the highest AAPC from 1999 to 2023. Gender-specific analyses revealed that males had a higher AAPC from 1999 to 2023 than females. Conclusion The United States opioid crisis continued to escalate during the COVID-19 period, with significant increases in mortality across the regions. The highest AAPCs were seen in the Midwest and among non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to account for trends in racial and regional disparities in opioid-related mortality that have increased during and post-COVID-19.

                Background PMS algebras are a type of algebraic structure that has been studied extensively in recent years. They are a generalization of several other algebraic structures, such as Boolean algebras and MV-algebras. Methods In this paper, we introduce the concept of t-derivations on PMS algebras. T-derivations are a type of mapping between PMS algebras that satisfies certain properties. We then study the properties of t-derivations and regular t-derivations on PMS algebras. Results We characterize further properties of t-derivations in the context of PMS algebras. We also investigate a novel result of t-derivations on the G-part of a PMS-algebra. Finally, we prove that the set of all t-derivations on a PMS-algebra forms a semigroup. Conclusions This paper provides a comprehensive study of t-derivations on PMS algebras. We have established several new results and characterized the properties of t-derivations in detail. Our results contribute to the further understanding of PMS algebras and their associated structures.

                Very little research has been conducted to rigorously study the application of geometry for qualitative analysis in the field of disaster management. The present work aims to examine how to enhance qualitative analysis in the field by applying geometry. Descriptive qualitative analysis was used as the main methodology with the support of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist and flow chart to describe not only the nature of qualitative analysis but also how the method can be enhanced by geometric application. The principal finding was that the field supplements qualitative analysis with geometry to improve the quality of research, considering the scratch programming language, machine-oriented learning, geometric effects, and the issue of awareness. This study provides a comprehensive approach to the topic by specifically addressing pluralism and flexibility.

Intracellular liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids is a fundamental mechanism by which cells compartmentalize their components and perform essential biological functions. Molecular simulations play a crucial role in providing microscopic insights into the physicochemical processes driving this phenomenon. In this study, we systematically compare six state-of-the-art sequence-dependent residue-resolution models to evaluate their performance in reproducing the phase behaviour and material properties of condensates formed by seven variants of the low-complexity domain (LCD) of the hnRNPA1 protein (A1-LCD)—a protein implicated in the pathological liquid-to-solid transition of stress granules. Specifically, we assess the HPS, HPS-cation–<i>π</i>, HPS-Urry, CALVADOS2, Mpipi, and Mpipi-Recharged models in their predictions of the condensate saturation concentration, critical solution temperature, and condensate viscosity of the A1-LCD variants. Our analyses demonstrate that, among the tested models, Mpipi, Mpipi-Recharged, and CALVADOS2 provide accurate descriptions of the critical solution temperatures and saturation concentrations for the multiple A1-LCD variants tested. Regarding the prediction of material properties for condensates of A1-LCD and its variants, Mpipi-Recharged stands out as the most reliable model. Overall, this study benchmarks a range of residue-resolution coarse-grained models for the study of the thermodynamic stability and material properties of condensates and establishes a direct link between their performance and the ranking of intermolecular interactions these models consider.

                <p>by Obaï Bin Ka’b Ali, Alexandre Vidal, Christophe Grova, Habib Benali</p>

Astrocytes critically shape whole-brain structure and function by forming extensive gap junctional networks that intimately and actively interact with neurons. Despite their importance, existing computational models of whole-brain activity ignore the roles of astrocytes while primarily focusing on neurons. Addressing this oversight, we introduce a biophysical neural mass network model, designed to capture the dynamic interplay between astrocytes and neurons via glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission pathways. This network model proposes that neural dynamics are constrained by a two-layered structural network interconnecting both astrocytic and neuronal populations, allowing us to investigate astrocytes’ modulatory influences on whole-brain activity and emerging functional connectivity patterns. By developing a simulation methodology, informed by bifurcation and multilayer network theories, we demonstrate that the dialogue between astrocytic and neuronal networks manifests over fast–slow fluctuation mechanisms as well as through phase–amplitude connectivity processes. The findings from our research represent a significant leap forward in the modeling of glial-neuronal collaboration, promising deeper insights into their collaborative roles across health and disease states.

Respiratory diseases represent a significant healthcare burden, as evidenced by the devastating impact of COVID-19. Biophysical models offer the possibility to anticipate system behavior and provide insights into physiological functions, advancements which are comparatively and notably nascent when it comes to pulmonary mechanics research. In this context, an Inverse Finite Element Analysis (IFEA) pipeline is developed to construct the first continuously ventilated three-dimensional structurally representative pulmonary model informed by both organ- and tissue-level breathing experiments from a cadaveric human lung. Here we construct a generalizable computational framework directly validated by pressure, volume, and strain measurements using a novel inflating apparatus interfaced with adapted, lung-specific, digital image correlation techniques. The parenchyma, pleura, and airways are represented with a poroelastic formulation to simulate pressure flows within the lung lobes, calibrating the model’s material properties with the global pressure-volume response and local tissue deformations strains. The optimization yielded the following shear moduli: parenchyma (2.8 kPa), airways (0.2 kPa), and pleura (1.7 Pa). The proposed complex multi-material model with multi-experimental inputs was successfully developed using human lung data, and reproduced the shape of the inflating pressure-volume curve and strain distribution values associated with pulmonary deformation. This advancement marks a significant step towards creating a generalizable human lung model for broad applications across animal models, such as porcine, mouse, and rat lungs to reproduce pathological states and improve performance investigations regarding medical therapeutics and intervention.

                <p>by Evan Gorstein, Rosa Aghdam, Claudia Solís-Lemus</p>

High-dimensional mixed-effects models are an increasingly important form of regression in which the number of covariates rivals or exceeds the number of samples, which are collected in groups or clusters. The penalized likelihood approach to fitting these models relies on a coordinate descent algorithm that lacks guarantees of convergence to a global optimum. Here, we empirically study the behavior of this algorithm on simulated and real examples of three types of data that are common in modern biology: transcriptome, genome-wide association, and microbiome data. Our simulations provide new insights into the algorithm’s behavior in these settings, and, comparing the performance of two popular penalties, we demonstrate that the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty consistently outperforms the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty in terms of both variable selection and estimation accuracy across omics data. To empower researchers in biology and other fields to fit models with the SCAD penalty, we implement the algorithm in a Julia package, HighDimMixedModels.jl.

                <p>by Sarah M. Tashjian, Joseph Cussen, Wenning Deng, Bo Zhang, Dean Mobbs</p>

Pivotal to self-preservation is the ability to identify when we are safe and when we are in danger. Previous studies have focused on safety estimations based on the features of external threats and do not consider how the brain integrates other key factors, including estimates about our ability to protect ourselves. Here, we examine the neural systems underlying the online dynamic encoding of safety. The current preregistered study used 2 novel tasks to test 4 facets of safety estimation: <i>Safety Prediction</i>, <i>Meta-representation</i>, <i>Recognition</i>, and <i>Value Updating</i>. We experimentally manipulated safety estimation changing both levels of external threats and self-protection. Data were collected in 2 independent samples (behavioral <i>N</i> = 100; MRI <i>N</i> = 30). We found consistent evidence of subjective changes in the sensitivity to safety conferred through protection. Neural responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracked increases in safety during all safety estimation facets, with specific tuning to protection. Further, informational connectivity analyses revealed distinct hubs of safety coding in the posterior and anterior vmPFC for external threats and protection, respectively. These findings reveal a central role of the vmPFC for coding safety.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-68/v1?src=rss">Novel Method for Routine Ultrasound-Guided Serum Collection for Biomarker Analysis Around the Knee Joint [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Biomarkers are essential tools in modern medicine, allowing stratification and monitoring of clinical care and treatment response. While systemic blood biomarkers, typically collected from the antecubital vein (AV), are widely used, their sensitivity for joint-specific pathologies such as osteoarthritis (OA) may be limited due to systemic dilution. At present, no serum biomarker reliably reflects the microenvironment of an affected joint in clinical practice. Although synovial fluid (SF) assessment can provide insights into localised pathology and are clinically used for diagnosis in crystal arthropathies and joint infections, their collection is invasive, painful, and carries risks, including infection, making repeated sampling impractical, limiting utility for monitoring treatment responses. This study introduces a novel ultrasound-guided venous sampling technique targeting the saphenous vein (SV) proximal to the knee joint as a less invasive alternative to SF aspiration, hypothesising that it may better reflect the joint-specific microenvironment. Methods A standardised gel model was used to train medically qualified researchers in ultrasound-guided venepuncture of vescles around 2-15 mm in diameter. Subsequently, 32 participants consented to blood sampling from the SV above the knee, with a proximally applied tourniquet to dilate vein diameter for easier venepuncture collection. Results The technique achieved serum collection in over 80% of consented individuals with minimal adverse effects (including n=2 minor bruising and n=1 transient nerve irritation). Key procedural insights included optimal site selection, appropriate pressure application, and effective tourniquet use. Discussion This method demonstrates feasibility, acceptability, and the potential for more localised sample collection, advancing biomarker research. Further validation, including paired SF comparisons, is required to confirm diagnostic utility and develop therapeutic strategies for joint-specific conditions.

                Introduction Globally, oral cancer is the 15th deadliest cancer among humans. Diverse health education interventions have played a very significant role in the prevention of oral cancer. Of these interventions, digital interventions, especially mhealth-driven interventions, have been largely underutilized. So far, only two known educative mobile health applications (MHAs) for oral cancer exits; unfortunately, these two applications are not comprehensive and not inclusive for diverse populations. There is a need for a comprehensive and more inclusive MHA that can be used to educate the public about oral cancer. Objectives To co-develop, co-create, and test a comprehensive and inclusive MHA that can be used to educate the public about oral cancer. Methods The proposed study will be conducted and reported using the PRODUCES (PRoblem, Objective, Design, (end-) Users, Co-creators, Evaluation, Scalability) framework—this framework provides a novel approach which can be used to develop mhealth interventions through participatory action research methodologies. This study will have three parts. The first part will co-develop an eight-sectioned lay educational content on oral cancer through three-round Delphi consultations with thirty subject matter experts in the field of oral cancer and public health. Using the co-developed educational content, the second part of this study will co-create an educative MHA prototype on oral cancer through three-round Delphi consultations with twenty digital communication experts and persons at risk of oral cancer. Lastly, the third part will, through a three-arm, parallel, open-label randomized control trial, test and compare, among seventy-five young adults, the effectiveness, usability, uptake, and acceptability of the co-created MHA prototype on oral cancer against a web-based educational resource on oral cancer. Conclusion The outcomes of this study will co-produce and test an inclusive and comprehensive MHA prototype that can be used to educate diverse populations across the world about oral cancer.

                Background Understanding the epidemiology of soccer injuries during specific international competitions is essential for customizing preventive strategies. Several studies have reported outcomes related to international competitions but, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no investigation into the injury patterns during any African Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournaments. This study aimed to analyse the incidence and the characteristics of soccer injuries during the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON), which took place in Cameroon from January 9 to February 6, 2022. Methods A video-based analysis covering 52 matches was conducted by two independent consultant physicians. They reviewed injury replays to determine incidence and characteristics ( i.e. ; mechanisms, body location, match moment, player substitution, absence in the next match, and referee decisions). Results The tournament involved 519 male players, comprising 275 African (ALP) and 244 Non-African (NALP) league players. Eighty-seven injuries occurred, with incidences of 1.7 and 48.8 injuries per match and per 1000 match hours, respectively. Injury incidence rose with competition stages, particularly contact mechanism injuries. Non-contact injuries (23/87) predominantly occurred after 60 minutes of play (19/23), with the thigh being the most frequently affected body part (18/87). Older age and playing time significantly correlated with injury occurrence (p=0.032 and p<0.001, respectively). NALP midfielders and forwards were notably injured by contact mechanisms (36/45) in the attacking zone. Although non-contact mechanisms were more common in ALP than NALP (13/42 vs. 9/45), the difference lacked statistical significance (p=0.240), with a higher rate of muscle injuries (13/42 vs. 10/45, p=0.001). Conclusion Muscle injuries prevailed among professional soccer players in the 2021 AFCON, with older age and playing time identified as key associated factors. Muscle injuries were more prevalent in ALP compared to NALP.

     alt="Afferent Projections to the Calca/CGRP-Expressing Parabrachial Neurons in Mice"/>
<p>The calcitonin gene-related peptide (Calca/CGRP)-expressing parabrachial (PB) neurons receive strong inputs from GABAergic bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) neurons and moderate GABAergic inputs from the substantia innominata (SI) and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VLPAG). They also receive strong or moderate inputs from glutamatergic neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Some regions such as the infralimbic cortex (IL), insular cortex (IC), SI, arcuate nucleus (Arc), and PVH show strong or moderate labeling with cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) but little labeling with rabies, suggesting these regions may innervate non-Calca/CGRP PB neurons.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The parabrachial nucleus (PB), located in the dorsolateral pons, contains primarily glutamatergic neurons that regulate responses to a variety of interoceptive and cutaneous sensory signals. One lateral PB subpopulation expresses the <i>Calca</i> gene, which codes for the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). These PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons relay signals related to threatening stimuli such as hypercarbia, pain, and nausea, yet their inputs and their neurochemical identity are only partially understood. We mapped the afferent projections to the lateral part of the PB in mice using conventional cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) retrograde tracing and then used conditional rabies virus retrograde tracing to map monosynaptic inputs specifically targeting the PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons. Using vesicular GABA (vGAT) and glutamate (vGLUT2) transporter reporter mice, we found that lateral PB neurons receive GABAergic afferents from regions such as the lateral part of the central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral dorsal subnucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, substantia innominata, and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Additionally, they receive glutamatergic afferents from the infralimbic and insular cortex, paraventricular nucleus, parasubthalamic nucleus, trigeminal complex, medullary reticular nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Using anterograde tracing and confocal microscopy, we then identified close axonal appositions between these afferents and PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons. Finally, we used channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping and found that GABAergic neurons of the central nucleus of the amygdala directly inhibit the PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons. These findings provide a comprehensive neuroanatomical framework for understanding the afferent projections regulating the PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons.</p>

                Yue et al. investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying nociceptive-evoked gamma-band oscillations (GBOs) in human and rodent models. Nociceptive-evoked GBOs preferentially encoding pain intensity are causally generated by parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the primary somatosensory cortex. These findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted pain therapies aimed at modulating GBOs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96303">Geometry and dynamics of representations in a precisely balanced memory network related to olfactory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Biological memory networks are thought to store information by experience-dependent changes in the synaptic connectivity between assemblies of neurons. Recent models suggest that these assemblies contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E/I assemblies), resulting in co-tuning and precise balance of excitation and inhibition. To understand computational consequences of E/I assemblies under biologically realistic constraints we built a spiking network model based on experimental data from telencephalic area Dp of adult zebrafish, a precisely balanced recurrent network homologous to piriform cortex. We found that E/I assemblies stabilized firing rate distributions compared to networks with excitatory assemblies and global inhibition. Unlike classical memory models, networks with E/I assemblies did not show discrete attractor dynamics. Rather, responses to learned inputs were locally constrained onto manifolds that ‘focused’ activity into neuronal subspaces. The covariance structure of these manifolds supported pattern classification when information was retrieved from selected neuronal subsets. Networks with E/I assemblies therefore transformed the geometry of neuronal coding space, resulting in continuous representations that reflected both relatedness of inputs and an individual’s experience. Such continuous representations enable fast pattern classification, can support continual learning, and may provide a basis for higher-order learning and cognitive computations.

                Many applications in biomedicine and synthetic bioengineering rely on understanding, mapping, predicting, and controlling the complex behavior of chemical and genetic networks. The emerging field of diverse intelligence investigates the problem-solving capacities of unconventional agents. However, few quantitative tools exist for exploring the competencies of non-conventional systems. Here, we view gene regulatory networks (GRNs) as agents navigating a problem space and develop automated tools to map the robust goal states GRNs can reach despite perturbations. Our contributions include: (1) Adapting curiosity-driven exploration algorithms from AI to discover the range of reachable goal states of GRNs, and (2) Proposing empirical tests inspired by behaviorist approaches to assess their navigation competencies. Our data shows that models inferred from biological data can reach a wide spectrum of steady states, exhibiting various competencies in physiological network dynamics without requiring structural changes in network properties or connectivity. We also explore the applicability of these ‘behavioral catalogs’ for comparing evolved competencies across biological networks, for designing drug interventions in biomedical contexts and synthetic gene networks for bioengineering. These tools and the emphasis on behavior-shaping open new paths for efficiently exploring the complex behavior of biological networks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97981">Robust single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals depot-specific cell population dynamics in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity</a></h4>

              
                Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), an alternative to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), encounters technical challenges in obtaining high-quality nuclei and RNA, persistently hindering its applications. Here, we present a robust technique for isolating nuclei across various tissue types, remarkably enhancing snRNA-seq data quality. Employing this approach, we comprehensively characterize the depot-dependent cellular dynamics of various cell types underlying mouse adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. By integrating bulk nuclear RNA-seq from adipocyte nuclei of different sizes, we identify distinct adipocyte subpopulations categorized by size and functionality. These subpopulations follow two divergent trajectories, adaptive and pathological, with their prevalence varying by depot. Specifically, we identify a key molecular feature of dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes, a global shutdown in gene expression, along with elevated stress and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, our differential gene expression analysis reveals distinct contributions of adipocyte subpopulations to the overall pathophysiology of adipose tissue. Our study establishes a robust snRNA-seq method, providing novel insights into the biological processes involved in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity, with broader applicability across diverse biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101727">Assessing the balance between excitation and inhibition in chronic pain through the aperiodic component of EEG</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating condition whose neural mechanisms are incompletely understood. An imbalance of cerebral excitation and inhibition (E/I), particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), is believed to represent a crucial mechanism in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Thus, identifying a non-invasive, scalable marker of E/I could provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of chronic pain and aid in developing clinically useful biomarkers. Recently, the aperiodic component of the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum has been proposed to represent a non-invasive proxy for E/I. We, therefore, assessed the aperiodic component in the mPFC of resting-state EEG recordings in 149 people with chronic pain and 115 healthy participants. We found robust evidence against differences in the aperiodic component in the mPFC between people with chronic pain and healthy participants, and no correlation between the aperiodic component and pain intensity. These findings were consistent across different subtypes of chronic pain and were similarly found in a whole-brain analysis. Their robustness was supported by preregistration and multiverse analyses across many different methodological choices. Together, our results suggest that the EEG aperiodic component does not differentiate between people with chronic pain and healthy individuals. These findings and the rigorous methodological approach can guide future studies investigating non-invasive, scalable markers of cerebral dysfunction in people with chronic pain and beyond.

">Spinal Cord Ultrasound Stimulation Modulates Corticospinal Excitability</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) offers superior tissue penetration and enables precise neuromodulation of cortical and subcortical circuits. However, its effects on neural activity in the human spinal cord remain largely unexplored. Objective: To investigate the effects of LIFU on spinal cord neuromodulation under varying conditions of intensity (spatial-peak pulse-average intensity, ISPPA), duty cycle (DC), and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). Methods: Thirty-six healthy human volunteers participated in the study. A 500 kHz ultrasound transducer with a focal depth exceeding 100 mm was used to target the C8 spinal cord. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) hotspot corresponding to the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, innervated by the C8 nerve. A 500 ms-duration LIFU was delivered to the C8 spinal cord 400 ms prior to single-pulse TMS over the FDI hotspot. Spinal cord ultrasound stimulation (SCUS) was administered with varying acoustic parameters: intensities (ISPPA: 2.5 and 10 W/cm2), DCs (10% and 30%), and PRFs (500 and 1000 Hz). Changes in corticospinal excitability were assessed by comparing TMS-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) between active and sham SCUS conditions. Results: SCUS with an ISPPA of 10 W/cm2, a DC of 30%, and a PRF of 1000 Hz significantly reduced MEP amplitudes compared to sham stimulation. However, at the high intensity (ISPPA of 10 W/cm2), varying the DC between 10% and 30% did not affect MEP amplitudes. Additionally, while a PRF of 1000 Hz decreased MEP amplitudes at 10 W/cm2, a PRF of 500 Hz did not produce significant changes. Conclusions: The results indicate that ultrasound stimulation of the spinal cord can suppress corticospinal drive to muscles, especially when utilizing high intensity and high PRF parameters. This suggests that ultrasound stimulation may provide a novel method for modulating human spinal neural activity.

">EEG-Informed fMRI Analysis Reveals Neurovascular Coupling in Motor Execution and Imagery</a></h4>

              
                The complementary strengths of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have driven extensive research into integrating these two noninvasive modalities to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive, sensory, and motor functions. However, the precise neural patterns associated with motor functions, especially imagined movements, remain unclear. Specifically, the correlations between electrophysiological responses and hemodynamic activations during executed and imagined movements have not been fully elucidated at a whole-brain level. In this study, we employed an EEG-informed fMRI approach on concurrent EEG-fMRI data to map hemodynamic changes associated with dynamic EEG temporal features during motor-related brain activities. We localized and differentiated the hemodynamic activations corresponding to continuous EEG temporal dynamics across multiple motor execution and imagery tasks. Validation against conventional block fMRI analysis demonstrated high precision in identifying regions specific to motor activities, underscoring the accuracy of the EEG-driven model. Beyond the expected sensorimotor activations, the integrated analysis revealed supplementary coactivated regions showing significant negative covariation between blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activities and sensorimotor EEG alpha power, including the cerebellum and insular cortex. These findings confirmed both the colocalization of EEG and fMRI activities in sensorimotor regions and a negative covariation between EEG alpha band power and BOLD changes. Moreover, the results provide novel insights into neurovascular coupling during motor execution and imagery on a brain-wide scale, advancing our understanding of the neural dynamics underlying motor functions.

">Self-supervision deep learning models are better models of human high-level visual cortex: The roles of multi-modality and dataset training size</a></h4>

              
                With the rapid development of Artificial Neural Network based visual models, many studies have shown that these models show unprecedented potence in predicting neural responses to images in visual cortex. Lately, advances in computer vision have introduced self-supervised models, where a model is trained using supervision from natural properties of the training set. This has led to examination of their neural prediction performance, which revealed better prediction of self-supervised than supervised models for models trained with language supervision or with image-only supervision. In this work, we delve deeper into the models ability to explain neural representations of object categories. We compare models that differed in their training objectives to examine where they diverge in their ability to predict fMRI and MEG recordings while participants are presented with images of different object categories. Results from both fMRI and MEG show that self-supervision was advantageous in comparison to classification training. In addition, language supervision is a better predictor for later stages of visual perception, while image-only supervision shows a consistent advantage over a longer duration, beginning from 80ms after exposure. Examination of the effect of data size training revealed that large dataset did not necessarily improve neural predictions, in particular in visual self-supervised models. Finally, examination of the correspondence of the hierarchy of each model to visual cortex showed that image-only self-supervision led to better correspondence than image only models. We conclude that while self-supervision shows consistently better prediction of fMRI and MEG recordings, each type of supervision reveals a different property of neural activity, with language-supervision explaining later onsets, while image-only self-supervision explains long and very early latencies of the neural response, with the model hierarchy naturally sharing corresponding hierarchical structure as the brain.

">Prolyl isomerase FKBP12 reduces axon growth and negatively regulates microtubule polymerization by inhibiting CRMP2A</a></h4>

              
                Prolyl isomerases are enzymes catalyzing conformational change of the peptide bond between proline and the preceding amino acid, regulating the function and stability of their substrates. We have previously identified CRMP2A - the longer isoform of a microtubule-associated protein Collapsin response mediator protein 2 - as a substrate of the phospho-specific prolyl isomerase Pin1. CRMP2A is negatively regulated and destabilized by CDK5 phosphorylation in the distal axons and growth cones. Pin1 specifically binds to phosphorylated CRMP2A and stabilizes it by inducing conformational changes. However, the conformational regulation of unphosphorylated CRMP2 remains unknown. Here, we show that the prolyl isomerase FKBP12 specifically binds to unphosphorylated CRMP2A and regulates its activity. Using in vitro microtubule polymerization assays we demonstrate that CRMP2A promotes microtubule growth and that this function is inhibited by FKBP12. Next, using GFP-EB3 microtubule plus-end tracking assay, we demonstrate that FKBP12 inhibits CRMP2A-mediated microtubule polymerization also in cells. Furthermore, we show that FKBP12 co-localizes with unphosphorylated CRMP2A in growth cones and that expression of FKBP12 reduces axon growth in microfluidic chambers, while FKBP12 knockdown enhances it. Together, we demonstrate that FKBP12 is a negative regulator of microtubule dynamics and axon growth. Moreover, we show that two prolyl isomerases can differentially (positively or negatively) regulate activity of a common substrate depending on its phosphorylation. This provides an additional layer of phosphorylation-dependent or -independent control of protein activity, microtubule dynamics, and neuronal growth. Given the broad substrate specificity of FKBP12 and Pin1, this regulatory mechanism likely contributes to the modulation of diverse proteins and cellular processes in the nervous system and beyond.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Objective memory decline is associated with poor quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD, but it is unclear what role perception of memory (metamemory) plays. The Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) measures metamemory and is proposed to have a three-factor structure, but the factor structure of the MMQ in PD has not been explored. The current study examined (i) the factor structure of the MMQ in PD and (ii) the relationship between the metamemory and QOL in PD. Methods: This longitudinal, observational study involved 149 participants with PD (98 males, M age = 65.78 years, SD = 9.25). Participants completed the MMQ and the Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (disease severity) at baseline, and the Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire-39 (QOL) two years later. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed both the three-factor and four-factor models were inadequate. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a four-factor solution. The contentment and ability subscales from the original factor structure remained, while the strategies subscale was divided into external strategies and internal strategies. Disease severity, ability, and internal strategies uniquely predicted QOL. Individuals who reported low subjective memory ability and high use of internal strategies reported worse QOL two years later. Conclusions: These findings indicate that metamemory predicts QOL in PD and suggest that improved perceived memory ability and strategy use could offer avenues for improved QOL.</p>

	<p>Background: This study examined the prevalence of mental health issues among Paraguayan researchers and their relationships with emotional regulation and psychosocial factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 235 researchers was conducted using validated instruments: the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21); the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ); and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Sociodemographic, academic, and behavioral variables were also analyzed. Results: Findings revealed significant rates of depression (26.4%), anxiety (30.6%), and stress (32.3%), with female researchers reporting nearly twice the rates of anxiety and stress compared to males. Researchers with doctoral degrees exhibited lower anxiety levels, emphasizing the protective role of advanced academic qualifications. Conversely, younger and early-career researchers were more vulnerable to psychological distress. High job demands and emotional dysregulation were strongly associated with poorer mental health outcomes, while hazardous alcohol consumption and low physical activity further exacerbated risks. Conclusions: These findings highlight the urgent need for institutional reforms to prioritize mental health and well-being in academic environments. By advancing the understanding of occupational health in resource-limited settings, this study provides actionable recommendations to improve the working conditions and mental health of researchers in Paraguay and beyond.</p>

                Agnihotri et al. show that the C9ORF72-associated poly-PR dipeptide promotes NEAT1-dependent TDP-43 nuclear condensate formation. Colocalization and subsequent delocalization of HSP70 from the condensates reduce their fluidity along with oligomerization of TDP-43, highlighting the crucial role of HSP70 in regulating TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon poly-PR stress.

     alt="Neurological and Cognitive Effects of Hypothyroidism in Patients With Epilepsy: A Study on Anti-Seizure Medicines Therapy"/>
<p>The study's significance lies in its comprehensive analysis of neurological disorders and cognitive pathologies in hypothyroidism and epilepsy patients undergoing anti-seizure medicines therapy. The study findings underscore the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate therapy in managing cognitive and neurological impairments in patients with hypothyroidism and epilepsy. To enhance clinical practice, specific measures that could be implemented include integrating routine cognitive assessments into the standard care of patients with thyroid dysfunction and personalizing treatment protocols based on individual risk factors such as hormone levels, family history, and stress indicators.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to examine neurological disorders and cognitive impairments in patients with secondary hypothyroidism and epilepsy undergoing treatment with antiepileptic medications. The study included 184 patients divided into three groups: Group 1 (subclinical hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 60), Group 2 (manifest hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 64), and Group 3 (control, <i>n</i> = 60). Patients in Group 2 received levothyroxine therapy (initial dose of 25 μg/day, titrated to 50–100 μg/day), while Groups 1 and 2 were treated with anti-seizure medications (valproic acid, 40 mg/kg/day). Neurological symptoms, including Babinski's reflex abnormalities (<i>χ</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 8.15, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and sensory disturbances (<i>χ</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 12.44, <i>p</i> = 0.005), were significantly more frequent in Group 2 than in Group 1. Cognitive test scores were significantly lower in Group 2 compared to Group 3 across all domains (<i>F</i>(2, 181) = 6.55, <i>p</i> = 0.002 for MMSE; <i>F</i>(2, 181) = 4.70, <i>p</i> = 0.010 for FAB; and <i>F</i>(2, 181) = 5.75, <i>p</i> = 0.006 for CDT), with Group 1 showing intermediate results. Regression analysis identified neurodegenerative disease risk (<i>β</i> = 0.34, CI: 0.20–0.48, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), anemia (<i>β</i> = 0.32, CI: 0.15–0.49, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and prolonged stress (<i>β</i> = 0.26, CI: 0.12–0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.002) as significant predictors of cognitive decline, while higher education was protective (<i>β</i> = −0.28, CI: −0.42 to −0.14, <i>p</i> = 0.003). An inverse relationship was observed between TSH levels and cognitive scores (<i>r</i> = −0.55, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>

     alt="Ultrastructural Localization of Glutamate Delta Receptor 1 in the Rodent and Primate Lateral Habenula"/>
<p>In this study, we used immunoelectron microscopic methods combined with tract-tracing approaches to demonstrate that GluD1 is primarily expressed in the core of symmetric synapses formed by GABAergic terminals that originate from the lateral hypothalamus and entopeduncular nucleus in the rodent and primate lateral habenula.

</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glutamate delta receptor 1 (GluD1) is a unique synaptogenic molecule expressed at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The lateral habenula (LHb), a subcortical structure that regulates negative reward prediction error and major monoaminergic systems, is enriched in GluD1. LHb dysfunction has been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, both of which are associated with <i>GRID1</i>, the gene that encodes GluD1. Thus, disruption in GluD1 synaptic signaling may contribute to LHb dysfunction and the pathophysiology of LHb-associated disorders. Despite its strong cellular expression, little is known about the subsynaptic and subcellular localization of GluD1 in LHb neurons. Given that GluD1 is involved in the development and/or regulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in various brain regions, a detailed map of GluD1 synaptic localization is essential to elucidate its role in the LHb. To address this issue, we used immunoelectron microscopy methods in rodents and monkeys. In both species, GluD1 immunoreactivity was primarily expressed in dendritic profiles, with lower expression in somata, spines, and glial elements. Pre- and post-embedding immunogold experiments revealed strong GluD1 expression in the core of symmetric GABAergic synapses. Albeit less frequent, GluD1 was also found at the edges (i.e., perisynaptic) of asymmetric, putative glutamatergic synapses. Through the combination of anterograde tracing with immunogold labeling in rats, we showed that axon terminals from the entopeduncular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus express postsynaptic GluD1 immunolabeling in the LHb. Our findings suggest that GluD1 may play a critical role in modulating GABAergic transmission in the rodent and primate LHb.</p>

                McCole et al. show an evolutionarily conserved shift to less enzymatically active Polycomb repressive complexes in quiescent cells. They propose that the non-enzymatic functions of EZH1-PRC2 and canonical PRC1 help maintain repressive chromatin in these cells. Their findings caution about using PRC2 inhibitors to treat cancers with tumor-sustaining, non-dividing cells.

	<p>Background: Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) is the most dreaded complication after reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to estimate and compare risks of sICH after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) depending on the location of the large vessel occlusion, concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis, timing of treatment, and core size. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were included, following a comprehensive search of different databases from inception to 1 March 2024. Random-effect models in a meta-analysis were employed to obtain the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for sICH with MT, and were then compared to other reperfusion treatment regimens, including best medical treatment and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Results: MT in the anterior circulation was associated with a significantly higher risk of sICH as compared with no-MT (RR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.03&amp;amp;ndash;2.07; p = 0.037). The risk of sICH was comparable between the MT and MT+IVT groups (RR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.57&amp;amp;ndash;1.03; p = 0.079). There was no difference in sICH risk with MT as compared with no-MT within 6 h of last known well (RR: 1.14; 95%CI: 0.78&amp;amp;ndash;1.66; p = 0.485) and beyond that time (RR: 1.29; 95%CI: 0.80&amp;amp;ndash;2.08; p = 0.252); the risk of sICH was also comparable between MT conducted within 6 h of last known well and MT conducted beyond that time (p = 0.512). The sICH risk for MT in the posterior circulation (RR: 7.48; 95%CI: 2.27&amp;amp;ndash;24.61) was significantly higher than for MT in the anterior circulation (RR: 1.18; 95%CI: 0.90&amp;amp;ndash;1.56) (p = 0.003). MT was also associated with a significantly higher sICH risk than no-MT among patients with large core strokes (RR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;2.66, p = 0.018). Conclusions: When evaluating cumulative evidence from randomized controlled trials, the risk of sICH is increased after MT compared with patients not treated with MT. Yet, the difference is largely driven by the greater risk of sICH in patients treated with MT for posterior circulation occlusions and, to a lesser degree, large core strokes. Concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis and the use of MT in the extended therapeutic window do not raise the risk of sICH.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous studies have shown that multiple post-traumatic irradiations of the cochlea with near-infrared light (NIR) can significantly reduce noise-induced hearing loss. However, a single NIR pre-treatment was shown to have the same effect. Extending the pre-treatment time did not result in any further reduction in hearing loss. The present study investigated whether a combined NIR pre- and post-treatment had an increased effect on hearing preservation. Methods: Frequency-specific auditory brainstem potential thresholds (ABR) were determined in young adult mice. One group (n = 8) underwent NIR irradiation (808 nm, 120 mW, 15 min) of the cochlea, followed by a 30 min noise exposure (5&amp;amp;ndash;20 kHz, 115 dB SPL). A post-NIR treatment was administered for 30 min immediately following the noise trauma. After 14 days, hearing loss was determined by ABR measurements. The results were compared with a trauma-only group (n = 8) and an untreated control group (n = 5). Subsequently, the spiral ganglion neuron density was investigated. Results: A peri-traumatic NIR treatment resulted in a significantly lower hearing loss compared to the trauma-only group. Hearing protection in these animals significantly exceeded the effect of an exclusive pre- or post-treatment across all frequencies. A loss of spiral ganglion neurons in the trauma-only group was observed, which was significantly rescued by the peri-traumatic NIR treatment. Conclusions: A single peri-traumatic NIR treatment seems to be the more effective approach for the preservation of hearing thresholds after noise trauma compared to an isolated pre- or post-treatment. One target of the protective effect seems to be the spiral ganglion.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by cardinal motor features and a multitude of non-motor manifestations. Among them, cognitive impairment in PD has been recognised as a defined clinical entity, and it might lead to an increased risk of developing dementia. Consequently, the present review aimed to ascertain the available interventions for the training of cognitive abilities in persons with PD (PwPD). Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed to select studies in the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers conducted the different phases of the review, and a third expert was called in to address any doubts/conflicts. Randomised controlled trials and randomised clinical trials concerning cognitive training with cognitive outcomes in PwPD were selected. Results: A total of 28 articles were included. The considered studies applied various experimental interventions for the training of cognitive functions in PwPD: computer-based platforms, exergames, paper-and-pencil programmes, dual-task or treadmill training with action observation therapy, motor imagery, and virtual reality components, interventions targeting precise cognitive domain, tele-rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation, structured cognitive training, and multimodal treatments. Cognitive functions were assessed employing neuropsychological tests, self-report questionnaires, and computerised batteries. Conclusions: Overall, the review reported better performances in the experimental groups compared to the control groups, in several cognitive domains. Structured cognitive training emerged as the most effective strategy to enhance cognitive functioning in PwPD. However, further studies are necessary to determine the most appropriate and useful training and to develop interventions that also consider patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life.</p>

	<p>Objective: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data pose significant challenges due to their inherently noisy and complex nature, making traditional statistical models less effective in capturing predictive features. While deep learning models offer superior performance through their non-linear capabilities, they often lack transparency, reducing trust in their predictions. This study introduces the Time Reversal (TR) pretraining method to address these challenges. TR aims to learn temporal dependencies in data, leveraging large datasets for pretraining and applying this knowledge to improve schizophrenia classification on smaller datasets. Methods: We pretrained an LSTM-based model with attention using the TR approach, focusing on learning the direction of time in fMRI data, achieving over 98 % accuracy on HCP and UK Biobank datasets. For downstream schizophrenia classification, TR-pretrained weights were transferred to models evaluated on FBIRN, COBRE, and B-SNIP datasets. Saliency maps were generated using Integrated Gradients (IG) to provide post hoc explanations for pretraining, while Earth Mover&amp;amp;rsquo;s Distance (EMD) quantified the temporal dynamics of salient features in the downstream tasks. Results: TR pretraining significantly improved schizophrenia classification performance across all datasets: median AUC scores increased from 0.7958 to 0.8359 (FBIRN), 0.6825 to 0.7778 (COBRE), and 0.6341 to 0.7224 (B-SNIP). The saliency maps revealed more concentrated and biologically meaningful salient features along the time axis, aligning with the episodic nature of schizophrenia. TR consistently outperformed baseline pretraining methods, including OCP and PCL, in terms of AUC, balanced accuracy, and robustness. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the dual benefits of the TR method: enhanced predictive performance and improved interpretability. By aligning model predictions with meaningful temporal patterns in brain activity, TR bridges the gap between deep learning and clinical relevance. These findings emphasize the potential of explainable AI tools for aiding clinicians in diagnostics and treatment planning, especially in conditions characterized by disrupted temporal dynamics.</p>

                <p>It is widely believed that axons in the central nervous system of adult mammals do not regrow following injury. This failure is thought, at least in part, to underlie the limited recovery of function following injury to the brain or spinal cord. Some studies of fixed tissue have suggested that, counter to dogma, norepinephrine (NE) axons regrow following brain injury. Here, we have used in vivo two-photon microscopy in layer 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex in transgenic mice harboring a fluorophore selectively expressed in NE neurons. This protocol allowed us to explore the dynamic nature of NE axons following injury with the selective NE axon toxin <I>N</I>-(2-chloroethyl)-<I>N</I>-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4). Following DSP4, NE axons were massively depleted and then slowly and partially recovered their density over a period of weeks. This regrowth was dominated by new axons entering the imaged volume. There was almost no contribution from local sprouting from spared NE axons. Regrown axons did not appear to use either the paths of previously lesioned NE axons or NE axons that were spared and survived DSP4 as a guide. To measure NE release, GCaMP8s was selectively expressed in neocortical astrocytes and startle-evoked, NE receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were measured. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were abolished soon after DSP4 lesion but returned to pre-lesion values after 3&ndash;5&nbsp;weeks, roughly coincident with NE axon regrowth, suggesting that the regrown NE axons are competent to release NE in response to a physiological stimulus in the awake mouse.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0419-24.2024?rss=1">Interaction between Facial Expression and Color in Modulating ERP P3</a></h4>

              
                <p>The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence selective attention and brain activity contributed to selective attention remains unclear. For example, reddish angry faces increase emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether brain activity and selective attention are similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, facial expression or facial color had no significant main effect or interaction effect on P1 amplitudes for the target, and facial expression had significant main effects only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the interaction between facial expression and color modulates the P3 associated with selective attention. Moreover, the response enhancement resulting from this interaction appears to occur at a cognitive processing stage that follows the processing stage associated with facial color or expression alone. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.</p>

                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

                The splenic localization of hydatid cysts is extremely rare. A 50-year-old obese female who consults with a painful and febrile syndrome of the right hypochondrium. Abdominal ultrasound and a CT scan computed tomography revealed a complete situs inversus, a mass of the right hypochondrium measuring 152 mm with membrane detachment, and infiltration of the surrounding fat, evoking a type II complicated splenic hydatic cyst. The patient was operated on in an emergency via midline laparotomy. Exploration revealed situs inversus, an angiant cyst of the spleen. Exposition of the splenic pedicle is difficult. The samples were then infected. Total splenectomy was performed. The postoperative period was unproblematic, and the patient was discharged with antibiotic and antiparasitic treatment and habitual vaccination.

                Introduction Recent advances in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and improvements in clinical trial design have reinvigorated the potential for agents developed in preclinical studies to be translated into new therapeutic agents, as well as highlighting the need for improved and effective means of measuring neuropathy in preclinical and clinical research. A systematic review of the literature on the methods of measuring the severity of DPN and the association of the results of each method with diabetic retinopathy would contribute positively to the above developments. Methods The intended scoping review will be aligned, in combination, with the frameworks proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and the framework proposed by Peters et al. in 2015. The PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases will be searched, as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. The search strategy will include the following sequence of Boolean terms and operators: (“retinopathy” OR “eye disease” OR “eye disease” OR “maculopathy” OR “retinal” OR “macular”) AND “neuropathy” and for the title/abstract or abstract only “severity” AND (“diabetes” OR “diabetic”). The yielded publications will be screened according to criteria. This will be followed by data extraction, synthesis and presentation of results, discussion and conclusions. Discussion The different ways of measuring the severity of peripheral neuropathy identified in the previous literature will be discussed, as well as the association of neuropathy and/or its severity with retinopathy in patients with diabetes. The main aim of the discussion will be to elucidate the role of different methods of measuring the severity of DPN and its association with retinopathy. Registration The protocol has been registered on the international platform of registered systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (INPLASY).
