	<p>Duplication of the pituitary gland (DPG) is an extremely rare malformation. DPG is associated with a wide variety of midline and central nervous system malformations (DPG-plus syndrome). We present the computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings of a rare case of DPG with associated tuberomammillary fusion resulting in a hypothalamic mass-like configuration, oropharyngeal teratoma, cleft palate, hypertelorism, duplicated/broad sella, duplication/low bifurcation of the basilar artery, and craniovertebral midline anomalies. Qualitative interpretation of DTI yielded normal white matter organization of the brain. The duplication of the prechordal plate and the rostral end of the notochordal plate/notochord is thought to be the main factor leading to a duplication of the pituitary primordium and resulting in the formation of two morphologically normal glands. The time of induction of the teratogenic influence, the extent of the prechordal plate and notochordal plate/notochord abnormalities, and the faulty interactions are believed to be the reason for the wide spectrum of associated midline abnormalities.</p>

	<p>Up to 80% of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) patients in nursing homes experiences chronic pain and 97% develops fluctuant neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Agitation, associated with unrelieved pain, is managed through antipsychotics and may increase the risk of death. Evidence is accumulating in favor of analgesia for a safer, effective therapy of agitation. The Italian version of Mobilization&amp;amp;ndash;Observation&amp;amp;ndash;Behavior&amp;amp;ndash;Intensity&amp;amp;ndash;Dementia, I-MOBID2, recently validated in the Italian setting, shows: good scale content validity index (0.89), high construct validity (Spearman rank-order correlation Rho = 0.748), reliable internal consistency (Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;alpha; coefficient = 0.751), good-excellent inter-rater (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC = 0.778) and test-retest (ICC = 0.902) reliability, and good inter-rater and test-retest agreement (Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s K = 0.744) with 5.8 min completion time. This study intends to identify the responsiveness of the I-MOBID2 based on COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) recommendations, assessing the a priori hypotheses of (1) the efficacy of painkillers administered to severe AD patients after proper pain assessment and (2) the effect of reduction of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) score and of agitation rescue medications. This protocol is approved by Calabria Region Ethics Committee protocol No. 31/2017 and follows the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inferring ongoing cancer evolution from single tumour biopsies using synthetic supervised learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tom W. Ouellette, Philip Awadalla</p>

Variant allele frequencies (VAF) encode ongoing evolution and subclonal selection in growing tumours. However, existing methods that utilize VAF information for cancer evolutionary inference are compressive, slow, or incorrectly specify the underlying cancer evolutionary dynamics. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle synthetic supervised learning method, TumE, that integrates simulated models of cancer evolution with Bayesian neural networks, to infer ongoing selection in bulk-sequenced single tumour biopsies. Analyses in synthetic and patient tumours show that TumE significantly improves both accuracy and inference time per sample when detecting positive selection, deconvoluting selected subclonal populations, and estimating subclone frequency. Importantly, we show how transfer learning can leverage stored knowledge within TumE models for related evolutionary inference tasks—substantially reducing data and computational time for further model development and providing a library of recyclable deep learning models for the cancer evolution community. This extensible framework provides a foundation and future directions for harnessing progressive computational methods for the benefit of cancer genomics and, in turn, the cancer patient.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing interneuron circuits for compartment-specific feedback inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joram Keijser, Henning Sprekeler</p>

Cortical circuits process information by rich recurrent interactions between excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. One of the prime functions of interneurons is to stabilize the circuit by feedback inhibition, but the level of specificity on which inhibitory feedback operates is not fully resolved. We hypothesized that inhibitory circuits could enable separate feedback control loops for different synaptic input streams, by means of specific feedback inhibition to different neuronal compartments. To investigate this hypothesis, we adopted an optimization approach. Leveraging recent advances in training spiking network models, we optimized the connectivity and short-term plasticity of interneuron circuits for compartment-specific feedback inhibition onto pyramidal neurons. Over the course of the optimization, the interneurons diversified into two classes that resembled parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we show that the resulting circuit can be understood as a neural decoder that inverts the nonlinear biophysical computations performed within the pyramidal cells. Our model provides a proof of concept for studying structure-function relations in cortical circuits by a combination of gradient-based optimization and biologically plausible phenomenological models.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Frequency–dependency of the involvement of dopamine D1/D5 and beta‐adrenergic receptors in hippocampal LTD triggered by locus coeruleus stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Patterned stimulation of the locus coeruleus (LC, 100 Hz), in conjunction with test-pulse stimulation of hippocampal afferents, results in input-specific long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Effects are long-lasting and have been described in Schaffer-collateral–CA1 and perforant path-dentate gyrus synapses in behaving rats. To what extent LC-mediated hippocampal LTD (LC-LTD) is frequency-dependent is unclear. Here, we report that LC-LTD can be triggered by LC stimulation with 2 and 5 Hz akin to tonic activity, 10 Hz equivalent to phasic activity, and 100 Hz akin to high-phasic activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving rats. LC-LTD at both 2 and 100 Hz can be significantly prevented by an NMDA receptor antagonist. The LC releases both noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) from its hippocampal terminals and may also trigger hippocampal DA release by activating the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Unclear is whether both neurotransmitters contribute equally to hippocampal LTD triggered by LC stimulation (LC-LTD). Both DA D1/D5 receptors (D1/D5R) and beta-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) are critically required for hippocampal LTD that is induced by patterned stimulation of hippocampal afferents, or is facilitated by spatial learning. We, therefore, explored to what extent these receptor subtypes mediate frequency-dependent hippocampal LC-LTD. LC-LTD elicited by 2, 5, and 10 Hz stimulation was unaffected by antagonism of β-AR with propranolol, whereas LC-LTD induced by these frequencies was prevented by D1/D5R-antagonism using SCH23390. By contrast, LC-LTD evoked at 100 Hz was prevented by β-AR-antagonism and only mildly affected by D1/D5R-antagonism. Taken together, these findings support that LC-LTD can be triggered by LC activity at a wide range of frequencies. Furthermore, the contribution of D1/D5R and β-AR to hippocampal LTD that is triggered by LC activity is frequency-dependent and suggests that D1/D5R may be involved in LC-mediated hippocampal tonus.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Nonapoptotic caspases in neural development and in anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Apoptosis, classically initiated by caspase pathway activation, plays a prominent role during normal brain development as well as in neurodegeneration. The noncanonical, nonlethal arm of the caspase pathway is evolutionarily conserved and has also been implicated in both processes, yet is relatively understudied. Dysregulated pathway activation during critical periods of neurodevelopment due to environmental neurotoxins or exposure to compounds such as anesthetics can have detrimental consequences for brain maturation and long-term effects on behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Delta spike P681R mutation enhances SARS-CoV-2 fitness over Alpha variant</a></h4>

              
                It is important to identify mutations that account for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Liu et al. show that Delta spike mutation P681R enhances the cleavage of full-length spike to S1 and S2, which improves cell surface-mediated virus entry and leads to the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal apoptosis drives remodeling states of microglia and shifts in survival pathway dependence</a></h4>

              
                Microglia serve critical remodeling roles that shape the developing nervous system, responding to the changing neural environment with phagocytosis or soluble factor secretion. Recent single-cell sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have revealed the context-dependent diversity in microglial properties and gene expression, but the cues promoting this diversity are not well defined. Here, we ask how interactions with apoptotic neurons shape microglial state, including lysosomal and lipid metabolism gene expression and dependence on Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) for survival. Using early postnatal mouse retina, a CNS region undergoing significant developmental remodeling, we performed scRNAseq on microglia from mice that are wild-type, lack neuronal apoptosis (Bax KO), or are treated with CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397). We find that interactions with apoptotic neurons drives multiple microglial remodeling states, subsets of which are resistant to CSF1R inhibition. We find that TAM receptor Mer and complement receptor 3 are required for clearance of apoptotic neurons, but that Mer does not drive expression of remodeling genes. We show TAM receptor Axl is negligible for phagocytosis or remodeling gene expression but is consequential for microglial survival in the absence of CSF1R signaling. Thus, interactions with apoptotic neurons shift microglia towards distinct remodeling states and through Axl, alter microglial dependence on survival pathway, CSF1R.

                When people perform the same task repeatedly, their behavior becomes habitual, or inflexible to changes in the goals or structure of a task. While habits have been hypothesized to be a key aspect of motor skill acquisition, there has been little empirical work investigating the relationship between skills and habits. To better understand this relationship, we examined whether and when people's behavior would become habitual as they learned a challenging new motor skill. After up to ten days of practice, we altered the structure of the task to assess whether participants would flexibly adjust their behavior or habitually persist in performing the task the way they originally learned. We found that participants' behavior became habitual early in practice--after only two days--at which point they were still relatively unskilled. These data demonstrate that motor skills become habitual after relatively little training, but can nevertheless further improve with practice.

                Inhibitory control improves into young adulthood after specialization of relevant brain systems during adolescence. However, the biological mechanisms supporting this unique transition are not well understood. Given that adolescence is defined by pubertal maturation, we examined relative contributions of chronological age and pubertal maturation to inhibitory control development. 105 8-19-year-olds completed 1-5 longitudinal visits (227 visits total) in which pubertal development was assessed via self-reported Tanner stage and inhibitory control was assessed with an in-scanner antisaccade task. As expected, percent and latency of correct antisaccade responses improved with age and pubertal stage. When controlling for pubertal stage, chronological age was distinctly associated with correct response rate. In contrast, pubertal stage was uniquely associated with antisaccade latency even when controlling for age. Chronological age was associated with fMRI task activation in several regions including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while puberty was associated with right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) activation. Furthermore, task-related connectivity between VLPFC and cingulate was associated with both pubertal stage and response latency. These results suggest that while age-related developmental processes may support maturation of brain systems underlying the ability to inhibit a response, puberty may play a larger role in the effectiveness of generating cognitive control responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory regulation of absence seizures in a mouse model of Gnb1 encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Absence seizures, a type of non-convulsive epilepsy manifested by spike-wave discharges (SWD) in the electroencephalogram (EEG), display synchronous reciprocal excitation between the neocortex and thalamus. Recent studies have revealed that inhibitory neurons in the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus and excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons are two key subcortical players in generating SWD. However, the signals that drive SWD-related thalamic activity remain elusive. Here, we show that SWD predominately occurs during wakefulness in several mouse models of absence epilepsy. In more focused studies of Gnb1 mutant mice, we found that sensory input regulates SWD. Using in vivo recording, we demonstrate that TC cells are activated prior to the onset of SWD and then inhibited during SWD. On the contrary, RT cells are slightly inhibited prior to SWD, but are strongly activated during SWD. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of TC cells leads to the enhancement of SWD in Gnb1 mice. Together, our results indicate that sensory input in the periphery can regulate SWD by activating the thalamocortical pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Neuropeptidergic Signaling Pathway for Olfactory Gain Modulation</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems are dynamically adjusted according to the animal's ongoing needs by neuromodulators, such as neuropeptides. Despite their prevalence across all nervous systems, how peptidergic neurons and the neuropeptide they release act to adjust sensory processing remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal that a heterogeneous ensemble of local interneurons (LNs) release the neuropeptide myoinhibitory peptide (MIP) within the Drosophila primary olfactory center (the antennal lobe, AL). We find MIPergic LNs form reciprocal connections with many AL principal neurons, but only a subset express the inhibitory MIP receptor (sex peptide receptor, SPR). We find both the MIPergic LNs and several of the SPR-expressing neurons are activated by the food-related odor apple cider vinegar (ACV), therefore suggesting MIP plays a role in adjusting ACV responses within the AL. We demonstrate that MIP can simultaneously decrease olfactory input to some glomeruli, while indirectly increasing olfactory input to others. As those glomeruli boosted by MIP -- as well as MIP itself -- are necessary and sufficient to initiate an attractive behavioral response to ACV, the neural substrates identified here may represent a key circuit element for the animal's switch in behavioral responses.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by synaptic loss and neuronal network dysfunction. These network deficits are mediated by early alterations in neuronal firing rates that coincide with amyloid plaque accumulation. Mounting evidence supports that inhibitory networks are impaired in AD, but the mechanisms driving these inhibitory deficits are poorly understood. Here we use in vivo multiphoton calcium imaging to determine the relationship between amyloid accumulation and the spontaneous activity of excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We show that somatostatin-expressing (SOM) interneurons are hyperactive, while parvalbumin-expressing interneurons are hypoactive in APP/PS1 mice. Only SOM interneuron hyperactivity correlated with proximity to amyloid plaque. These inhibitory deficits were accompanied by decreased excitatory neurons activity and decreased pairwise activity correlations in APP/PS1 mice. Our study identifies cell-specific interneuronal firing deficits driven by amyloid pathology in APP/PS1 mice and provides new insights for targeting inhibitory circuits in Alzheimer's disease.

                Rod photoreceptor degeneration causes deterioration in the morphology and physiology of cone photoreceptors along with changes in retinal circuits. These changes could diminish visual signaling at cone-mediated light levels, thereby limiting the efficacy of treatments such as gene therapy for rescuing normal, cone-mediated vision. However, the impact of progressive rod death on cone-mediated signaling remains unclear. A mouse model of rod degeneration was used to investigate the fidelity of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) signaling throughout disease progression. Despite clear deterioration of cone morphology with rod death, cone-mediated signaling among RGCs remained surprisingly robust: spatiotemporal receptive fields changed little and the mutual information between stimuli and spiking responses was relatively constant. This relative stability held until nearly all rods had died and cones had completely lost well-formed outer segments. Interestingly, RGC information rates were higher and more stable for natural movies than checkerboard noise as degeneration progressed. The main change in RGC responses with photoreceptor degeneration was a decrease in response gain. These results suggest that gene therapies for rod degenerative diseases are likely to successfully prolong cone-mediated vision even if there are changes to cone morphology and density.

                Cognitive decline with age is associated with brain atrophy and reduced brain activations, but the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are unclear, especially in deeper brain structures primarily affected by healthy aging or neurodegenerative processes. Here, we characterize time-resolved, resting-state magnetoencephalography activity of the hippocampus and subcortical brain regions in a large cohort of healthy young and older volunteers from the Cam-CAN open repository. The data show age-related changes in both rhythmic and arrhythmic signal strength and temporal variability in multiple deeper brain regions, including the hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. We observe a slowing of neural activity in deeper brain regions, which echoes previous reports of cortical slowing. We also report reduced occipito-parietal alpha peak associated with increased theta-band activity and signal variability in the hippocampus, an effect that may reflect compensatory processes as theta activity and variability were more strongly expressed when cognitive performances are preserved. Overall, this study advances the understanding of the biological nature of inter-individual variability in aging. The data provide new insight of how hippocampus and subcortical neurophysiological activity evolve with biological age, and highlight frequency-specific effects associated with cognitive decline vs. cognitive maintenance.

                Performance changes dramatically both across (eccentricity) and around (polar angle) the visual field. All neurophysiological and virtually all behavioral studies of cortical magnification investigate eccentricity effects without considering polar angle. But, does cortical magnification underlie differences around the visual field? We magnified stimulus size according to eccentricity and polar angle to equate their cortical representation. We found that magnifying the stimulus eliminates differences across --but not around-- the visual field.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SARM1 activation and its downstream pathways are distinct in neuronal compartments</a></h4>

              
                Sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1) is a critical regulator of axon degeneration that acts through hydrolysis of NAD+ following injury. Recent work has defined the structure and catalytic activity of SARM1, yet the specific pathways controlled by SARM1 following diverse neuronal insults are not well defined. Here we show that the mechanisms of SARM1 activation and downstream signaling pathways are both context and localization dependent. Endogenous SARM1 is present in axons, dendrites and cell bodies and is primarily localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. In cultured hippocampal neurons, knockout of SARM1 protects axons from degeneration by treatment with mitochondrial toxins but does not affect the degeneration of other cell compartments. In contrast, direct activation of SARM1 leads to degeneration of axons, dendrites, and cell bodies, indicating that SARM1 is present and can be activated in these neuronal compartments. Inhibition of dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK, MAP3K12) and caspases were not protective in these paradigms, though both SARM1-dependent and independent dendrite degeneration required calpain activity. Together, these results demonstrate that SARM1 activation is not specific to axons though distinct pathways regulate degeneration in axons and dendrites.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse states and stimuli tune olfactory receptor expression levels to modulate food-seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                Animals must weigh competing needs and states to generate adaptive behavioral responses to the environment. Sensorimotor circuits are thus tasked with integrating diverse external and internal cues relevant to these needs to generate context-appropriate behaviors. However, the mechanisms that underlie this integration are largely unknown. Here, we show that a wide range of states and stimuli converge upon a single C. elegans olfactory neuron to modulate food-seeking behavior. Using an unbiased ribotagging approach, we find that the expression of olfactory receptor genes in the AWA olfactory neuron is influenced by a wide array of states and stimuli, including feeding state, physiological stress, and recent sensory cues. We identify odorants that activate these state-dependent olfactory receptors and show that altered expression of these receptors influences food-seeking and foraging. Further, we dissect the molecular and neural circuit pathways through which these diverse cues are integrated by AWA. This reveals a modular organization in which state-related signals arising from different cell types in the body converge on AWA and independently control chemoreceptor expression. The synthesis of these signals by AWA allows animals to generate sensorimotor responses that reflect the animal's overall state. Our findings suggest a general model in which state-dependent transcriptional changes at the sensory periphery modulate animals' sensorimotor responses to meet their ongoing needs and states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">tDCS induced GABA change is associated with the simulated electric field in M1, an effect mediated by grey matter volume in the MRS voxel</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objective: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has wide ranging applications in neuro-behavioural and physiological research, and in neurological rehabilitation. However, it is currently limited by substantial inter-subject variability in responses, which may be explained, at least in part, by anatomical differences that lead to variability in the electric field (E-field) induced in the cortex. Here, we tested whether the variability in the E-field in the stimulated cortex during tDCS, estimated using computational simulations, explains the variability in tDCS induced changes in GABA, a neurophysiological marker of stimulation effect. Methods: Data from five previously conducted MRS studies were combined. The anode was placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1, 3 studies, N = 24) or right temporal cortex (2 studies, N = 32), with the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital ridge. Single voxel spectroscopy was performed in a 2x2x2cm voxel under the anode in all cases. MRS data were acquired before and either during or after 1mA tDCS using either a sLASER sequence (7T) or a MEGA-PRESS sequence (3T). sLASER MRS data were analysed using LCModel, and MEGA-PRESS using FID-A and Gannet. E-fields were simulated in a finite element model of the head, based on individual MPRAGE images, using SimNIBS. Separate linear mixed effects models were run for each E-field variable (mean and 95th percentile; magnitude, and components normal and tangential to grey matter surface, within the MRS voxel). The model included effects of time (pre or post tDCS), E-field, grey matter volume in the MRS voxel, and a 3-way interaction between time, E-field and grey matter volume. Additionally, we ran a permutation analysis using PALM to determine whether E-field anywhere in the brain, not just in the MRS voxel, correlated with GABA change. Results: In M1, higher mean E-field magnitude was associated with greater tDCS-induced decreases in GABA (t(24) = 3.24, p = 0.003). Further, the association between mean E-field magnitude and GABA change was moderated by the grey matter volume in the MRS voxel (t(24) = -3.55, p = 0.002). These relationships were consistent across all E-field variables except the mean of the normal component. No significant relationship was found between tDCS-induced GABA decrease and E-field in the temporal voxel. No significant clusters were found in the whole brain analysis. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the electric field induced by tDCS within the brain is variable, and is significantly related to tDCS-induced decrease in GABA, a key neurophysiological marker of stimulation. These findings strongly support individualised dosing of tDCS, at least in M1. Further studies examining E-fields in relation to other outcome measures, including behaviour, will help determine the optimal E-fields required for any desired effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ALFF Response Interaction With Learning During Feedback in Individuals With Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is defined as changes of BOLD signal during resting state (RS) brain activity. Previous studies identified differences in RS activation between healthy and multiple sclerosis (MS) participants. However, no research has investigated the relationship between ALFF and learning in MS. We thus examine this here. Twenty-five MS and 19 healthy participants performed a paired-associate word learning task where participants were presented with extrinsic or intrinsic performance feedback. Compared to healthy participants, MS participants showed higher local brain activation in the right thalamus. We also observed a positive correlation in the MS group between ALFF and extrinsic feedback within the left inferior frontal gyrus, and within the left superior temporal gyrus in association with intrinsic feedback. Healthy participants showed a positive correlation in the right fusiform gyrus between ALFF and extrinsic feedback. Findings suggest that while MS participants do not show a feedback learning impairment compared to the healthy participants, ALFF differences might suggest a general maladaptive pattern of task unrelated thalamic activation and adaptive activation in frontal and temporal regions. Results indicate that ALFF can be successfully used at capturing pathophysiological changes in local brain activation in MS in association with learning through feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural dynamics and architecture of the heading direction circuit in a vertebrate brain</a></h4>

              
                Animals can use different strategies to navigate. They may guide their movements by relying on external cues in their environment or, alternatively, by using an internal cognitive map of the space around them and their position within it. An essential part of this representation are heading cells, neurons whose activity depends on the heading direction of the animal. Although those cells have been found in vertebrates, the full network has never been observed and there is very little mechanistic understanding of how these cells acquire their response properties. In this study, we use volumetric functional imaging in larval zebrafish to observe, for the first time in a vertebrate, a full network that encodes allocentric heading direction. This network of approximately one hundred inhibitory neurons is arranged in an anatomical circle in the anterior hindbrain. Its activity is driven purely by the integration of internally generated signals, indicating that a simple vertebrate brain can encode maps of how an animal moves within its surroundings. Single cell reconstructions of electron micrographs allow us to uncover how the connectivity pattern of neurons within the network supports the implementation of a ring attractor network. The neurons we identify share features with neurons in the dorsal tegmentum nucleus of rodents and the fly central complex, showing that similar connectivity and mechanistic principles underlie the generation of cognitive maps of heading direction across the animal kingdom.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spleen voltammetry assesses in real time norepinephrine release elicited by autonomic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Bioelectronic medicine uses neurostimulation devices to modulate the activity of autonomic nerves and restore function in visceral organs. The autonomic, noradrenergic, innervation of the spleen is implicated in the neural control of inflammation; for that reason, the spleen is the target of autonomic stimulation therapies tested in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. However, there are no real time markers for successful engagement of the spleen by autonomic stimulation. Here, we use fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) in the spleen to assess, in real time, the release of norepinephrine (NE) in response to autonomic stimulation in mice. We show that spleen voltammograms demonstrate oxidative current peaks at a voltage of ~0.8 V that is proportional up to a NE blood concentration of 30 to 300nM. The oxidative current increases within seconds in response to electrical splenic nerve stimulation and is blocked by interventions that deplete NE or inhibit NE release. Oxidative current increases in response to electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and is elicited by efferent, but not afferent, fiber-selective optogenetic VNS. Spleen cyclic voltammetry can potentially provide a real-time physiological marker for dose calibration and monitoring of the anti-inflammatory effectiveness of autonomic stimulation therapies targeting the spleen.

                Aesthetic experiences during natural vision are varied: they can arise from viewing scenic landscapes, interesting architecture, or attractive people. Recent research in the field of neuroaesthetics has taught us a lot about where in the brain such aesthetic experiences are represented. Much less is known about when such experiences arise during the cortical processing cascade. Particularly, the dynamic neural representation of perceived attractiveness for rich natural scenes is not well understood. Here, I present data from an EEG experiment, in which participants provided attractiveness judgments for a set of diverse natural scenes. Using multivariate pattern analysis, I demonstrate that scene attractiveness is mirrored in early brain signals that arise within 200ms of vision, suggesting that the aesthetic quality of scenes is first resolved during perceptual processing. In more detailed analyses, I show that even such early neural correlates of scene attractiveness are partly related to inter-individual variation in aesthetic preferences and that they generalize across scene contents. Together, these results characterize the time-resolved neural dynamics that give rise to aesthetic experiences in complex natural environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">neuroWalknet, a controller for hexapod walking allowing for context dependent behavior</a></h4>

              
                Decentralized control has been established as a key control principle in insect walking and has been successfully leveraged to account for a wide range of walking behaviors in the proposed neuroWalknet architecture. This controller allows for walking patterns with different velocities in forward and backward direction -- quite similar to the behavior shown in stick insects --, for negotiation of curves, and for robustly dealing with various disturbances. While these simulations focus on the cooperation of different, decentrally controlled legs, here we consider a set of biological experiments not yet been tested by neuroWalknet, that focus on the function of the individual leg and are context dependent. These intraleg studies deal with four groups of interjoint reflexes. The reflexes are elicited by either a stimulation of the femoral chordotonal organ (fCO) or a specific stimulation of campaniform sensilla (CS). Motor output signals are recorded from the alpha-joint, the beta-joint or the gamma-joint of the leg. Furthermore, such reflexes have been studied while the ganglion was treated with pilocarpine. Although these biological data represent results obtained from different local reflexes in different contexts, they fit with and are embedded into the behavior shown by the global structure of neuroWalknet. In particular, a specific and intensively studied behavior, active reaction, has since long been assumed to represent a separate behavioral element, from which it is not clear why it occurs in some situations, but not in others. This question could now be explained as an emergent property of the holistic structure of neuroWalknet. When experimenting with pilocarpine, oscillations were induced in neuroWalknet even though this does not include an explicit central pattern generator and in this way provides a simpler model as a functional explanation. As the simulation data result from a holistic system, further results were obtained that could be used as predictions to be tested in further biological experiments.

                Aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Tau pathology is believed to be driven by both free tau aggregates and tau carried within exosomes, which propagate trans-synaptically and induce tau pathology in recipient neurons by a corrupting process of seeding. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPRi screen in tau biosensor cells and identified cellular regulators shared by both mechanisms of tau seeding. The top validated regulators are ANKLE2, BANF1, NUSAP1, EIF1AD, and VPS18, which work as factors that restrict tau aggregation initiated by both exosomal and vesicle-free tau seeds. Interestingly, ANKLE2 and BANF1 more robustly affected exosomal tau seeding than free aggregates. Lastly, validation studies revealed that several of the identified protein hits are downregulated in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, suggesting that their decreased activity may be required for the emergence or progression of tau pathology in the human brain.

                Dopamine (DA) is involved in stress and stress-related illnesses, including many psychiatric disorders. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) plays a role in stress responses and targets the ventral midbrain DA system. This system is comprised of DA and non-DA cells and is divided into specific subregions. Although CRF inputs to the midline A10 nuclei of the DA system are well studied in rodents, in monkeys, CRF-containing terminals are highly enriched in the expanded A10 parabrachial pigmented nucleus (PBP) and in the A8 subregion (retrorubral field). In primates, the central extended amygdala, a rich source of CRF afferents across species, preferentially targets the PBP and A8 fields. We thus sought to characterize CRF terminals on DA (tyrosine hydroxylase, TH+) and non-DA (TH-) cell types in the PBP and A8 regions at the ultrastructural level using immuno-reactive electron microscopy (EM) for TH and CRF in male and female macaques. CRF labeling was present mostly in axon terminals, which mainly contacted non-DA dendrites in both subregions. Most CRF-positive terminals had inhibitory (symmetric) profiles. In the A8, CRF symmetric (inhibitory) contacts onto non-DA neurons were significantly greater than symmetric (excitatory) profiles; this pattern was also seen in the PBP, but did not reach statistical significance. No sex differences were found. Hormonal assays suggested that our animals were at similar developmental stages and experienced similar stress levels. Together our findings suggest that at baseline, CRF terminals in the primate PBP and A8 largely regulate DA indirectly through non-DA neurons.

                Humans are strategically more prosocial when their actions are being watched than when they act alone. Using a psychopharmacogenetic approach, we investigated the computational and endocrinological mechanisms of such audience-driven prosociality. 187 participants received either a single dose of testosterone or a placebo and performed a prosocial and self-oriented reinforcement learning task. Crucially, the task was performed either in private or when being watched. Rival theories of testosterone's role in status-seeking suggest that the hormone might either strengthen or diminish audience-depended generosity. We show that exogenous testosterone strongly decreases submission to audience expectations, full eliminating strategic i.e., feigned generosity. We next performed reinforcement-learning drift-diffusion modeling to elucidate which latent aspects of decision-making testosterone acted on. Computational modeling revealed that testosterone compared to placebo did not deteriorate reinforcement learning per se, rather, in presence of the audience, the hormone impacted the expression of the learned information into behavioral choice. These results indicate that instead of deceptively increasing socially desirable behavior, testosterone boosts honest forms of status-seeking, arguably by impacting the motivational link between learned values and behavior.

                Conversion of astroglia into functional neurons has been considered as a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies reported that downregulation of the RNA binding protein, PTBP1, converts astrocytes into neurons in situ in multiple mouse brain regions, consequently improving pathological phenotypes associated with Parkinson's disease, RGC loss, and aging. Here, we demonstrate that PTBP1 downregulation using antisense oligonucleotides or an astrocyte specific AAV-mediated shRNA system fails to convert hippocampal astrocytes into neurons in WT, and {beta}-amyloid (5xFAD) and tau (PS19) Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models, and fails to reverse synaptic/cognitive deficits and AD-associated pathology. Similarly, PTBP1 downregulation cannot convert astrocytes into neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra. Together, our study suggests that cell fate conversion strategy for neurodegenerative disease therapy through manipulating one single gene, such as PTBP1, warrants more rigorous scrutiny.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Blood-brain barrier dysfunction promotes astrocyte senescence through albumin-induced TGFβ signaling activation</a></h4>

              
                Blood-brain barrier dysfunction (BBBD) and accumulation of senescent astrocytes occur during brain aging and contribute to neuroinflammation and disease. Here, we explored the relationship between these two age-related events, hypothesizing that chronic hippocampal exposure to the blood-borne protein serum albumin could induce stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) in astrocytes via transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF{beta}) signaling. We found that one week of albumin exposure significantly increased TGF{beta}1 and senescence marker expression in cultured rat hippocampal astrocytes. These changes were preventable by pharmacological inhibition of the type I TGF{beta} receptor (TGF{beta}R) ALK5. To study these effects in vivo, we utilized an animal model of BBBD in which albumin was continuously infused into the lateral ventricles of adult mice. Consistent with our in vitro results, one week of albumin infusion significantly increased TGF{beta} signaling activation and the burden of senescent astrocytes in hippocampal tissue. Pharmacological inhibition of TGF{beta}R ALK5 or conditional genetic knockdown of astrocytic TGF{beta}R prior to albumin infusion was sufficient to prevent albumin-induced astrocyte senescence. Together, these results establish a link between TGF{beta} signaling activation and astrocyte senescence and suggest that prolonged exposure to serum albumin due to BBBD can trigger these phenotypic changes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reversible and gain modulation of neuronal responses and sensorimotor behavior by mid-infrared stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation serves as a cornerstone for brain sciences and clinical applications. Mid-infrared stimulation (MIRS) has been recently reported to cause non-thermal modulation of brain functions. However little knowledge of mechanisms hampers its application. Here we bridge across ion channels, neuronal signals, and behavioral performances associated with sensorimotor transformation to provide evidence of how the alternation of neuronal activity by MIRS guides the change of behavioral performance in awake-behaving pigeons. We compared effects on visually-guided eye movements by applying MIRS and electrical stimulation (ES) in the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (nLM). Distinct from ES, we found a specific gain modulation of MIRS to alter behavior in a manner of the strength of visual inputs. Our simultaneous extracellular recordings showed that MIRS can excite and inhibit the neuronal activity in the same pretectal neuron based on its ongoing sensory responsiveness levels in awake-behaving animals. We further applied computational simulations and found that MIRS can modulate the carbonyl group (-C=O) enriched on the potassium channel to resonate, and could affect action potential generation, alter neuronal responses to sensory inputs and then guide behavior. Our findings suggest that MIRS could be a promising approach for brain researches and neurological diseases, with gene free manipulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retinotopic organization of feedback projections in primate early visual cortex: implications for active vision</a></h4>

              
                Feedback connections play a major role in many theories of brain function. Previous studies of feedback connections to early visual areas have mainly concentrated on the representation of central visual fields. Here, injections of tracers at different eccentricities in areas V1 and V2 revealed retinotopically organized feedback. Peripheral injections revealed projections from 15 areas that are not labeled by central injections. Connection strengths for the majority of projections vary significantly with eccentricity in a systematic fashion with respect to distance and origin; whereas projections to central and upper visual fields are significantly stronger from ventral stream areas, peripheral and lower field projections are stronger from the dorsal stream. Non-invasive functional connectivity suggests a similar anatomical organization in humans. These features are discussed with respect to the cognitive and perceptual roles of these feedback pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">StandardRat: A multi-center consensus protocol to enhance functional connectivity specificity in the rat brain</a></h4>

              
                Task-free functional connectivity in animal models provides an experimental framework to examine connectivity phenomena under controlled conditions and allows comparison with invasive or terminal procedures. To date, animal acquisitions are performed with varying protocols and analyses that hamper result comparison and integration. We introduce StandardRat, a consensus rat functional MRI acquisition protocol tested across 20 centers. To develop this protocol with optimized acquisition and processing parameters, we initially aggregated 65 functional imaging datasets acquired in rats from 46 centers. We developed a reproducible pipeline for the analysis of rat data acquired with diverse protocols and determined experimental and processing parameters associated with a more robust functional connectivity detection. We show that the standardized protocol enhances biologically plausible functional connectivity patterns, relative to pre-existing acquisitions. The protocol and processing pipeline described here are openly shared with the neuroimaging community to promote interoperability and cooperation towards tackling the most important challenges in neuroscience.

	<p>The effectiveness of carmustine (BCNU) wafers on local recurrence of glioblastoma (GBM) remains contentious. We investigated the accumulating high-dose effects of BCNU released from the wafers on the survival of GBM patients by measuring BCNU concentration in the resection cavity of GBM over time. BCNU wafers (Gliadel&amp;amp;reg;) were implanted with an Ommaya device in 15 patients, including 12 patients with GBM. BCNU concentrations in the tumor resection cavity were measured for 30 days postoperatively. The area under the curve (AUC)all was calculated from BCNU concentration curves, and the relationships between AUCall and survival, tumor phenotypes on MRI, and recurrence patterns were analyzed. The BCNU concentration was maximal 1 h postoperatively, rapidly decreased within 24 h, and remained relatively high for 7 days. GBM patients were classified into two groups: early recurrence (ER) and late or no recurrence (LN), using median progression-free survival as the cut-off. AUCall tended to be lower in the ER group than in the LN group, but the difference was not significant. MRI revealed that all patients in the ER group had highly invasive GBMs, whereas all patients in the LN group had less-invasive GBMs. A total of 9 patients experienced recurrence, with 6 local, 2 diffuse, and 1 disseminated patterns. No differences in AUCall were seen between local and non-local recurrence groups. Total BCNU concentrations did not correlate with tumor progression or survival. However, a high concentration of BCNU may have potential to provide some survival benefit for less-invasive type GBM.</p>

	<p>Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), with the characteristics of high morbidity, high recurrence rate, high mortality, and disability rate, is a typical manifestation of ischemic stroke and has become a hot research topic in the clinical field. The protective effects of nuciferine on brain injury MCAO rats were investigated and its mechanisms of actions were revealed. The MCAO rats were established by the suture method. The pathological staining of the rat brain was processed and observed, the pharmacodynamics assay of nuciferine were studied, and the gene expression regulation by nuciferine was detected by transcriptome technology. The results showed that nuciferine significantly alleviated brain damage in MCAO rats, and the transcriptomic results suggested that nuciferine could exert therapeutic effects through the regulation of lipid metabolism, including arachidonic acid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, the PPAR signaling pathway and other related pathways. This finding provided new perspectives on the treatment of MCAO with nuciferine and facilitates the development of novel drugs for this disease.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is often observed in cancer patients and impairs their life quality. Grape-seed-orientated procyanidin has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, yet its effects in preventing CICI have not been investigated. (2) Method: Adult male mice received 2.3 mg/kg cisplatin or saline injections for three cycles consisting of five daily injections followed by 5 days of rest. Procyanidin or saline was administered 1 h prior to cisplatin treatment. Cognitive testing, gelatin zymography, and blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain-barrier (BBB) penetration tests were performed after treatment cessation. RAW264.7 cells were treated by stimulated supernatant of SHSY5Y cells. In addition, high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) expression and MMP-9 activity were tested. (3) Results: Repeated cisplatin treatment increased BBB penetration, MMP-9 activity, impaired performance in contextual fear conditioning, and novel object recognition tasks. The knockout of MMP-9 rescues cognitive impairment and cisplatin-induced upregulation of HMGB1 in SHSY5Y cells. HMGB1/TLR4/IP3K/AKT signaling contributes to the increased MMP-9 activity in RAW264.7 cells. Procyanidin treatment attenuates MMP-9 activity, BBB damage, and CICI. (4) Conclusions: The results indicated that MMP-9 activation and BBB disruption is involved in CICI. Procyanidin may effectively alleviate the harmful effects of cisplatin.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which is recommended for the improvement of some pain-related symptoms and for antidepressant treatment, on the primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). We searched for studies comparing rTMS and sham rTMS in the M1 of FM patients. Pain intensity, quality of life, health status, and depression were compared with or without rTMS for at least 10 sessions. We searched four databases. Quality assessment and quantitative analysis were performed using RevMan 5.4. After screening, five randomized controlled trials of 170 patients with FM were included in the analysis. As a result of the meta-analysis of rTMS on the M1 of individuals with FM, high-frequency rTMS resulted in a significant improvement on quality of life (MD = &amp;amp;minus;2.50; 95% CI: &amp;amp;minus;3.99 to &amp;amp;minus;1.01) compared with sham rTMS. On the other hand, low-frequency rTMS resulted in a significant improvement on health status (MD = 15.02; 95% CI: 5.59 to 24.45). The application of rTMS to the M1 is proposed as an adjunctive measure in the treatment of individuals with FM. Because rTMS has various effects depending on each application site, it is necessary to classify sites or set frequencies as variables.</p>

	<p>The evidence base supporting treatment interventions for patients with disorders of consciousness is limited, and rigorous treatment trials are needed to guide future management of this complex patient population. There are many potential study designs that can be employed to develop this evidence, but the process of selecting the optimal study design is challenging. This article reviews common obstacles that impede research progress in this population and a range of study designs that may be employed. In addition, we consider how the particular practical and scientific obstacles may drive selection of the optimal design and, in particular, how the optimal design changes as treatment research proceeds along the translational continuum from mechanistic discovery to real-world clinical impact.</p>

	<p>Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome represented by an acute disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition, highly prevalent in older, and critically ill patients, and associated with poor outcomes. This review synthesized existing evidence on the effectiveness of music interventions on delirium in adults, and music interventions (MIs), psychometric assessments and outcome measures used. We searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, SCOPUS, Clinical Trials and CENTRAL for quantitative designs comparing any MIs to standard care or another intervention. From 1150 studies 12 met the inclusion criteria, and 6 were included in the meta-analysis. Narrative synthesis showed that most studies focused on prevention, few assessed delirium severity, with the majority of studies reporting beneficial effects. The summary relative risk for incident delirium comparing music vs. no music in postsurgical and critically ill older patients was 0.52 (95% confidential interval (CI): 0.20&amp;amp;ndash;1.35, I2 = 79.1%, heterogeneity &amp;amp;lt;0.0001) for the random effects model and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34&amp;amp;ndash;0.66) using the fixed effects model. Music listening interventions were more commonly applied than music therapy delivered by credentialed music therapists, and delirium assessments methods were heterogeneous, including both standardized tools and systematic observations. Better designed studies are needed addressing effectiveness of MIs in specific patient subgroups, exploring the correlations between intervention-types/dosages and delirium symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid and Gentle Immunopurification of Brain Synaptic Vesicles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Current methods to isolate synaptic vesicles (SVs), the organellar quanta of synaptic transmission, require highly specialized materials and up to 24 h. These technical obstacles have thus far limited the study of SVs in models of synaptic function and pathophysiology. Here, we describe techniques for the rapid isolation of SVs by immunoprecipitation with widely available antibodies conjugated to magnetic beads. We report that the inexpensive rho1D4 monoclonal antibody binds SVs and show that elution with the 1D4 peptide yields native vesicles that are &ge; 10-fold purer than those obtained with classical techniques. These methods substantially widen the accessibility of SVs, enabling their purification in 60&ndash;90 min for downstream analyses including mass spectrometry and cryo-electron microscopy. Immunopurified SV preparations from mouse brain contained apolipoprotein E, the LDL receptor Lrp1, and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting that SVs may play direct roles in lipid homeostasis and lipoprotein trafficking at the nerve terminal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> SVs are small organelles that form and recycle at nerve terminals to enable synaptic transmission. Much remains unknown about the processes that enable the formation and function of SVs. Moreover, nerve terminals appear to be particularly vulnerable to pathophysiologic processes underlying neurodegenerative diseases and schizophrenia. Although techniques to purify synaptic vesicles thus have the potential to yield significant insights into physiology and pathophysiology of nerve terminals, current methods rely on either esoteric materials or expression of transgenes. This article addresses these problems by establishing robust, efficient methods for SV purification using widely available materials, and it highlights several promising areas of future study arising from proteomic analyses of immunopurified SVs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spontaneously Recycling Synaptic Vesicles Constitute Readily Releasable Vesicles in Intact Neuromuscular Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emerging evidence shows that spontaneous synaptic transmission plays crucial roles on neuronal functions through presynaptic molecular mechanisms distinct from that of action potential (AP)-evoked transmission. However, whether the synaptic vesicle (SV) population undergoing the two forms of transmission is segregated remains controversial due in part to the conflicting results observed in cultured neurons. Here we address this issue in intact neuromuscular synapses using transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing two different indicators targeted in the SVs: a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein, pHluorin, and a tag protein, HaloTag. By establishing a quantitative measure of recycled SV fractions, we found that ~85% of SVs were mobilized by high-frequency AP firings. In contrast, spontaneously recycling SVs were mobilized only from &lt;8% of SVs with a time constant of 45 min at 25&deg;C, although prolonged AP inhibition mobilized an additional population with a delayed onset. The mobilization of the early-onset population was less temperature-sensitive and resistant to tetanus toxin, whereas that of the late-onset population was more sensitive to temperature and was inhibited by tetanus toxin, indicating that prolonged AP inhibition activated a distinct molecular machinery for spontaneous SV fusion. Therefore, the early-onset population limited to &lt;8% was likely the only source of spontaneous release that occurred physiologically. We further showed that this limited population was independent from those reluctant to fuse during AP firing and was used in both the hypertonic stimulation and the immediate phase of AP-evoked releases, thereby matching the characteristics of the readily releasable pool.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are divided into functionally distinct pools depending on how they respond to action potential (AP) firing. The origin of SVs used for spontaneous fusion remains enigmatic despite intensive studies in cultured preparations. We addressed this question in intact neuromuscular synapses and provided two findings. First, prolonged AP inhibition activated a distinct population of fusion, which needs to be distinguished from genuine spontaneous fusion arising from a highly limited fraction. Second, the limited fraction observed early in the AP inhibition period exhibited the characteristics of readily releasable pool in the subsequent round of stimulation. Our study revealed that the origin of spontaneous SV fusion is restricted to the readily releasable pool among the SV pools involved in AP-evoked fusion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Arrestin Facilitates Rhodopsin Dephosphorylation in Vivo</a></h4>

              
                <p>Deactivation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involves multiple phosphorylations followed by arrestin binding, which uncouples the GPCR from G-protein activation. Some GPCRs, such as rhodopsin, are reused many times. Arrestin dissociation and GPCR dephosphorylation are key steps in the recycling process. <I>In vitro</I> evidence suggests that visual arrestin (ARR1) binding to light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin hinders dephosphorylation. Whether ARR1 binding also affects rhodopsin dephosphorylation <I>in vivo</I> is not known. We investigated this using both male and female mice lacking ARR1. Mice were exposed to bright light and placed in darkness for different periods of time, and differently phosphorylated species of rhodopsin were assayed by isoelectric focusing. For WT mice, rhodopsin dephosphorylation was nearly complete by 1 h in darkness. Surprisingly, we observed that, in the <I>Arr1</I> KO rods, rhodopsin remained phosphorylated even after 3 h. Delayed dephosphorylation in <I>Arr1</I> KO rods cannot be explained by cell stress induced by persistent signaling, since it is not prevented by the removal of transducin, the visual G-protein, nor can it be explained by downregulation of protein phosphatase 2A, the putative rhodopsin phosphatase. We further show that cone arrestin (ARR4), which binds light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin poorly, had little effect in enhancing rhodopsin dephosphorylation, whereas mice expressing binding-competent mutant ARR1-3A showed a similar time course of rhodopsin dephosphorylation as WT. Together, these results reveal a novel role of ARR1 in facilitating rhodopsin dephosphorylation <I>in vivo</I>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins used by cells to receive and respond to a broad range of extracellular signals that include neurotransmitters, hormones, odorants, and light (photons). GPCR signaling is terminated by two sequential steps: phosphorylation and arrestin binding. Both steps must be reversed when GPCRs are recycled and reused. Dephosphorylation, which is required for recycling, is an understudied process. Using rhodopsin as a prototypical GPCR, we discovered that arrestin facilitated rhodopsin dephosphorylation in living mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Development of Receptive Field Tuning Properties in Mouse Binocular Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mouse primary visual cortex is a model system for understanding the relationship between cortical structure, function, and behavior (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B46">Seabrook et al., 2017</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B8">Chaplin and Margrie, 2020</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B19">Hooks and Chen, 2020</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B39">Saleem, 2020</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B12">Flossmann and Rochefort, 2021</cross-ref>). Binocular neurons in V1 are the cellular basis of binocular vision, which is required for predation (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B43">Scholl et al., 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B21">Hoy et al., 2016</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B26">La Chioma et al., 2020</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B3">Berson, 2021</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B24">Johnson et al., 2021</cross-ref>). The normal development of binocular responses, however, has not been systematically measured. Here, we measure tuning properties of neurons to either eye in awake mice of either sex from eye opening to the closure of the critical period. At eye opening, we find an adult-like fraction of neurons responding to the contralateral-eye stimulation, which are selective for orientation and spatial frequency; few neurons respond to ipsilateral eye, and their tuning is immature. Fraction of ipsilateral-eye responses increases rapidly in the first few days after eye opening and more slowly thereafter, reaching adult levels by critical period closure. Tuning of these responses improves with a similar time course. The development and tuning of binocular responses parallel that of ipsilateral-eye responses. Four days after eye opening, monocular neurons respond to a full range of orientations but become more biased to cardinal orientations. Binocular responses, by contrast, lose their cardinal bias with age. Together, these data provide an in-depth accounting of the development of monocular and binocular responses in the binocular region of mouse V1 using a consistent set of visual stimuli and measurements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this manuscript, we present a full accounting of the emergence and refinement of monocular and binocular receptive field tuning properties of thousands of pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex. Our data reveal new features of monocular and binocular development that revise current models on the emergence of cortical binocularity. Given the recent interest in visually guided behaviors in mice that require binocular vision (e.g., predation), our measures will provide the basis for studies on the emergence of the neural circuitry guiding these behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Environmental Enrichment Mitigates the Long-Lasting Sequelae of Perinatal Fentanyl Exposure in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>The opioid epidemic is a rapidly evolving societal issue driven, in part, by a surge in synthetic opioid use. A rise in fentanyl use among pregnant women has led to a 40-fold increase in the number of perinatally-exposed infants in the past decade. These children are more likely to develop mood-related and somatosensory-related conditions later in life, suggesting that fentanyl may permanently alter neural development. Here, we examined the behavioral and synaptic consequences of perinatal fentanyl exposure in adolescent male and female C57BL/6J mice and assessed the therapeutic potential of environmental enrichment to mitigate these effects. Dams were given <I>ad libitum</I> access to fentanyl (10 &micro;g/ml, per os) across pregnancy and until weaning [postnatal day (PD)21]. Perinatally-exposed adolescent mice displayed hyperactivity (PD45), enhanced sensitivity to anxiogenic environments (PD46), and sensory maladaptation (PD47), sustained behavioral effects that were completely normalized by environmental enrichment (PD21&ndash;PD45). Additionally, environmental enrichment normalized the fentanyl-induced changes in the frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) of layer 2/3 neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We also demonstrate that fentanyl impairs short-term potentiation (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in S1 layer 2/3 neurons, which, instead, exhibit a sustained depression of synaptic transmission that is restored by environmental enrichment. On its own, environmental enrichment suppressed long-term depression (LTD) of control S1 neurons from vehicle-treated mice subjected to standard housing conditions. These results demonstrate that the lasting effects of fentanyl can be ameliorated with a noninvasive intervention introduced during early development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Illicit use of fentanyl accounts for a large proportion of opioid-related overdose deaths. Children exposed to opioids during development have a higher risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders later in life. Here, we employ a preclinical model of perinatal fentanyl exposure that recapitulates these long-term impairments and show, for the first time, that environmental enrichment can reverse deficits in somatosensory circuit function and behavior. These findings have the potential to directly inform and guide ongoing efforts to mitigate the consequences of perinatal opioid exposure.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Activity of Spinal Interneurons during Forward and Backward Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Higher vertebrates are capable not only of forward but also backward and sideways locomotion. Also, single steps in different directions are generated for postural corrections. While the networks responsible for the control of forward walking (FW) have been studied in considerable detail, the networks controlling steps in other directions are mostly unknown. Here, to characterize the operation of the spinal locomotor network during FW and backward walking (BW), we recorded the activity of individual spinal interneurons from L4 to L6 during both FW and BW evoked by epidural stimulation (ES) of the spinal cord at L5&ndash;L6 in decerebrate cats of either sex. Three groups of neurons were revealed. Group 1 (45%) had a similar phase of modulation during both FW and BW. Group 2 (27%) changed the phase of modulation in the locomotor cycle depending on the direction of locomotion. Group 3 neurons were modulated during FW only (Group 3a, 21%) or during BW only (Group 3b, 7%). We suggest that Group 1 neurons belong to the network generating the vertical component of steps (the limb elevation and lowering) because it should operate similarly during locomotion in any direction, while Groups 2 and 3 neurons belong to the networks controlling the direction of stepping. Results of this study provide new insights into the organization of the spinal locomotor circuits, advance our understanding of ES therapeutic effects, and can potentially be used for the development of novel strategies for recuperation of impaired balance control, which requires the generation of corrective steps in different directions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animals and humans can perform locomotion in different directions in relation to the body axis (forward, backward, sideways). While the networks that control forward walking have been studied in considerable detail, the networks controlling steps in other directions are unknown. Here, by recording the activity of the same spinal neurons during forward and backward walking, we revealed three groups of neurons forming, respectively, the network operating similarly during stepping in different directions, the network changing its operation with a change in the direction of stepping, and the network operating only during locomotion in a specific direction. These networks presumably control different aspects of the step. The obtained results provide new insights into the organization of the spinal locomotor networks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presynaptic Interactions between Trigeminal and Cervical Nociceptive Afferents Supplying Upper Cervical Lamina I Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cervical and trigeminal afferents innervate neighboring cranial territories, and their convergence on upper cervical dorsal horn neurons provides a potential substrate for pain referral in primary headache syndromes. Lamina I neurons are central to this mechanism, as they relay convergent nociceptive input to supraspinal pain centers. Unfortunately, little is known about the interactions between trigeminal and cervical afferents supplying Lamina I neurons. Here, we used rats of both sexes to show that cervical and trigeminal afferents interact via presynaptic inhibition, where monosynaptic inputs to Lamina I neurons undergo unidirectional as well as reciprocal presynaptic control. This means that afferent-driven presynaptic inhibition shapes the way trigeminal and cervical A-fiber and C-fiber input reaches Lamina I projection neurons (PNs) and local-circuit neurons (LCNs). We propose that this inhibition provides a feedforward control of excitatory drive to Lamina I neurons that regulates their convergent and cervical-specific or trigeminal-specific processing modes. As a consequence, disruption of the trigeminal and cervical afferent-driven presynaptic inhibition may contribute to development of primary headache syndromes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Callosal Fiber Length Scales with Brain Size According to Functional Lateralization, Evolution, and Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain size significantly impacts the organization of white matter fibers. Fiber length scaling, the degree to which fiber length varies according to brain size, was overlooked. We investigated how fiber lengths within the corpus callosum, the most prominent white matter tract, vary according to brain size. The results showed substantial variation in length scaling among callosal fibers, replicated in two large healthy cohorts (~2000 human subjects, including both sexes). The underscaled callosal fibers mainly connected the precentral gyrus and parietal cortices, whereas the overscaled callosal fibers mainly connected the prefrontal cortices. The variation in such length scaling was biologically meaningful: larger scaling corresponded to larger neurite density index but smaller fractional anisotropy values; cortical regions connected by the callosal fibers with larger scaling were more lateralized functionally as well as phylogenetically and ontogenetically more recent than their counterparts. These findings highlight an interaction between interhemispheric communication and organizational and adaptive principles underlying brain development and evolution.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain size varies across evolution, development, and individuals. Relative to small brains, the neural fiber length in large brains is inevitably increased, but the degree of such increase may differ between fiber tracts. Such a difference, if it exists, is valuable for understanding adaptive neural principles in large versus small brains during evolution and development. The present study showed a substantial difference in the length increase between the callosal fibers that connect the two hemispheres, replicated in two large healthy cohorts. Together, our study demonstrates that reorganization of interhemispheric fibers length according to brain size is intrinsically related to fiber composition, functional lateralization, cortical myelin content, and evolutionary and developmental expansion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reading and Modulating Cortical {beta} Bursts from Motor Unit Spiking Activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>&beta; Oscillations (13&ndash;30 Hz) are ubiquitous in the human motor nervous system. Yet, their origins and roles are unknown. Traditionally, &beta; activity has been treated as a stationary signal. However, recent studies observed that cortical &beta; occurs in "bursting events," which are transmitted to muscles. This short-lived nature of &beta; events makes it possible to study the main mechanism of &beta; activity found in the muscles in relation to cortical &beta;. Here, we assessed whether muscle &beta; activity mainly results from cortical projections. We ran two experiments in healthy humans of both sexes (<I>N</I> = 15 and <I>N</I> = 13, respectively) to characterize &beta; activity at the cortical and motor unit (MU) levels during isometric contractions of the tibialis anterior muscle. We found that &beta; rhythms observed at the cortical and MU levels are indeed in bursts. These bursts appeared to be time-locked and had comparable average durations (40&ndash;80 ms) and rates (approximately three to four bursts per second). To further confirm that cortical and MU &beta; have the same source, we used a novel operant conditioning framework to allow subjects to volitionally modulate MU &beta;. We showed that volitional modulation of &beta; activity at the MU level was possible with minimal subject learning and was paralleled by similar changes in cortical &beta; activity. These results support the hypothesis that MU &beta; mainly results from cortical projections. Moreover, they demonstrate the possibility to decode cortical &beta; activity from MU recordings, with a potential translation to future neural interfaces that use peripheral information to identify and modulate activity in the central nervous system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show for the first time that &beta; activity in motor unit (MU) populations occurs in bursting events. These bursts observed in the output of the spinal cord appear to be time-locked and share similar characteristics of &beta; activity at the cortical level, such as the duration and rate at which they occur. Moreover, when subjects were exposed to a novel operant conditioning paradigm and modulated MU &beta; activity, cortical &beta; activity changed in a similar way as peripheral &beta;. These results provide evidence for a strong correspondence between cortical and peripheral &beta; activity, demonstrating the cortical origin of peripheral &beta; and opening the pathway for a new generation of neural interfaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Partially Overlapping Neural Correlates of Metacognitive Monitoring and Metacognitive Control</a></h4>

              
                <p>Metacognition describes the process of monitoring one's own mental states, often for the purpose of cognitive control. Previous research has investigated how metacognitive signals are generated (metacognitive monitoring), for example, when people (both female/male) judge their confidence in their decisions and memories. Research has also investigated how metacognitive signals are used to influence behavior (metacognitive control), for example, setting a reminder (i.e., cognitive offloading) for something you are not confident you will remember. However, the mapping between metacognitive monitoring and metacognitive control needs further study on a neural level. We used fMRI to investigate a delayed-intentions task with a reminder element, allowing human participants to use their metacognitive insight to engage metacognitive control. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that we could separately decode both monitoring and control, and, to a lesser extent, cross-classify between them. Therefore, brain patterns associated with monitoring and control are partially, but not fully, overlapping.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Models of metacognition commonly distinguish between monitoring (how metacognition is formed) and control (how metacognition is used for behavioral regulation). Research into these facets of metacognition has often happened in isolation. Here, we provide a study which directly investigates the mapping between metacognitive monitoring and metacognitive control at a neural level. We applied multivariate pattern analysis to fMRI data from a novel task in which participants separately rated their confidence (metacognitive monitoring) and how much they would like to use a reminder (metacognitive control). We find support for the notion that the two aspects of metacognition overlap partially but not fully. We argue that future research should focus on how different metacognitive signals are selected for control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Neural Bases of Action-Outcome Learning in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>From an associative perspective the acquisition of new goal-directed actions requires the encoding of specific action-outcome (AO) associations and, therefore, sensitivity to the validity of an action as a predictor of a specific outcome relative to other events. Although competitive architectures have been proposed within associative learning theory to achieve this kind of identity-based selection, whether and how these architectures are implemented by the brain is still a matter of conjecture. To investigate this issue, we trained human participants to encode various AO associations while undergoing functional neuroimaging (fMRI). We then degraded one AO contingency by increasing the probability of the outcome in the absence of its associated action while keeping other AO contingencies intact. We found that this treatment selectively reduced performance of the degraded action. Furthermore, when a signal predicted the unpaired outcome, performance of the action was restored, suggesting that the degradation effect reflects competition between the action and the context for prediction of the specific outcome. We used a Kalman filter to model the contribution of different causal variables to AO learning and found that activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) tracked changes in the association of the action and context, respectively, with regard to the specific outcome. Furthermore, we found the mPFC participated in a network with the striatum and posterior parietal cortex to segregate the influence of the various competing predictors to establish specific AO associations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans and other animals learn the consequences of their actions, allowing them to control their environment in a goal-directed manner. Nevertheless, it is unknown how we parse environmental causes from the effects of our own actions to establish these specific action-outcome (AO) relationships. Here, we show that the brain learns the causal structure of the environment by segregating the unique influence of actions from other causes in the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices and, through a network of structures, including the caudate nucleus and posterior parietal cortex, establishes the distinct causal relationships from which specific AO associations are formed.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Improved Speech Hearing in Noise with Invasive Electrical Brain Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Speech perception in noise is a challenging everyday task with which many listeners have difficulty. Here, we report a case in which electrical brain stimulation of implanted intracranial electrodes in the left planum temporale (PT) of a neurosurgical patient significantly and reliably improved subjective quality (up to 50%) and objective intelligibility (up to 97%) of speech in noise perception. Stimulation resulted in a selective enhancement of speech sounds compared with the background noises. The receptive fields of the PT sites whose stimulation improved speech perception were tuned to spectrally broad and rapidly changing sounds. Corticocortical evoked potential analysis revealed that the PT sites were located between the sites in Heschl's gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. Moreover, the discriminability of speech from nonspeech sounds increased in population neural responses from Heschl's gyrus to the PT to the superior temporal gyrus sites. These findings causally implicate the PT in background noise suppression and may point to a novel potential neuroprosthetic solution to assist in the challenging task of speech perception in noise.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Speech perception in noise remains a challenging task for many individuals. Here, we present a case in which the electrical brain stimulation of intracranially implanted electrodes in the planum temporale of a neurosurgical patient significantly improved both the subjective quality (up to 50%) and objective intelligibility (up to 97%) of speech perception in noise. Stimulation resulted in a selective enhancement of speech sounds compared with the background noises. Our local and network-level functional analyses placed the planum temporale sites in between the sites in the primary auditory areas in Heschl's gyrus and nonprimary auditory areas in the superior temporal gyrus. These findings causally implicate planum temporale in acoustic scene analysis and suggest potential neuroprosthetic applications to assist hearing in noise.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Thoracic VGluT2+ Spinal Interneurons Regulate Structural and Functional Plasticity of Sympathetic Networks after High-Level Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) above the major spinal sympathetic outflow (T6 level) disinhibits sympathetic neurons from supraspinal control, causing systems-wide "dysautonomia." We recently showed that remarkable structural remodeling and plasticity occurs within spinal sympathetic circuitry, creating abnormal sympathetic reflexes that exacerbate dysautonomia over time. As an example, thoracic VGluT2<sup>+</sup> spinal interneurons (SpINs) become structurally and functionally integrated with neurons that comprise the spinal&ndash;splenic sympathetic network and immunological dysfunction becomes progressively worse after SCI. To test whether the onset and progression of SCI-induced sympathetic plasticity is neuron activity dependent, we selectively inhibited (or excited) thoracic VGluT2<sup>+</sup> interneurons using chemogenetics. New data show that silencing VGluT2<sup>+</sup> interneurons in female and male mice with a T3 SCI, using hM4Di designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (G<SUB>i</SUB> DREADDs), blocks structural plasticity and the development of dysautonomia. Specifically, silencing VGluT2<sup>+</sup> interneurons prevents the structural remodeling of spinal sympathetic networks that project to lymphoid and endocrine organs, reduces the frequency of spontaneous autonomic dysreflexia (AD), and reduces the severity of experimentally induced AD. Features of SCI-induced structural plasticity can be recapitulated in the intact spinal cord by activating excitatory hM3Dq-DREADDs in VGluT2<sup>+</sup> interneurons. Collectively, these data implicate VGluT2<sup>+</sup> excitatory SpINs in the onset and propagation of SCI-induced structural plasticity and dysautonomia, and reveal the potential for neuromodulation to block or reduce dysautonomia after severe high-level SCI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In response to stress or dangerous stimuli, autonomic spinal neurons coordinate a "fight or flight" response marked by increased cardiac output and release of stress hormones. After a spinal cord injury (SCI), normally harmless stimuli like bladder filling can result in a "false" fight or flight response, causing pathological changes throughout the body. We show that progressive hypertension and immune suppression develop after SCI because thoracic excitatory VGluT2<sup>+</sup> spinal interneurons (SpINs) provoke structural remodeling in autonomic networks within below-lesion spinal levels. These pathological changes can be prevented in SCI mice or phenocopied in uninjured mice using chemogenetics to selectively manipulate activity in VGluT2<sup>+</sup> SpINs. Targeted neuromodulation of SpINs could prevent structural plasticity and subsequent autonomic dysfunction in people with SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perinatal Opioid Exposure Results in Persistent Hypoconnectivity of Excitatory Circuits and Reduced Activity Correlations in Mouse Primary Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Opioid use by pregnant women results in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) and lifelong neurobehavioral deficits including language impairments. Animal models of NOWS show impaired performance in a two-tone auditory discrimination task, suggesting abnormalities in sensory processing in the auditory cortex. To investigate the consequences of perinatal opioid exposure on auditory cortex circuits, we administered fentanyl to mouse dams in their drinking water throughout gestation and until litters were weaned at postnatal day (P)21. We then used <I>in vivo</I> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in adult animals of both sexes to investigate how primary auditory cortex (A1) function was altered. Perinatally exposed animals showed fewer sound-responsive neurons in A1, and the remaining sound-responsive cells exhibited lower response amplitudes but normal frequency selectivity and stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). Populations of nearby layer 2/3 (L2/3) cells in exposed animals showed reduced correlated activity, suggesting a reduction of shared inputs. We then investigated A1 microcircuits to L2/3 cells by performing laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) combined with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from A1 L2/3 cells. L2/3 cells in exposed animals showed functional hypoconnectivity of excitatory circuits of ascending inputs from L4 and L5/6 to L2/3, while inhibitory connections were unchanged, leading to an altered excitatory/inhibitory balance. These results suggest a specific reduction in excitatory ascending interlaminar cortical circuits resulting in decreased activity correlations after fentanyl exposure. We speculate that these changes in cortical circuits contribute to the impaired auditory discrimination ability after perinatal opioid exposure.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This is the first study to investigate the functional effects of perinatal fentanyl exposure on the auditory cortex. Experiments show that perinatal fentanyl exposure results in decreased excitatory functional circuits and altered population activity in primary sensory areas in adult mice. These circuit changes might underlie the observed language and cognitive deficits in infants exposed to opioids.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias elicited by coexistence of multiple electrophysiological remodeling in ischemia: A simulation study</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cuiping Liang, Qince Li, Kuanquan Wang, Yimei Du, Wei Wang, Henggui Zhang</p>

Myocardial ischemia, injury and infarction (MI) are the three stages of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In the past two decades, a great number of studies focused on myocardial ischemia and MI individually, and showed that the occurrence of reentrant arrhythmias is often associated with myocardial ischemia or MI. However, arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the tissue with various degrees of remodeling in the ischemic heart have not been fully understood. In this study, biophysical detailed single-cell models of ischemia 1a, 1b, and MI were developed to mimic the electrophysiological remodeling at different stages of ACS. 2D tissue models with different distributions of ischemia and MI areas were constructed to investigate the mechanisms of the initiation of reentrant waves during the progression of ischemia. Simulation results in 2D tissues showed that the vulnerable windows (VWs) in simultaneous presence of multiple ischemic conditions were associated with the dynamics of wave propagation in the tissues with each single pathological condition. In the tissue with multiple pathological conditions, reentrant waves were mainly induced by two different mechanisms: one is the heterogeneity along the excitation wavefront, especially the abrupt variation in conduction velocity (CV) across the border of ischemia 1b and MI, and the other is the decreased safe factor (SF) for conduction at the edge of the tissue in MI region which is attributed to the increased excitation threshold of MI region. Finally, the reentrant wave was observed in a 3D model with a scar reconstructed from MRI images of a MI patient. These comprehensive findings provide novel insights for understanding the arrhythmic risk during the progression of myocardial ischemia and highlight the importance of the multiple pathological stages in designing medical therapies for arrhythmias in ischemia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Learning the rules of collective cell migration using deep attention networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julienne LaChance, Kevin Suh, Jens Clausen, Daniel J. Cohen</p>

Collective, coordinated cellular motions underpin key processes in all multicellular organisms, yet it has been difficult to simultaneously express the ‘rules’ behind these motions in clear, interpretable forms that effectively capture high-dimensional cell-cell interaction dynamics in a manner that is intuitive to the researcher. Here we apply deep attention networks to analyze several canonical living tissues systems and present the underlying collective migration rules for each tissue type using only cell migration trajectory data. We use these networks to learn the behaviors of key tissue types with distinct collective behaviors—epithelial, endothelial, and metastatic breast cancer cells—and show how the results complement traditional biophysical approaches. In particular, we present attention maps indicating the relative influence of neighboring cells to the learned turning decisions of a ‘focal cell’–the primary cell of interest in a collective setting. Colloquially, we refer to this learned relative influence as ‘attention’, as it serves as a proxy for the physical parameters modifying the focal cell’s future motion as a function of each neighbor cell. These attention networks reveal distinct patterns of influence and attention unique to each model tissue. Endothelial cells exhibit tightly focused attention on their immediate forward-most neighbors, while cells in more expansile epithelial tissues are more broadly influenced by neighbors in a relatively large forward sector. Attention maps of ensembles of more mesenchymal, metastatic cells reveal completely symmetric attention patterns, indicating the lack of any particular coordination or direction of interest. Moreover, we show how attention networks are capable of detecting and learning how these rules change based on biophysical context, such as location within the tissue and cellular crowding. That these results require only cellular trajectories and no modeling assumptions highlights the potential of attention networks for providing further biological insights into complex cellular systems.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Optineurin promotes myogenesis during muscle regeneration in mice by autophagic degradation of GSK3β</a></h4>

Skeletal muscle regeneration is essential for maintaining muscle function in injury and muscular disease. Myogenesis plays key roles in forming new myofibers during the process. Here, through bioinformatic screen for the potential regulators of myogenesis from 5 independent microarray datasets, we identify an overlapping differentially expressed gene (DEG) optineurin (OPTN). <i>Optn</i> knockdown (KD) delays muscle regeneration in mice and impairs C2C12 myoblast differentiation without affecting their proliferation. Conversely, <i>Optn</i> overexpression (OE) promotes myoblast differentiation. Mechanistically, OPTN increases nuclear levels of β-catenin and enhances the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcription activity, suggesting activation of Wnt signaling pathway. The activation is accompanied by decreased protein levels of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a negative regulator of the pathway. We further show that OPTN physically interacts with and targets GSK3β for autophagic degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β rescues the impaired myogenesis induced by <i>Optn</i> KD during muscle regeneration and myoblast differentiation, corroborating that GSK3β is the downstream effector of OPTN-mediated myogenesis. Together, our study delineates the novel role of OPTN as a potential regulator of myogenesis and may open innovative therapeutic perspectives for muscle regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The X-linked splicing regulator MBNL3 has been co-opted to restrict placental growth in eutherians</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas Spruce, Mireya Plass, André Gohr, Debashish Ray, María Martínez de Lagrán, Gregor Rot, Ana Nóvoa, Demian Burguera, Jon Permanyer, Marta Miret, Hong Zheng, Maurice S. Swanson, Quaid Morris, Moises Mallo, Mara Dierssen, Timothy R. Hughes, Barbara Pernaute, Manuel Irimia</p>

Understanding the regulatory interactions that control gene expression during the development of novel tissues is a key goal of evolutionary developmental biology. Here, we show that <i>Mbnl3</i> has undergone a striking process of evolutionary specialization in eutherian mammals resulting in the emergence of a novel placental function for the gene. <i>Mbnl3</i> belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins whose members regulate multiple aspects of RNA metabolism. We find that, in eutherians, while both <i>Mbnl3</i> and its paralog <i>Mbnl2</i> are strongly expressed in placenta, <i>Mbnl3</i> expression has been lost from nonplacental tissues in association with the evolution of a novel promoter. Moreover, <i>Mbnl3</i> has undergone accelerated protein sequence evolution leading to changes in its RNA-binding specificities and cellular localization. While <i>Mbnl2</i> and <i>Mbnl3</i> share partially redundant roles in regulating alternative splicing, polyadenylation site usage and, in turn, placenta maturation, <i>Mbnl3</i> has also acquired novel biological functions. Specifically, <i>Mbnl3</i> knockout (M3KO) alone results in increased placental growth associated with higher <i>Myc</i> expression. Furthermore, <i>Mbnl3</i> loss increases fetal resource allocation during limiting conditions, suggesting that location of <i>Mbnl3</i> on the X chromosome has led to its role in limiting placental growth, favoring the maternal side of the parental genetic conflict.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 Allele with Enlarged Perivascular Spaces</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Enlarged perivascular spaces have emerged as markers of cerebral small vessel disease and are linked to perivascular drainage dysfunction. The apolipoprotein E-ɛ4 (APOE-ɛ4) allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's neuropathology, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We studied the relationship between APOE-ɛ4 and the topography and burden of enlarged perivascular spaces to elucidate underlying mechanisms between APOE-ɛ4 and adverse clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 3,564 Framingham Heart Study participants with available genotypes and magnetic resonance imaging. Enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale were rated using a validated scale. We related APOE-ɛ4 allele presence to high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in each region and a mixed score reflecting high burden in both regions using multivariable logistic regression. Exploratory analyses incorporated presence of cerebral microbleeds and assessed effect modification by hypertension.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean age was 60.7 years (SD = 14.6), 1,644 (46.1%) were men, 1,486 (41.8%) were hypertensive, and 836 (23.5%) participants were APOE-ɛ4 carriers. APOE-ɛ4 was associated with high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale (odds ratio [OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16, 1.81) and mixed regions (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.68). Associations were slightly stronger in hypertensive subjects.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The APOE-ɛ4 allele plays a modest role in the burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying small vessel disease type in community-dwelling individuals with predominant centrum semiovale enlarged perivascular spaces, which may be hypertensive angiopathy in our sample.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Homecoming of the estranged GluD channels</a></h4>

              
                A recent paper by Carrillo and colleagues demonstrates that GluD proteins form bona fide ligand-gated ion channels when their intrinsic flexibility is constrained by interactions with protein partners. Therefore, Delta receptors resemble all other members of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family not only by sequence and structural homology, but also by functional dynamics.
