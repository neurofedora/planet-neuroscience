              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27307?af=R">Mapping Postictal Aphasia through Signal Complexity: A Stereo‐Electroencephalography Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The postictal period provides an opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology underlying aphasia and recovery following epileptic seizures. This study examines postictal aphasia in stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG)-explored patients to identify brain regions associated with task-specific language deficits using signal complexity analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated video-SEEG-recorded focal seizures with and without postictal aphasia in patients with SEEG-confirmed hemispheric language dominance. SEEG traces were analyzed using permutation entropy (PE), with the postictal period quantified by a PE-based metric, the Postictal Alteration Time (PAT). Brain region PAT was correlated with language function recovery (eg, repetition). Electro-clinical recuperation was also assessed within the dorsal-ventral language stream framework. Additionally, a bedside testing battery was developed to evaluate postictal aphasia severity and task-specific deficits.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 322 seizures from 98 patients were analyzed. Seizures with postictal aphasia had longer PAT than those without. Task-specific language recovery correlated with regional PAT (eg, naming – middle temporal gyrus). Moreover, the dorsal stream recovered faster than the ventral stream. Additionally, the Postictal Aphasia Scale (PAS) was developed, evaluating naming, reading, repetition, and comprehension (verbal and written) and automatic speech. Higher PAS scores (indicating milder deficits) correlated with faster regional complexity recovery. At 5 and 10 minutes postictally, PAS revealed a global aphasia pattern, with comprehension deficits gradually resolving. By 15 minutes, aphasia was primarily production-related, particularly affecting naming.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of postictal aphasia and introduces PAS as a tool for assessing postictal aphasia severity and domain-specific deficits, aiding surgical planning and rehabilitation. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27308?af=R">Sex Differences in Associations of Lewy Body Disease with Alzheimer's Disease and Cognitive Decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate how sex and age at menopause influence the interplay between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) neuropathologies, and their associations with cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from: (1) three Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center cohorts (i.e., the Religious Orders Study, Rush Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study), and (2) the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Neuropathology Data Set. Neuropathological evaluation assessed LBD (neocortical/limbic-type vs none) and AD, including neuritic plaques (β-amyloid plaques surrounded by dystrophic neurites) and neurofibrillary tangles. In each dataset, we tested interactive associations between LBD and sex on neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline. Additionally, in the Rush dataset, we tested whether age at spontaneous menopause modified the associations of LBD with neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and cognitive decline in women.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the Rush dataset, we included 1,277 women and 579 men. In the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset, we included 3,283 women and 3,563 men. Across both datasets, men were more likely to have LBD, whereas women showed greater neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burdens. Sex modified the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangles (but not neuritic plaques), whereby LBD was more strongly associated with greater neurofibrillary tangle burden in women than men. Men showed faster LBD-related cognitive decline, whereas women showed faster neurofibrillary tangle-related decline, after adjusting for copathologies (neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and LBD, as appropriate). In women, earlier age at menopause exacerbated the associations of LBD with neurofibrillary tangle burden and episodic memory decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Sex may influence AD and LBD neuropathologies, highlighting the need for precision approaches to dementia prevention and intervention. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

This study reveals that when sensing host albumin, C. albicans, even avirulent strains, can trigger an alternative pathogenicity pathway via transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming.

">Differences in brain activity during sentence repetition in people who stutter: a combined analysis of four fMRI studies</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the neural correlates of developmental stuttering benefits from the use of functional MRI (fMRI) during speech production. Despite two decades of research, however, we have reached little consensus. In the current study, we analysed pooled fMRI data from four different studies that used the same sentence reading task and methodological approach. The combined sample included 56 adolescents and adults who stutter and 53 demographically matched typically fluent controls. A sparse-sampling design was used in each study, in which participants spoke during the silent period between measurements of brain activity. Sentence reading evoked activity in both groups across frontal and temporal regions bilaterally. At statistical thresholds corrected for family-wise error, there were no significant group differences. An uncorrected threshold was applied to explore group differences in areas previously identified in earlier fMRI studies on stuttering. People who stutter (PWS) showed greater activity compared with controls in right frontal pole, right anterior insula extending to frontal operculum, left planum temporale, and midbrain, at the level of red nucleus. In contrast, PWS showed lower activity in left superior frontal sulcus, subgenual medial prefrontal cortex, right anterior temporal lobe, and portions of inferior parietal lobe bilaterally including the angular gyrus on the left. Despite pooling data across multiple studies to achieve a relatively large sample, group differences in regions involved in speech-motor control only emerged at an uncorrected voxel-wise threshold. Some of these findings align with previous fMRI studies, such as increased activity in the right anterior insular cortex.

">ALS-Linked FUS and SOD1 Mutations Elevate MCM2 in Human Motor Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive motor neuron loss. In typically post-mitotic neurons, abnormal reactivation of cell cycle regulators and DNA replication licensing factors is observed in ALS pathogenesis. Emerging evidence links components of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, notably MCM2, to replication stress and genomic instability, implying a mechanistic role in ALS pathogenesis. Objective: To determine whether ALS-associated mutations in FUS and SOD1 influence MCM2 expression and localisation in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived spinal motor neurons (MNs). Methods: We differentiated isogenic hiPSC lines carrying FUS P525L-GFP and R495QfsX527, a SOD1 mutant line, and matched wild-type controls into spinal MNs ([&ge;]28 days in vitro). QRT-PCR quantified MCM2 mRNA levels ({Delta}{Delta}Ct method; n=3 biological replicates, technical triplicates). Protein expression was assessed by Western blot densitometry (n=3). Subcellular distribution of MCM2 in FUS mutants was evaluated by immunofluorescence (pilot, N=1; [&ge;]50 cells quantified). Results: FUS P525L MNs exhibited a modest, non-significant increase in MCM2 mRNA (1.3-fold vs. WT; p=0.1319) but a significant 1.8-fold elevation in MCM2 protein levels (p=0.034). The R495QfsX527 line showed a comparable trend at the transcript level (1.2-fold; p > 0.05) and a 1.6-fold increase in protein (p = 0.041). SOD1 mutant MNs demonstrated a pronounced 2.3-fold MCM2 protein upregulation (p=0.008). Immunofluorescence in FUS mutant MNs revealed no significant nuclear-to-cytoplasmic shift in MCM2 localisation, indicating that elevated MCM2 levels are not driven by subcellular mislocalization. Conclusion: ALS-linked FUS and SOD1 mutations upregulate MCM2 protein in human spinal MNs, suggesting post-transcriptional or stability-driven regulation. The absence of relocalisation in FUS mutants shows that this impact is caused by overexpression rather than mislocalisation. MCM2 may be a biomarker of disease-associated replication stress. Future studies will explore whether MCM2 overexpression exacerbates DNA damage or serves as a compensatory response, clarifying its role in ALS pathogenesis.

">Bioenergetic and Protein Processing Imbalances Synergize in iPSC-Dopamine neurons from Individuals with Idiopathic Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based models represent a powerful human system to gain insights into the etiopathology of Parkinsons disease (PD). Here, we study several iPSC-derived dopamine neuron (iPSC-DAN) lines, from individuals with idiopathic PD, which is the most common form of PD. Specifically, using iPSC-DAN differentiated for 50-55 days, we performed an in-depth analysis of different bioenergetic pathways and cellular quality control mechanisms in the cells. Our results showed wide ranging impairments in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), glycolysis and creatine kinase pathways in the PD dopamine (DA) neurons. Specifically, the PD neurons exhibited reduced oxygen consumption rates (OCR) at baseline and after challenges with mitochondrial inhibitors, as well as decreased glycolytic reserves measured via ECAR. This translated to lower OCR:ECAR ratios signifying more reliance on glycolysis vs OXPHOS in the PD cells. Moreover, a mislocalization of creatine kinase B to mitochondria was seen in the PD cells. These energetic changes synergized with the enhanced expression of mitochondrial fission proteins, disrupted mitophagy and oxidative stress. Additionally, the PD neurons contained more monomeric, phosphorylated and aggregated forms of alpha synuclein and displayed reduced viability. Ultrastructural examination through immuno-electron microscopy showed more alpha synuclein gold particles directly associated with mitochondria and packing autophagic vesicles. In essence, these data capture a web of key changes in human iPSC-DAN from idiopathic PD subjects associated with neuronal degeneration.

">Individual differences in learning and decision-making: the role of COMT Val158Met polymorphism in transitive inference</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the ordinal relationships between items requires constructing a rank order supporting decision-making between options. This process depends on the ability to learn reciprocal relationships and to select the best option available when making a choice. In such forms of decision-making, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in encoding the relative value of alternatives as a decision is formed. Higher-order cognitive abilities are influenced by genetic factors that affect dopamine availability in the PFC, potentially contributing to individual differences. Here, we examined the performance of 83 participants in a transitive inference task (TI), grouped by genotype based on the Val158Met single-nucleotide polymorphism in the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene. The task included a learning phase in which participants acquired the reciprocal relationships among a set of hierarchically ranked items (A>B>C>D>E>F), followed by a test phase in which they were required to compare all possible item pairs and select the higher-ranked one. While genotype did not significantly influence test-phase performance, it did affect learning efficiency. Specifically, Val homozygotes took a longer learning procedure than both heterozygotes and Met homozygotes during the learning phase. Drift diffusion modelling (DDM) revealed that task performance was explained by the efficiency of evidence accumulation, which was lower in Val homozygotes, accounting for their poorer performance not only during initial learning but also when required to switch to a reversed hierarchical structure (A<B<C<D<E<F). These findings suggest that individual differences in inferential decision-making and cognitive flexibility may be partially driven by genetically determined variations in prefrontal dopamine availability.

">Cellular basis for cortical network aging in primates</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale brain networks are vulnerable to change with aging and become dysregulated. How these networks are altered at the cellular level remains unclear owing to challenges of bridging data across scales. Here, we integrate in vivo cortical similarity networks with whole brain spatial transcriptomics to characterize the aging brain in a lifespan cohort of macaques (N=64, ages 1-26 years). Deep-layer excitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes emerged as dominant correlates of cortical similarity, linking infragranular cell type composition to macroscopic network structure. Age-related declines in network strength were most pronounced in transmodal networks, including default mode and limbic, and aligned with regions enriched in inhibitory and glial cell types. Parvalbumin-enriched chandelier cells showed the strongest association with regional vulnerability, suggesting a role in network disconnection. Cell-type enrichment was conserved across species, with both human and macaque transcriptomic data aligning with the cortical functional hierarchy. These findings uncover a cellular basis for cortical network aging and highlight the value of imaging-transcriptomic integration across scales.

">Multiplicative couplings facilitate rapid learning and information gating in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The brain consists of reciprocal connectivity and loops between recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and feedforward neural networks (FNNs). However, how their interactions facilitate learning remains unknown. Here we propose a multiplicative RNN-FNN coupling mechanism and report remarkable computational strengths in learning. The multiplicative interaction imposes a Hebbian-weight amplification onto synaptic-neuronal coupling, enabling context-dependent gating and rapid switching. We demonstrate that multiplicative coupling-driven synaptic plasticity achieves 2-100 folds of speed improvement in supervised, reinforcement and unsupervised learning settings, boosting memory capacity, model robustness and generalization of RNNs. We further demonstrate the efficacy and biological plausibility of multiplicative gating in modeling multiregional circuits, including a prefrontal cortex-mediodorsal thalamus network for context-dependent decision making, a cortico-thalamic-cortical network for working memory and attention, and an entorhinal cortex-hippocampus network for visuospatial navigation and sequence replay. Take together, our results offer insights into multi-plasticity, attractor dynamics and computation of recurrent neural circuits and profound neuroscience-inspired applications.

">Perineuronal Net and Inhibitory Synapse Remodeling on Striatal Fast-spiking Interneurons by Chronic Alcohol Exposure</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder is characterized by persistent drinking in the face of negative consequences. Such inflexible drinking requires dorsolateral striatum fast-spiking interneurons, which comprise roughly 1% of all striatal neurons. How chronic ethanol exposure affects fast-spiking interneuron physiology is poorly understood. We discover in mice that chronic ethanol exposure induced a dramatic loss of GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, synapses onto dorsolateral striatum fast-spiking interneuron somata and proximal dendrites where perineuronal nets, a subdivision of the extracellular matrix, are enriched. We found that chronic ethanol exposure degraded these perineuronal nets and that enzymatically degrading perineuronal nets similarly reduced GABAergic transmission onto dorsolateral striatum fast-spiking interneurons. Modeling the effect of alcohol, we find that silencing extrinsic GABAergic projections to the dorsolateral striatum increased voluntary ethanol consumption. Taken together, these data suggest chronic alcohol exposure remodels perineuronal nets and inhibitory synapses on fast-spiking interneurons to facilitate alcohol drinking.

">Spatially resolved mapping of monoacylglycerol lipase activity in the brain</a></h4>

              
                Visualizing signaling systems in the brain with high spatial resolution is critical to understand brain function and to develop therapeutics. Especially enzymes are often regulated on the post-translational level, resulting in a disconnect between protein levels and activity. Conventional antibody-based methods have limitations, including potential cross reactivity and the inability of antibodies to discriminate between active and inactive enzyme states. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), an enzyme degrading the neuroprotective endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, is the target of inhibitors currently in clinical trials for the treatment of several neurological disorders. To support translational and (pre)clinical studies and fully realize the therapeutic opportunities of MAGL inhibitors, it is essential to map the spatial distribution of MAGL activity throughout the brain in both health and disease. Here, we introduce selective fluorescent activity-based probes for MAGL enabling direct visualization of its enzymatic activity in lysates, cultured cells and tissue sections. We show that oxidative stress, which inactivates MAGL through the oxidation of regulatory cysteines, reduces probe labeling , thereby validating the probes activity-dependence. Extending this approach, we developed an activity-based histology protocol to visualize MAGL activity in fresh-frozen mouse and human brain tissues. This approach revealed robust MAGL activity in astrocytes and presynaptic terminals within the mouse hippocampus, and further allows detection of MAGL activity in the human cerebral cortex. Collectively, these findings establish selective activity-based probes as powerful tools mapping MAGL activity with high spatial resolution across mammalian brain tissue.

">The Functional Epididymal Amyloid Cystatin-Related Epididymal Spermatogenic (CRES) is a Component of the Mammalian Brain Extracellular Matrix</a></h4>

              
                CRES is the defining member of a reproductive subgroup of family 2 cystatins of cysteine protease inhibitors. We previously showed that CRES and other subgroup members are part of a highly plastic amyloid-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) with host defense functions in the mouse epididymal lumen. Based on parallels between the epididymis and the brain, we hypothesized that CRES and CRES amyloids might also function within the brain including the ECM. Here we show that CRES is produced by hippocampal neurons and astrocytes in the male and female mouse and human brain. Further, approximately 50% of hippocampal astrocytes from aged mice, like the aged human donor samples, had significantly reduced levels of CRES compared to younger mice, suggesting an age-related decline in CRES could contribute to altered brain function. Immunofluorescence experiments showed CRES colocalized with the ECM markers phosphacan and wisteria floribunda agglutinin indicating that CRES is part of the ECM. CRES monomer and high molecular weight SDS-resistant forms were found in insoluble fractions of the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and midbrain and bound to the protein aggregation disease (PAD) ligand, which preferentially binds amyloids but not protein monomers, suggesting a population of CRES exists in the brain as an amyloid structure. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that CRES/CRES amyloid is present in the mammalian brain and may contribute to ECM structure and function.

">Dynamic Modulation of Beta-Band Oscillations in the LGN and Their Role in Visual Processing</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal oscillations are a ubiquitous feature of thalamocortical networks and can be dynamically modulated across processing states, enabling thalamocortical communication to flexibly adapt to varying environmental and behavioral demands. The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), like all thalamic nuclei, engages in reciprocal synaptic interactions with the cortex, relaying retinal information to and receiving feedback input from primary visual cortex (V1). While retinal excitation is the primary driver of LGN activity, retinal synapses represent a minority of the total synaptic input onto LGN neurons, allowing for both retinogeniculate and geniculocortical signals to be influenced by nonretinal sources. To gain a holistic view of network processing in the geniculocortical pathway, we performed simultaneous extracellular recordings from the LGN and V1 of behaving macaque monkeys, measuring local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity. These recordings revealed prominent beta-band oscillations coherent between the LGN and V1 that influenced spike timing in the LGN and were statistically consistent with a feedforward process from the LGN to V1. These thalamocortical oscillations were suppressed by visual stimulation, spatial attention, and behavioral arousal, strongly suggesting that these oscillations are not a feature of active visual processing. Instead, they appear analogous to occipital lobe, alpha oscillations recorded in humans and may represent a signature of signal suppression that occurs during periods of low engagement or active distractor suppression.

">Loss of FMRP in microglia promotes degeneration of parvalbumin neurons and audiogenic seizures via progranulin insufficiency</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from loss of FMR1-encoded FMRP and is associated with reduced density of parvalbumin (PV) neurons; however, the mechanism underlying this abnormality remains unknown. Here we report that microglial FMRP regulates PV neuron density through lysosomal function. Mice with Fmr1 deletion in microglia exhibited audiogenic seizures (AGS) and decreased PV neuron density in the cortex and AGS-associated inferior colliculus (IC). FMRP increased the expression of lysosomal genes in microglia, including the progranulin-encoding Grn gene. Its loss in microglia led to impaired lysosomal function and increased apoptosis in microglia and PV neurons. Furthermore, PV neuron density in the IC was reduced similarly in male Grn+/-, Fmr1-/y, and Grn+/-;Fmr1-/y mice, and AAV8-mediated overexpression of progranulin rescued AGS and PV neuron loss in Fmr1-/y mice. This indicates that progranulin insufficiency is a determinant for PV neuron loss in FXS and elevating progranulin is a therapeutic strategy for FXS.

">Retinal waves reveal axial biases in modular patterns of cortical activity that predict future orientation preferences</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous activity before sensory onset is thought to guide the formation of functional neural circuits. In visual cortex, spontaneous activity prior to experience exhibits modular patterns that resemble future visually evoked orientation selective responses. However, the factors at this early stage that build the initial network interactions that support the orientation tuning of modular responses at eye opening remain unknown. Here we provide the first evidence that retinal waves could play an important role by shaping the modular biases in patterns of intracortical connectivity and lay the foundation for orientation selective responses. We demonstrate that slow propagating waves in developing cortex that are dependent on retinal activity recruit specific modular patterns during their movement across the cortical surface, resulting in strikingly elongated patterns of modular coactivity that predict visually-evoked orientation responses at eye opening. Thus axial biases in spontaneous patterns of co-activity are present before the onset of visual experience and could serve as the seed for the developmental emergence of modular orientation representations.

">Characterization of astrocyte density in the Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome mouse model of ASD</a></h4>

              
                Transcription factor 4 (TCF4) is a proneural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays a critical role in brain development and is associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Autosomal dominant mutations in TCF4 result in a profound neurodevelopmental disorder called Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS). Germline TCF4 loss-of-function (LOF) studies using human and mouse models have identified dysregulation in neural cell proliferation, genesis, and specification which lead to disruption in neuronal, astroglial and oligodendroglial lineages. In this study, we focused on the role of TCF4 in the genesis of the astrocyte lineage, specifically in the context of modeling PTHS. We show that germline heterozygous mutations in Tcf4 had no effect on the expression of astrocyte marker genes in primary astrocyte cultures and whole brain lysates. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of pan- and subclass-specific astrocyte markers showed Tcf4 mutation had no effect on the proportions of astrocytes in the dorsal cortex and corpus callosum. Lastly, we tracked ventrally-derived astrocytes using an Nkx2.1 reporter mouse and observed that germline Tcf4 LOF did not result in misallocation of ventrally-derived astrocytes into the dorsal cortex, a phenotype previously observed when both Tcf4 alleles were conditionally deleted in the Nkx2.1 lineage. These data indicate that germline heterozygous TCF4 LOF, which models PTHS, does not appear to affect the astrocyte lineage at the cell population level.

">Norepinephrine acts through radial astrocytes in the developing optic tectum to enhance threat detection and escape behavior</a></h4>

              
                The ability to switch behavioral states is essential for animals to adapt and survive. We investigated how norepinephrine (NE) activation of radial astrocytes alters visual processing in the optic tectum (OT) of developing Xenopus laevis. NE activates calcium transients in radial astrocytes through 1-adrenergic receptors. NE and radial astrocyte activation shifted OT response selectivity to preferentially respond to looming stimuli, associated with predation threat. NE-mediated astrocytic release of ATP/adenosine reduced excitatory transmission by retinal ganglion cell axons, without affecting inhibitory transmission in the OT. Blockade of adenosine receptors prevented both decreased neurotransmission and the selectivity shift. Chemogenetic activation of tectal radial astrocytes reproduced NE's effects and enhanced behavioral detection of looming stimuli in freely swimming animals. NE signaling via radial astrocytes enhances network signal-to-noise for detecting threatening stimuli, with important implications for sensory processing and behavior.

">Somatosensory Realignment Following Single and Dual Force Field Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Evidence that adaptive motor learning coincides with a realignment of somatosensory perception has led to hypotheses that a shared mechanism underlies both processes, predicting similar properties. However, studies of somatosensory realignment with visuomotor adaptation have shown mixed support, possibly due to a confounding coactivation of sensory prediction errors and multisensory integration. While the former is thought to drive adaptation, both processes may contribute to somatosensory realignment. Here, we examined somatosensory realignment following force field adaptation, which is not confounded by multisensory integration. Across two experiments, we tested whether somatosensory realignment mimics three properties of adaptation in this paradigm. Our first experiment examined the specificity of somatosensory realignment to the perceptions of movement or static position and the generalization to reach directions adjacent to the one performed during the adaptation task. The results showed that force field adaptation coincided with a selective realignment of somatosensory perception of movement in the direction of the perturbing force that did not correlate with the magnitude of adaptation or generalize beyond the reach direction of the adaptation task. In a second experiment, we tested whether context-dependent dual adaptation to opposing force field perturbations coincides with a context-dependent dual realignment of somatosensory perception. The results showed no evidence of context-dependent somatosensory realignment after dual adaptation. Our results indicate that somatosensory realignment does not show the same properties as force field adaptation; however, it displays some coherence with the nature of the perturbation. Overall, our data suggest that somatosensory realignment and adaptation likely stem from distinct mechanisms.

">Domain-General Brain Networks Support Language Development</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neural basis of verbal intelligence across development requires disentangling the contributions of domain-general and language-selective brain systems. Although language is often considered a domain-specific function, complex language tasks also engage domain-general networks, such as the Default-Mode (DM) and Multiple-Demand (MD) systems. Yet how these systems contribute to the maturation of verbal competence remains poorly understood. Here, we examined this question using gray matter volume measures in an accelerated longitudinal dataset of children and adolescents from Beijing (N = 170), using the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale as a benchmark for verbal abilities. We observed that individual differences in VCI were more strongly associated with structural maturation of domain general networks (DM and MD) than with the language-selective network, and that these effects varied with age. Targeted validation in an independent cohort from Chongqing (N = 150) confirmed significant contributions of domain-general networks in adolescence (13-15 years), highlighting the robustness of these developmental effects. These findings suggest that domain-general cortical systems play a critical and previously underappreciated role in the emergence of verbal intelligence during adolescence, with implications for understanding how large-scale brain networks support the development of abstract verbal reasoning.

Identification of quantitative biomarkers has the potential to facilitate the diagnosis process. This study aims to explore a routine to gain such biomarkers using quantitative analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data. Previous studies suggest that EEG data can be used to differentiate schizophrenia patients from healthy subjects. Various EEG features were used for such diagnostics using machine learning (ML) algorithms, but selecting the optimal EEG features and the classifiers is still insufficient. We propose an automatic selection of ML parameters using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software. Using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis’s “Supervised Attribute Selection” tool, we identified attributes that allow the identification of schizophrenia patients with a high accuracy of 93%. The attributes identified were EEG signals enriched for alpha and gamma frequencies from specific brain areas (frontal right, central, parietal, and occipital). This proposed strategy can effectively identify schizophrenia patients with high accuracy. It could be used as an ML tool to support diagnosis and potentially provide insights into the underlying disease mechanism of schizophrenia.</span>

                <p>by Nathanael Larigaldie, Tim Yates, Ulrik R. Beierholm</p>

Perception is dependent on the ability to separate stimuli from different objects and causes in order to perform inference and further processing. We have models of how the human brain can perform such causal inference for simple binary stimuli (e.g., auditory and visual), but the complexity of the models increases dramatically with more than two stimuli. To characterize human perception with more complex stimuli, we developed a Bayesian inference model that takes into account a potentially unlimited number of stimulus sources: it is general enough to factor in any discrete sequential cues from any modality. Because the model employs a non-parametric prior, increased signal complexity does not necessitate the addition of more parameters. The model not only predicts the number of possible sources, but also specifies the source with which each signal is associated. As a test case, we demonstrate that such a model can explain several phenomena in the auditory stream perception literature, that it provides an excellent fit to experimental data, and that it makes novel predictions that we experimentally confirm. These findings have implications not just for human auditory temporal perception, but for a wide range of perceptual phenomena across unisensory and multisensory stimuli.

                <p>by Rachael Aber, Yanming Di, Benjamin D. Dalziel</p>

Trends in infectious disease incidence provide important information about epidemic dynamics and prospects for control. Higher-frequency variation around incidence trends can shed light on the processes driving epidemics in complex populations, as transmission heterogeneity, shifting landscapes of susceptibility, and fluctuations in reporting can impact the volatility of observed case counts. However, measures of temporal volatility in incidence, and how volatility changes over time, are often overlooked in population-level analyses of incidence data, which typically focus on moving averages. Here we present a statistical framework to quantify temporal changes in incidence dispersion and to detect rapid shifts in the dispersion parameter, which may signal new epidemic phases. We apply the method to COVID-19 incidence data in 144 United States (US) counties from January 1st, 2020 to March 23rd, 2023. Theory predicts that dispersion should be inversely proportional to incidence, however our method reveals pronounced temporal trends in dispersion that are not explained by incidence alone, but which are replicated across counties. In particular, dispersion increased around the major surge in cases in 2022, and highly overdispersed patterns became more frequent later in the time series. These increases potentially indicate transmission heterogeneity, changes in the susceptibility landscape, or that there were changes in reporting. Shifts in dispersion can also indicate shifts in epidemic phase, so our method provides a way for public health officials to anticipate and manage changes in epidemic regime and the drivers of transmission.

Understanding how stem cells organize to form early tissue layers remains an important open question in developmental biology. Helpful in understanding this process are biomarkers or features that signal when a significant transition or decision occurs. We show such features from the spatial layout of the cells in a colony are sufficient to train neural networks to classify stem cell colonies according to differentiation protocol treatments each colony has received. We use topological data analysis to derive input information about the cells’ positions to a four-layer feedforward neural network. We find that despite the simplicity of this approach, such a network has performance similar to the traditional image classifier ResNet. We also find that network performance may reveal the time window during which differentiation occurs across multiple conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012395">Allocating limited surveillance effort for outbreak detection of endemic foot and mouth disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ariel Greiner, José L. Herrera-Diestra, Michael Tildesley, Katriona Shea, Matthew Ferrari</p>

Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) affects cloven-hoofed animals globally and has become a major economic burden for many countries around the world. Countries that have had recent FMD outbreaks are prohibited from exporting most meat products; this has major economic consequences for farmers in those countries, particularly farmers that experience outbreaks or are near outbreaks. Reducing the number of FMD outbreaks in countries where the disease is endemic is an important challenge that could drastically improve the livelihoods of millions of people. As a result, significant effort is expended on surveillance; but there is a concern that uninformative surveillance strategies may waste resources that could be better used on control management. Rapid detection through sentinel surveillance may be a useful tool to reduce the scale and burden of outbreaks. In this study, we use an extensive outbreak and cattle shipment network dataset from the Republic of Türkiye to retrospectively test three possible strategies for sentinel surveillance allocation in countries with endemic FMD and minimal existing FMD surveillance infrastructure that differ in their data requirements: ranging from low to high data needs, we allocate limited surveillance to [1] farms that frequently send and receive shipments of animals (Network Connectivity), [2] farms near other farms with past outbreaks (Spatial Proximity) and [3] farms that receive many shipments from other farms with past outbreaks (Network Proximity). We determine that all of these surveillance methods find a similar number of outbreaks – 2-4.5 times more outbreaks than were detected by surveying farms at random. On average across surveillance efforts, the Network Proximity and Network Connectivity methods each find a similar number of outbreaks and the Spatial Proximity method always finds the fewest outbreaks. Since the Network Proximity method does not outperform the other methods, these results indicate that incorporating both cattle shipment data and outbreak data provides only marginal benefit over the less data-intensive surveillance allocation methods for this objective. We also find that these methods all find more outbreaks when outbreaks are rare. This is encouraging, as early detection is critical for outbreak management. Overall, since the Spatial Proximity and Network Connectivity methods find a similar proportion of outbreaks, and are less data-intensive than the Network Proximity method, countries with endemic FMD whose resources are constrained could prioritize allocating sentinels based on whichever of those two methods requires less additional data collection.

                <p>by Ching-Shin Huang, Hui Wang, Joshua B. R. White, Oksana Degtjarik, Cindy Huynh, Kristoffer Brannstrom, Mark T. Horn, Stephen P. Muench, William S. Somers, Javier Chaparro-Riggers, Laura Lin, Lidia Mosyak</p>

Intravascular hemolysis releases hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which can damage vascular and renal tissues due to its oxidative nature. Circulating haptoglobin acts as a primary defense by binding to free hemoglobin, forming a haptoglobin–hemoglobin (HpHb) complex that is then recognized and cleared by the CD163 scavenger receptor on macrophages. While the function and structure of HpHb complex are mostly well-defined, the molecular mechanism underlying its interaction with CD163 remains unclear. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human CD163 in its unliganded state and in its complex with HpHb. These structures reveal that CD163 functions as a trimer, forming a composite binding site at its center for one protomer of the dimeric HpHb, resulting in a 3:1 binding stoichiometry. In the unliganded state, CD163 can also form a trimer, but in an autoinhibitory configuration that occludes the ligand binding site. Widespread electrostatic interactions mediated by calcium ions are pivotal in both pre-ligand and ligand-bound receptor assemblies. This calcium-dependent mechanism enables CD163/HpHb complexes to assemble and, once internalized, disassemble into individual components upon reaching the endosome, where low calcium and lower pH conditions prevail. Collectively, this study elucidates the molecular mechanism by which CD163-mediated endocytosis efficiently clears different isoforms of HpHb.

In this study, we conducted high-throughput spatiotemporal analysis of primary cilia length and orientation across 22 mouse brain regions. We developed automated image analysis algorithms, which enabled us to examine over 10 million individual cilia, generating the largest spatiotemporal atlas of cilia. We found that cilia length and orientation display substantial variations across different brain regions and exhibit fluctuations over a 24-h period, with region-specific peaks during light-dark phases. Our analysis revealed unique orientation patterns of cilia, suggesting that cilia orientation within the brain is not random but follows specific patterns. Using BioCycle, we identified rhythmic fluctuations in cilia length across five brain regions: the nucleus accumbens core, somatosensory cortex, and the dorsomedial, ventromedial, and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei. Our findings present novel insights into the brain cilia dynamics, and highlight the need for further investigation into cilia’s role in the brain’s response to environmental changes and regulation of oscillatory physiological processes.

                Heavy metal contamination has gradually become a highly significant global issue due to its continual existence in the environment and bioaccumulation in the ecosystems, posing deleterious risks to human health. The major objectives of the review is to investigate the sources, pathways, and toxicological impacts of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead, mercury, and arsenic, elucidating their health consequences and plausible mitigation strategies. Furthermore, the review explores the dual origins of heavy metal contamination; natural geological processes and anthropogenic activities such as industrial emissions, mining, and agricultural practices. These heavy metals seep into soil, water, and food chains, leading to bioaccumulation, bio-magnification and causing significant health risks, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and reproductive toxicity. Additionally, the addition of indigenous case studies from Nigeria, such as lead poisoning in Zamfara State and contamination in the Great Kwa River of Cross Rivers State underscores the disproportionate impact of heavy metal pollution in developing nations. The key findings from this review via the selected case studies revealed the socio-economic and environmental dimensions of the issue, providing a contextual understanding of region-specific vulnerabilities and health outcomes. To address these problems, the review evaluates already existing mitigation strategies, including chelation therapy and phytoremediation, while proposing sustainable, cost-effective solutions for reducing exposure and mitigating impacts. It emphasizes the importance of integrative approaches involving policy, community engagement, and technological innovations to fight heavy metal contamination effectively. In conclusion, this review contributes to the understanding of heavy metal toxicity, giving and showcasing very much important insights into the sources and health implications of contamination. By integrating theoretical perspectives with practical solutions, this review provides a robust framework for informing policy makers and advancing sustainable environmental management practices.

                Background Nowadays, digital literacy plays a key role in improving public management, especially in the most vulnerable communities. In this regard, we aim to understand how the knowledge and use of digital tools impact the work life of the vulnerable population in Lambayeque, facilitating their access to digital platforms and, in turn, improving their interaction with public services. The research aimed to analyze how the implementation of digital literacy improved the use of digital platforms in public administration among the vulnerable working population of the Lambayeque Region during the year 2023. Methods To achieve this, an applied approach with a descriptive-propositional scope was adopted. Additionally, a non-experimental and cross-sectional design was employed, considering a population of 1,356 inhabitants of Lambayeque, from which 673 were selected using a statistical formula. Results The results evidenced a positive relationship between digital literacy and the use of digital platforms. It was observed that the majority of respondents had a high level of digital literacy, which favored efficiency in the use of these tools within public administration. However, it was also identified that a sector of the population still presented a medium level, highlighting the need to strengthen the development of digital skills. Furthermore, the findings coincided with previous research that emphasized the importance of digital literacy in various sectors, such as commerce, small and medium enterprises, and financial inclusion. Conclusions Consequently, it was concluded that training in digital literacy was key to the adoption of new technologies and the utilization of digital services, thereby promoting a more active and empowered citizenship in the digital environment.

                The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rapidly digitising educational system due to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made a change in leadership imperative. A key framework for improving organisational effectiveness in handling these changes is digital leadership. It combines technological competencies with traditional leadership. Even with increased scholarly interest, there remains a gap in the thorough analysis of the field’s intellectual framework, thematic evolution, and collaborative dynamics. This study addresses this gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of digital leadership research in education from 2010 to 2024, employing RStudio to map publication trends, influential sources, author productivity, conceptual themes, and social structures. Data from 338 Scopus-indexed documents reveal a significant rise in publications post-2010, peaking in 2023, with core journals such as Education and Information Technologies and Cogent Education dominating the field. Prolific authors like Karakose T., Altinay F., and Z. underscore the centrality of collaborative research, while thematic mapping identifies key clusters: digital competence, virtual leadership, and institutional innovation. Thematic evolution highlights a post-pandemic pivot toward digital transformation and AI integration, though niche areas like K-12 digital leadership remain underdeveloped. Social network analysis reveals fragmented yet growing global collaborations, with the United States, Turkey, and the United Kingdom as dominant hubs, while disparities persist in Global South participation. The study’s implications emphasize the need for interdisciplinary research, equitable global partnerships, and policy frameworks that prioritize digital leadership training for educators. Practitioners are encouraged to implement adaptive strategies to leverage emerging technologies, ensuring sustainable learning outcomes. This analysis provides a foundation for future research and practice in digital leadership by delineating the field’s conceptual and social networks, thereby bridging the divides between theory, policy, and institutional practice.

                Background This study aimed to validate a comprehensive and psychometrically sound instrument—the Propensity to Cheat Scale (PCS)—designed to measure undergraduate students’ propensity toward academic dishonesty in Ethiopian universities. Based on Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior, the PCS was validated to assess students’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control related to various forms of cheating, including cheating on tests and examinations, cheating on assignments, cheating on research work (plagiarism), and theft and mutilation of library materials. Methods The present study employed an explanatory research design using a questionnaire based on the Propensity to Cheat Scale (PCS). The questionnaire was administered to 500 university students (male = 367 [73.4%]; female = 133 [26.6%]) selected from three Ethiopian public universities between November and January 2022. In order to measure the underlying variables of propensity towards cheating, a factor model is developed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the students’ perceived PTC. The internal consistency of the PTC scale was assessed using reliability analysis, and validity evaluations were conducted to confirm the scale’s discriminant and convergent validity. Results Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results revealed a good fit to the data, and the internal consistency of the PCS was found to be strong, providing a reliable measure of students’ propensity for cheating. Validity evaluations, including discriminant validity and convergent validity, confirmed the validity of the scale. The average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability values also supported the scale’s convergent validity. The multidimensional concept of the PTC was supported by a four-factor solution consisting of 26 reliable and valid items. Conclusion The findings of the study demonstrate that the scale has also provided sufficient evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. By establishing discriminant and convergent validity, as well as reliability, through different validation procedures, the study has provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the PCS as an instrument for determining whether university students are likely to engage in cheating behavior.

                Background Managing immune-mediated inflammatory diseases(IMIDs) is complex for patients and healthcare professionals. Research indicates healthcare fragmentation due to mono-disciplinary approaches that address numerous comorbid conditions. While acknowledged as critical to IMIDs care, the joint coordination and management of somatic disorders, psychological disorders, and socioeconomic factors receive limited attention in current clinical practices. Research calls for more interprofessional approaches addressing IMIDs patients’ needs. Therefore, this study explored patients’ experiences participating in an interprofessional patient-centred complex IMIDs intervention to inform future development. Materials & Methods The study was based on semi-structured interviews with 11 participants. We used Thematic Analysis to analyse data. Results We identified three overarching themes: Bringing well-known actors into a new concept, Expanding interprofessional care, and Bridging interprofessional care. From the patients’ perspective, integrating expertise from well-known professionals and a broader spectrum of professionals was critical to addressing their complex IMIDs needs and avoiding fragmentation. Moreover, coordination administered by care coordinators was vital to their experiences of success. Conclusions This study presents a two-fold conceptualisation of interprofessional care to inform future IMIDs intervention development. Our results underscore the importance of individualising and tailoring treatment through patient-centred care to help patients improve their IMIDs and self-management skills.

                Biomedical databases are an important part of the scientific infrastructure for organising and synergising research outputs. Many of these databases abstract content from the rapidly expanding scientific literature. Therefore, database curators require effective literature search methods in order to capture research relevant to their domain. This article describes LitSieve, a literature search tool with filtering based on text mined annotations, and flexible article organisation features. It allows users to define filters based on biomedical entities like genes, diseases and species to include or exclude particular articles within their results. By combining a search query with a filter, curators are able to identify articles relevant to the database which they are curating. LitSieve uses APIs provided by Europe PMC, from which abstracts, article full text and text mined annotations are drawn. LitSieve is available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/litsieve/

<p>Lateral view of the African wild dog brain showing the location of the somatosensory cortical areas in relation to the parietal multisensory region (PP), occipital visual cortical areas (17, 18, 19, 21, SS, T), and temporal auditory cortical areas (AAF, AI AII). These broad relations of the sensory cortex reflect that observed in many other mammals.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Social behaviors in the African wild dog (<i>Lycaon pictus</i>) commonly involve a range of tactile aspects, including biting, pushing, embracing, mounting, face and muzzle licking, nose–chin and muzzle contact, paw placement, play fighting, and wrestling, supported by the vestibular system. We employed an array of architectural and immunohistochemical stains to provide a qualitative description of the somatosensory and vestibular systems in the brain of one representative African wild dog individual. The appearance of both systems does not appear to differ from that reported in other Carnivora. The six nuclei forming the vestibular system, and their relationship to each other and the incoming vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve, appear like those observed in many mammalian species. The location and appearance of the dorsal column nuclei, the trigeminal sensory column, the colliculi, somatosensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus, and the five somatosensory cortical areas observed in the African wild dog are like those observed in the domestic dog and other Carnivora. This study of the somatosensory and vestibular systems of the African wild dog completes our series of studies describing the major sensory systems in the African wild dog brain. It appears reasonable to conclude that, at the systems level of analysis, no overt specializations of any of the sensory systems are present. Thus, the neural underpinnings of the complex sociality of the African wild dog may be supported by nonsensory neural systems, such as motor, neuromodulatory, limbic, or cognitive systems, or levels of organization like receptor expression patterns or connectivity.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the impact of dopamine deficiency and isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) on cognitive performance in early neuronal α-synuclein disease (NSD) with hyposmia but without motor disability.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative baseline data, cognitive performance was assessed with a cognitive summary score (CSS) derived from robust healthy control (HC) norms. Performance was examined for participants with hyposmia in early NSD-Integrated Staging System (NSD-ISS), either stage 2A (cerebrospinal fluid α-synuclein seed amplification assay [SAA]+, dopamine transporter scan [DaTscan]−) or 2B (SAA+, DaTscan+).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants were stage 2A (n = 101), stage 2B (N = 227), and HCs (n = 158). Although stage 2 had intact Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (mean [SD] = 27.0 [2.3]), stage 2A had a numerically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.05, <i>p =</i> NS; effect size = 0.09) and stage 2B a statistically worse CSS (z-score mean difference = 0.23, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; effect size = 0.40) compared with HCs. In stage 2A, hyposmia alone was associated with normal cognition, but those with comorbid iRBD had significantly worse cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.33, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, effect size =0.50). In stage 2B, hyposmia alone had abnormal cognition (z-score mean difference = 0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.0078, effect size = 0.29), and superimposed iRBD had a statistically significant additive effect.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using a novel CSS, we demonstrated that hyposmia is associated with cognitive deficits in prodromal NSD without motor disability, particularly when comorbid dopamine system impairment or comorbid iRBD is present. Therefore, it is critical to include and assess cognition at all stages when studying synuclein disease, even in the absence of motor disability. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Microglia are involved in many aspects of postnatal brain development and neuronal plasticity. This article questions some of the assumptions inherent in current experimental models used to analyze microglial ontogeny and function which likely underestimate the contributions of blood monocytes to brain homeostasis. It summarizes evidence from animal models of congenital microglial deficiency that postnatal neuronal development and synaptic refinement do not require the presence of microglia. Instead, the absence of microglia is associated with accelerated progression in disease models and age-dependent neuropathology in humans, implying that the major essential function of microglia is to protect against neuronal injury.

                The brain’s ability to adapt and support learning relies on experience-dependent synaptic plasticity, where connections between neurons are strengthened or weakened in response to activity. Recent research in mammalian systems reveals microRNAs (miRNAs) as crucial regulators of this process, offering a new perspective on how neurons achieve timely, localized control of protein synthesis. Neuronal activity influences every stage of the miRNA life cycle, from transcription to transport, maturation, and decay. Transcriptional regulation enables neuron-wide structural adaptations, while synapse-specific transport and maturation ensure localized protein synthesis. Though incompletely understood, activity-regulated miRNA decay allows for reversible modulation of gene expression. These discoveries highlight miRNAs as an essential layer of regulation, bridging neuronal activity with molecular changes that support learning and memory.

                Bershteyn et al. describe the long-term properties of a human stem cell-derived GABAergic interneuron cell therapy candidate undergoing clinical evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy. Following transplantation into the brains of healthy or epileptic mice, grafted cells demonstrate exceptional purity, differentiation into authentic subtypes, integration with host circuitry, and gradual electrophysiological maturation.

                Tan et al. compared gene expression of young and 3-week-old flies from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. Aging caused widespread sex- and genotype-specific transcriptional changes but global robustness of co-expression modules. Some networks lost connectivity and reduced genetic control of gene expression with age and were associated with organismal senescence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101105">Ultraslow serotonin oscillations in the hippocampus delineate substates across NREM and waking</a></h4>

              
                Beyond the vast array of functional roles attributed to serotonin (5-HT) in the brain, changes in 5-HT levels have been shown to accompany changes in behavioral states, including WAKE, NREM, and REM sleep. Whether 5-HT dynamics at shorter time scales can be seen to delineate substates within these larger brain states remains an open question. Here, we performed simultaneous recordings of extracellular 5-HT using a recently developed G-Protein-Coupled Receptor-Activation-Based 5-HT sensor (GRAB5-HT3.0) and local field potential in the hippocampal CA1 of mice, which revealed the presence of prominent ultraslow (&lt;0.05 Hz) 5-HT oscillations both during NREM and WAKE states. Interestingly, the phase of these ultraslow 5-HT oscillations was found to distinguish substates both within and across larger behavioral states. Hippocampal ripples occurred preferentially on the falling phase of ultraslow 5-HT oscillations during both NREM and WAKE, with higher power ripples concentrating near the peak specifically during NREM. By contrast, hippocampal–cortical coherence was strongest, and microarousals and intracranial EMG peaks were most prevalent during the rising phase in both wake and NREM. Overall, ultraslow 5-HT oscillations delineate substates within the larger behavioral states of NREM and WAKE, thus potentially temporally segregating internal memory consolidation processes from arousal-related functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97326">Acquisition of auditory discrimination mediated by different processes through two distinct circuits linked to the lateral striatum</a></h4>

              
                The striatum, the central hub of cortico-basal ganglia loops, contains functionally heterogeneous subregions distinguished by the topographic patterns of structural connectivity. These subregions mediate various processes of procedural learning. However, it remains unclear when and how striatal subregions engage in the acquisition of sensory stimulus-based decision-making. A neuroimaging of regional brain activity shows that the anterior dorsolateral striatum (aDLS) and posterior ventrolateral striatum (pVLS) in rats are activated in a different temporal pattern during the acquisition phase of auditory discrimination. Chronic and transient pharmacologic manipulations show that the aDLS promotes the behavioral strategy driven by the stimulus-response association while suppressing that by the response-outcome association, and that the pVLS contributes to forming and maintaining the stimulus-response strategy. Electrophysiological recording indicates that subpopulations of aDLS neurons predominantly represent the outcome of specific behaviors at the initial period of discrimination learning, and that pVLS subpopulations encode the beginning and ending of each behavior according to the progress of learning. In addition, other subpopulations of striatal neurons indicate sustained activation after obtaining reward with distinct patterns reflecting the stimulus-response associations. Our findings demonstrate that aDLS and pVLS neurons integrate the new learning of auditory discrimination in spatiotemporally and functionally different manners.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97130">The microbiome interacts with the circadian clock and dietary composition to regulate metabolite cycling in the Drosophila gut</a></h4>

              
                The gut microbiome plays a key role in the maintenance of host metabolic homeostasis and health. Most metabolic processes cycle with a 24-hour rhythm, but the extent to which the microbiome influences metabolite cycling under different conditions, such as variations in dietary composition, remains largely unknown. In this study, we utilized high temporal resolution metabolite profiling of the <i>Drosophila</i> gut to investigate the role of the microbiome in metabolite cycling. We find that the microbiome increases the number of oscillating metabolites despite the previous finding that it dampens transcript cycling in the gut. Time-restricted feeding also promotes metabolite cycling and does so to a larger extent in germ-free flies, thereby increasing cycling in these flies to levels comparable to those in microbiome-containing flies. Enhancement of cycling by the microbiome depends upon a circadian clock, which also maintains phase in the face of changes in the microbiome. Interestingly, a high protein diet increases microbiome-dependent metabolite cycling, while a high sugar diet suppresses it. Gene Ontology identifies amino acid metabolism as the metabolic pathway most affected by changes in the gut microbiome, the circadian clock, and timed feeding, suggesting that it is subject to regulation by multiple inputs. Collectively, our observations highlight a key role of the gut microbiome in host metabolite cycling and reveal a complex interaction with internal and external factors.

">Synaptic properties of layer 6 auditory corticothalamic inputs in normal hearing and noise-induced hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (CTs) provide strong feedback input that is crucial to perception and cognition in normal and pathological states; however, the synaptic properties of this input remain largely unknown, especially in pathology. Here, we examined the synaptic properties of CT axon terminals in the medial geniculate body (MGB), the auditory thalamus, in normal hearing mice and in a mouse model of noise-induced hearing loss. In normal hearing mice, we found that the synaptic strength of CTs to the core-type ventral subdivision of the auditory thalamus (MGv), which mainly conveys rapid sensory information, is stronger than the synaptic strength of CTs to the matrix-type dorsal subdivision of the auditory thalamus (MGd), which likely conveys higher-order internal state information. This is due to increased functional release sites (n) in CT[-&gt;]MGv compared to CT[-&gt;]MGd synapses. After noise trauma, we observed enhanced short-term facilitation in CT[-&gt;]MGd but not CT[-&gt;]MGv synapses. Our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of short-term synaptic plasticity after noise-induced hearing loss via which CTs enhance the throughput of matrix-type thalamus, likely to improve perceptual recovery via higher-order contextual modulation.

">Memorization of novel patterns in working memory in a model based on dendritic bistability</a></h4>

              
                Working memory can hold many types of information and is crucial for cognition. Commonly, models of working memory maintain information such as hues or words by forming memory attractors through structured connectivities. However, real-world information can be novel, making it infeasible to use pre-trained attractors. In addition, most models-with or without attractors-have focused on maintaining binary categories instead of continuous information in each neuron. In the present study, we investigate how the brain might maintain working memory representations of arbitrary novel patterns with graded values. We propose an unstructured network model in which each neuron has multiple bistable dendrites. Each dendrite effectively implements fast Hebbian plasticity due to dendritic dynamics and dendrite-soma interactions. This network can maintain novel graded patterns under various perturbations without fine tuning of parameters. Through analytical characterization of network dynamics during the encoding and memory periods, we identify different conditions that yield either perfect memories or several types of memory errors. We also demonstrate memory robustness under various conditions and resilience to temporal inhibitory perturbations. Thus, this architecture provides robust and analytically tractable storage of novel graded patterns in working memory.

">Genetic inactivation of the Translin/Trax RNase activity alters small RNAs including miRNAs, disrupts gene expression and impairs distinct forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory</a></h4>

              
                Neurons utilize RNA interference in the reversible translational repression of synaptically localized mRNAs, enabling rapid translation in response to synaptic activity. Two evolutionarily conserved proteins, Translin and Trax, form an RNase complex which processes miRNAs, tRNAs and siRNAs. To determine the specific role of the RNase activity of this complex in brain function, we employed a mouse line harboring a point mutation in Trax (E126A) that renders the Translin/Trax RNase inactive. At the molecular level, we found alterations in the levels of multiple small RNAs including miRNAs, tsRNAs and substantial downregulation of gene expression at the mRNA level in the hippocampus of TraxE126A mice. At the synaptic level, TraxE126A mice exhibit deficits in specific forms of long-term hippocampal synaptic plasticity. At the behavioral level, TraxE126A mice display impaired long-term spatial memory and altered open-field and acoustic-startle behavior. These studies reveal the functional role of Translin/Trax RNase in the mammalian brain.

">AAV-based temporal APOE4-to-APOE2 replacement reveals rebound adaptation and RAB24-mediated Aβ and cholesterol dysregulation</a></h4>

              
                APOE-targeted gene therapy offers a promising strategy for modifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, yet the temporal dynamics and context-dependent effects of APOE isoform modulation remain poorly defined. Here, we developed a rapid AAV-based platform enabling inducible in vivo replacement of APOE4 with APOE2. In 5xFAD mice, sustained APOE4 expression exacerbated cognitive decline, A{beta} deposition (parenchymal and vascular), and glial activation, whereas long-term APOE2 expression--with concurrent APOE4 silencing--significantly reversed these pathological features and rescued cognitive function. In contrast, short-term APOE2 replacement conferred no benefit and unexpectedly worsened behavioral and pathological outcomes. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that APOE4-associated gene signatures were broadly reversed by long-term APOE2 expression, but paradoxically aggravated by short-term replacement. Among these, RAB24--a regulator of autophagic trafficking--was upregulated by APOE4 and short-term APOE2 but suppressed by long-term APOE2. RAB24 elevation impaired A{beta} clearance and cholesterol homeostasis via lysosomal retention in primary astrocytes and neurons. Together, these findings uncover a rebound-adaptation mechanism that shapes APOE2 therapeutic outcomes, identify RAB24 as a modifiable node in A{beta} and cholesterol metabolism, and establish a temporally controlled gene therapy platform to inform the design of future APOE-targeted interventions in AD.

">Light stimulation system for measuring pupillary light responses based on Maxwellian view optical system using a retina presentation type viewfinder</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of applying a retinal projection viewfinder based on the Maxwellian view (MV) optical system for measuring post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) by comparing its performance with a typical LED-based optical system. Methods: Twenty-two healthy participants underwent pupillometry using both the MV-based viewfinder and a typical LED-based system. Monochromatic red and blue light stimuli were presented for durations of 1 and 10 seconds. Pupil responses, including maximum constriction, PIPR amplitude after 6 seconds from the light offset, area under the curve (AUC) values of PIPR, and sustained slopes, were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model to assess the differences between the two systems. Results: The MV-based viewfinder significantly enhanced net PIPR amplitude (p < 0.05) and sustained slope (p < 0.01) during 10-second light stimulation compared to the LED system, demonstrating its capability to effectively measure ipRGC-driven responses. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the net AUC values. These results highlight that the MV-based viewfinder enables effective PIPR measurements by delivering constant and controlled light stimulation directly to the retina, minimizing the effects of dynamic pupil constriction during light stimulation. Conclusions: The MV-based viewfinder showed feasibility as an effective method for measuring PIPR without requiring pharmacological dilation and technical knowledge to build the MV system. This innovative approach has significant potential for clinical and research applications in pupillometry. Translational Relevance: Our methodology provides practical solutions for dilation-free effective measurement of PIPR, accelerating its translation from experimental tool to routine clinical diagnostic.

">Deep mapping of the endomembrane system of cerebellar Purkinje neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal function relies on the precise spatial organization of intracellular membrane-bounded organelles involved in anabolism and Ca2+ sequestration, such as the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), along with structures involved in catabolism, such as lysosomes. Despite their known roles in energy supply, calcium homeostasis, and proteostasis, our understanding of how the anabolism-linked organelles are structurally arranged within neurons remains incomplete. Due to the tremendous complexity in the morphologies and fine structural features and interwoven nature of these intracellular organelles, particularly the ER, our understanding of their structural organization is limited, particularly, with regard to quantitative assessments of their sites of interaction and accurate measures of their volumetric proportions inside of a single large neuron. To approach this challenge, we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) to generate large-scale 3D EM volumes and electron tomography on high-pressure frozen tissue of the rodent cerebellum, including the largest cells in the vertebrate brain, the cerebellar Purkinje neuron as well as the most abundant cell type in the vertebrate brain, the much smaller cerebellar granule neuron. We reconstructed the neuronal ultrastructure of these different cell types, focusing on the ER, mitochondria and membrane contact sites, to then characterize intracellular motifs and organization principles in detail, providing a first full map to quantitatively describe a neuronal endoarchitectome. At the gross level organization, we found that the intracellular composite of organelles are cell type specific features, with specific differences between Purkinje neurons and Granule cells. At the level of fine structure, we mapped ultrastructural domains within Purkinje neurons where ER and mitochondria associate directly. In addition to cell type specific differences, we observed significant subcellular regional variation, particularly within the axon initial segment (AIS) of Purkinje neurons, where we identified ultrastructural domains with sharply contrasting distributions of ER and mitochondria. These findings suggest a finely tuned spatial organization of organelles that may underpin the distinct functional demands along the axon. We expect that our subcellular map, along with the methods developed to obtain these maps, will facilitate future studies in health, aging and disease to characterize defined features, by developing a framework for quantitative analysis of the neuronal ultrastructure.

">REVS: A New Open-Source Platform for High-Resolution Analysis of Rodent Wheel Running Behavior</a></h4>

              
                Background Rodent wheel running is widely used in neuroscience and preclinical research to assess locomotor function, recovery post-trauma or disease, circadian rhythms, and exercise physiology. However, most existing wheel-running systems offer limited metrics, lack flexibility in hardware, or require costly proprietary software, reducing their usefulness for detailed behavioral phenotyping, especially in models of injury or rehabilitation. New method We developed REVS (Revolution Evaluation and Visualization Software), a low-cost, open-source hardware and software platform for analyzing and visualizing rodent wheel running behavior. REVS captures wheel revolutions using Hall effect sensors and computes 13 day-level behavioral metrics along with detailed bout-level data. Users can interactively explore high-resolution temporal features and export data in Open Data Commons (ODC)-compatible formats. REVS supports customizable wheel types, facilitating use in animals with motor and/or sensory impairments. Results We validated REVS using a mouse model of partial spinal cord injury, where fine motor control is compromised. REVS detected impairments in 10 of 13 behavioral metrics post-injury, with varied recovery trajectories across measures. Principal component analysis revealed that recovery was closely linked to bout quality and intensity, rather than timing. Comparison with existing methods Unlike commercial and open-source systems, REVS offers more detailed metrics, customizable wheel compatibility, seamless blending with common vivarium hardware, integrated data visualizations, and ODC-compatible data export. It also supports flexible analysis across individuals and groups. Conclusions REVS provides a powerful, scalable tool for granular behavioral phenotyping in rodent studies, enhancing reproducibility and revealing insights into subtle locomotor changes associated with injury, recovery, and intervention.

">A novel, evolutionarily conserved inhibitory circuit selectively regulates dentate gyrus mossy cell function.</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian dentate gyrus contributes to mnemonic function by parsing similar events and places. The disparate activity patterns of mossy cells and granule cells is believed to enable this function yet the mechanisms that drive this circuit dynamic remain elusive. We identified a novel inhibitory interneuron subtype, characterized by VGluT3 expression, with overwhelming target selectivity for mossy cells while also revealing that CCK, PV, SOM and VIP interneurons preferentially innervate granule cells. Leveraging pharmacology and novel enhancer viruses, we find that this target-specific inhibitory innervation pattern is evolutionarily conserved in non-human primates and humans. In addition, in vivo chemogenetic manipulation of VGluT3+ interneurons selectively alters the activity and functional properties of mossy cells. These findings establish that mossy cells and granule cells have unique, evolutionarily conserved inhibitory innervation patterns and suggest selective inhibitory circuits may be necessary to maintain DG circuit dynamics and enable pattern separation across species.

">Conditions for replay of neuronal assemblies</a></h4>

              
                From cortical synfire chains to hippocampal replay, the idea that neural populations can be activated sequentially with precise spike timing is thought to be essential for several brain functions. It has been shown that neuronal sequences with weak feedforward connectivity can be replayed due to amplification via intra-assembly recurrent connections. However, this phenomenon was thought to depend on inhibitory feedback, but its mechanisms were still unclear. Here, we arrive at a minimal spiking model that shows that feedback inhibition is not needed for this amplification to occur. We then introduce a population model of membrane-potential distributions that explains the spiking network behavior, and we analytically describe how different connectivity structures determine replay speed, with weaker feedforward connectivity generating slower pulses that can be sustained by recurrent connections. These pulses can only propagate if neuronal leak currents are slow enough with respect to the pulse speed. Together, our simulations and analytical results predict the conditions for replay of neuronal assemblies.

">Alpha and theta activity during reward anticipation are modulated by implicit expectations about sequential risk</a></h4>

              
                Reward anticipation potentially guides sequential decision making, yet its underlying neural dynamics remain unclear. In this study, we investigated how risk levels and uncertainty modulate oscillatory brain activity during reward anticipation. EEG was recorded while participants (N = 44) performed a modified version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task where balloon burst probabilities changed throughout the task, promoting uncertainty. We analyzed induced spectral power time-locked to three risk levels: early no-risk pumps, final successful pumps (preceding a cash out), and unsuccessful pumps (preceding a balloon burst). Time-frequency decomposition using Morlet wavelets revealed a parieto-occipital alpha power increase following early no-risk pumps, interpreted as disengagement from deliberative processing when anticipating sure rewards. In contrast, centroparietal alpha and frontocentral theta power decreased most prominently following final successful pumps, suggesting heightened attentional and expectancy-related processes in response to high reward potential. The results indicate that alpha and theta dynamics are sensitive to risk levels and reward expectations. These findings provide novel insights into the oscillatory mechanisms of reward anticipation in uncertain decision environments.

">Surprising effects of stimulus repetition on neuronal firing rates and gamma-band synchronization in awake macaque V1</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus repetition is abundant, because the environment is redundant and/or because it is redundantly sampled. This offers an opportunity to optimize the processing of repeated stimuli. Indeed, stimulus repetition leads to classically described neuronal response decreases, and to more recently described neuronal gamma synchronization increases (sometimes preceded by decreases for a few trials). Here, we used a full-screen colored background (FSCB) and a flashed black bar, while recording multi-unit activity (MUA) and local field potentials (LFP) from area V1 of an awake macaque monkey. We found that the FSCB repetition induced neuronal response increases (sometimes preceded by decreases for a few trials) and gamma synchronization decreases (preceded by increases for a few trials). These effects are largely opposite to the dominant previous findings. Intriguingly, these surprising effects largely reversed when we isolated the responses to the flashed black bar. We discuss these findings, considering differences to previous studies with regards to the subject of the study, the stimuli and the task. We notice that in studies reporting classical results for gamma, sometimes in combination with firing rates, the stimuli were typically (partly) predictive of the reward. Here, we found non-classical results for the FSCB that was not reward predictive, and classical results for the black bar that was reward predictive. Whether this has revealed a general effect of reward predictive versus non-predictive stimuli will require further investigation with stimuli and task designs tailored specifically for this question.

">Dissecting the contribution of recent reward versus recent performance history on cognitive effort allocation</a></h4>

              
                An extensive body of literature has shown that humans tend to avoid expending cognitive effort, just like for physical effort or financial resources. How then, do we decide whether to put this effort in? Decision-making not only involves choosing our actions, but also the meta-decision of how much cognitive effort to invest in making this choice, weighing the costs of cognitive effort against potential rewards. Popular recent theories, grounded in the field of reinforcement learning, suggest that this cost-benefit trade-off can be informed by the opportunity costs of effort investment, which the brain may approximate by the estimated average reward rate per unit time. It follows from intuition that in a low reward environment, investing cognitive resources in the task at hand will less likely lead to missed opportunities. Recent studies provided support for this idea, showing that people exert more cognitive effort when reward rate is low. Here, we replicate one of the key previous findings but provide an important nuance to this result. Cognitive effort allocation was better explained by participants' recent performance history (i.e. accuracy rate) than average reward rate. In combination with the observation that participants were insensitive to the reward currently at stake, this invites a reinterpretation of these previous findings and suggests the need for further studies to assess whether environmental richness may indeed serve as a heuristic to modulate cognitive effort allocation.

">The cryo-EM-delineated mechanism underlying mimicry of CXCR4 agonism enables widespread stem cell neuroprotection in a mouse model of ALS</a></h4>

              
                G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins that mediate a range of signaling functions and, therefore, offer targets for a number of therapeutic interventions. Chemokine receptor CXCR4, a GPCR, plays versatile roles in normal and abnormal physiological processes. Synthetic CXCR4 antagonists have been extensively studied and approved for the clinical treatment of cancer and other diseases. We recently elucidated the structural mechanisms underlying CXCR4 antagonism using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). CXCR4 agonism by synthetic molecules is an unanticipated therapeutic intervention we recently unveiled. The structural mechanisms underlying those actions remain poorly understood yet could help elucidate a new class of drugs. Here we demonstrate a synthetic dual-moiety strategy that combines simplified agonistic and antagonistic moieties taken from natural agonistic and antagonistic chemokines, respectively, to design de novo peptide mimics of biological function of natural CXCR4 agonist SDF-1. Two peptides so generated, SDV1a and SDVX1 were shown to mimic the action of SDF-1 in activating CXCR4 signaling pathways and cell migration. The structural mechanism of these peptides in the mimicry of CXCR4 agonism was illustrated by cryo-EM structures of CXCR4 bound and activated by the peptides in the presence of G protein, revealing common interactions with the receptor by these peptides in comparison with SDF-1 that explain their close mimicry and conformational changes leading to CXCR4 signal activation. The therapeutic benefit of one of these peptides, SDV1a, was demonstrated in the SOD1G93A mouse model of the spinal motor neuron degenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) wherein the success of neuroprotective actions of transplanted human neural stem cells (hNSCs) is directly correlated with the expanse of diseased neuroaxis traversed by the donor cells; SDV1a enabled broader neuroprotective coverage while also permitting a much less invasive route of cell administration for extending life. Taken together, these results provide insights into the structural determinants of therapeutic CXCR4 agonism which may allow the design of adjunctive drugs that improve cell-based treatments of central nervous system (CNS) diseases.

">Proteomic and in silico dissection of MetaAggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brains</a></h4>

              
                RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), key translation regulators, are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The pathological entities associated with ALS are known as ''MetaAggregates'': heterogeneous coaggregates composed of amyloids, RBPs, and RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s). In this study, to explore the molecular constituents of ALS-associated MetaAggregates, we developed a proteomic approach using a psoralen-conjugated RBP and crosslinked it with a biotinylated rG4 to enable the isolation of MetaAggregates from ALS brain extracts. Single-cell RNA-seq using in vitro ALS models identified ELAVL4 as a cytoplasmic RBP and revealed the enrichment of an IGFBP2-derived rG4 structure in ALS-specific neurons. Mass spectrometry and amyloidogenicity-based principal component analysis revealed 79 candidate proteins with roles in RNA processing, metabolism, trafficking, and stress responses. Docking simulations highlighted a subset of proteins with potential pro-aggregation characteristics, diverse cytosolic associations and functional links to RNA processing relevant to ALS. Through proteomic and in silico dissection of ALS-associated MetaAggregates, the findings of this study establish a conceptual framework for the exploration of unrecognized amyloidogenic drivers of neurodegeneration.

                <p>In the mammalian visual system, three functionally distinct parallel processing streams extend from the retina to the visual thalamus and then to the visual cortex: magnocellular (M), parvocellular (P), and koniocellular (K). Tree shrews (<I>Tupaia belangeri</I>), a preprimate species, provide an advantageous model to study the K pathway in isolation because, while M and P pathways remain mixed in Lamina 1 (L1), L2, L4, and L5 of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), L3 and L6 receive strictly K-input from the contralateral eye. Additionally, K-input laminae selectively receive glutamatergic axons from the superior colliculus. To reveal how cellular and synaptic properties of K geniculate laminae may differ from M/P laminae and how tectal input may shape the K relay to the cortex, we studied the morphology and connectivity of retinal and tectal terminals in pathway-specific laminae. While confirming that K laminae relay cells contain calbindin, we also found its expression in GABAergic cells across all laminae. No cell-type or lamina specificity was observed for parvalbumin. Ultrastructurally, retinal terminals are morphologically distinct in M/P versus K laminae. Tectogeniculate axons in L3 and L6 resemble retinal terminals in their morphology and synaptic targets, while corticogeniculate terminals are sparse in L6. VGluT2, the molecular marker for large-sized driver terminals, is expressed prominently in one of the three tectal cell types that project to LGN. Morphological differences in synaptic circuitry between L3 and L6 provide further evidence that two geniculate K laminae are differentially innervated to relay distinct sets of information to the cortex.</p>

                <p>by Mohammad Kayyali, Ana Mincholé, Shuang Qian, Alistair Young, Devran Ugurlu, Elliot Fairweather, Steven Niederer, John Whitaker, Martin Bishop, Pablo Lamata</p>

Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings are affected by the heart’s three-dimensional orientation within the thorax, i.e., the anatomical axis. Various cardiac conditions can cause the anatomical axis to shift and/or alter the pattern of electrical activation, leading to changes in the electrical axis. Nevertheless, there remains a lack of a formal, population-level study of the interplay between the cardiac anatomical and electrical axes and the factors that affect them. In this context, this study aimed to: (1) propose standardised definitions for the cardiac anatomical and electrical axes, (2) characterise their population-wide interplay in healthy conditions, (3) evaluate the impact of hypertension on their distribution and (4) identify associations with phenotypical and disease characteristics. Using cardiac magnetic resonance images and 12-lead ECGs from ~39,000 UK Biobank participants, patient-specific, paired biventricular geometries and vectorcardiograms were constructed. Five anatomical and four electrical axis definitions were computed, with the optimal pair of definitions selected based on their mutual alignment in 3D space within 28,000 healthy subjects. Accordingly, the anatomical axis was defined as the vector from the apex to the spatial centre of the four valves, and the electrical axis as the direction of the maximum QRS dipole. Mean angular separation in 3D, ΔAE3D, was 145.0° ± 16.8° in the healthy cohort. The electrical axes exhibited a much larger variability, and strong evidence of anatomical-electrical coupling was identified. Increasing BMI notably affected the anatomical axis, rotating the heart more horizontally—a pattern mirrored by the electrical axis. Both axes were also significantly influenced by sex and, to a lesser extent, age. The axes were then studied in the sub-cohort of ~3,500 UK BioBank participants with primary hypertension, where a similar rotational pattern as that with increasing BMI was revealed. Finally, phenome-wide association studies in the 39,000 participants reveal associations between the axes angular metrics and phenotypes signalling an increased afterload, and an association to hypertension among other clinical conditions. These findings underscore the complex anatomical-electrical interplay and highlight the potential of cardiac axes biomarkers for an improved clinical ECG interpretation and disease characterisation.

                <p>by Laura Downie, Nuria Ferrandiz, Elizabeth Courthold, Megan Jones, Stephen J. Royle</p>

Membrane contact sites (MCSs) are areas of close proximity between organelles that allow the exchange of material, among other roles. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has MCSs with a variety of organelles in the cell. MCSs are dynamic, responding to changes in cell state, and are, therefore, best visualized through inducible labeling methods. However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here, we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed <i>LaBeRling</i>, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets, and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic human cells. LaBeRling is nondisruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells.

                <p>by Matthew D. Hurton, Jennifer M. Miller, Miler T. Lee</p>

After egg fertilization, an initially silent embryonic genome is transcriptionally activated during the maternal-to-zygotic transition. In zebrafish, maternal vertebrate pluripotency factors Nanog, Pou5f3 (OCT4 homolog), and Sox19b (SOX2 homolog) (NPS) play essential roles in orchestrating embryonic genome activation, acting as “pioneers” that open condensed chromatin and mediate acquisition of activating histone modifications. However, some embryonic gene transcription still occurs in the absence of these factors, suggesting the existence of other mechanisms regulating genome activation. To identify chromatin signatures of these unknown pathways, we profiled the histone modification landscape of zebrafish embryos using CUT&RUN. Our regulatory map revealed two subclasses of enhancers distinguished by presence or absence of H3K4me2. Enhancers lacking H3K4me2 tend to require NPS factors for de novo activation, while enhancers bearing H3K4me2 are epigenetically bookmarked by DNA hypomethylation to recapitulate gamete activity in the embryo, independent of NPS pioneering. Thus, parallel enhancer activation pathways combine to induce transcriptional reprogramming to pluripotency in the early embryo.

                <p>by Angus Leung, Ahmed Mahmoud, Travis Jeans, Ben D. Fulcher, Bruno van Swinderen, Naotsugu Tsuchiya</p>

The neural mechanisms of consciousness remain elusive. Previous studies on both human and non-human animals, through manipulation of level of conscious arousal, have reported that specific time-series features correlate with level of consciousness, such as spectral power in certain frequency bands. However, such features often lack principled, theoretical justifications as to why they should be related with level of consciousness. This raises two significant issues: firstly, many other types of times-series features which could also reflect conscious level have been ignored due to researcher biases toward specific analyses; and secondly, it is unclear how to interpret identified features to understand the neural activity underlying consciousness, especially when they are identified from recordings which summate activity across large areas such as electroencephalographic recordings. To address the first concern, here we propose a new approach: in the absence of any theoretical priors, we should be maximally agnostic and treat as many known features as feasible as equally promising candidates. To apply this approach, we use <i>h</i>ighly <i>c</i>omparative <i>t</i>ime-<i>s</i>eries <i>a</i>nalysis (<i>hctsa</i>), a toolbox which provides over 7,700 different univariate time-series features originating from different research fields. To address the second issue, we employ <i>hctsa</i> to high-quality neural recordings from a relatively simple brain, the fly brain (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), extracting features from local field potentials during wakefulness, general anesthesia, and sleep. At Stage 1 of this registered report, we constructed a classifier for each feature, for discriminating wakefulness and anesthesia in a discovery group of flies (<i>N</i> = 13). At Stage 2, we assessed their performances on four independent groups of evaluation flies, from which recordings were made during anesthesia and sleep, and which were originally blinded to the data analysis team (<i>N</i> = 49). We found only 47 time-series features, applied to recordings obtained from the center of the fly brain, to also significantly classify wake from anesthesia or sleep in all 4 of these evaluation datasets. Most of these were related to autocorrelation, and they indicated that signals during wakefulness remained correlated to their past for a longer timescale than during anesthesia and sleep. Meanwhile, time-series features related to well-known potential markers of consciousness, such as those related to complexity or spectral power, failed to generalize across all the flies. However, many of these complexity and spectral features have a consistent direction of effect due to anesthesia or sleep across flies, suggesting that even slight variations in experiment setup can reduce generalizability of classifiers. These results caution the current state of frequent discoveries of new potential consciousness markers, which may not generalize across datasets, and point to autocorrelation as a class of dynamical properties which does.

                Background In the Indian coastal state of Odisha, agriculture remains the primary livelihood, particularly paddy cultivation. However, traditional farming practices often result in inefficient resource use, particularly water. Given the state’s varied climatic zones and soil types, there is a pressing need for sustainable solutions. Precision agriculture, which utilizes advanced information technologies for decision-making, offers a pathway to enhance productivity while minimizing resource wastage. Methods This study applied machine learning (ML) and ensemble regression techniques to predict water usage for paddy cultivation in Odisha. The models were trained on a comprehensive dataset integrating remote sensing data, satellite imagery, historical weather records, soil profiles, and field-level observations. Various regression algorithms were used in ensemble combinations to enhance predictive accuracy and model robustness. Soil moisture, climatic conditions, and crop health indicators were continuously monitored using sensor-based and image-derived data. Results The ensemble regression models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with performance metrics exceeding 90% in forecasting optimal water usage. These predictions enabled precise water management tailored to specific agro-climatic zones within Odisha. Furthermore, the models effectively supported crop recommendation strategies based on soil and environmental parameters, ensuring optimal resource allocation. Conclusions The integration of ML and ensemble regression in precision agriculture significantly improves water use efficiency and supports data-driven farming in coastal Odisha. By enabling accurate predictions of water needs and crop suitability, these technologies contribute to maximizing yield, conserving natural resources, and fostering long-term sustainability. The findings emphasize the potential for scalable, technology-driven solutions to modernize traditional agricultural practices in resource-constrained environments.

                In this datanote we presented the data of 31 iRBD (idiopathic Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder) patients studied throughout three years to assess their eventual phenoconversion to Parkinson’s disease and other established neurodegenerative conditions. iRBD is a prodromal condition involved in the development of neurological pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease. In a previous study we evaluated transcription factor mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells as predictive biomarkers of phenoconversion in iRBD. We demonstrated that among the transcription factors mRNA levels analysed, STAT1, GATA3 and FOXP3 mRNA levels in CD4+ T cells may be used to predict phenoconversion.

                Background Areke is a popular traditional distilled beverage in semi-urban and rural areas in Ethiopia. Traditional areke distillation uses an open fire system which consumes a lot of firewood and produces a large amount of indoor air pollution. Methods The areke distiller apparatus (heat exchanger, condenser, energy-efficient stoves, storage tanks, and local areke extraction apparatus) was manufactured by technicians (welders). Different types of grains (wheat, millet, lupine, barley, and maize) were purchased at the neighborhood market. The traditional method of areke fermentation was prepared by an experienced woman brewer using a combination of ingredients using appropriate steps and procedures. The efficacy of a traditional stove, a modified stove, and a combination of a modified stove and double pipe were evaluated. The amount of ethanol was estimated by measuring the refractive index and specific gravity. Sensory evaluation of areke samples was evaluated by 10 consumer sensory panelists. Result The greatest ethanol concentration of the areke (53.75 ± 0.01 (% v/v)) was obtained from millet E (dagusa E) in double pipe distillation (E). The maize E (bekolo E) of overall acceptance had the greatest score (4.5 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. The alcoholic strength of lupine E ( gibeto E) was scored excellent (5.0 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. All of the judges agreed that traditional and double pipe areke consumption was acceptable. The combination of double pipe distillation and modified stove resulted in a 50% ± 0.15 reduction in the average amount of firewood used. The traditional open fire stove consumed more firewood (5.1 kg ± 0.1) than the combination of double pipe distillation and modified stove (2.5 kg ± 0.01). Conclusion These results indicate that the combination of double pipe distillation with modified stove had a better performance compared to the traditional Areke distillation.

                Teixeira et al. present UltraID-light-inducible protein aggregation (UltraID-LIPA), a technique that combines optogenetic induction of α-synuclein aggregation with proximity-based proteomics. This system enables high-resolution capture of early aggregation events in live cells and implicates known and novel endolysosomal proteins, offering a robust framework for dissecting early pathogenic mechanisms in synucleinopathies and guiding future innovations.

                SCN2A loss-of-function mutations are a high-risk factor for autism. Li et al. show that selective Scn2a deficiency in VTA dopaminergic neurons or global haploinsufficiency in Scn2a+/− mice causes dopamine system hypofunction. Levodopa treatment at an appropriate dosage can alleviate non-motor autistic-like behaviors, including insufficient anxiety and social deficits.

                Da Graça et al. identify ER-endosome contact sites as critical hubs for autophagosome biogenesis, where starvation triggers sequential endosome tethering to ER exit sites. This spatiotemporal coordination regulates Ca2+ signaling and phase separation, leading to the formation of nano-vesicles that seed phagophore initiation.

                BLIMP1 is expressed in a subset of GCBCs. Conter et al. have shown that BLIMP1 intrinsically regulates multiple key processes in GCBCs, including positive selection, cell-cycle progression, isotype switching, zonal localization, MBC differentiation, and transcriptional programming.

                Flaherty et al. demonstrate that the catalytic efficiency of METTL16 regulates expression of MAT2A to determine the intracellular SAM setpoint. Their data indicate that this is required for several SAM-dependent processes. Moreover, they show that hyperactive METTL16 is synthetically lethal with MTAP deletion, a common genetic abnormality in cancer.

                Neuroinflammation is central to Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Stephenson et al. establish that neutral lipid accumulation is necessary for microglial activation and that microglia expressing an Alzheimer’s risk gene hijack triglyceride biosynthesis to acquire a basal immune activated state. Targeting triglyceride metabolism can modulate immune reactivity and disease phenotypes.

                How high stand density and shade regulate cambial activity and wood formation in perennial trees remains unclear. Wei et al. demonstrate that, in Populus, the miR156-SPL module mediates shade-induced cytokinin reduction, leading to inhibition of cambial activity and xylem development under shade.
