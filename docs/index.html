              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16678">A unified model for the origins of spongiform degeneration and other neuropathological features in prion diseases</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.16678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decades after their initial observation in prion-infected brain tissues, the identities of virus-like dense particles, varicose tubules, and oval bodies containing parallel bands and fibrils have remained elusive. Our recent work revealed that a phenotype of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most notable for the perinuclear space (PNS), contributes to spongiform degeneration. To assess the significance of this phenotype for the etiology of prion diseases, we explored whether it can be functionally linked to other neuropathological hallmarks observed in these diseases, as this would indicate it to be a central event. Having surveyed the neuropathological record and other distant literature niches, we propose a model in which pathogenic forms of the prion protein poison raft domains, including essential Na+, K+-ATPases (NKAs) embedded within them, thereby triggering an ER-centered cellular rescue program coordinated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). The execution of this program stalls general protein synthesis, causing the deterioration of synaptic spines. As the disease progresses, cells selectively increase sterol biosynthesis, along with ribosome and ER biogenesis. These adaptive rescue attempts cause morphological changes to the ER which manifest as ER dilation or ER hypertrophy in a manner that is influenced by Ca2+ influx into the cell. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of mRNAs and tRNAs interrupts in late stage disease, thereby depriving ribosomes of supplies and inducing them to aggregate into a paracrystalline form. In support of this model, we share previously reported data, whose features are consistent with the interpretation that 1) the phenotype of ER dilation is observed in major prion diseases, 2) varicose tubules and oval bodies represent ER hypertrophy, and 3) virus-like dense particles are paracrystalline aggregates of inactive ribosomes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16997">Three mechanistically different variability and noise sources in the trial-to-trial fluctuations of responses to brain stimulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.16997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) are among the few directly observable responses to external brain stimulation and serve a variety of applications, often in the form of input-output (IO) curves. Previous statistical models with two variability sources inherently consider the small MEPs at the low-side plateau as part of the neural recruitment properties. However, recent studies demonstrated that small MEP responses under resting conditions are contaminated and over-shadowed by background noise of mostly technical quality, e.g., caused by the amplifier, and suggested that the neural recruitment curve should continue below this noise level. This work intends to separate physiological variability from background noise and improve the description of recruitment behaviour. We developed a triple-variability-source model around a logarithmic logistic function without a lower plateau and incorporated an additional source for background noise. Compared to models with two or fewer variability sources, our approach better described IO characteristics, evidenced by lower Bayesian Information Criterion scores across all subjects and pulse shapes. The model independently extracted hidden variability information across the stimulated neural system and isolated it from background noise, which led to an accurate estimation of the IO curve parameters. This new model offers a robust tool to analyse brain stimulation IO curves in clinical and experimental neuroscience and reduces the risk of spurious results from inappropriate statistical methods. The presented model together with the corresponding calibration method provides a more accurate representation of MEP responses and variability sources, advances our understanding of cortical excitability, and may improve the assessment of neuromodulation effects.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17043">Optimal signal transmission and timescale diversity in a model of human brain operating near criticality</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cortical neurons exhibit a hierarchy of timescales across brain regions in response to input stimuli, which is thought to be crucial for information processing of different temporal scales. Modeling studies suggest that both intra-regional circuit dynamics as well as cross-regional connectome may contribute to this timescale diversity. Equally important to diverse timescales is the ability to transmit sensory signals reliably across the whole brain. Therefore, the brain must be able to generate diverse timescales while simultaneously minimizing signal attenuation. To understand the dynamical mechanism behind these phenomena, we develop a second-order mean field model of the human brain by applying moment closure and coarse-graining to a digital twin brain model endowed with whole brain structural connectome. Cross-regional coupling strength is found to induced a phase transition from asynchronous activity to synchronous oscillation. By analyzing the input-response properties of the model, we reveal criticality as a unifying mechanism for enabling simultaneously optimal signal transmission and timescales diversity. We show how structural connectome and criticality jointly shape intrinsic timescale hierarchy across the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17296">Comparison of Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Eye Movements in Non-experts and the Skill Transfer Effects of Gaze Guidance and Annotation Guidance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for converting the tacit knowledge of experts into explicit knowledge have drawn increasing attention. Gaze data has emerged as a valuable approach in this effort. However, the effective transfer of tacit knowledge remains a challenge. No studies have directly compared the effects of gaze-based and annotation-based guidance or adequately examined their impacts on skill improvement after instruction. This study examined the effects of gaze and annotation guidance on the spatiotemporal characteristics of eye movements and the skill transfer of expert evaluation techniques in karate kata performances. 28 non-expert participants were assigned to three groups: a gaze guidance group, an annotation guidance group, and a control group. Participants were presented with instructional slideshows based on the expert's gaze data and annotations. Before and after instruction, participants were asked to evaluate karate kata performance videos performed by practitioners with different skill levels. The results showed that the annotation guidance group exhibited an effect of directing gaze toward the presented areas of focus, with a trend of increased total number of fixation areas. On the other hand, while the gaze guidance group was not encouraged to make fixations on multiple areas, the possibility of promoting peripheral vision was inferred based on measurements from the eye-tracking system. Regarding ranking results, 71.4% of participants in the gaze guidance group showed an improvement in ranking skills, with a trend toward better scoring ability compared to the other groups. This demonstrates the necessity of selecting appropriate methods based on instructional goals to transfer tacit knowledge effectively. Gaze-based instructional methods are expected to be versatile and applicable to karate kata and fields such as industry, medicine, and other sports.

                arXiv:2412.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although neuron models have been well-studied for their rich dynamics and biological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries that emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable neuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the strange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an asymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical non-chaotic Rulkov neurons. We discover a quasi-multistability in the system emerging from the existence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and quantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex fractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find that the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16773">Fast Multi-Group Gaussian Process Factor Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.16773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are now commonly used in dimensionality reduction approaches tailored to neuroscience, especially to describe changes in high-dimensional neural activity over time. As recording capabilities expand to include neuronal populations across multiple brain areas, cortical layers, and cell types, interest in extending Gaussian process factor models to characterize multi-population interactions has grown. However, the cubic runtime scaling of current methods with the length of experimental trials and the number of recorded populations (groups) precludes their application to large-scale multi-population recordings. Here, we improve this scaling from cubic to linear in both trial length and group number. We present two approximate approaches to fitting multi-group Gaussian process factor models based on (1) inducing variables and (2) the frequency domain. Empirically, both methods achieved orders of magnitude speed-up with minimal impact on statistical performance, in simulation and on neural recordings of hundreds of neurons across three brain areas. The frequency domain approach, in particular, consistently provided the greatest runtime benefits with the fewest trade-offs in statistical performance. We further characterize the estimation biases introduced by the frequency domain approach and demonstrate effective strategies to mitigate them. This work enables a powerful class of analysis techniques to keep pace with the growing scale of multi-population recordings, opening new avenues for exploring brain function.

                arXiv:2412.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech brain-computer interfaces aim to decipher what a person is trying to say from neural activity alone, restoring communication to people with paralysis who have lost the ability to speak intelligibly. The Brain-to-Text Benchmark '24 and associated competition was created to foster the advancement of decoding algorithms that convert neural activity to text. Here, we summarize the lessons learned from the competition ending on June 1, 2024 (the top 4 entrants also presented their experiences in a recorded webinar). The largest improvements in accuracy were achieved using an ensembling approach, where the output of multiple independent decoders was merged using a fine-tuned large language model (an approach used by all 3 top entrants). Performance gains were also found by improving how the baseline recurrent neural network (RNN) model was trained, including by optimizing learning rate scheduling and by using a diphone training objective. Improving upon the model architecture itself proved more difficult, however, with attempts to use deep state space models or transformers not yet appearing to offer a benefit over the RNN baseline. The benchmark will remain open indefinitely to support further work towards increasing the accuracy of brain-to-text algorithms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17273">The Hydrodynamic Limit of Neural Networks with Balanced Excitation and Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of `Balanced Neural Networks' is a very popular explanation for the high degree of variability and stochasticity in the brain's activity. We determine equations for the hydrodynamic limit of a balanced all-to-all network of 2n neurons for asymptotically large n. The neurons are divided into two classes (excitatory and inhibitory). Each excitatory neuron excites every other neuron, and each inhibitory neuron inhibits all of the other neurons. The model is of a stochastic hybrid nature, such that the synaptic response of each neuron is governed by an ordinary differential equation. The effect of neuron j on neuron k is dictated by a spiking Poisson Process, with intensity given by a sigmoidal function of the synaptic potentiation of neuron j. The interactions are scaled by n^{-1/2} , which is much stronger than the n^{-1} scaling of classical interacting particle systems. We demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the system does not blow up as n asymptotes to infinity because the network activity is balanced between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The limiting population dynamics is proved to be Gaussian: with the mean determined by the balanced between excitation and inhibition, and the variance determined by the Central Limit Theorem for inhomogeneous Poisson Processes. The limiting equations can thus be expressed as autonomous Ordinary Differential Equations for the means and variances.

Abstract: It has been proposed that information sharing, which is a ubiquitous and consequential behavior, plays a critical role in cultivating and maintaining a sense of shared reality. Across three studies, we tested this theory by investigating whether or not people are especially likely to share information that they believe will be interpreted similarly by others in their social circles. Using neuroimaging while members of the same community viewed brief film clips, we found that more similar neural responding of participants was associated with a greater likelihood to share content. We then tested this relationship using two behavioral studies and found (1) that people were particularly likely to share content that they believed others in their social circles would interpret similarly and (2) that perceived similarity with others leads to increased sharing likelihood. In concert, our findings support the idea that people are driven to share information to create and reinforce shared understanding, which is critical to social connection.

                arXiv:2405.01385v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are the primary treatment for epilepsy, yet medication tapering effects have not been investigated in a dose, region, and time-dependent manner, despite their potential impact on research and clinical practice.
  We examined over 3000 hours of intracranial EEG recordings in 32 subjects during long-term monitoring, of which 22 underwent concurrent ASM tapering. We estimated ASM plasma levels based on known pharmaco-kinetics of all the major ASM types.
  We found an overall decrease in the power of delta band activity around the period of maximum medication withdrawal in most (80%) subjects, independent of their epilepsy type or medication combination. The degree of withdrawal correlated positively with the magnitude of delta power decrease. This dose-dependent effect was evident across all recorded cortical regions during daytime; but not in sub-cortical regions, or during night time. We found no evidence of a differential effect in seizure onset, spiking, or pathological brain regions.
  The finding of decreased delta band power during ASM tapering agrees with previous literature. Our observed dose-dependent effect indicates that monitoring ASM levels in cortical regions may be feasible for applications such as medication reminder systems, or closed-loop ASM delivery systems. ASMs are also used in other neurological and psychiatric conditions, making our findings relevant to a general neuroscience and neurology audience.

Abstract: Graph theory is now becoming a standard tool in system-level neuroscience. However, endowing observed brain anatomy and dynamics with a complex network structure does not entail that the brain actually works as a network. Asking whether the brain behaves as a network means asking whether network properties count. From the viewpoint of neurophysiology and, possibly, of brain physics, the most substantial issues a network structure may be instrumental in addressing relate to the influence of network properties on brain dynamics and to whether these properties ultimately explain some aspects of brain function. Here, we address the dynamical implications of complex network, examining which aspects and scales of brain activity may be understood to genuinely behave as a network. To do so, we first define the meaning of networkness, and analyse some of its implications. We then examine ways in which brain anatomy and dynamics can be endowed with a network structure and discuss possible ways in which network structure may be shown to represent a genuine organisational principle of brain activity, rather than just a convenient description of its anatomy and dynamics.

Abstract: Conservation is a critical milestone of cognitive development considered to be supported by both the understanding of quantitative concepts and the reversibility of mental operations. To assess whether this critical component of human intelligence has emerged in Vision Language Models, we have curated the ConserveBench, a battery of 365 cognitive experiments across four dimensions of physical quantities: volume, solid quantity, length, and number. The former two involve only transformational tasks, whereas the latter two involve non-transformational tasks assessing the understanding of quantitative concepts alone. Surprisingly, we find that while Vision Language Models are generally capable of conserving, they tend to fail at non-transformational tasks whose successes are typically considered to be evidence of the ability to conserve. This implies that the law of conservation, at least in concrete domains, may exist without corresponding conceptual understanding of quantity. $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/pages/Conservation/}{Website}$

                arXiv:2412.02078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the application of brain-computer interface (BCI), while pursuing accurate decoding of brain signals, we also need consider the computational efficiency of BCI devices. ECoG signals are multi-channel temporal signals which is collected using a high-density electrode array at a high sampling frequency. The data between channels has a high similarity or redundancy in the temporal domain. The redundancy of data not only reduces the computational efficiency of the model, but also overwhelms the extraction of effective features, resulting in a decrease in performance. How to efficiently utilize ECoG multi-channel signals is one of the research topics. Effective channel screening or compression can greatly reduce the model size, thereby improving computational efficiency, this would be a good direction to solve the problem. Based on previous work [1], this paper proposes a very simple channel compression method, which uses a learnable matrix to perform matrix multiplication on the original channels, that is, assigning weights to the channels and then linearly add them up. This effectively reduces the number of final channels. In the experiment, we used the vision-based ECoG multi-classification dataset owned by our laboratory to test the proposed channel selection (compression) method. We found that the new method can compress the original 128-channel ECoG signal to 32 channels (of which subject MonJ is compressed to 8 channels), greatly reducing the size of the model. The demand for GPU memory resources during model training is reduced by about 68.57%, 84.33% for each subject respectively; the model training speed also increased up around 3.82, 4.65 times of the original speed for each subject respectively. More importantly, the performance of the model has improved by about 1.10% compared with our previous work, reached the SOTA level of our unique visual based ECoG dataset

                arXiv:2410.24070v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems have become a popular tool in both neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Having measures to compare how similar activations of neurons are across conditions, architectures, and species, gives us a scalable way of learning how information is transformed within different neural networks. In contrast to this trend, recent investigations have revealed how some metrics can respond to spurious signals and hence give misleading results. To identify the most reliable metric and understand how measures could be improved, it is going to be important to identify specific test cases which can serve as benchmarks. Here we propose that the phenomena of compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allows us to build a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. By implementing this case, we show it enables us to test whether metrics can identify representations which gradually develop throughout learning and probe whether representations identified by metrics are relevant to computations executed by networks. By building both an attractor- and RNN-based test case, we show that the new Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and identifies behaviorally relevant representations more reliably than prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also show how test cases can be used beyond evaluating metrics to study new architectures. Specifically, results from applying DSA to modern (Mamba) state space models, suggest that, in contrast to RNNs, these models may not exhibit changes to their recurrent dynamics due to their expressiveness. Overall, by developing test cases, we show DSA's exceptional ability to detect compositional dynamical motifs, thereby enhancing our understanding of how computations unfold in RNNs.

Abstract: Statistical physics provides tools for analyzing high-dimensional problems in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. These calculations, particularly those using the replica method, often involve lengthy derivations that can obscure physical interpretation. We give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Specifically, we introduce a cavity approach to analyzing high-dimensional learning problems and apply it to three cases: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure -- a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables -- enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a na\"ive method. These results match those obtained through the replica method.

Abstract: We present a Python package together with a practical guide for the implementation of a lightweight diversity-enhanced genetic algorithm (GA) approach for the exploration of multi-dimensional parameter spaces. Searching a parameter space for regions with desirable properties, e.g. compatibility with experimental data, poses a type of optimization problem wherein the focus lies on pinpointing all "good enough" solutions, rather than a single "best solution". Our approach dramatically outperforms random scans and other GA-based implementations in this aspect. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to a particle physics problem, showcasing its ability to identify promising parameter points in isolated, viable regions meeting experimental constraints. The companion Python package is applicable to optimization problems beyond those considered in this work, including scanning over discrete parameters (categories). A detailed guide for its usage is provided.

                arXiv:2412.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog circuit design can be considered as an optimization problem with the targeted circuit specifications as constraints. When stringent circuit specifications are considered, it is desired to have an optimization methodology that adapts well to heavily constrained search spaces. To this end, we propose a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm with a tiered ensemble of acquisition functions and demonstrate its considerable application potential for analog circuit design automation. Our method is the first to introduce the concept of multiple dominance among acquisition functions, allowing the search for the optimal solutions to be effectively bounded \emph{within} the predicted set of feasible solutions in a constrained search space. This has resulted in a significant reduction in constraint violations by the candidate solutions, leading to better-optimized designs within tight computational budgets. The methodology is validated in gain and area optimization of a two-stage Miller compensated operational amplifier in a 65 nm technology. In comparison to robust baselines and state-of-the-art algorithms, this method reduces constraint violations by up to 38% and improves the target objective by up to 43%. The source code of our algorithm is made available at https://github.com/riarashid/TRACE.

                arXiv:2412.17629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we reveal the intrinsic duality between graph neural networks (GNNs) and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), bridging two traditionally distinct fields. Building on this insight, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel evolutionary algorithm that models individuals as nodes in a graph and leverages designed frequency-domain filters to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Through the use of these filters, GNE aggregates high-frequency (diversity-enhancing) and low-frequency (stability-promoting) information, transforming EAs into interpretable and tunable mechanisms in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on benchmark functions demonstrate that GNE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as GA, DE, CMA-ES, SDAES, and RL-SHADE, excelling in complex landscapes, optimal solution shifts, and noisy environments. Its robustness, adaptability, and superior convergence highlight its practical and theoretical value. Beyond optimization, GNE establishes a conceptual and mathematical foundation linking EAs and GNNs, offering new perspectives for both fields. Its framework encourages the development of task-adaptive filters and hybrid approaches for EAs, while its insights can inspire advances in GNNs, such as improved global information propagation and mitigation of oversmoothing. GNE's versatility extends to solving challenges in machine learning, including hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search, as well as real-world applications in engineering and operations research. By uniting the dynamics of EAs with the structural insights of GNNs, this work provides a foundation for interdisciplinary innovation, paving the way for scalable and interpretable solutions to complex optimization problems.

                arXiv:2412.16219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are seen as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), but the performance gap remains a challenge. While this gap is narrowing through ANN-to-SNN conversion, substantial computational resources are still needed, and the energy efficiency of converted SNNs cannot be ensured. To address this, we present a unified training-free conversion framework that significantly enhances both the performance and efficiency of converted SNNs. Inspired by the biological nervous system, we propose a novel Adaptive-Firing Neuron Model (AdaFire), which dynamically adjusts firing patterns across different layers to substantially reduce the Unevenness Error - the primary source of error of converted SNNs within limited inference timesteps. We further introduce two efficiency-enhancing techniques: the Sensitivity Spike Compression (SSC) technique for reducing spike operations, and the Input-aware Adaptive Timesteps (IAT) technique for decreasing latency. These methods collectively enable our approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance while delivering significant energy savings of up to 70.1%, 60.3%, and 43.1% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, respectively. Extensive experiments across 2D, 3D, event-driven classification tasks, object detection, and segmentation tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various domains.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16842">Graph Learning-based Regional Heavy Rainfall Prediction Using Low-Cost Rain Gauges</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.16842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and timely prediction of heavy rainfall events is crucial for effective flood risk management and disaster preparedness. By monitoring, analysing, and evaluating rainfall data at a local level, it is not only possible to take effective actions to prevent any severe climate variation but also to improve the planning of surface and underground hydrological resources. However, developing countries often lack the weather stations to collect data continuously due to the high cost of installation and maintenance. In light of this, the contribution of the present paper is twofold: first, we propose a low-cost IoT system for automatic recording, monitoring, and prediction of rainfall in rural regions. Second, we propose a novel approach to regional heavy rainfall prediction by implementing graph neural networks (GNNs), which are particularly well-suited for capturing the complex spatial dependencies inherent in rainfall patterns. The proposed approach was tested using a historical dataset spanning 72 months, with daily measurements, and experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in predicting heavy rainfall events, making this approach particularly attractive for regions with limited resources or where traditional weather radar or station coverage is sparse.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems use specialized agents to handle tasks within complex workflows, enabling automation and efficiency. However, optimizing these systems often requires labor-intensive, manual adjustments to refine roles, tasks, and interactions. This paper introduces a framework for autonomously optimizing Agentic AI solutions across industries, such as NLP-driven enterprise applications. The system employs agents for Refinement, Execution, Evaluation, Modification, and Documentation, leveraging iterative feedback loops powered by an LLM (Llama 3.2-3B). The framework achieves optimal performance without human input by autonomously generating and testing hypotheses to improve system configurations. This approach enhances scalability and adaptability, offering a robust solution for real-world applications in dynamic environments. Case studies across diverse domains illustrate the transformative impact of this framework, showcasing significant improvements in output quality, relevance, and actionability.

Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17312">Improving Pareto Set Learning for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization via Stein Variational Hypernetworks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs) are common in real-world scenarios where evaluating objective functions is costly and involves extensive computations or physical experiments. Current Pareto set learning methods for such problems often rely on surrogate models like Gaussian processes to approximate the objective functions. These surrogate models can become fragmented, resulting in numerous small uncertain regions between explored solutions. When using acquisition functions such as the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), these uncertain regions can turn into pseudo-local optima, complicating the search for globally optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SVH-PSL, which integrates Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) with Hypernetworks for efficient Pareto set learning. Our method addresses the issues of fragmented surrogate models and pseudo-local optima by collectively moving particles in a manner that smooths out the solution space. The particles interact with each other through a kernel function, which helps maintain diversity and encourages the exploration of underexplored regions. This kernel-based interaction prevents particles from clustering around pseudo-local optima and promotes convergence towards globally optimal solutions. Our approach aims to establish robust relationships between trade-off reference vectors and their corresponding true Pareto solutions, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. Through extensive experiments across both synthetic and real-world MOO benchmarks, we demonstrate that SVH-PSL significantly improves the quality of the learned Pareto set, offering a promising solution for expensive multi-objective optimization problems.

                arXiv:2412.17411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty calibration, the process of aligning confidence with accuracy, is a hallmark of human intelligence. However, most machine learning models struggle to achieve this alignment, particularly when the training dataset is small relative to the network's capacity. Here, we demonstrate that uncertainty calibration can be effectively achieved through a pretraining method inspired by developmental neuroscience. Specifically, training with random noise before data training allows neural networks to calibrate their uncertainty, ensuring that confidence levels are aligned with actual accuracy. We show that randomly initialized, untrained networks tend to exhibit erroneously high confidence, but pretraining with random noise effectively calibrates these networks, bringing their confidence down to chance levels across input spaces. As a result, networks pretrained with random noise exhibit optimal calibration, with confidence closely aligned with accuracy throughout subsequent data training. These pre-calibrated networks also perform better at identifying "unknown data" by exhibiting lower confidence for out-of-distribution samples. Our findings provide a fundamental solution for uncertainty calibration in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution contexts.

Abstract: Variational quantum circuits have arisen as an important method in quantum computing. A crucial step of it is parameter optimization, which is typically tackled through gradient-descent techniques. We advantageously explore instead the use of evolutionary algorithms for such optimization, specifically for time-series forecasting. We perform a comparison, for diverse instances of real-world data, between gradient-descent parameter optimization and covariant-matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. We observe that gradient descent becomes permanently trapped in local minima that have been avoided by evolutionary algorithms in all tested datasets, reaching up to a six-fold decrease in prediction error. Finally, the combined use of evolutionary and gradient-based techniques is explored, aiming at retaining advantages of both. The results are particularly applicable in scenarios sensitive to gains in accuracy.

Abstract: To develop a preliminary understanding towards Graph Foundation Models, we study the extent to which pretrained Graph Neural Networks can be applied across datasets, an effort requiring to be agnostic to dataset-specific features and their encodings. We build upon a purely structural pretraining approach and propose an extension to capture feature information while still being feature-agnostic. We evaluate pretrained models on downstream tasks for varying amounts of training samples and choices of pretraining datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that embeddings from pretrained models improve generalization only with enough downstream data points and in a degree which depends on the quantity and properties of pretraining data. Feature information can lead to improvements, but currently requires some similarities between pretraining and downstream feature spaces.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17654">Enhanced Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks for Static Object Detection Using 3D Convolutions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a class of network models capable of processing spatiotemporal information, with event-driven characteristics and energy efficiency advantages. Recently, directly trained SNNs have shown potential to match or surpass the performance of traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in classification tasks. However, in object detection tasks, directly trained SNNs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to ANNs when tested on frame-based static object datasets (such as COCO2017). Therefore, bridging this performance gap and enabling directly trained SNNs to achieve performance comparable to ANNs on these static datasets has become one of the key challenges in the development of SNNs.To address this challenge, this paper focuses on enhancing the SNN's unique ability to process spatiotemporal information. Spiking neurons, as the core components of SNNs, facilitate the exchange of information between different temporal channels during the process of converting input floating-point data into binary spike signals. However, existing neuron models still have certain limitations in the communication of temporal information. Some studies have even suggested that disabling the backpropagation in the time dimension during SNN training can still yield good training results. To improve the SNN handling of temporal information, this paper proposes replacing traditional 2D convolutions with 3D convolutions, thus directly incorporating temporal information into the convolutional process. Additionally, temporal information recurrence mechanism is introduced within the neurons to further enhance the neurons' efficiency in utilizing temporal information.Experimental results show that the proposed method enables directly trained SNNs to achieve performance levels comparable to ANNs on the COCO2017 and VOC datasets.

                arXiv:2412.17799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life, Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway's Game of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human ingenuity alone.

                arXiv:2304.09599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have emerged as a powerful framework for optimization, especially for black-box optimization. Existing evolutionary algorithms struggle to comprehend and effectively utilize task-specific information for adjusting their optimization strategies, leading to subpar performance on target tasks. Moreover, optimization strategies devised by experts tend to be highly biased. These challenges significantly impede the progress of the field of evolutionary computation. Therefore, this paper first introduces the concept of Automated EA: Automated EA exploits structure in the problem of interest to automatically generate update rules (optimization strategies) for generating and selecting potential solutions so that it can move a random population near the optimal solution. However, current EAs cannot achieve this goal due to the poor representation of the optimization strategy and the weak interaction between the optimization strategy and the target task. We design a deep evolutionary convolution network (DECN) to realize the move from hand-designed EAs to automated EAs without manual interventions. DECN has high adaptability to the target task and can obtain better solutions with less computational cost. DECN is also able to effectively utilize the low-fidelity information of the target task to form an efficient optimization strategy. The experiments on nine synthetics and two real-world cases show the advantages of learned optimization strategies over the state-of-the-art human-designed and meta-learning EA baselines. In addition, due to the tensorization of the operations, DECN is friendly to the acceleration provided by GPUs and runs 102 times faster than EA.

                arXiv:2205.08645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In living organisms, homeostasis is the natural regulation of internal states aimed at maintaining conditions compatible with life. Typical artificial systems are not equipped with comparable regulatory features. Here, we introduce an artificial neural network that incorporates homeostatic features. Its own computing substrate is placed in a needful and vulnerable relation to the very objects over which it computes. For example, artificial neurons performing classification of MNIST digits or Fashion-MNIST articles of clothing may receive excitatory or inhibitory effects, which alter their own learning rate as a direct result of perceiving and classifying the digits. In this scenario, accurate recognition is desirable to the agent itself because it guides decisions to regulate its vulnerable internal states and functionality. Counterintuitively, the addition of vulnerability to a learner does not necessarily impair its performance. On the contrary, self-regulation in response to vulnerability confers benefits under certain conditions. We show that homeostatic design confers increased adaptability under concept shift, in which the relationships between labels and data change over time, and that the greatest advantages are obtained under the highest rates of shift. This necessitates the rapid un-learning of past associations and the re-learning of new ones. We also demonstrate the superior abilities of homeostatic learners in environments with dynamically changing rates of concept shift. Our homeostatic design exposes the artificial neural network's thinking machinery to the consequences of its own "thoughts", illustrating the advantage of putting one's own "skin in the game" to improve fluid intelligence.

Termed Chebyshev Feature Neural Network (CFNN), the new structure employs Chebyshev functions with learnable frequencies as the first hidden layer, followed by the standard fully connected hidden layers. The learnable frequencies of the Chebyshev layer are initialized with exponential distributions to cover a wide range of frequencies. Combined with a multi-stage training strategy, we demonstrate that this CFNN structure can achieve machine accuracy during training. A comprehensive set of numerical examples for dimensions up to $20$ are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the method.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural oscillations are fundamental for brain function and govern various cognitive processes. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging advances offer the opportunity to study frequency-specific properties of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations at multiple frequency bands. However, most have focused on spontaneous brain activity in the resting state, leaving a gap in direct evidence regarding the specific activations of cognitive tasks across different frequency bands. We aim to address this gap by exploring the role of blood-oxygen-level-dependent oscillations across multiple frequency bands in cognitive processes. We used task-functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 339 healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project to map the activation patterns of performing seven cognitive tasks at multiple frequency bands (ie slow-1 to slow-6). Our findings revealed that different frequency bands are associated with distinct task-activation patterns. Specifically, slow-1/2/3 oscillations primarily contribute to local sensory information processing, while slow-4 is crucial for various fundamental cognitive functions. Slow-5 is involved in cognitive processes that require greater memory load, integrated cognitive processing, and attention maintenance. This underscores the importance of analyzing a broad frequency range to capture the full spectrum of cognitive function, highlighting the diverse roles of different frequency bands in brain activity, shedding light on the underlying mechanism of brain–behavior associations.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In this study, we explored the relationship between developmental differences in gray matter structure and grammar learning ability in 159 Dutch-speaking individuals (8 to 25 yr). The data were collected as part of a recent large-scale functional MRI study (Menks WM, Ekerdt C, Lemhöfer K, Kidd E, Fernández G, McQueen JM, Janzen G. Developmental changes in brain activation during novel grammar learning in 8–25-year-olds. Dev Cogn Neurosci. 2024;66:101347. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101347">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2024.101347</a>) in which participants implicitly learned Icelandic morphosyntactic rules and performed a grammaticality judgment task in the scanner. Behaviorally, Menks et al. (2024) showed that grammaticality judgment task performance increased steadily from 8 to 15.4 yr, after which age had no further effect. We show in the current study that this age-related grammaticality judgment task performance was negatively related to cortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness in many clusters throughout the brain. Hippocampal volume was positively related to age-related grammaticality judgment task performance and L2 (English) vocabulary knowledge. Furthermore, we found that grammaticality judgment task performance, L2 grammar proficiency, and L2 vocabulary knowledge were positively related to gray matter maturation within parietal regions, overlapping with the functional MRI clusters that were reported previously in Menks et al. (2024) and which showed increased brain activation in relation to grammar learning. We propose that this overlap in functional and structural results indicates that brain maturation in parietal regions plays an important role in second language learning.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Understanding the goal of an observed action requires computing representations that are invariant to specific instantiations of the action. For example, we can accurately infer the goal of an action even when the agent’s desired outcome is not achieved. Observing actions consistently recruits a set of frontoparietal and posterior temporal regions, often labeled the “action observation network.” While progress has been made in charting which regions of the action observation network are involved in understanding goals of observed actions, it is not clear where goals are represented independently of outcomes. We used functional magnetic resonance-based multivariate pattern analysis to identify such regions. Human participants (20 females, 12 males) watched videos of successful and failed attempts of actions with different goals involving two different object types. We found that the bilateral anterior inferior parietal lobe and the right ventral premotor cortex distinguished between object-specific action goals regardless of outcomes. The left anterior inferior parietal lobe encodes action goals regardless of both outcomes and object types. Our results provide insights into the neural basis of representing action goals and the different roles of frontoparietal and posterior temporal regions in action understanding.</span>

In an fMRI study of sentence production, we investigated the brain representations for compositional processing during speaking.

With voxel-wise encoding models, we probed the specificity of the compositional structure built during the production of each sentence, comparing an unstructured model of word meaning without relational information with a model that encodes abstract thematic relations and a model encoding event-specific relational structure. Whole-brain analyses revealed that sentence meaning at different levels of specificity was encoded in a large left frontal-parietal-temporal network. A comparison with semantic structures composed during the comprehension of the same sentences showed similarly distributed brain activity patterns. An ROI analysis over left fronto-temporal language parcels showed that event-specific relational structure above word-specific information was encoded in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Overall, we found evidence for the encoding of sentence meaning during sentence production in a distributed brain network and for the encoding of event-specific semantic structures in the left inferior frontal gyrus.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The cerebral cortex is critical for advanced cognitive functions and relies on a vast network of neurons to carry out its highly intricate neural tasks. Generating cortical neurons in accurate numbers hinges on cell signaling orchestrated by primary cilia to coordinate the proliferation and differentiation of cortical stem cells. While recent research has shed light on multiple ciliary roles in corticogenesis, specific mechanisms downstream of cilia signaling remain largely unexplored. We previously showed that an excess of early-born cortical neurons in mice mutant for the ciliary gene <span style="font-style:italic;">Inpp5e</span> was rescued by re-introducing Gli3 repressor. By comparing expression profiles between <span style="font-style:italic;">Inpp5e</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Gli3</span> mutants, we here identified novel Gli3 target genes. This approach highlighted the transcription factor gene <span style="font-style:italic;">Sall3</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Pappalysin1</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Pappa</span>), a metalloproteinase involved in IGF signaling, as upregulated genes in both mutants. Further examination revealed that Gli3 directly binds to <span style="font-style:italic;">Sall3</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Pappa</span> enhancers and suppresses their activity in the dorsal telencephalon. Collectively, our analyses provide important mechanistic insights into how primary cilia govern the behavior of neural stem cells, ultimately ensuring the production of adequate numbers of neurons during corticogenesis.</span>

                Background The approach to estimating mandibular age has been widely used, although it has shown age estimation disparities in diverse populations, including Indians. Objective Our goal was to test the Demirjian 8-teeth approach utilizing orthopantomogram to estimate age reliably after incorporating the third molar. We also used Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations to estimate age estimation accuracy in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Methods The retrospective study included 196 people. Individuals were 8–24 years old. The left mandibular teeth were staged using an orthopantomographs utilizing the Demirjian 8-teeth approach. The Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression models determined dental age, and statistical methods compared dental age to chronological age. Results The gender breakdown was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. Gender did not significantly affect chronological mean age or estimated mean age (13.39±3.77 vs. 13.10±3.51, p = 0.583; 11.75±2.92 vs. 11.58±2.70, p = 0.674). Statistically substantial differences in chronological and estimated mean ages between male and female individuals (p<0.001). Out of the total participants, 31.6% had a difference in age of ±1 year, 30.6% had a difference of 1-2 years, and 37.8% had a difference of more than 2 years. Compared to chronological and estimated ages, these variations in age between males and females were not statistically significant (p=0.557). Conclusions The findings of this study support the use of Demirjian’s 8-teeth approach in the Saudi population residing in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, employing Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations.

                Abstract Introduction Preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL), part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, involves giving carbohydrate-rich liquids before surgery instead of traditional fasting. It improves glucose control, reduces insulin resistance, and enhances patient comfort. Methods A comprehensive scoping review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies from 2017 to 2024. Primary, English-language clinical trial involving pediatric patients were included without restrictions on surgical procedure, or outcomes. Data extraction was focused on sample sizes, PCL types, and perioperative outcomes. Results The scoping review examined 11 studies on PCL in pediatric surgery, covering various procedures with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 1200 participants. Most studies indicated metabolic benefits, with 7 out of 11 showing stabilized blood glucose and reduced hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, 5 studies associated PCL with reduced preoperative anxiety, agitation, and discomfort, including thirst and hunger. For stomach content, 5 studies showed PCL reduced gastric residual volume and improved pH. Postoperative findings were mixed: 4 studies found no significant difference in nausea and vomiting, while 2 suggested benefits. Length of hospital stay from 3 studies showed no clinical difference results. Conclusions PCL in pediatric surgery shows potential to stabilize blood glucose, reduce metabolic risks, and improve recovery. However, the evidence regarding outcomes such as length of hospital stay and postoperative complications remains inconsistent, indicating the need for further investigation.

                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                Objectives To investigate the impact of electroacupuncture on cognitive function, quality of life (QoL), and depression severity in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods This double-blinded randomized controlled trial included 60 participants aged 18-55 with cognitive symptoms related to MDD at Thammasat University Hospital. Participants were divided into two groups: the electroacupuncture group combined with standard antidepressant treatment (EG; n=30) and the control group receiving standard care with placebo acupuncture (CG; n=30). The study assessed 1) executive functions using the Trail making test- B and Stroop Color and Word Test, 2) delayed recall, and 3) subjective cognitive complaint and Quality of life (QoL) using WHODAS 2.0. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Thai version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Baseline and post-intervention assessments were conducted over 10 weeks. Mann-Whitney U test analyzed treatment effects by comparing median differences between groups. Results Both groups exhibited similar demographics and cognitive traits. Cognitive improvement was observed in both groups at the endpoint. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significantly higher median scores for subjective cognitive complaints in the EG compared to the CG (EG: Median = 5.5, CG: Median = 0.0, p=0.049). No serious side effects were identified from either electroacupuncture or placebo acupuncture. Conclusions Electroacupuncture improved subjective complaints in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, but did not show effects on specific cognitive functions, QoL, or depressive symptoms. This study provides initial evidence supporting the potential of electroacupuncture in MDD patients with cognitive symptoms, suggesting opportunities for further research.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                <p>by Hyeontae Jo, Sung Woong Cho, Hyung Ju Hwang</p>

Differential equations are pivotal in modeling and understanding the dynamics of various systems, as they offer insights into their future states through parameter estimation fitted to time series data. In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). RCS data showed that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of RCS data over time, Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, and Bayesian-based methods, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method called Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD) that provides accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimizes the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, thereby demonstrating the ability of the proposed method in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions over a normal distribution. These results address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data. Therefore, EPD marks a significant advancement in accurately modeling systems with RCS data, realizing a deeper understanding of system dynamics and parameter variability.

Monitoring the spread of infectious disease is essential to design and adjust the interventions timely for the prevention of the epidemic outbreak and safeguarding the public health. The governments have generally adopted the incidence-based statistical method to estimate the time-varying effective reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> and evaluate the transmission ability of epidemics. However, this method exhibits biases arising from the reported incidence data and assumes the generation interval distribution which is not available at the early stage of epidemic. Recent studies showed that the viral loads characterized by cycle threshold (Ct) of the infected populations evolving throughout the course of epidemic and providing a possibility to infer the epidemic trajectory. In this work, we propose the Cycle Threshold-based Transformer (Ct-Transformer) to estimate <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>. We find the supervised learning of Ct-Transformer outperforms the traditional incidence-based statistic and Ct-based <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> estimating methods, and more importantly Ct-Transformer is robustness to the detection resources. Further, we apply the proposed model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and obtain excellent fine-tuning performance, which attains comparable performance with the supervised Ct-Transformer, verified by both the synthetic and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that the Ct-based deep learning method can improve the real-time estimates of <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, enabling more easily adapted to the track of the newly emerged epidemic.

The brain’s complex distributed dynamics are typically quantified using a limited set of manually selected statistical properties, leaving the possibility that alternative dynamical properties may outperform those reported for a given application. Here, we address this limitation by systematically comparing diverse, interpretable features of both intra-regional activity and inter-regional functional coupling from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data, demonstrating our method using case–control comparisons of four neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings generally support the use of linear time-series analysis techniques for rs-fMRI case–control analyses, while also identifying new ways to quantify informative dynamical fMRI structures. While simple statistical representations of fMRI dynamics performed surprisingly well (e.g., properties within a single brain region), combining intra-regional properties with inter-regional coupling generally improved performance, underscoring the distributed, multifaceted changes to fMRI dynamics in neuropsychiatric disorders. The comprehensive, data-driven method introduced here enables systematic identification and interpretation of quantitative dynamical signatures of multivariate time-series data, with applicability beyond neuroimaging to diverse scientific problems involving complex time-varying systems.

Accurate estimates of the incidence of infectious diseases are key for the control of epidemics. However, healthcare systems are often unable to test the population exhaustively, especially when asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases are widespread; this leads to significant and systematic under-reporting of the real incidence. Here, we propose a machine learning approach to estimate the incidence of a pandemic in real-time, using reported cases and the overall test rate. In particular, we use Bayesian symbolic regression to automatically learn the closed-form mathematical models that most parsimoniously describe incidence. We develop and validate our models using COVID-19 incidence values for nine different countries, confirming their ability to accurately predict daily incidence. Remarkably, despite the differences in epidemic trajectories and dynamics across countries, we find that a single model for all countries offers a more parsimonious description and is more predictive of actual incidence compared to separate models for each country. Our results show the potential to accurately model incidence in real-time using closed-form mathematical models, providing a valuable tool for public health decision-makers.

                <p>by Juliana Chase, Liyu Xia, Lung-Hao Tai, Wan Chen Lin, Anne G. E. Collins, Linda Wilbrecht</p>

Computational modeling has revealed that human research participants use both rapid working memory (WM) and incremental reinforcement learning (RL) (RL+WM) to solve a simple instrumental learning task, relying on WM when the number of stimuli is small and supplementing with RL when the number of stimuli exceeds WM capacity. Inspired by this work, we examined which learning systems and strategies are used by adolescent and adult mice when they first acquire a conditional associative learning task. In a version of the human RL+WM task translated for rodents, mice were required to associate odor stimuli (from a set of 2 or 4 odors) with a left or right port to receive reward. Using logistic regression and computational models to analyze the first 200 trials per odor, we determined that mice used both incremental RL and stimulus-insensitive, one-back strategies to solve the task. While these one-back strategies may be a simple form of short-term or working memory, they did not approximate the boost to learning performance that has been observed in human participants using WM in a comparable task. Adolescent and adult mice also showed comparable performance, with no change in learning rate or softmax beta parameters with adolescent development and task experience. However, reliance on a one-back perseverative, win-stay strategy increased with development in males in both odor set sizes, but was not dependent on gonadal hormones. Our findings advance a simple conditional associative learning task and new models to enable the isolation and quantification of reinforcement learning alongside other strategies mice use while learning to associate stimuli with rewards within a single behavioral session. These data and methods can inform and aid comparative study of reinforcement learning across species.

                <p>by Armaan A. Abraham, Zhixin Cyrillus Tan, Priyanka Shrestha, Emily R. Bozich, Aaron S. Meyer</p>

Systems serology aims to broadly profile the antigen binding, Fc biophysical features, immune receptor engagement, and effector functions of antibodies. This experimental approach excels at identifying antibody functional features that are relevant to a particular disease. However, a crucial limitation of this approach is its incomplete description of what structural features of the antibodies are responsible for the observed immune receptor engagement and effector functions. Knowing these antibody features is important for both understanding how effector responses are naturally controlled through antibody Fc structure and designing antibody therapies with specific effector profiles. Here, we address this limitation by modeling the molecular interactions occurring in these assays and using this model to infer quantities of specific antibody Fc species among the antibodies being profiled. We used several validation strategies to show that the model accurately infers antibody properties and then applied the model to infer previously unavailable antibody fucosylation information from existing systems serology data. Using this capability, we find that COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is associated with the induction of afucosylated spike protein-targeting IgG. Our results also question an existing assumption that controllers of HIV exhibit gp120-targeting IgG that are less fucosylated than those of progressors. Additionally, we confirm that afucosylated IgG is associated with membrane-associated antigens for COVID-19 and HIV, and present new evidence indicating that this relationship is specific to the host cell membrane. Finally, we use the model to identify redundant assay measurements and subsets of information-rich measurements from which Fc properties can be inferred. In total, our modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for the reasoning typically applied in these studies, improving the ability to draw mechanistic conclusions from these data.

                <p>by Sarah E. Baum, Daniele M. Pelissari, Fernanda Dockhorn Costa, Luiza O. Harada, Mauro Sanchez, Patricia Bartholomay, Ted Cohen, Marcia C. Castro, Nicolas A. Menzies</p>

Effectively responding to drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) requires accurate and timely information on resistance levels and trends. In contexts where use of drug susceptibility testing has not been universal (i.e. not all patients are offered testing), surveillance for rifampicin-resistance—one of the core drugs in the TB treatment regimen—has relied on resource-intensive and infrequent nationally-representative prevalence surveys. The expanded availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) over the past decade has increased testing coverage in many settings. However, RDT data collected in the course of routine (but not universal) use may provide biased estimates of resistance if the subset of patients receiving RDTs is not representative of the overall cohort. Here, we developed a method that attempts to correct for non-random use of RDT testing in the context of routine TB diagnosis to recover unbiased estimates of resistance among new and previously treated TB cases. Specifically, we employed statistical corrections to model rifampicin resistance among TB notifications with observed Xpert MTB/RIF (a WHO-recommended RDT) results using a hierarchical generalized additive regression model, and then used model output to impute results for untested individuals. We applied this model to 2017–2023 case-level data on over 800,000 patients from Brazil. Modeled estimates of the prevalence of rifampicin resistance were substantially higher than naïve estimates, with estimated prevalence ranging between 28–44% higher for new cases and 2–17% higher for previously treated cases. Our estimates of RR-TB incidence were estimated with narrower uncertainty intervals relative to WHO estimates for the same time period, and were robust to alternative model specifications. Our approach provides a generalizable method to leverage routine RDT data to derive timely estimates of RR-TB prevalence among notified TB cases in settings where testing for TB drug resistance is not universal.

                <p>by Jiyoung Kang, Hae-Jeong Park</p>

Integrating multiscale, multimodal neuroimaging data is essential for a comprehensive understanding of neural circuits. However, this is challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between spatial coverage and resolution in each modality, necessitating a computational strategy that combines modality-specific information effectively. This study introduces a dynamic causal modeling (DCM) framework designed to address the challenge of combining partially observed, multiscale signals across a larger-scale neural circuit by employing a shared neural state model with modality-specific observation models. The proposed method achieves robust circuit inference by iteratively integrating parameter estimates from local microscale and global meso- or macroscale circuits, derived from signals across various scales and modalities. Parameters estimated from high-resolution data within specific regions inform global circuit estimation by constraining neural properties in unobserved regions, while large-scale circuit data help elucidate detailed local circuitry. Using a virtual ground truth system, we validated the method across diverse experimental settings, combining calcium imaging (CaI), voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI), and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals—each with distinct coverage and resolution. Our reciprocal and iterative parameter estimation approach markedly improves the accuracy of neural property and connectivity estimates compared to traditional one-step estimation methods. This iterative integration of local and global parameters presents a reliable approach to inferring extensive, complex neural circuits from partially observed, multimodal, and multiscale data, showcasing how information from different scales reciprocally enhances entire circuit parameter estimation.

Neuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumour in children. Over half of all high-risk cases are expected to succumb to the disease even after chemotherapy, surgery, and immunotherapy. Although the importance of <i>MYCN</i> amplification in this disease is indisputable, the mechanistic details remain enigmatic. Here, we present a multicellular model of neuroblastoma comprising a continuous automaton, discrete cell agents, and a centre-based mechanical model, as well as the simulation results we obtained with it. The continuous automaton represents the tumour microenvironment as a grid-like structure, where each voxel is associated with continuous variables such as the oxygen level therein. Each discrete cell agent is defined by several attributes, including its cell cycle position, mutations, gene expression pattern, and more with behaviours such as cell cycling and cell death being stochastically dependent on these attributes. The centre-based mechanical model represents the properties of these agents as physical objects, describing how they repel each other as soft spheres. By implementing a stochastic simulation algorithm on modern GPUs, we simulated the dynamics of over one million neuroblastoma cells over a period of months. Specifically, we set up 1200 heterogeneous tumours and tracked the <i>MYCN</i>-amplified clone’s dynamics in each, revealed the conditions that favour its growth, and tested its responses to 5000 drug combinations. Our results are in agreement with those reported in the literature and add new insights into how the <i>MYCN</i>-amplified clone’s reproductive advantage in a tumour, its gene expression profile, the tumour’s other clones (with different mutations), and the tumour’s microenvironment are inter-related. Based on the results, we formulated a hypothesis, which argues that there are two distinct populations of neuroblastoma cells in the tumour; the p53 protein is pro-survival in one and pro-apoptosis in the other. It follows that alternating between inhibiting MDM2 to restore p53 activity and inhibiting ARF to attenuate p53 activity is a promising, if unorthodox, therapeutic strategy. The multicellular model has the advantages of modularity, high resolution, and scalability, making it a potential foundation for creating digital twins of neuroblastoma patients.

The baroreflex is one of the most important control mechanisms in the human cardiovascular system. This work utilises a closed-loop in silico model of baroreflex regulation, coupled to pulsatile mechanical models with (i) one heart chamber and 36-parameters and (ii) four chambers and 51 parameters. We perform the first global sensitivity analysis of these closed-loop systems which considers <i>both</i> cardiovascular and baroreflex parameters, and compare the models with their respective unregulated equivalents. Results show the reduced influence of regulated parameters compared to unregulated equivalents and that, in the physiological resting state, model outputs (pressures, heart rate, cardiac output etc.) are most sensitive to parasympathetic arc parameters. This work provides insight into the effects of regulation and model input parameter influence on clinical metrics, and constitutes a first step to understanding the role of regulation in models for personalised healthcare.

                <p>by Bethan Cracknell Daniels, Darunee Buddhari, Taweewun Hunsawong, Sopon Iamsirithaworn, Aaron R. Farmer, Derek A. T. Cummings, Kathryn B. Anderson, Ilaria Dorigatti</p>

The development of a safe and efficacious vaccine that provides immunity against all four dengue virus serotypes is a priority, and a significant challenge for vaccine development has been defining and measuring serotype-specific outcomes and correlates of protection. The plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) is the gold standard assay for measuring serotype-specific antibodies, but this test cannot differentiate homotypic and heterotypic antibodies and characterising the infection history is challenging. To address this, we present an analysis of pre- and post-infection antibody titres measured using the PRNT, collected from a prospective cohort of Thai children. We applied four machine learning classifiers and multinomial logistic regression to the titre data to predict the infecting serotype. The models were validated against the true infecting serotype, identified using RT-PCR. Model performance was calculated using 100 bootstrap samples of the train and out-of-sample test sets. Our analysis showed that, on average, the greatest change in titre was against the infecting serotype. However, in 53.4% (109/204) of the subjects, the highest titre change did not correspond to the infecting serotype, including in 34.3% (11/35) of dengue-naïve individuals (although 8/11 of these seronegative individuals were seropositive to Japanese encephalitis virus prior to their infection). The highest post-infection titres of seropositive cases were more likely to match the serotype of the highest pre-infection titre than the infecting serotype, consistent with antigenic seniority or cross-reactive boosting of pre-infection titres. Despite these challenges, the best performing machine learning algorithm achieved 76.3% (95% CI 57.9–89.5%) accuracy on the out-of-sample test set in predicting the infecting serotype from PRNT data. Incorporating additional spatiotemporal data improved accuracy to 80.6% (95% CI 63.2–94.7%), while using only post-infection titres as predictor variables yielded an accuracy of 71.7% (95% CI 57.9–84.2%). These results show that machine learning classifiers can be used to overcome challenges in interpreting PRNT titres, making them useful tools in investigating dengue immune dynamics, infection history and identifying serotype-specific correlates of protection, which in turn can support the evaluation of clinical trial endpoints and vaccine development.

                <p>by Máté Mohácsi, Márk Patrik Török, Sára Sáray, Luca Tar, Gábor Farkas, Szabolcs Káli</p>

Finding optimal parameters for detailed neuronal models is a ubiquitous challenge in neuroscientific research. In recent years, manual model tuning has been gradually replaced by automated parameter search using a variety of different tools and methods. However, using most of these software tools and choosing the most appropriate algorithm for a given optimization task require substantial technical expertise, which prevents the majority of researchers from using these methods effectively. To address these issues, we developed a generic platform (called Neuroptimus) that allows users to set up neural parameter optimization tasks via a graphical interface, and to solve these tasks using a wide selection of state-of-the-art parameter search methods implemented by five different Python packages. Neuroptimus also offers several features to support more advanced usage, including the ability to run most algorithms in parallel, which allows it to take advantage of high-performance computing architectures. We used the common interface provided by Neuroptimus to conduct a detailed comparison of more than twenty different algorithms (and implementations) on six distinct benchmarks that represent typical scenarios in neuronal parameter search. We quantified the performance of the algorithms in terms of the best solutions found and in terms of convergence speed. We identified several algorithms, including covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and particle swarm optimization, that consistently, without any fine-tuning, found good solutions in all of our use cases. By contrast, some other algorithms including all local search methods provided good solutions only for the simplest use cases, and failed completely on more complex problems. We also demonstrate the versatility of Neuroptimus by applying it to an additional use case that involves tuning the parameters of a subcellular model of biochemical pathways. Finally, we created an online database that allows uploading, querying and analyzing the results of optimization runs performed by Neuroptimus, which enables all researchers to update and extend the current benchmarking study. The tools and analysis we provide should aid members of the neuroscience community to apply parameter search methods more effectively in their research.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is traditionally considered a region dedicated to long-term memory, recent neuroimaging and intracranial recording evidence suggests that the MTL also contributes to certain aspects of visual short-term memory (VSTM), such as the quality or precision of retained VSTM content. This study aims to further investigate the MTL's role in VSTM precision through the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants underwent 1.5 mA offline tDCS over bilateral temporal lobes using left cathodal and right anodal electrodes, administered for either 20 min (active) or 0.5 min within a 20-min window (sham), in a counterbalanced design. As the electrical current passes through midbrain structures with this bilateral stimulation montage, prior behavioral and modeling evidence suggests that this tDCS protocol can modulate MTL functions. To confirm this and examine its impacts on VSTM, participants completed a VSTM color recall task immediately following tDCS, while undergoing a 20-min fMRI scan and a subsequent 7.5-min resting-state scan, during which they focused on a fixation cross. Behavioral results indicated that this tDCS protocol decreased VSTM precision without significantly affecting overall recall success. Furthermore, psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that tDCS over the temporal lobe modulated hippocampal-occipital functional connectivity during the VSTM task, despite no main effect on fMRI BOLD activity. Notably, this modulation was also observed during resting-state fMRI 15–20 min post-tDCS, with the magnitude of the effect correlating with participants' behavioral changes in VSTM precision across active and control conditions. Combined, these findings suggest that tDCS over the temporal lobe can modulate the intrinsic functional connectivity between the MTL and visual sensory areas, thereby affecting VSTM precision.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence indicates that inherited astrocyte dysfunction can be a primary trigger for epilepsy development; however, the available data are rather limited. In addition, astrocytes are considered as a perspective target for the design of novel and improvement of the existing antiepileptic therapy. Piracetam and related nootropic drugs are widely used in the therapy of various epileptic disorders, but detailed mechanisms of racetams action and, in particular, their effects on glial functions are poorly understood. In this study, we explored the functional state of astrocytes in the dentate gyrus (DG) of Krushinsky–Molodkina (KM) rats genetically prone to audiogenic seizures and compared the action of piracetam on the DG astrocytes in KM and normal Wistar rats. Wistar and naïve KM rats which received injections of saline (control) or piracetam (100 mg/kg) for 21 days were recruited in our studies. Comparative analysis of control Wistar and KM rats revealed genetically determined abnormalities in DG astrocytes of KM rats including an increased expression of NFIA but a decreased GFAP, ALDH1L1, EAATs, and glutamine synthetase (GS). Piracetam treatment normalized the expression of all studied markers, except NFIA, in KM rats, while in Wistar rats, it potentiated only GS and NFIA. The results suggested that the nootropic and antiepileptic effects of piracetam may be, at least partially, mediated by the modulation of astroglia functions. In addition, analysis of NFIA and GS colocalization revealed the novel pattern of astrocyte heterogeneity in the DG which was significantly altered in epileptic rats but corrected by piracetam.</p>

                The authors identified an open-prone PIEZO1-S2472E mutant and captured its partially flattened and intermediate open state. Combining structural analyses, MD simulations, and electrophysiological characterizations, they have revealed distinct structural features that define the closed, intermediate open, and inactivated states, providing novel insights into the gating mechanism of PIEZO channels.

                Chapman et al. generate a brain-wide atlas of supraspinal inputs to cervical V1 interneurons. Monosynaptic input arises from over two dozen brain regions, some of which preferentially innervate molecularly distinct V1 subsets. These results provide an anatomical foundation for understanding how the brain communicates with spinal interneurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98900">Long non-coding RNA Malat1 fine-tunes bone homeostasis and repair by orchestrating cellular crosstalk and β-catenin-OPG/Jagged1 pathway</a></h4>

              
                The IncRNA <i>Malat1</i> was initially believed to be dispensable for physiology due to the lack of observable phenotypes in <i>Malat1</i> knockout (KO) mice. However, our study challenges this conclusion. We found that both <i>Malat1</i> KO and conditional KO mice in the osteoblast lineage exhibit significant osteoporosis. Mechanistically, <i>Malat1</i> acts as an intrinsic regulator in osteoblasts to promote osteogenesis. Interestingly, <i>Malat1</i> does not directly affect osteoclastogenesis but inhibits osteoclastogenesis in a non-autonomous manner in vivo via integrating crosstalk between multiple cell types, including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes. Our findings substantiate the existence of a novel remodeling network in which <i>Malat1</i> serves as a central regulator by binding to β-catenin and functioning through the β-catenin-OPG/Jagged1 pathway in osteoblasts and chondrocytes. In pathological conditions, <i>Malat1</i> significantly promotes bone regeneration in fracture healing. Bone homeostasis and regeneration are crucial to well-being. Our discoveries establish a previous unrecognized paradigm model of <i>Malat1</i> function in the skeletal system, providing novel mechanistic insights into how a lncRNA integrates cellular crosstalk and molecular networks to fine tune tissue homeostasis, remodeling and repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92004">Basement membranes are crucial for proper olfactory placode shape, position and boundary with the brain, and for olfactory axon development</a></h4>

              
                Despite recent progress, the complex roles played by the extracellular matrix in development and disease are still far from being fully understood. Here, we took advantage of the zebrafish <i>sly</i> mutation which affects Laminin γ1, a major component of basement membranes, to explore its role in the development of the olfactory system. Following a detailed characterisation of Laminin distribution in the developing olfactory circuit, we analysed basement membrane integrity, olfactory placode and brain morphogenesis, and olfactory axon development in <i>sly</i> mutants, using a combination of immunochemistry, electron microscopy and quantitative live imaging of cell movements and axon behaviours. Our results point to an original and dual contribution of Laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in organising the border between the olfactory placode and the adjacent brain: they maintain placode shape and position in the face of major brain morphogenetic movements, they establish a robust physical barrier between the two tissues while at the same time allowing the local entry of the sensory axons into the brain and their navigation towards the olfactory bulb. This work thus identifies key roles of Laminin γ1-dependent basement membranes in neuronal tissue morphogenesis and axon development in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94884">A novel human pluripotent stem cell gene activation system identifies IGFBP2 as a mediator in the production of haematopoietic progenitors in vitro</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge in the stem cell biology field is the ability to produce fully functional cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that are a valuable resource for cell therapy, drug screening, and disease modelling. Here, we developed a novel inducible CRISPR-mediated activation strategy (iCRISPRa) to drive the expression of multiple endogenous transcription factors (TFs) important for in vitro cell fate and differentiation of iPSCs to haematopoietic progenitor cells. This work has identified a key role for IGFBP2 in developing haematopoietic progenitors. We first identified nine candidate TFs that we predicted to be involved in blood cell emergence during development, then generated tagged gRNAs directed to the transcriptional start site of these TFs that could also be detected during single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). iCRISPRa activation of these endogenous TFs resulted in a significant expansion of arterial-fated endothelial cells expressing high levels of IGFBP2, and our analysis indicated that IGFBP2 is involved in the remodelling of metabolic activity during in vitro endothelial to haematopoietic transition. As well as providing fundamental new insights into the mechanisms of haematopoietic differentiation, the broader applicability of iCRISPRa provides a valuable tool for studying dynamic processes in development and for recapitulating abnormal phenotypes characterised by ectopic activation of specific endogenous gene expression in a wide range of systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97180">Base editing of Ptbp1 in neurons alleviates symptoms in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a multifactorial disease caused by irreversible progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Recent studies have reported the successful conversion of astrocytes into DANs by repressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1), which led to the rescue of motor symptoms in a chemically-induced mouse model of PD. However, follow-up studies have questioned the validity of this astrocyte-to-DAN conversion model. Here, we devised an adenine base editing strategy to downregulate PTBP1 in astrocytes and neurons in a chemically-induced PD mouse model. While PTBP1 downregulation in astrocytes had no effect, PTBP1 downregulation in neurons of the striatum resulted in the expression of the DAN marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in non-dividing neurons, which was associated with an increase in striatal dopamine concentrations and a rescue of forelimb akinesia and spontaneous rotations. Phenotypic analysis using multiplexed iterative immunofluorescence imaging further revealed that most of these TH-positive cells co-expressed the dopaminergic marker DAT and the pan-neuronal marker NEUN, with the majority of these triple-positive cells being classified as mature GABAergic neurons. Additional research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of the observed markers and understand how the formation of these cells contributes to the rescue of spontaneous motor behaviors. Nevertheless, our findings support a model where downregulation of neuronal, but not astrocytic, PTBP1 can mitigate symptoms in PD mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100086">The evolutionary modifications of a GoLoco motif in the AGS protein facilitate micromere formation in the sea urchin embryo</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary introduction of asymmetric cell division (ACD) into the developmental program facilitates the formation of a new cell type, contributing to developmental diversity and, eventually, species diversification. The micromere of the sea urchin embryo may serve as one of those examples: an ACD at the 16-cell stage forms micromeres unique to echinoids among echinoderms. We previously reported that a polarity factor, activator of G-protein signaling (AGS), plays a crucial role in micromere formation. However, AGS and its associated ACD factors are present in all echinoderms and across most metazoans. This raises the question of what evolutionary modifications of AGS protein or its surrounding molecular environment contributed to the evolutionary acquisition of micromeres only in echinoids. In this study, we learned that the GoLoco motifs at the AGS C-terminus play critical roles in regulating micromere formation in sea urchin embryos. Further, other echinoderms’ AGS or chimeric AGS that contain the C-terminus of AGS orthologs from various organisms showed varied localization and function in micromere formation. In contrast, the sea star or the pencil urchin orthologs of other ACD factors were consistently localized at the vegetal cortex in the sea urchin embryo, suggesting that AGS may be a unique variable factor that facilitates ACD diversity among echinoderms. Consistently, sea urchin AGS appears to facilitate micromere-like cell formation and accelerate the enrichment timing of the germline factor Vasa during early embryogenesis of the pencil urchin, an ancestral type of sea urchin. Based on these observations, we propose that the molecular evolution of a single polarity factor facilitates ACD diversity while preserving the core ACD machinery among echinoderms and beyond during evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93002">Clinical phenotypes in acute and chronic infarction explained through human ventricular electromechanical modelling and simulations</a></h4>

              
                Sudden death after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with electrophysiological heterogeneities and ionic current remodelling. Low ejection fraction (EF) is used in risk stratification, but its mechanistic links with pro-arrhythmic heterogeneities are unknown. We aim to provide mechanistic explanations of clinical phenotypes in acute and chronic MI, from ionic current remodelling to ECG and EF, using human electromechanical modelling and simulation to augment experimental and clinical investigations. A human ventricular electromechanical modelling and simulation framework is constructed and validated with rich experimental and clinical datasets, incorporating varying degrees of ionic current remodelling as reported in literature. In acute MI, T-wave inversion and Brugada phenocopy were explained by conduction abnormality and local action potential prolongation in the border zone. In chronic MI, upright tall T-waves highlight large repolarisation dispersion between the border and remote zones, which promoted ectopic propagation at fast pacing. Post-MI EF at resting heart rate was not sensitive to the extent of repolarisation heterogeneity and the risk of repolarisation abnormalities at fast pacing. T-wave and QT abnormalities are better indicators of repolarisation heterogeneities than EF in post-MI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98441">Virus adaptation to heparan sulfate comes with capsid stability tradeoff</a></h4>

              
                Because of high mutation rates, viruses constantly adapt to new environments. When propagated in cell lines, certain viruses acquire positively charged amino acids on their surface proteins, enabling them to utilize negatively charged heparan sulfate (HS) as an attachment receptor. In this study, we used enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) as model and demonstrated that unlike the parental MP4 variant, the cell-adapted strong HS-binder MP4-97R/167G does not require acidification for uncoating and releases its genome in the neutral or weakly acidic environment of early endosomes. We experimentally confirmed that this pH-independent entry is not associated with the use of HS as an attachment receptor but rather with compromised capsid stability. We then extended these findings to another HS-dependent strain. In summary, our data indicate that acquisition of capsid mutations conferring affinity for HS come together with decreased capsid stability and allow EV-A71 to enter the cell via a pH-independent pathway. This pH-independent entry mechanism boosts viral replication in cell lines but may prove deleterious <i>in vivo</i>, especially for enteric viruses crossing the acidic gastric environment before reaching their primary replication site, the intestine. Our study thus provides new insight into the mechanisms underlying the <i>in vivo</i> attenuation of HS-binding EV-A71 strains. Not only are these viruses hindered in tissues rich in HS due to viral trapping, as generally accepted, but our research reveals that their diminished capsid stability further contributes to attenuation <i>in vivo</i>. This underscores the complex relationship between HS-binding, capsid stability, and viral fitness, where increased replication in cell lines coincides with attenuation in harsh in vivo environments like the gastrointestinal tract.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86194">Impairment of lipid homeostasis causes lysosomal accumulation of endogenous protein aggregates through ESCRT disruption</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregation increases during aging and is a pathological hallmark of many age-related diseases. Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) depends on a core network of factors directly influencing protein production, folding, trafficking, and degradation. Cellular proteostasis also depends on the overall composition of the proteome and numerous environmental variables. Modulating this cellular proteostasis state can influence the stability of multiple endogenous proteins, yet the factors contributing to this state remain incompletely characterized. Here, we performed genome-wide CRISPRi screens to elucidate the modulators of proteostasis state in mammalian cells, using a fluorescent dye to monitor endogenous protein aggregation. These screens identified known components of the proteostasis network and uncovered a novel link between protein and lipid homeostasis. Increasing lipid uptake and/or disrupting lipid metabolism promotes the accumulation of sphingomyelins and cholesterol esters and drives the formation of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates at the lysosome. Proteome profiling of lysosomes revealed ESCRT accumulation, suggesting disruption of ESCRT disassembly, lysosomal membrane repair, and microautophagy. Lipid dysregulation leads to lysosomal membrane permeabilization but does not otherwise impact fundamental aspects of lysosomal and proteasomal functions. Together, these results demonstrate that lipid dysregulation disrupts ESCRT function and impairs proteostasis.

                Speech production and perception involve complex neural dynamics in the human brain. Using magnetoencephalography, our study explores the interaction between cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connectivities during these processes. Our connectivity findings during speaking revealed a significant connection from the right cerebellum to the left temporal areas in low frequencies, which displayed an opposite trend in high frequencies. Notably, high-frequency connectivity was absent during the listening condition. These findings underscore the vital roles of cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connections within the speech production and perception network. The results of our new study enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics of brain connectivity during speech processes, emphasizing the distinct frequency-based interactions between various brain regions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100260">The emergence of visual category representations in infants’ brains</a></h4>

              
                Organizing the continuous stream of visual input into categories like places or faces is important for everyday function and social interactions. However, it is unknown when neural representations of these and other visual categories emerge. Here, we used steady-state evoked potential electroencephalography to measure cortical responses in infants at 3–4 months, 4–6 months, 6–8 months, and 12–15 months, when they viewed controlled, gray-level images of faces, limbs, corridors, characters, and cars. We found that distinct responses to these categories emerge at different ages. Reliable brain responses to faces emerge first, at 4–6 months, followed by limbs and places around 6–8 months. Between 6 and 15 months response patterns become more distinct, such that a classifier can decode what an infant is looking at from their brain responses. These findings have important implications for assessing typical and atypical cortical development as they not only suggest that category representations are learned, but also that representations of categories that may have innate substrates emerge at different times during infancy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97465">Genome concentration limits cell growth and modulates proteome composition in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                Defining the cellular factors that drive growth rate and proteome composition is essential for understanding and manipulating cellular systems. In bacteria, ribosome concentration is known to be a constraining factor of cell growth rate, while gene concentration is usually assumed not to be limiting. Here, using single-molecule tracking, quantitative single-cell microscopy, and modeling, we show that genome dilution in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells arrested for DNA replication limits total RNA polymerase activity within physiological cell sizes across tested nutrient conditions. This rapid-onset limitation on bulk transcription results in sub-linear scaling of total active ribosomes with cell size and sub-exponential growth. Such downstream effects on bulk translation and cell growth are near-immediately detectable in a nutrient-rich medium, but delayed in nutrient-poor conditions, presumably due to cellular buffering activities. RNA sequencing and tandem-mass-tag mass spectrometry experiments further reveal that genome dilution remodels the relative abundance of mRNAs and proteins with cell size at a global level. Altogether, our findings indicate that chromosome concentration is a limiting factor of transcription and a global modulator of the transcriptome and proteome composition in <i>E. coli</i>.

">Spatiotemporal dynamics of EEG microstate networks over the first two years of life: A multi-cohort longitudinal study</a></h4>

              
                The first two years of life are marked by rapid development of large-scale brain networks that support emerging cognition and behavior. Magnetic-resonance approaches have revealed much about largescale networks in sleep, but very little is known about functional network dynamics in awake, behaving infants during this period of substantial development. Microstates are brief instances of distinct spatial topographies of largescale neural activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG) that offer a novel approach to studying whole-brain network dynamics at sub-second scale in awake infants by capturing their temporally coherent brain activity. While emerging literature is leveraging microstate dynamics in adults to understand mature largescale network function, developmental trajectories during networks rapid construction in infancy remain uncharacterized. In this study, we leveraged longitudinal resting-state EEG data from 854 infants across two geoculturally diverse cohorts to explore largescale network development through EEG microstates over the first two years of life. We provide evidence for conserved emergence of various network configurations (microstate classes A-G) through infancy across cohorts using data-driven clustering analyses. We also demonstrate significant longitudinal changes in microstate dynamics during this period, characterized by more numerous and more rapid transitions between largescale configurations, especially over early infancy. While patterns of sensory microstate development were largely consistent between cohorts, higher-order cognitive microstates showed context-specific developmental trends. Together these results provide novel insights into how large-scale brain networks functionally develop and organize across the first two years of life.

">Cytoplasmic expression of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 in radial glial progenitor cells modulates brain cortex development</a></h4>

              
                During nervous system development, the interplay between cell cycle regulation and neurogenesis is fundamental to achieve the correct timing for neuronal differentiation. However, the molecular players regulating this transition are poorly understood. Among these, the cell-cycle regulatory cyclins and their cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) play a pivotal role. In the present work we uncover an unknown function of cyclin D1 (Ccnd1) during cortex development which is independent of cell cycle regulation and that relies on its cytoplasmic localization and membrane association. We show that Ccnd1 is localized in the cytoplasm of the radial glial process (RGP) of neuron progenitors in different regions of the developing brain, including the cortex. Cytoplasmic Ccnd1 is enriched at the distal tip of the RGP, adjacent to the meningeal basement membrane, and overlaps with beta1-integrin at the plasma membrane. CCND1 knock-out animals show an abnormal cortical layering in which the distribution of Tbr2+ and Ctip2+ cells are affected without displaying proliferation defects. This is consistent with a cytoplasmic function of Ccnd1 as overexpression by in utero electroporation of a dominant negative Ccnd1, unable to activate Cdks, and targeted to the cytoplasmic membranes, reproduces some of these Tbr2 and Ctip2 defects. Finally, we provide evidence that cytoplasmic Ccnd1 affects neuron morphology and that it is required for the proper detachment of the RGP from the meningeal basement membrane by a mechanism involving the phosphorylation of the integrin effector protein paxillin. Hence, we propose that Ccnd1 has an important cytoplasmic function for cortical development independently of cell cycle regulation.

">Dissecting the functional heterogeneity of glutamatergic synapses with high-throughput optical physiology</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent reporters for glutamate release and postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling are essential tools for quantifying synapse functional heterogeneity across neurons and circuits. However, leveraging these probes for neuroscience requires scalable experimental frameworks. Here, we devised a high-throughput approach to efficiently collect and analyze hundreds of optical recordings of glutamate release activity at presynaptic boutons in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Boutons exhibited remarkable functional heterogeneity and could be separated into multiple functional classes based on their iGluSnFR3 responses to single action potentials, paired stimuli, and synaptic parameters derived from mean-variance analysis. Finally, we developed a novel all-optical assay of pre- and postsynaptic glutamatergic synapse function. We deployed iGluSnFR3 with a red-shifted, postsynaptically-targeted Ca2+ sensor, enabling direct imaging and analysis of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission at large numbers of dendritic spines. This work enables direct observation of the flow of information at single synapses and should speed detailed investigations of synaptic functional heterogeneity.

">Foveal action for the control of extrafoveal vision</a></h4>

              
                Microsaccades have been convincingly linked to extrafoveal covert attention shifts for more than two decades. However, the direction of causality between individual microsaccade generation and an alteration in both extrafoveal visual sensitivity and behavior remains debated: do microsaccades merely reflect, perhaps probabilistically, an altered extrafoveal sensitivity, or is the act of generating microsaccades sufficient to, on its own, modify such sensitivity? Using a novel exploitation of real-time retinal image stabilization, behavior, and neurophysiology in the superior colliculus, we show that exclusive experimental control over foveal oculomotor state is entirely sufficient to influence extrafoveal sensitivity. This happens for eccentricities as large as ~50 times those associated with microsaccades, and it also takes place in the absence of any differential attentional demands. Most importantly, such influence is mediated through well-known, classic pre- and post-saccadic visual processing changes. Thus, seemingly-innocuous subliminal eye movements do constitute an integral component of cognitive processes like attention.

">Collecting, detecting and handling non-wear intervals in longitudinal light exposure data</a></h4>

              
                In field studies using wearable light loggers, participants often need to remove the devices, resulting in non-wear intervals of varying and unknown duration. Accurate detection of these intervals is an essential step in data pre-processing pipelines. However, the limited reporting on whether and how non-wear information is collected and detected has hindered the development of effective data pre-processing strategies and automated detection algorithms. Here, we deploy a multi-modal approach to collect non-wear time during a longitudinal light exposure campaign and systematically compare non-wear detection strategies. Healthy participants (n=26; mean age 28{+/-}5 years, 14F) wore a near-corneal plane light logger for one week and reported non-wear events in three ways: pressing an "event marker" button on the light logger, placing it in a black bag, and using an app-based Wear log. Wear log entries were checked twice a day to ensure high data quality and used as ground truth for non-wear interval detection. Participants showed high adherence to the protocol, with non-wear time constituting 5.4{+/-}3.8% (mean{+/-}SD) of total participation time. Considering button presses, our results indicated that extending time windows beyond one minute improved their detection at the start and end of non-wear intervals, achieving identification in >85.4% of cases. To detect non-wear intervals based on black bag use, we applied an algorithm detecting clusters of low illuminance to our data and compared its performance to detecting clusters of low activity. Performance was higher for illuminance (F1=0.76) than activity (F1=0.52). Transition states between wear and non-wear emerged as a major source of misclassification, and we suggest that combining illuminance and activity data could enhance detection accuracy. Lastly, we compared light exposure metrics averaged across the week derived from three datasets: the full dataset, a dataset filtered for non-wear based on self-reports, and a dataset filtered for non-wear using the low illuminance clusters detection algorithm. The differences in light exposure metrics across these datasets were minimal. Our results highlight that while non-wear detection may be less critical in high-compliance cohorts, systematically collecting and detecting non-wear intervals is both feasible and important for ensuring robust data pre-processing.

">Using deep generative models for simultaneous representational and predictive modeling of brain and behavior: A graded supervised-to-unsupervised modeling framework.</a></h4>

              
                Research in cognitive neuroscience has increasingly used machine learning algorithms and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to model brain-behavior relationships. These algorithms typically fall into two main types: unsupervised or supervised. In cognitive neuroscience, most studies assume that brain states map to behavior in a linear, one-to-one fashion. If such mapping exists, unsupervised and supervised approaches should lead to converging conclusions. Conclusions diverge, however, when the mapping is more complex. Unfortunately, the ground truth of brain-behavior relationships is rarely, if ever, known in advance, leading to the possibility of incorrect conclusions when scientists use a modeling approach guided by a single set of assumptions that may not be justified. In this paper, we introduce a possible solution to this dilemma. We combine unsupervised and discriminative supervised models with a model comparison strategy, and apply this approach on simulated data where the ground truth brain-behavior relationships are known. The combined modeling approach learns a latent space that models the distribution of simulated brain states (similar to unsupervised approaches). At the same time, the latent space contains information that can be used to predict behavior, thereby contributing to brain-behavior characterizations (similar to supervised approaches). We use four simulated datasets that vary in the linearity and homogeneity of the brain-behavior relationship to compare the modeling results for each simulated dataset along a continuum from fully unsupervised to fully supervised. More importantly, we examine what happens to the latent space as a consequence of incorrect assumptions that applied to a dataset during modeling. We further show how our framework can model diverse brain-behavior relationships in a way that fully unsupervised v. fully supervised approaches do not, by comparing the modeling results for each simulated dataset along a continuum from fully unsupervised to fully supervised.

                Microglia dysregulation is implicated across a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, making their modulation a promising therapeutic target. Using PBMC-derived induced microglia-like cells (piMGLCs) in a scalable assay, we screened 489 CNS-penetrant compounds for modulation of microglial phagocytosis of human synaptosomes in a validated assay for microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. Compounds from the library that reduced phagocytosis by [&ge;]2 standard deviations across the library without cytotoxicity were validated in secondary screens, with 28 of them further confirmed to reduce phagocytosis by 50% or more. Image-based morphological measurements were calculated to measure the degree of ramified vs. amoeboid morphotype as an indicator of activation state. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling indicated divergent effects on cell signaling, metabolism, activation, and actin dynamics across confirmed compounds. In particular, multiple CNS-penetrant small molecules with prior FDA approval or demonstration of safety in vivo demonstrated modulatory effects on microglia. These potential disease-modifying agents represent high-priority candidates for repositioning studies in neurodevelopmental, neuroinflammatory, or neurodegenerative disorders.

">Auditory brainstem responses to speech-in-noise reflect selective attention, comprehension, and subjective listening effort</a></h4>

              
                The auditory brainstem plays a crucial role in speech-in-noise listening, refining numerous acoustic features such as pitch and spatial location under continual descending influence from cortex. However, the difficulty of characterizing brainstem activity during continuous speech listening has obscured its functional role in ecologically valid contexts - not only the effects of selective attention on neural responses, but also their impact on comprehension and listening effort. Here, we evaluate the role of the brainstem on speech-in-noise perception and selective attention using a continuous, speech-based stimulus with embedded chirps (Cheech) that rapidly and effectively evokes auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) while participants listen to short story narratives. The Cheech-modified stories were presented alone or in the presence of another spatially separated talker, and neural responses were measured throughout by EEG. Both word-level detection performance and narrative-level comprehension were evaluated, as well as subjective reports of listening effort. ABR wave V was modulated by the presence of a competing talker, selective attention for the target versus masker, and the talker gender. Additionally, faster wave V peak latencies and larger amplitudes were associated with identification of the target words embedded within the stories, while faster latencies additionally related to better comprehension question accuracy and lower subjective listening effort. Collectively, our results provide clear evidence for the influence of brainstem encoding processes on individual speech-listening behaviors, including the ability to selectively attend to and comprehend target speech in the presence of a competing talker.

">Cerebral perfusion and metabolic response of astrocytes and neurons during locomotion</a></h4>

              
                The hemodynamic response links neural oxidative metabolism changes to increased cerebral blood flow during brain activity. Although Roy and Sherrington introduced this concept over a century ago (1890), the exact cellular mechanisms remain unclear. This study demonstrates how local blood supply increases correlate with the metabolic response of individual brain cells during locomotion. Using Raman microspectroscopy, we observed an elevation in oxygen saturation levels (sO2) in cortical venules but not in arterioles, which were already near saturation. The increased sO2 in the venules was accompanied by vasodilation, indicating blood oversupply in the local brain area, a phenomenon known as functional hyperemia. We then analyzed the metabolic response of individual neurons and astrocytes to locomotion. In neurons, the levels of reduced cytochromes of c and b types [cyt c,b (Fe2+)] rapidly decreased at the onset of locomotion. This suggests an increase in the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (electron transport chain, ETC) in response to heightened energy demands in these cells. In contrast, because astrocytes rely less on oxidative phosphorylation for their energy metabolism than neurons, we did not observe an initial decrease in reduced cytochromes in these cells. However, as locomotion continued, the cyt c,b (Fe2+) levels steadily increased in both cell types. In neurons, this led to a slow recovery from the initial drop, while in astrocytes, the increase exceeded baseline levels. Consequently, we observed an overload of electrons in the astrocytic ETC. The distinct responses of astrocytic and neuronal mitochondria to locomotion may reflect differences in the organization of the ETC in the two cell types. Furthermore, astrocytes may shift to glycolysis under increased neuronal activity. This difference also resulted in hydrogen peroxide (H202) production in astrocytic mitochondria but not neuronal mitochondria. Since H202 is a signaling molecule critical for cognitive function in the brain, we speculate that astrocytic mitochondria act as signaling hubs during exercise.

">Emergence of Pre-movement Beta Activity with Stable Sensorimotor Predictions to Facilitate Motor Adjustments</a></h4>

              
                Daily, we adapt to perturbations to maintain efficient performance, especially when transitioning between environments with different features. Such an adaptative process relies on updating motor programs based on past errors, a process associated with beta oscillations (13-35 Hz). Yet, the spatio-temporal dynamics underlying the transition between different environments, and the updating of motor programs in response to specific environmental perturbations remain elusive. Here, we show for the first time that pre-movement beta activity in a cerebello-cortical network emerges as the features of a new environment and motor outcomes become more stable and predictable. Notably, the cerebellum and parietal cortex drive prefrontal activity near movement initiation to update these predictions. Using a single-trial approach, we reveal that pre-movement beta bursts predict the evolution of trial-by-trial motor adjustments within a stable environment. These findings demonstrate that pre-movement beta activity within cerebellar-cortical network encodes essential information for achieving efficient sensorimotor predictions following environmental changes.

">Critical Scaling of Novelty in the Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ability to detect unanticipated, novel events and rapidly relay this information across neural networks is fundamental to brain function, enabling the selection of appropriate behavioral responses. Here, we examine the transmission of holographically triggered action potentials in primary visual cortex of quietly resting mice, focusing on the dynamics of communication from pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate that these novel action potentials, which are uncorrelated with preceding activity, exert a disproportionally large influence on neighboring neurons. Their influence scales robustly to an exponent between 0.2 and 0.3 relative to their number. Remarkably, even a small number of novel action potentials can engage a majority of the local network, achieving high decoding accuracy of the perturbation origin in the face of high trial-by-trial variability and ongoing activity characterized by scale-invariant, parabolic neuronal avalanches. This heightened susceptibility to small, local perturbations aligns with the behavior of complex systems exhibiting critical dynamics. Our findings reveal that scaling underpins the efficient communication of unanticipated action potentials, suggesting it is a fundamental mechanism for detecting and processing novel events in the brain. These results provide new insights into the neural basis of novelty detection and highlight the importance of critical dynamics in cortical network function.

">Grin2a Ablation Distinctly Reshapes PV+ and SST+ Interneuron circuits in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex to Amplify Gamma Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a debilitating mental health disorder marked by cognitive deficits, especially in executive functions, which are often resistant to treatment. The GRIN2A gene encodes the GluN2A subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Rare coding mutations in GRIN2A, such as protein-truncating variants, increase susceptibility to SCZ by ~20-fold. However, the effects on network dynamics and the function of GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) remain unclear. In this study, we use brain slices from Grin2a mutant mice to investigate inhibitory synaptic and oscillatory activity driven by parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) INs. Our findings reveal significant alterations in synaptic currents and inhibitory modulation arise from GluN2A deficiency. Specifically, both heterozygous and knockout Grin2a mutants exhibit impaired synaptic transmission and release properties of INs inputs, including changes in release probability and evoked quantal events to layer V pyramidal neurons. Genotype-dependent alterations were observed in the frequency, kinetics, and amplitude of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an increased density of PV+ and SST+ INs in the Grin2a mutants, consistent with an overall increase in inhibitory tone. Additionally, optogenetic stimulation revealed a dynamic shift for inducing gamma-band oscillations through PV+ INs. Overall, our study highlights the essential role of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors in modulating inhibitory tone and maintaining network stability in the mPFC of adult mice and elucidates a pathophysiological mechanism that might contribute to cognitive deficits often observed in SCZ patients.

">Investigating the Role of Glyoxalase 1 as a Therapeutic Target for Cocaine and Oxycodone Use Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Methylglyoxal (MG) is an endogenously produced non-enzymatic side product of glycolysis that acts as a partial agonist at GABAA receptors. MG that is metabolized by the enzyme glyoxalase-1 (GLO1). Inhibition of GLO1 increases methylglyoxal levels, and has been shown to modulate various behaviors, including decreasing seeking of cocaine-paired cues and ethanol consumption. The goal of these studies was to determine if GLO1 inhibition could alter cocaine- or oxycodone-induced locomotor activation and/or conditioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine or oxycodone. We used both pharmacological and genetic manipulations of GLO1 to address this question. Administration of the GLO1 inhibitor s-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (pBBG) did not alter the locomotor response to cocaine or oxycodone. Additionally, pBBG had no significant effect on place preference for cocaine or oxycodone. Genetic knockdown of Glo1, which is conceptually similar to pharmacological inhibition, did not have any significant effects on cocaine place preference, nor did Glo1 overexpression affect locomotor response to cocaine. In summary, our results show that neither pharmacological nor genetic manipulations of GLO1 influence locomotor response or CPP to cocaine or oxycodone.

">Network Segregation During Episodic Memory Shows Age-Invariant Relations with Memory Performance From 7 to 82 Years</a></h4>

              
                Lower episodic memory capability, as seen in development and aging compared with younger adulthood, may partly depend on lower brain network segregation. Here, our objective was twofold: (1) test this hypothesis using within- and between-network functional connectivity (FC) during episodic memory encoding and retrieval, in two independent samples (n=734, age 7-82 years). (2) Assess associations with age and the ability to predict memory comparing task-general FC and memory-modulated FC. In a multiverse-inspired approach, we performed tests across multiple analytic choices. Results showed that relationships differed based on these analytic choices, were often weak, and mainly present in the cohort with the most data. Significant relationships indicated that (i) memory-modulated FC predicted memory performance and associated with memory in an age-invariant manner. (ii) In line with the so-called neural dedifferentiation view, task-general FC showed lower segregation with higher age in adults which was associated with worse memory performance. In development, although there were only weak signs of a neural differentiation, that is, gradually higher segregation with higher age, we observed similar lower segregation-worse memory relationships. This age-invariant relationships between FC and episodic memory suggest that network segregation is pivotal for memory across the healthy lifespan.

">Balancing Act: A Neural Trade-Off Between Coherence and Creativity in Spontaneous Speech</a></h4>

              
                Effective communication involves a delicate balance between generating novel, engaging content and maintaining a coherent narrative. The neural mechanisms underlying this balance between coherence and creativity in discourse production remain unexplored. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between coherence and creativity in spontaneous speech, with a specific focus on the interaction among three key neural networks: the Default Mode Network, Multiple Demand Network, and the Semantic Control Network. To this end, we conducted a two-part analysis. At the behavioural level, we analysed speech samples produced in response to topic cues, computing measures of global coherence (indexing the degree of connectedness to the main topic) and Divergent Semantic Integration (DSI; reflecting the diversity of ideas incorporated in the narrative). Coherence and divergence in speech were negatively correlated, suggesting a trade-off between maintaining a coherent narrative structure and incorporating creative elements. At the neural level, higher global coherence was associated with greater activation in the Multiple Demand Network, emphasising its role in organising and sustaining logical flow in discourse production. In contrast, functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that higher DSI was related to greater coupling between the Default Mode and Multiple Demand Networks, suggesting that creative speech relies on a dynamic interplay between associative and executive processes. These results provide new insights into the cognitive and neural processes underpinning spontaneous speech production, highlighting the complex interplay between different brain networks in managing competing demands of being coherent and creative.

">Aggregation promoting sequences rather than phosphorylation are essential for Tau-mediated toxicity in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Background: Disease-modifying therapies for tauopathies like Alzheimer's disease have targeted Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, as both pathological manifestations are implicated in Tau-mediated toxicity. However, the relative contributions of these pathology-linked changes to Tau neurotoxicity remain unclear. Methods: Leveraging the genetic tractability of Drosophila, we generated multiple inducible human Tau transgenes with altered phosphorylation status and/or aggregation propensity. Their individual and combined impact was tested in vivo by quantifying Tau accumulation and neurodegenerative phenotypes in the aging fly nervous system. Results: We report that phospho-mimicking Tau (hTau2N4RE14) induced profound neurodegeneration, supporting a neurotoxic role for phosphorylation. However, when we rendered hTau2N4RE14 aggregation incompetent, by deleting the 306VQIVYK311 motif in the microtubule-binding region, neurotoxicity was abolished. Moreover, a peptide inhibitor targeting this motif efficaciously reduced Tau toxicity in aging Drosophila. Conclusion: Neurodegeneration mediated by Tau hyperphosphorylation is gated via at least one aggregation-mediating motif on the protein. This highlights the primacy of blocking Tau aggregation in therapy, perhaps without the need to clear phosphorylated species.

">Cortical projection neurons with distinct axonal connectivity employ ribosomal complexes with distinct protein compositions</a></h4>

              
                Diverse subtypes of cortical projection neurons (PN) form long-range axonal projections that are responsible for distinct sensory, motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions. Translational control has been identified at multiple stages of PN development, but how translational regulation contributes to formation of distinct, subtype-specific long-range circuits is poorly understood. Ribosomal complexes (RCs) exhibit variations of their component proteins, with an increasing set of examples that confer specialized translational control. Here, we directly compare the protein compositions of RCs in vivo from two closely related cortical neuron subtypes-cortical output "subcerebral PN" (SCPN) and interhemispheric "callosal PN" (CPN)- during establishment of their distinct axonal connectivity. Using retrograde labeling of subtype-specific somata, purification by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, ribosome immunoprecipitation, and ultra-low-input mass spectrometry, we identify distinct protein compositions of RCs from these two subtypes. Strikingly, we identify 16 associated proteins reliably and exclusively detected only in RCs of SCPN. 10 of these proteins have known interaction with components of ribosomes; we further validated ribosome interaction with protein kinase C epsilon (PRKCE), a candidate with roles in synaptogenesis. PRKCE and a subset of SCPN-specific candidate ribosome-associated proteins also exhibit enriched gene expression by SCPN. Together, these results indicate that ribosomal complexes exhibit subtype-specific protein composition in distinct subtypes of cortical projection neurons during development, and identify potential candidates for further investigation of function in translational regulation involved in subtype-specific circuit formation.

">Sexual Failure Decreases Sweet Taste Perception in Male Drosophila via Dopaminergic Signaling</a></h4>

              
                Sweet taste perception, a critical aspect of the initiation of feeding behavior, is primarily regulated by an animal's internal metabolic state. However, non-metabolic factors, such as motivational and emotional states, can also influence peripheral sensory processing and hence feeding behavior. While mating experience is known to induce motivational and emotional changes, its broader impact on other innate behaviors such as feeding remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we demonstrated that mating failure of male fruit flies suppressed sweet taste perception via dopamine signaling in specific neural circuitry. Upon repetitive failure in courtship, male flies exhibited a sustained yet reversible decline of sweet taste perception, as measured by the proboscis extension reflex (PER) towards sweet tastants as well as the neuronal activity of sweet-sensing Gr5a+ neurons in the proboscis. Mechanistically, we identified a small group of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) and innervating with Gr5a+ neurons as the key modulator. Repetitive sexual failure decreased the activity of these dopaminergic neurons and in turn suppressed Gr5a+ neurons via Dop1R1 and Dop2R receptors. Our findings revealed a critical role for dopaminergic signaling in integrating reproductive experience with appetitive sensory processing, providing new insights into the complex interactions between different innate behaviors and the role of brain's reward systems in regulating internal motivational and emotional states.

">Impact of dopaminergic modulation on the state transitions of striatal medium spiny neuron sub-types - a computational study</a></h4>

              
                Medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the striatum are known for their bistable membrane potential leading to two states - a hyperpolarized down-state and relatively depolarized up-state. Glutamatergic inputs from the hippocampus play a key role in switching the cell to up-state. This gating is known to play a key role in regulating when other synaptic inputs, such as from the cortex, should generate action potentials and when they should be considered as noise. Therefore, it is crucial for the transition between states to occur normally as abnormal gating has implications in conditions such as Schizophrenia. Although dopamine is reported to modulate ion channels of MSN sub-types - dMSN and iMSN, its influence on the state transition times and up-state dwell times are being reported here. This was done using biophysically constrained spiny models of dMSN and iMSN with explicit dopamine receptors. Additionally, strong correlation between state transition times and spiking frequencies of MSN sub-types was observed.

In this study, we demonstrate that TAM expressed a distinct ''neural growth'' gene signature. TAM actively enhance neural growth within tumors and directly promote neurites outgrowth. We identify secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1) as a key mediator of TAM-driven neural growth activity, which triggers neuronal mTORC2 signaling. Leveraging this new neural growth function, which added to the TAM wound healing properties, we explored TAM potential to repair central nervous system. Adoptive transfer of in vitro-generated TAM in a severe complete-compressive-contusive spinal cord injury (scSCI) model, not only repaired the damaged neural parenchyma by improving tissue oxygenation, ECM remodeling, and dampening chronic inflammation, but also resulted in neural regrowth and partial functional motor recovery. Proteomic analysis and subsequent functional validation confirmed that TAM-induced spinal cord regeneration is mediated through the activation of neural mTORC2 signaling pathways. Collectively, our data unveil a previously unrecognized role of TAM in tumor innervation, neural growth, and neural tissue repair.

">Navigating the Maze: Identifying Potential Pitfalls in Attention State Classification from fMRI Brain Patterns</a></h4>

              
                Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) is a powerful technique to decode brain states from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns. In neurofeedback (NF) applications, it has been used to perform real-time classification of brain activity patterns, establishing a closed-loop system that provides immediate feedback to the participants, enabling them to learn to control a complex mental state. However, MVPA has many potential limitations when applied to fMRI datasets (especially in real-time analysis) arising from small effect sizes, small number of training samples, high dimensionality of the data and, more generally, design choices. All these factors might produce inaccurate classification results. In this work, we followed a previous NF paradigm for sustained attention training. Participants were presented with composite images superimposing faces and scenes. They were instructed to focus on one class (either face or scene) for an extended period. A logistic regression classifier was trained to determine whether participants were adequately focusing on the instructed category based on their fMRI data. We analysed the classification outputs of the no-feedback training runs using various classifier settings, including whole brain data and different masking approaches, combined with different methods for the computation of single-trial fMRI responses. Furthermore, a ventricle mask was used as a control condition for the classification task, and simulations were carried out to assess the influence of the class order on the classification performances. We found inflation of the decoding accuracy for several common design choices and confounders. In particular, motion artefacts and low frequency drifts coupled with the task timing might have artificially increased the accuracy scores. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that fixed order in the presentation of experimental conditions resulted in further inflation of the classification accuracies especially in GLM-based and average-based trial estimate methods. We discuss the drawbacks of applying MVPA using the analysed sustained attention paradigm and provide insights for future improvements.

">FGF21 Analogue PF-05231023 on Alcohol Consumption and Neuronal Activity in the Nucleus Accumbens</a></h4>

              
                Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a liver-derived hormone known to suppress alcohol consumption in mice and non-human primates. However, the role of FGF21 in modulating environmental and behavioural factors driving alcohol consumption, such as cue-driven responses and effortful actions to obtain alcohol, and its effects on neural activity related to consumption, remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the impact of PF-05231023, a long-acting FGF21 analogue, across multiple dimensions of alcohol consumption and motivation. PF-05231023 reduced alcohol intake and preference in a dose- and sex-specific manner; diminished approach behaviours following an alcohol but not sucrose cue; and decreased lever-pressing under a progressive-ratio schedule, both alone and when combined with the GLP-1 agonist Exendin-4. Additionally, PF-05231023 altered the microstructure of alcohol consumption by shortening drinking bouts and increased the recruitment of nucleus accumbens (Acb) neurons associated with bout termination. These findings demonstrate that PF-05231023 broadly suppresses alcohol-motivated behaviours and that targeting FGF21 signaling in combination with GLP-1 agonists may enhance therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, the observed reductions in alcohol consumption following PF-05231023 appear to involve diminished alcohol palatability and modulation of neuronal activity from distinct subsets of Acb neurons.

">In vivo multiplex imaging of dynamic neurochemical networks with designed far-red dopamine sensors</a></h4>

              
                Neurochemical signals like dopamine (DA) play a crucial role in a variety of brain functions through intricate interactions with other neuromodulators and intracellular signaling pathways. However, studying these complex networks has been hindered by the challenge of detecting multiple neurochemicals in vivo simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we developed a single-protein chemigenetic DA sensor, HaloDA1.0, which combines a cpHaloTag-chemical dye approach with the G protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) strategy, providing high sensitivity for DA, sub-second response kinetics, and an extensive spectral range from far-red to near-infrared. When used together with existing green and red fluorescent neuromodulator sensors, Ca2+ indicators, cAMP sensors, and optogenetic tools, HaloDA1.0 provides high versatility for multiplex imaging in cultured neurons, brain slices, and behaving animals, facilitating in-depth studies of dynamic neurochemical networks.

">Association of Bile Acids with Connectivity of Executive Control and Default Mode Networks in Patients with Major Depression</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Bile acids may contribute to pathophysiologic markers of Alzheimers disease, including disruptions of the executive control network (ECN) and the default mode network (DMN). Cognitive dysfunction is common in major depressive disorder (MDD), but whether bile acids impact these networks in MDD patients is unknown. Methods: Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans and blood measures of four bile acids from 74 treatment-naive adults with MDD were analyzed. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) seeds were used to examine connectivity of the ECN and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seeds were used for the DMN. Using a whole-brain analysis, the functional connectivity of these seeds was correlated with serum levels chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and its bacterially-derived secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid (LCA). Results: CDCA levels were strongly and inversely correlated with connectivity between DLPFC regions of the ECN (R2= .401, p<.001). LCA levels were strongly and positively correlated with connectivity of the DLPFC and left inferior temporal cortex of the ECN (R2=.263, p<.001). The LCA/CDCA ratio was strongly and positively correlated with connectivity of the DLPFC with two components of the ECN: bilateral inferior temporal cortex and the left superior and inferior parietal lobules (all R2>.24, all p<.001). For the DMN, the LCA/CDCA ratio was strongly and negatively correlated with connectivity of the PCC with multiple bilateral insula regions (all R2>0.25, all p<.001). Conclusions: The relationship between LCA and CDCA levels and functional connectivity of the ECN and DMN suggests potential shared pathophysiologic processes between Alzheimers disease and MDD.

">Red-shifted GRAB acetylcholine sensors for multiplex imaging in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) is essential in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Recent studies highlight the significance of interactions between ACh and various neuromodulators in regulating complex behaviors. The ability to simultaneously image ACh and other neuromodulators can provide valuable information regarding the mechanisms underlying these behaviors. Here, we developed a series of red fluorescent G protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) ACh sensors, with a wide detection range and expanded spectral profile. The high-affinity sensor, rACh1h, reliably detects ACh release in various brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and cortex. Moreover, rACh1h can be co-expressed with green fluorescent sensors in order to record ACh release together with other neurochemicals in various behavioral contexts using fiber photometry and two-photon imaging, with high spatiotemporal resolution. These new ACh sensors can therefore provide valuable new insights regarding the functional role of the cholinergic system under both physiological and pathological conditions.

">Sensory expectations shape neural population dynamics in motor circuits</a></h4>

              
                The neural basis of movement preparation has been extensively studied during self-initiated actions where motor cortical activity during preparation shows a lawful relationship to the parameters of the subsequent action. However, movements are regularly triggered and constantly corrected based on sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body or environment. Since such disturbances are often predictable and since preparing for disturbances would make movements better, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans and monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of a future mechanical perturbation, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, scaling directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent perturbation signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Based on neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm, we show that this neural geometry emerges through training, but only when the incoming sensory information indicating perturbation direction coincides with - or is preceded by - a condition-independent signal indicating that a perturbation has occurred. Thus, motor circuit dynamics are shaped by future sensory inputs, providing clear empirical support for the idea that movement is governed by the sophisticated manipulation of sensory feedback.

">Identification of neuron-glia signaling feedback in human schizophrenia using patient-derived, mix-and-match forebrain assembloids</a></h4>

              
                Although abnormal activities across multiple cell types are believed to contribute to the development of various neurodevelopmental disorders, current brain organoid technologies fall short in accurately modeling the dynamic cellular interactions in the human brain. Recently, we developed a cellular reconstitution technology to create human forebrain assembloids with enhanced cellular diversity, representing dynamic interactions between neurons and glial cells. Here, we created patient-derived, mix-and-match forebrain assembloids, in which neurons, astrocytes, and microglia from both healthy individuals and schizophrenia patients were reconstituted in a combinatorial manner, and identified aberrant cellular interactions between neurons and glial cells in human schizophrenia. At the early stage, schizophrenia forebrain assembloids showed premature neurogenesis induced by the abnormal proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. Integrated modular analysis of gene expression in post-mortem schizophrenia brain tissue and brain assembloids found increased expression of tumor protein p53 (TP53) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells 4 (NFATC4), which functioned as master transcriptional regulators to epigenetically reprogram the transcriptome involved in the cellular dynamics of neuronal progenitor cells, leading to premature neurogenesis. At the later stage, we observed weakened structures of laminar organization of the cortical layers in forebrain assembloids and identified the neuron-dependent transcriptional plasticity of glial cells and their altered signaling feedback with neurons, in which neuronal urocortin (UCN) and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F (PTPRF) elicited the expression of Wnt family member 11 (WNT11) and thrombospondin 4 (THBS4) in astrocytes and microglia, respectively. These aberrant signaling axes altered the neuronal transcriptome associated with neuronal response to various stimuli and synthetic processes of biomolecules, resulting in reduced synapse connectivity. Thus, we elucidated developmental stage-specific, multifactorial mechanisms by which dynamic cellular interplay among neural progenitor cells, neurons, and glial cells contribute to the development of the human schizophrenia brain. Our study further demonstrated the potential and applicability of patient-derived forebrain assembloid technology to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental disorders.

	<p>Background/Objectives:&amp;amp;nbsp;Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an obligate food-borne intracellular parasite, causes severe neuropathology by establishing a persistent infection in the host brain. We have previously shown that T. gondii infection induces severe neuropathology in the brain manifested by increased nitric oxide production, oxidative stress, glial activation/BBB damage, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine glia maturation factor-beta and induced apoptosis. Methods: The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the serum amyloid P (SAP) components, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;), caspase 1 (Casp 1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;) and complement 3 (C3) gene expressions on the 10th, 20th and 30th days after infection with T. gondii in the neuroimmunopathogenesis of toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) in mouse brains by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The study also aimed to determine whether there was a correlation between the markers included in the study on these critical days, which had not previously been investigated. The mRNA expression levels of SAP components, NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, Casp 1, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; and C3 were examined. Results: The most notable outcome of this investigation was the observation that SAP components exhibited a 13.9-fold increase on day 10 post-infection, followed by a rapid decline in the subsequent periods. In addition, IL-1&amp;amp;beta; expression increased 20-fold, while SAP components decreased 13-fold on day 20 after infection. Additionally, the TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, Casp 1 and NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B expression levels were consistently elevated to above normal levels at each time point. Conclusions: This study identified SAP components, NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, Casp 1 and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha; expressions as playing critical roles in TE neuroimmunopathogenesis. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate SAP components during the transition from acute systemic infection to early/medium chronic and chronic infection and to explore the relationship between SAP components and other nuclear factors/pro-cytokines.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent research has explored the presence of subthreshold autistic traits (ATs) in individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD), suggesting that these traits may contribute to the severity of BPD symptoms and increase the risk of other mental health issues, including suicidal behaviors. This study aims to investigate the relationship between ATs and affective symptoms, such as mood instability and suicidality, in people diagnosed with BPD. Methods: A total of 48 subjects with BPD were assessed with self-report questionnaires including the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), the mood spectrum self-report version (MOODS-SR) and the ruminative response scale (RRS). Results: Subjects with significant ATs scored higher than BPD subjects in all domains and in the total score of AdAS Spectrum, RRS, and MOODS-SR, as well as in the items investigating suicidality. RRS total score, its depression domain, and the MOODS-SR rhythmicity domain, as well as suicidality, were predictors of the presence of ATs. Conclusions: Our data confirm the relationship between the presence of clinically significant ATs and affective symptoms, ruminative thinking, and suicidality in patients with BPD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Military aviators can be exposed to extreme physiological stressors, including decompression stress, G-forces, as well as intermittent hypoxia and/or hyperoxia, which may contribute to neurobiological dysfunction/damage. This study aimed to investigate the levels of neurological biomarkers in military aviators to assess the potential risk of long-term brain injury and neurodegeneration. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 48 Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) aviators and 48 non-aviator CAF controls. Plasma samples were analyzed for biomarkers of glial activation (GFAP), axonal damage (NF-L, pNF-H), oxidative stress (PRDX-6), and neurodegeneration (T-tau), along with S100b, NSE, and UCHL-1. The biomarker concentrations were quantified using multiplexed immunoassays. Results: The aviators exhibited significantly elevated levels of GFAP, NF-L, PRDX-6, and T-tau compared to the CAF controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), indicating increased glial activation, axonal injury, and oxidative stress. Trends toward higher levels of S100b, NSE, and UCHL-1 were observed but were not statistically significant. The elevated biomarker levels suggest cumulative brain damage, raising concerns about potential long-term neurological impairments. Conclusions: Military aviators are at increased risk for neurobiological injury, including glial and axonal damage, oxidative stress, and early neurodegeneration. These findings emphasize the importance of proactive monitoring and further research to understand the long-term impacts of high-altitude flight on brain health and to develop strategies for mitigating cognitive decline and neurodegenerative risks in this population.</p>

	<p>Radiation therapy is widely recognized as an efficacious modality for treating neoplasms located within the craniofacial region. Nevertheless, this approach is not devoid of risks, predominantly concerning potential harm to the neural structures. Adverse effects may encompass focal cerebral necrosis, cognitive function compromise, cerebrovascular pathology, spinal cord injury, and detriment to the neural fibers constituting the brachial plexus. With increasing survival rates among oncology patients, evaluating post-treatment quality of life has become crucial in assessing the benefits of radiation therapy. Consequently, it is imperative to investigate therapeutic strategies to mitigate cerebral complications from radiation exposure. Current management of radiation-induced cerebral damage involves corticosteroids and bevacizumab, with preclinical research on antioxidants and thalidomide. Despite these efforts, an optimal treatment remains elusive. Recent studies suggest the gut microbiota&amp;amp;rsquo;s involvement in neurologic pathologies. This review aims to discuss the causes and existing treatments for radiation-induced cerebral injury and explore gut microbiota modulation as a potential therapeutic strategy.</p>

">Stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation in endothelial cells disrupts blood-retinal barrier integrity causing neurodegeneration.</a></h4>

              
                Increased vascular leakage and endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction are major features of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we investigated the mechanisms leading to EC dysregulation and asked whether altered mitochondrial dynamics in ECs impinge on vascular barrier integrity and neurodegeneration. We show that ocular hypertension, a major risk factor to develop glaucoma, induced mitochondrial fragmentation in retinal capillary ECs accompanied by increased oxidative stress and ultrastructural defects. Analysis of EC mitochondrial components revealed overactivation of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a central regulator of mitochondrial fission, during glaucomatous damage. Pharmacological inhibition or EC-specific in vivo gene delivery of a dominant negative DRP1 mutant was sufficient to rescue mitochondrial volume, reduce vascular leakage, and increase expression of the tight junction claudin-5 (CLDN5). We further demonstrate that EC-targeted CLDN5 gene augmentation restored blood-retinal-barrier integrity, promoted neuronal survival, and improved light-evoked visual behaviors in glaucomatous mice. Our findings reveal that preserving mitochondrial homeostasis and EC function are valuable strategies to enhance neuroprotection and improve vision in glaucoma.

">Collapse of directed functional hierarchy under classical serotonergic psychedelics</a></h4>

              
                It has been proposed that psychedelics induce profound functional changes to the hierarchical organisation of the human brain. Yet the term hierarchy is currently not well defined in neuroscience. Here, we use a precise definition of hierarchy, grounded in the theory of thermodynamics, which allows the quantification of temporal asymmetry in the directionality of information flow. We quantified the changes to the directed functional hierarchy of the brain under three classical serotonergic psychedelics - psilocybin, LSD and DMT. We found that all three psychedelics induce a reduction of the directed functional hierarchy, such that they display lower levels of global and network temporal asymmetry and a contraction of the two main patterns of variation of temporal asymmetry. Crucially, our results imply that the brain's directed functional hierarchy is collapsed under psychedelics, interpreted as yielding a more flexible brain. This enhanced flexibility in brain organisation under psychedelics may underpin the altered cognition and behaviour observed during these states, and, possibly afterwards, be suggestive of therapeutic potential.

In this study, 66 participants with normal cognition, 59 with subjective cognitive decline, 12 with mild cognitive impairment, and 11 with Alzheimer’s disease dementia were included in the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE) cohort. A regional asymmetry index, denoting the left–right asymmetry of β-amyloid plaques, was derived for each region based on the Anatomical Automatic Labeling atlas. The level of β-amyloid plaques in each region was compared among different clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease using the analysis of variance. An additional correlation analysis examined the relationship between each region of interest’s cognitive performance scores and asymmetry index values. We found that β-amyloid appears to be lateralized in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, there is a significant correlation between β-amyloid asymmetry in various brain regions and cognition. The observed Aβ lateralization could potentially be utilized as a neuroimaging biomarker throughout AD progression.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied both in research settings and clinically, notably in treating depression through the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). We have recently shown that transcranial alternating current stimulation of the dlPFC partially entrains muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) to the stimulus. We, therefore, aimed to further explore the sympathetic properties of the dlPFC, hypothesizing that single-pulse TMS could generate de novo MSNA bursts. Microneurography was performed on the right common peroneal nerve in 12 participants. TMS pulses were then delivered to the ipsilateral dlPFC at resting motor threshold (MT) of the first dorsal interosseous muscle and at powers 20 below, 10 below, 10% above, and 20% above MT. The MT and 10% above MT intensities were also used to stimulate the right motor cortex and shoulder. Comparisons between stimulus intensities at the same site and between sites at the same intensities revealed no differences in MSNA burst frequency, burst incidence, or single MSNA spikes. Most stimulus trains, however, showed reduced burst frequency and incidence from baseline, regardless of site. This suggests that the TMS itself was evoking arousal-based sympathoinhibition, independent of dlPFC influences. It seems the dlPFC is capable of modulating MSNA but cannot directly generate bursts.</span>

Substantial evidence shows that, during choice deliberation, the brain can retrieve prospective decision outcomes. However, decisions are seldom made in a vacuum.

Nevertheless, most investigations of retrieval processes examined decisions in isolation, disregarding the context in which they occur. Here, we studied how context shapes prospective outcome retrieval during deliberation. We designed a decision-making task where participants were presented with object–context pairs and made decisions which led to a certain outcome. We show during deliberation, likely outcomes were retrieved in transient patterns of neural activity, as early as 3 s before participants decided. The strength of prospective outcome retrieval explains participants’ behavioral efficiency, but only when context affects the decision outcome. Our results suggest context imparts strong constraints on retrieval processes and how neural representations are shaped during decision-making.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Anti-MAG polyneuropathy is a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathies, particularly MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance) and Waldenstr&amp;amp;ouml;m macroglobulinemia. It is characterized by a subacute onset of distal sensory symptoms, with distal motor dysfunction typically appearing only in the later stages of the disease. The condition is caused by the presence of autoantibodies directed against myelin-associated glycoprotein, a structural protein of myelin. This leads to abnormalities in electrophysiological studies, such as markedly delayed distal latencies without conduction blocks or temporal dispersion of potentials. While rituximab (RTX) is the primary treatment, its efficacy is limited, with improvement seen in only 30&amp;amp;ndash;50% of patients. Recently, acute worsening of symptoms after RTX treatment has been increasingly reported. Methods: This systematic review compiles case reports and series from inception to June 2024 published on Scopus, PubMed or Cochrane, documenting acute exacerbations after RTX treatment in patients with anti-MAG polyneuropathy. Additionally, we present a case report from our institution that highlights this phenomenon. Results: We identified 13 clinical cases of acute deterioration in patients with anti-MAG polyneuropathy. Among these, eight patients (62%) achieved full recovery following additional treatment, while five patients (38%) did not return to their previous level of function. Plasmapheresis led to complete recovery in all four patients who received this intervention. Interestingly, many patients also experienced recovery after discontinuation of rituximab (RTX) treatment without the need for further therapeutic intervention. Conclusions: Acute clinical deterioration following RTX treatment in anti-MAG polyneuropathy is a possible occurrence. However, to date, no studies have assessed the true prevalence of this phenomenon. Further research is warranted to identify potential predictors of worsening following RTX treatment in this patient population.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders marked by challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. People with ASD may exhibit repetitive behaviors, unique ways of learning, and different ways of interacting with the world. The term &amp;amp;ldquo;spectrum&amp;amp;rdquo; reflects the wide variability in how ASD manifests in individuals, including differences in abilities, symptoms, and support needs, and conditions characterized by difficulties in social interactions, communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology, with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid. Previous studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation have shown promising results, suggesting nervous system susceptibility to electromagnetic fields, with evidence indicating that extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) treatment may modulate inflammatory responses through multiple pathways, including the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;, and the enhancement of anti-inflammatory mediators. Methods: This pilot study included 20 children (ages 2&amp;amp;ndash;13) with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD. A 15-week protocol involved ELF-EMF treatments using the SEQEX device, with specific day and night programs. Assessment was conducted through standardized pre- and post-treatment tests: Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-4, Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test-4, and Conner&amp;amp;rsquo;s 3GI. Results: Statistically significant improvements were observed in receptive language (PPVT-4: from 74.07 to 90.40, p = 0.002) and expressive language (EOWPVT-4: from 84.17 to 90.50, p = 0.041). Notable reductions, with statistical significance, were found in externalizing problems across both age groups (1.5&amp;amp;ndash;5 years: p = 0.028; 6&amp;amp;ndash;18 years: p = 0.027), with particular improvement in attention and behavioral problems. The results were observed over a short period of 15 weeks, therefore excluding the possibility of coincidental age-related gains, that would typically occur during a normal developmental timeframe. Parent evaluations showed significant reduction in ASD symptoms, particularly in the 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;5 years group (p = 0.046). Conclusions: ELF-EMF treatment demonstrated a high safety profile and efficacy in mitigating ASD-related symptoms. The observed improvements suggest both direct effects on central and autonomic nervous systems and indirect effects through inflammatory response modulation. Further studies are needed to confirm these promising results through broader demographics and randomized control designs.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive impairment poses a significant global health challenge, emphasizing the critical need for early detection and intervention. Traditional diagnostics like neuroimaging and clinical evaluations are often subjective, costly, and inaccessible, especially in resource-poor settings. Previous research has focused on speech analysis primarily conducted using English data, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. Methods: In this study, we present our results from the INTERSPEECH 2024 TAUKADIAL Challenge, where we aimed to automatically detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and predict cognitive scores for English and Chinese speakers (169 in total). Our approach leverages Whisper, a speech foundation model, to extract language-agnostic speech embeddings. We then utilize ensemble models to incorporate task-specific information. Results: Our model achieved unweighted average recall of 81.83% in an MCI classification task, and root mean squared error of 1.196 in cognitive score prediction task, which placed the model at the second and the first position, respectively, in the ranking for each task. Comparison between language-agnostic and language-specific models reveals the importance of capturing language-specific nuances for accurate cognitive impairment prediction. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of language-specific ensemble modeling with Whisper embeddings in enabling scalable, non-invasive cognitive health assessments of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, achieving state-of-the-art results in multilingual settings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent studies have investigated the effects of ketamine on fear memory in animals. However, it is unclear if ketamine might affect avoidance memory and emotional behaviors concomitantly. In this study, we compared the effects of (R,S)- and (S)-ketamine in modulating avoidance responses, and depression- and anxiety-related behaviors in stressed mice. Methods: Mice were previously exposed to inescapable footshock stress, and 24 h later, they were trained in the active avoidance task. (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-isomer was administered 1 h prior to re-exposition to the active avoidance task. Three hours after drug administration, mice were tested in the tail suspension, followed by the open field test. Results: Neither form of ketamine affected avoidance memory retrieval, while (S)-ketamine, and tangentially, (R,S) reduced avoidance responses during re-exposition to aversive stimulus. In the tail suspension test, (R,S)- and (S)-ketamine equally evoked antidepressant effects. In the open field test, the racemic mixture, but not (S)-ketamine, induced anxiolytic actions. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the therapeutic potential of ketamine for the treatment of stress-related disorders, with (R,S)-ketamine being more effective in simultaneously inducing antidepressant and anxiolytic responses and reducing avoidance responses in stressed mice.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) resting tremor is thought to be initiated in the basal ganglia and amplified in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Because stress worsens tremor, the noradrenergic system may play a role in amplifying tremor. We tested if and how propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduces PD tremor and whether or not this effect is specific to stressful conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cross-over, double-blind intervention study, participants with PD resting tremor received propranolol (40 mg, single dose) or placebo (counter-balanced) on 2 different days. During both days, we assessed tremor severity (with accelerometry) and tremor-related brain activity (with functional magnetic resonance imaging), as well as heart rate and pupil diameter, while subjects performed a stressful cognitive load task that has been linked to the noradrenergic system. We tested for effects of drug (propranolol vs placebo) and stress (cognitive load vs rest) on tremor power and tremor-related brain activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 27 PD patients with prominent resting tremor. Tremor power significantly increased during cognitive load versus rest (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 13.8; <i>p</i> = 0.001; ηp2$$ {\upeta}_{\mathrm{p}}^2 $$ = 0.42) and decreased by propranolol versus placebo (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 6.4; <i>p</i> = 0.02; ηp2$$ {\upeta}_{\mathrm{p}}^2 $$ = 0.25), but there was no interaction. We observed task-related brain activity in a stress-sensitive cognitive control network and tremor power-related activity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Propranolol significantly reduced tremor-related activity in the motor cortex compared to placebo (<i>F</i>[1,21] = 5.3; <i>p</i> = 0.03; ηp2$$ {\upeta}_{\mathrm{p}}^2 $$ = 0.20), irrespective of cognitive load.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that propranolol has a general, context-independent, tremor-reducing effect that may be implemented at the level of the primary motor cortex. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This article is my recollection of events surrounding the discovery of head direction (HD) cells by Jim Ranck in 1984 and the first journal publications 6 years later. Ranck first described the fundamental properties of HD cells qualitatively in a <i>Society for Neuroscience</i> abstract (1984) and in the proceedings to a conference. Ranck, however, was convinced by Bob Muller, a faculty colleague in the lab, to delay writing up Jim's discovery until they developed a two-spot video tracking system, which would enable proper quantitative analyses. The development of this system was complex and was still undergoing development when I arrived in the Brooklyn lab in 1986. By this time, Jim had begun to refocus his efforts on thinking about the relationship between space and manifolds and was no longer engaged in active research. It thus befell me (unintentionally) to complete the recordings of these fascinating cells. This endeavor involved recording additional HD cells with the new video tracking system, monitoring the cells' responses following a series of environmental manipulations, and performing quantitative analyses on the data. Throughout 1987, I recorded most of the cells that would form the basis for our 1990 papers published in the <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i>. Along the way, there were many events and emotions: luck, excitement, humor, frustration, tutorials, unintended outcomes, and long-lasting friendships. I was guided and supported during this time by both Bob Muller and John Kubie, but remain forever grateful to Jim for this wonderful opportunity.</p>

                Poluben et al. show that prostate cancer cell resistance to an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist targeting the full-length AR (ARfl) is driven by an AR spice variant (ARv7) that functions independently of ARfl but requires adaptations associated with increased chromatin accessibility and is dependent on nuclear factor I transcription factors.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Electroencephalogram (EEG) brain networks describe the driving and synchronous relationships among multiple brain regions and can be used to identify different emotional states. However, methods for extracting interpretable structural features from brain networks are still lacking. In the current study, a novel deep learning structure comprising both an attention mechanism and a domain adversarial strategy is proposed to extract discriminant and interpretable features from brain networks. Specifically, the attention mechanism enhances the contribution of crucial rhythms and subnetworks for emotion recognition, whereas the domain-adversarial module improves the generalization performance of our proposed model for cross-subject tasks. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method for subject-independent emotion recognition tasks with the SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset (SEED) and the EEGs recorded in our laboratory. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can effectively improve the classification accuracy of different emotions compared with commonly used methods such as domain adversarial neural networks. On the basis of the extracted network features, we also revealed crucial rhythms and subnetwork structures for emotion processing, which are consistent with those found in previous studies. Our proposed method not only improves the classification performance of brain networks but also provides a novel tool for revealing emotion processing mechanisms.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) is less investigated than the more common late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) despite its more aggressive course. A cortical signature of EOAD was recently proposed and may facilitate EOAD investigation. Here, we aimed to validate this proposed MRI biomarker of EOAD neurodegeneration in an Appalachian clinical cohort. We also compared differences in EOAD signature atrophy in participants with biomarker-positive EOAD, LOAD, early-onset non-AD pathologies, and cognitively normal individuals. Cortical thinning was reliably detected in eight of nine signature areas of persons with EOAD relative to cognitively normal individuals despite very early disease stage. Additionally, individuals with EOAD showed thinner cortex in most signature regions relative to those with early-onset non-AD pathologies. EOAD and LOAD showed similar cortical atrophy within most EOAD signature regions. Whole-brain vertex-wise cortical analyses supported these findings. Furthermore, signature cortical atrophy showed expected relationships with measures of global and specific cognitive and functional status. This investigation further validates and expands upon the recently defined EOAD signature and suggests its robustness within a rural population, even at early disease stage. Larger scale and longitudinal studies employing this marker of EOAD neurodegeneration are needed to further understand clinical effects and appropriate management of persons with EOAD.</span>

Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and tract volumes were measured for 14 striato-cortical and 12 thalamo-cortical tract bundles. Data were examined using linear regressions for group by age effects and group plus age effects, and false discovery rate correction was applied. Following false discovery rate correction, volumes of thalamocortical tracts to premotor, pericentral, and parietal regions were significantly reduced in autism spectrum disorder compared to thalamo-cortical groups, but no group by age interactions were found. Uncorrected results suggested additional main effects of group and age might be present for both tract volume and mean diffusivity across multiple subcortico-cortical tracts.

	<p>Objectives: Growing evidence suggests a link between organophosphate insecticides and depression disorder. These chemicals are metabolized and subsequently expelled through the urinary tract. The present study aims to investigate whether dialkyl phosphate metabolites associate with depression score and severity among the general population. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). All urinary dialkyl phosphate metabolites were quantitatively analyzed. The survey&amp;amp;rsquo;s complex design parameters and sampling weights were considered. Results: 3035 eligible individuals were included. The estimated prevalence of mild and major depression was 18.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.9&amp;amp;ndash;19.7%) and 9.9% (95% CI: 8.7&amp;amp;ndash;11.0%). For each incremental unit in the level of urinary dimethyl phosphate (DMP), individuals were found to have a higher depression score of 0.77 and a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.13) for mild depression and 2.75 (95% CI: 2.74&amp;amp;ndash;2.76) for major depression. Conclusions: Our findings indicate positive and independent associations between urinary dialkyl phosphate metabolites and an elevated risk of depression among the general population.</p>

	<p>Background: Emotions play a crucial role in people&amp;amp;rsquo;s lives, profoundly affecting their cognition, decision-making, and interpersonal communication. Emotion recognition based on brain signals has become a significant challenge in the fields of affective computing and human-computer interaction. Methods: Addressing the issue of inaccurate feature extraction and low accuracy of existing deep learning models in emotion recognition, this paper proposes a multi-channel automatic classification model for emotion EEG signals named DACB, which is based on dual attention mechanisms, convolutional neural networks, and bidirectional long short-term memory networks. DACB extracts features in both temporal and spatial dimensions, incorporating not only convolutional neural networks but also SE attention mechanism modules for learning the importance of different channel features, thereby enhancing the network&amp;amp;rsquo;s performance. DACB also introduces dot product attention mechanisms to learn the importance of spatial and temporal features, effectively improving the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s accuracy. Results: The accuracy of this method in single-shot validation tests on the SEED-IV and DREAMER (Valence-Arousal-Dominance three-classification) datasets is 99.96% and 87.52%, 90.06%, and 89.05%, respectively. In 10-fold cross-validation tests, the accuracy is 99.73% and 84.26%, 85.40%, and 85.02%, outperforming other models. Conclusions: This demonstrates that the DACB model achieves high accuracy in emotion classification tasks, demonstrating outstanding performance and generalization ability and providing new directions for future research in EEG signal recognition.</p>

	<p>Background: Eye movement research serves as a critical tool for assessing brain function, diagnosing neurological and psychiatric disorders, and understanding cognition and behavior. Sex differences have largely been under reported or ignored in neurological research. However, eye movement features provide biomarkers that are useful for disease classification with superior accuracy and robustness compared to previous classifiers for neurological diseases. Neurological diseases have a sex specificity, yet eye movement analysis has not been specific to our understanding of sex differences. Methods: The study involved subjects recruited from 804 sites equipped with RightEye Vision Systems, primarily located in optometry practices across the United States. Subjects completed six eye movement assessments: circular smooth pursuit (CSP), horizontal smooth pursuit (HSP), vertical smooth pursuit (VSP), horizontal saccades (HS), vertical saccades (VS), and fixation stability (FS). Eye movements were analyzed and classified in accordance with age and sex by multiple t-tests and linear regression models. Results: This study represented a large sample size of 23,557 subjects, with 11,871 males and 11,686 females representing ages from birth through 80 years of age. We observed statistically significant differences for all eye movement functions between males and females. Conclusions: We demonstrate that eye movements are sex-specific and offer normative data to compare sex-specific eye movement function by age. Novel baseline metrics can be compared to individual performance, regardless of sex. This study represents significant progress in linking eye movements with brain function and clinical syndromes, allowing researchers and clinicians to stratify individuals by age and sex.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Rodents provide a useful translational model of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors. Previously stressed animals exhibit physiological and behavioral stress responses that parallel those observed in anxious humans. Patients diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) present with a spectrum of debilitating anxiety symptoms that result from exposure to one or more traumatic events, with individuals exposed to early adverse experiences and women having increased vulnerability for diagnoses; however, the mechanisms of this increased vulnerability remain unknown. PTSD involves a complex network of highly interconnected brain regions, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Serotonin (5-HT) release into the BNST yields an increased expression of both fear and anxiety, specifically through 5-HT2C receptor signaling. The present experiment addressed whether 5-HT2C receptor signaling in the BNST is necessary for the acquisition of early-life stress (ELS)-induced enhancements in adult contextual fear learning. Methods: Rats received 0 or 15 footshocks on postnatal day 17, an established model of acute ELS (aELS) that yields enhanced adult fear learning. In adulthood, rats received bilateral infusions of a vehicle, a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist (RS-102221), or a 5-HT2C receptor agonist (MK-212) into the BNST 15 min prior to one-footshock contextual fear conditioning in a novel context. The next day, rats were returned to the fear-conditioning context to assess their fear memory (freezing). Results: Females demonstrated aELS-induced enhancement in contextual fear learning, while males did not. BNST infusions of RS-102221 reduced contextual fear conditioning, independent of aELS condition and sex. Infusions of MK-212 had no effect. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that serotonergic signaling through 5-HT2C receptors in the BNST contributes to contextual fear conditioning, but not aELS-induced stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL).</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal type of cancer, frequently presenting an unfavorable prognosis. The current treatment options for this neoplasia are still limited, highlighting the need for further research evaluating new drugs to treat GBM or to serve as an adjuvant to improve the efficiency of currently used therapies. In this sense, the inhibition of A2A receptors in the brain has presented a neuroprotective role for several diseases, such as neurodegenerative conditions, and it has been suggested as a possible pharmacological target in some types of cancer; thus, it also can be underscored as a potential target in GBM. Recently, Istradefylline (IST) was approved by the FDA for treating Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, representing a safe drug that acts through the inhibition of the A2A receptor, and it has also been suggested as an antineoplastic drug. Therefore, this work aims to explore the effects of A2A receptor inhibition as a therapy for GBM and assess the feasibility of this blockage occurring through the effects of IST.</p>

	<p>Substance use disorders (SUDs) and anxiety disorders (ADs) are highly comorbid, a co-occurrence linked to worse clinical outcomes than either condition alone. While the neurobiological mechanisms involved in SUDs and anxiety disorders are intensively studied separately, the mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remain an emerging area of interest. This narrative review explores the neurobiological processes underlying this comorbidity, using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework to map disruptions in positive valence, negative valence, and cognitive systems across the three stages of the addiction cycle: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation. Anxiety and substance use play a reciprocal role at each stage of addiction, marked by significant psychosocial impairment and dysregulation in the brain. A more thorough understanding of the neural underpinnings involved in comorbid SUDs and anxiety disorders will contribute to more tailored and effective therapeutic interventions and assessments.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/12/ENEURO.0495-23.2024?rss=1">Can Information About Stiffness Perception be Inferred from Action Signals Using Models?</a></h4>

              
                <p>We use sensory feedback to form our perception, and control our movements and forces (actions). There is an ongoing debate about the relation between perception and action, with evidence in both directions. For example, there are cases in which perceptual illusions affect action signals and cases where they do not. However, even when they do, it is unknown if perceptual information can be inferred from action signals alone. To answer this question, we utilized a perceptual illusion created by artificial tactile skin stretch, which increases stiffness perception, and affects grip force. We used data recorded in a stiffness discrimination task in which participants compared pairs of virtual objects, comprised of force and artificial skin stretch and indicated which they perceived as stiffer. We explored if models could predict the participants&rsquo; perceptual responses, and the increase in stiffness perception caused by the skin stretch, solely from their recorded action signals. That is, with no information provided about the stimuli. We found that participants&rsquo; perceptual augmentation could be predicted to an extent from their action signals alone. We predicted the average augmentation effect across participants, and a general trend of increased predicted perceptual augmentation for increased real perceptual augmentation. These results indicate that at least some perceptual information is present in action signals. Furthermore, of the action signals examined, grip force was necessary for predicting the augmentation effect, and a motion signal (e.g., position) was needed for predicting human-like perception, shedding light on what information may be presented in the different signals.</p>

                <p>by Roukayatou R. Ouedraogo, Hannah K. Sowers, Spencer R. Lynch, Nathan E. Hudson, Brittany E. Bannish</p>

Fibrinolysis, the plasmin-mediated degradation of the fibrin mesh that stabilizes blood clots, is an important physiological process, and understanding mechanisms underlying lysis is critical for improved stroke treatment. Experimentalists are now able to study lysis on the scale of single fibrin fibers, but mathematical models of lysis continue to focus mostly on fibrin network degradation. Experiments have shown that while some degradation occurs along the length of a fiber, ultimately the fiber is cleaved at a single location. We built a 2-dimensional stochastic model of a fibrin fiber cross-section that uses the Gillespie algorithm to study single fiber lysis initiated by plasmin. We simulated the model over a range of parameter values to learn about patterns and rates of single fiber lysis in various physiological conditions. We also used epifluorescent microscopy to measure the cleavage times of fibrin fibers with different apparent diameters. By comparing our model results to the laboratory experiments, we were able to: 1) suggest value ranges for unknown rate constants(namely that the degradation rate of fibrin by plasmin should be ≤ 10 s<sup>−1</sup> and that if plasmin crawls, the rate of crawling should be between 10 s<sup>−1</sup> and 60 s<sup>−1</sup>); 2) estimate the fraction of fibrin within a fiber cross-section that must be degraded for the fiber to cleave in two; and 3) propose that that fraction is higher in thinner fibers and lower in thicker fibers. Collectively, this information provides more details about how fibrin fibers degrade, which can be leveraged in the future for a better understanding of why fibrinolysis is impaired in certain disease states, and could inform intervention strategies.

                <p>by Kathrin Pabst, Evripidis Gkanias, Barbara Webb, Uwe Homberg, Dominik Endres</p>

Accurate navigation often requires the maintenance of a robust internal estimate of heading relative to external surroundings. We present a model for angular velocity integration in a desert locust heading circuit, applying concepts from early theoretical work on heading circuits in mammals to a novel biological context in insects. In contrast to similar models proposed for the fruit fly, this circuit model uses a single 360° heading direction representation and is updated by neuromodulatory angular velocity inputs. Our computational model was implemented using steady-state firing rate neurons with dynamical synapses. The circuit connectivity was constrained by biological data, and remaining degrees of freedom were optimised with a machine learning approach to yield physiologically plausible neuron activities. We demonstrate that the integration of heading and angular velocity in this circuit is robust to noise. The heading signal can be effectively used as input to an existing insect goal-directed steering circuit, adapted for outbound locomotion in a steady direction that resembles locust migration. Our study supports the possibility that similar computations for orientation may be implemented differently in the neural hardware of the fruit fly and the locust.

                <p>by Melvin Bérard, Laura Merlini, Sophie G. Martin</p>

Starvation, which is associated with inactivation of the growth-promoting TOR complex 1 (TORC1), is a strong environmental signal for cell differentiation. In the fission yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, nitrogen starvation has distinct physiological consequences depending on the presence of mating partners. In their absence, cells enter quiescence, and TORC1 inactivation prolongs their life. In presence of compatible mates, TORC1 inactivation is essential for sexual differentiation. Gametes engage in paracrine pheromone signaling, grow towards each other, fuse to form the diploid zygote, and form resistant, haploid spore progenies. To understand the signaling changes in the proteome and phospho-proteome during sexual reproduction, we developed cell synchronization strategies and present (phospho-)proteomic data sets that dissect pheromone from starvation signals over the sexual differentiation and cell–cell fusion processes. Unexpectedly, these data sets reveal phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 during sexual development, which we establish requires TORC1 activity. We demonstrate that TORC1 is re-activated by pheromone signaling, in a manner that does not require autophagy. Mutants with low TORC1 re-activation exhibit compromised mating and poorly viable spores. Thus, while inactivated to initiate the mating process, TORC1 is reactivated by pheromone signaling in starved cells to support sexual reproduction.

                Background Cogan’s syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ocular inflammation, vestibulocochlear dysfunction, and systemic vasculitis. Case Presentation We report a 28-year-old female who experienced decreased visual acuity and ocular redness one month after a COVID-19 infection, with ophthalmological signs linked to keratitis, uveitis and retinal vasculitis. Two weeks later, she developed vertigo, tinnitus, and sudden hearing loss, leading to a diagnosis of Cogan’s disease. The patient received corticosteroid therapy, resulting in regression of ophthalmological signs, but progressed to complete deafness. One month later, she presented with lymphocytic meningitis and high intracranial pressure, which improved under treatment. The patient later received cochlear implants. Objective This case report aims to highlight an atypical presentation of Cogan’s syndrome with neurological involvement following a COVID-19 infection. This case contributes to the limited literature on such presentations. Conclusion Our case is one of only two reported instances of Cogan’s syndrome presenting with neurological signs post-COVID-19 infection, underscoring the rarity and complexity of this condition.

                Background Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that affects a significant proportion of the global population, posing a major public health challenge. In recent years, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mental health diagnosis has garnered increasing attention. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on AI-based approaches for depression diagnosis, identifying both advancements and gaps in the literature that can guide future studies. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted across leading research databases to identify relevant studies published up to July 2024. A combination of automated and manual filtering was employed to refine the initial set of records. Eligibility criteria were applied to ensure that only studies directly addressing the use of AI for depression diagnosis were included in the final analysis. Results The initial search yielded 1,179 records. Following a rigorous selection process, 145 studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the review. These studies represent a diverse array of AI techniques and data sources, with a predominant focus on supervised learning algorithms. The most common data sources were social networks, followed by clinical data integrated with psychological assessments. Conclusion The results highlight the growing interest in leveraging AI for depression diagnosis, particularly through the use of supervised learning methods. Social network data has emerged as the most frequently used data source, though clinical data combined with validated psychological tests remains a key area of focus. Despite these advancements, several challenges persist, including data availability and quality, which present opportunities for future research to improve diagnostic accuracy and generalizability.

                Background The Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy was a very strict policy for COVID-19 response in the Chinese mainland, with the overarching goal of preventing imported infections and domestic flare-ups. Policy and implications The dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy has long been criticized by European and American politicians for the issue of human rights. There are some points that need to be considered with regard to these criticisms: Firstly, the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy protected millions of Chinese people from death, the outcomes of China’s COVID-19 response demonstrated the correctness and suitability of the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy, and the policy benefited the world. Secondly, freedom and health were generally conflicted and extremely difficult to be compatible in the COVID-19 pandemic, and the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy indeed exhibited several advantages in the fight against COVID-19. Thirdly, China struggled to spare no effort to save lives all the time during the COVID-19 pandemic under the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. Recommendations Appropriate restrictions on freedom and human rights are justified to protect public health and prevent harm to others in the COVID-19 pandemic, and an important premise is that the implement of these restrictions are based on law. Conclusions In summary, it is biased to censure the Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy or abandonment of the Chinese dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy based on human rights, and the great achievement of the policy and China’s efforts to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic should not be ignored.

                Background ELIXIR is a pan-European public-funded research infrastructure dedicated to life science data. As such, it must demonstrate public value to its funders and stakeholders. We present methods to inventory research publications linked to ELIXIR that have received funding and support, as well as related citation metrics, used as performance metrics for these audiences. Methods To overcome challenges inherent in ELIXIR’s distributed structure, and the fact that those publishing ELIXIR-supported work are typically working part-time on ELIXIR matters, a semi-automated approach, consisting of text-mining followed by manual curation, is presented. A country-level case study (ELIXIR Italy) refines and expands the methods, notably by introducing more granularity in the curation process (e.g. considering all national-level grants, examining affiliations to report publication per institute) and by additionally looking at the scientific impact of the resources developed and operated by the Italian Node of ELIXIR. Results Overall, the methods described in this article have shown to: (1) be repeatable with acceptable levels of accuracy and consistency (notably across curators); (2) require reasonable effort in terms of curation of monthly ‘harvests’ of publications (obtained by text-mining); and (3) to be well-adapted to ELIXIR’s distributed nature. Conclusions Concrete examples are provided of downstream uses of the inventoried publications and their citations, both for ELIXIR as a whole and for the Italian case study. Limitations of the methods are discussed, particularly the challenges associated with using an ‘Open literature’ database (Europe PMC) for the text-mining, and the constraints related to curation capacity. The methods, along with the valuable lessons learned during their development, are sufficiently generic and pragmatic enough to be readily adapted by other similar research infrastructures.

                Background Rational prescription writing is an important skill to master during internship. This Quality Improvement (QI) project aimed to understand the state of prescription writing among interns posted in the Department of Psychiatry, analyze the causes responsible for errors in prescription writing and bring about a change in the current practice. Methods The MBBS interns are posted in the Department of Psychiatry for 15 days. During day 1 to day 5 of their posting, a pre intervention phase was conducted wherein prescriptions written by interns in the Department of Psychiatry were collected. The prescriptions were scored based on 14 criteria which were selected based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and Medical Council of India (MCI) ideal prescription format. During PDSA (Plan Do Study Act) Cycle 1, an educational handout was distributed to the interns containing the MCI ideal prescription format and WHO guidelines regarding prescription writing. The brochure was also verbally explained to the interns. From day 7 to day 15 of their posting, prescriptions written by the interns were collected. The prescriptions were scored using the same criteria. Results During the pre intervention phase the mean total score of prescriptions was 9.54 ± 1.003. There was a significant improvement in the mean total score to 10.26 ± 0.746. There was a 7.54% improvement. There was also a significant improvement in several individual criteria. Conclusions The first PDSA cycle was successful in improving the quality of prescription writing among interns posted in the Department of Psychiatry. There is a need to implement more PDSA cycles to improve the quality still further.

                Background Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a progressive neurovascular-degenerative condition without specific treatment that causes lacunar stroke, most intracerebral haemorrhage, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and several neuropsychiatric conditions. Objectives To conduct a rapid multi-stage scoping review to identify licensed interventions that could be repurposed for testing in cSVD at phase-3. Methods First, we screened preclinical studies of potential relevance to cSVD and used a drug dictionary to identify studies of potential interventions. Separately, we screened clinical studies of relevance to cSVD and VCI. Following merging, we removed drugs that were unsuitable or impractical to assess long-term in the UK. We then performed mini-meta-analyses for shortlisted interventions assessing effects on cognition and scored these for their relevance to cSVD. Results The preclinical review created a long-list of 1,757 deduplicated interventions. Those that were not available in the UK, not expensive or impractical to administer long-term were merged with 62 interventions identified from 75 relevant clinical studies to create a medium-list of 52 interventions. Focussed literature review short-listed ten interventions for review by an independent scientific advisory group; they ranked three as most suitable for immediate testing: metformin, tadalafil and isosorbide mononitrate. Conclusion This rapid review identified three interventions that are suitable for testing in a late phase-3 (platform) trial involving patients with cSVD. The approach could be improved with partial automation, text mining and generative pre-trained transformer approaches which would help manage the large data volumes. Further, our data-driven approach could be combined with genetic or other mechanistic methods to further de-risk future trials.

<p>The homeobox transcription factor Engrailed1 was crucial for the survival of PV neurons. Deprivation of Engrailed1 in PV neurons led to the increasement of cleaved caspase-3 in PV-positive RGCs and PV neurons in V1 and disrupted the eye-specific retinogeniculate segregation, resulting in an expansion of the ipsilateral eye projection.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Homeobox transcription factor Engrailed1 (En1) is expressed in the ectoderm and mediates the establishment of retinotectal topography, but its role in eye-specific retinogeniculate segregation and visual function remains unclear. Parvalbumin (PV) neurons, which are widely distributed in the visual pathway, play a crucial role in visual development and function. In this study, we conditionally knocked out En1 gene in PV neurons and found an expansion of the ipsilateral eye projection, while no significant effects were observed in the contralateral eye projection. Additionally, we observed a decrease in the number of PV neurons in PV-Cre:En1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, accompanied by an increased level of cleaved caspase-3 in PV neurons. Furthermore, the genetic ablation of PV neurons in the retina through intraocular AAV-DIO-Caspase3 injection in PV-Cre mice was sufficient to disrupt retinogeniculate segregation. Finally, we observed that PV-Cre:En1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice exhibited enhanced visual depth perception in the visual cliff test. These results demonstrate that En1 in PV neurons participates in eye-specific retinogeniculate segregation through cell survival and regulates binocular vision.</p>

                Abstract The comorbidity due to pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health problem, but its mechanism remains unclear. It is suspected that hyperglycemic alteration of the immune response to TB and the composition of the lung microbiota play an important role. This scoping review aimed to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms by mapping evidence on the effect of hyperglycemia on physical health indicators, immune cell counts, cytokine levels, and the composition of lung microbiota in patients with the DM-TB comorbidity. A systematic search for research articles about the relationship between hyperglycemia and physical health, immune cells, and cytokine levels in humans was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus. Then, articles on the interactions between the immune cells, cytokines, and lung microbiota were identified through Google Scholar and Google search engines. Characteristics of the studies focusing on effects of hyperglycemia, the findings of the articles relevant to the research objectives, and strengths and weaknesses of the selected articles were charted in a data extraction tool. Twenty-one articles on the effects of hyperglycemia on immune mediators and health outcomes of patients with DM-TB were included. The evidence showed hyperglycemia to be associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes; altered counts and functioning of dendritic cells, monocytes, and CD4+ T cells; and changes in cytokine levels (mainly INF-γ, IL-17, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α) in patients with DM-TB. The composition of the lung microbiota changed in correlation with changes in physical health outcomes, counts of immune cells, and cytokine levels. Thus, hyperglycemia, immune responses, and dysbiosis of the lung microbiota are integral in the pathogenesis of DM-TB and TB treatment outcomes. A prospective cohort study, especially in individuals with newly diagnosed DM versus known DM and concomitant latent TB versus active TB, is recommended to define causal relationships.

                Background Dental professionals are exposed to either high level of noise which often becomes annoying over a time, and it is largely related to turbines and suctions used during the procedure. We performed this study with an aim to know the need for efforts to reduce impact of noise on young. Methods The study group comprised of 102 dentists (53 males and 49 females) final year dental students, interns and board students of family dentistry, endodontics, prosthodontics was enrolled. The noise assessment device is switched on to know the base noise level in the clinics and to know hearing ability of the dentist through a pre – recorded verbal communication. When the dentist starts the procedure, the same verbal communication is re-introduced and based on his reaction the decibel level is increased to a point where he can understand it. The same is followed after the procedure. Results Using T – test the age and gender mean was assessed, while ANNOVA test was used to know the hearing impairment and its mean before, during and after procedure. We have found that there is an imminent increase of sound during the procedure and thereby associated impairment; which continues but to a lesser decibel level even after the procedure is completed for long time. Discussion and Conclusion We have highlighted few guidelines from various studies which range from reducing multiple turbine usage at a given point of treatment wherever possible to a recommendation to use ear plugs for those procedures related to high noise levels.

                Background This mixed-method action research study explores the impact of a gamified virtual learning tool on elementary students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) skills in English language acquisition. Despite the acknowledged importance of SRL in educational contexts, limited research exists on its development among young learners. The present study is one of the products of the academic unit project “Key Factors and Essential Elements for a Comprehensive Model of Bilingual Education: A Multidimensional Approach for Diverse Contexts and Areas of Knowledge” sponsored by the School of Education at Universidad de La Sabana, institution where the first author conducted her master’s studies, and the corresponding author is a professor and main researcher of the of the academic unit project. Method Six students aged 8-10 participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured observations and pre- and post-questionnaires. The tool was designed based on Zimmerman’s SRL model and included tasks structured through gamification elements. For the purpose of quantitative data analysis, descriptive statistics were used; as for qualitative data, thematic analysis was the chosen approach. Results The results revealed that guided use of the gamified tool significantly enhanced students’ use of SRL strategies, particularly in goal setting, monitoring progress, and reflecting on learning outcomes. Students demonstrated increased motivation, engagement, and confidence, although explicit instruction was required to maximize the tool’s benefits. The usability of the tool was rated positively, with participants highlighting its effectiveness for language learning and SRL skill development. Conclusions The study concludes that gamified virtual environments can effectively promote SRL skills in young language learners by fostering motivation and engagement. However, for optimal outcomes, such tools should be supplemented with explicit instruction in SRL strategies. This research contributes to understanding the integration of gamified tools in elementary education, highlighting their potential to develop foundational skills essential for lifelong learning.

                Drawing from historical accounts, cultural practices, archaeological discoveries, and indigenous technical knowledge, the research presents a critical review of varied aspects of the construction of the Konark temple and presents future research directions. To fulfill the purpose, documents were sourced from Scopus, Google Scholar, and ancient texts and palm leaves. Findings suggest the legacy of Narasimhadeva I, the Hindu monarch who remained undefeated during his reign, safeguarded the kingdom from encroaching Muslim rulers. The narrative highlights the bravery of a faithful elephant that revived the king on the battlefield. The Konark temple was built with the dual purpose of showcasing the glory of his victory and devotion to the Sun God. The ancient artisans’ knowledge, skills, and commitment were crucial in erecting this tallest temple structure. The investigation further illuminates the use of sea routes for transporting monumental stones, the ingenuity in laying the temple’s foundation, the selection of high-grade stones, the monumental task of lifting colossal stones, like the world’s heaviest stone hoisted to a height of about two hundred feet, the use of rust-resistant iron, and the application of advanced astronomical knowledge by ancient artisans. The study provides insights into ancient engineering ingenuity, encouraging further exploration of the enduring legacy of the Konark temple’s construction.

                Background The representation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is disproportionate to graduates from STEM fields. There is limited research addressing challenges facing women retention in STEM in the UAE. Methods A cross-sectional study using a validated questionnaire was conducted. A total of 165 participants were enrolled; 62% males and 35% females. Results More women believed there is gender inequality in STEM (47% versus 28%). 44% of female participants experienced gender inequality in their career. Men were significantly less likely to experience gender inequality (OR=0.06, 95% CI=0.02-0.16). Women reported lack of organizational emphasis on diversity and inclusion for promotion to leadership (44% versus 60%). Conclusion Data confirms gender-based preconceptions and biases in STEM fields. Institutional initiatives and policies to challenge stereotypes and promote gender equality are required. Governmental role is crucial in creating an inclusive environment for women scientists.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1538/v1?src=rss">Impact of vision problems on children’s daily activities: Insights from a focus group discussion [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background/Purpose There are approximately 18.94 million visually impaired children worldwide, with 90% of them living in low-middle income countries. Research shows that visual impairment (VI) has a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) of those affected. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how VI affects the daily activities of these children to develop management strategies that can help minimize its impact on their QoL. Therefore, qualitative research design was utilized to explore the perceived impact of VI on the daily activities of children living with VI. Methods Using a qualitative approach, purposive sampling was used to identify information-rich participants to partake in focus group discussions (FGDs) and address the aim of the study adequately. Identified data sources were divided into two groups: one with ‘experts’ who worked with children regularly, and another with school-going children aged 6-17 years, from three rural schools in Sekhukhune district, South Africa. The FGDs were guided by semi-structured interview questions. All sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, cleaned, coded, and analysed under ten domains, identified from the literature. Results A total of 477 statements and comments related to children’s vision were generated through the nine FGDs. Participants were nine experts working with children, and 49 children living with or without VI. Of the total number of statements, 60% (n = 287) were generated from FGDs with children, 63% (n = 299) were negative statements, and the remaining 19% (n = 92), and 18% (n = 86) were neutral and positive statements respectively. The most generated statements fell under the domains ‘Hobbies, Leisure and Sport’ 21% (n = 101), ‘Education’ 21% (n = 100), and ‘Psychological and Emotional’ 12.8% (n = 61). Conclusion This study offered comprehensive insights into the impact of VI on the daily activities of rural school-aged children and young people.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ground-breaking research of patient H.M. brought to light the importance of the hippocampus for our memories of everyday and special events. Three quarters of a century of intense neurobiological and neuropsychological research would follow as scientists sought to understand why the hippocampus is such an important memory structure in the brain. Navigating a career during this time required adaptive research strategies as new evidence emerged. Although exciting progress has been made, complex challenges remain.</p>
