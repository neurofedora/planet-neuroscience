	<p>Introduction: The aim of this study is a comprehensive analysis of the parameters of exogenous evoked potentials (visual, brainstem auditory, and somatosensory) in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), a prototype of both neuromuscular junction disease and autoimmune disease. The study also seeks to isolate electrophysiological changes that may indicate disorders within the central and/or peripheral nervous system. Methods: A total of forty-two consecutive patients with myasthenia gravis (24 women, 18 men) were included in the study. All of the patients underwent EP examination. MR images were also analyzed. Results: In the group of MG patients, the latency of P100 (113.9 ± 13.9; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) VEP, wave III (3.92 ± 0.29; p = 0.015), wave V (5.93 ± 0.32; &amp;amp;lt;0.0001), interlatency III–V (2.00 ± 0.12; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001), interlatency I–V (4.20 ± 0.28; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) BAEP, and all components of SEP (N9, P10, N13, P16, N20, P22) were significantly longer. Mean wave I and V amplitude BAEP were relatively lower. Conclusions: The results of the study suggest the presence of disturbances in the bioelectric activities of the central and peripheral nervous system in MG patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">The emergent relationship between temporoparietal junction and anosognosia in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anosognosia and impairment of insight are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can lead to delays in appropriate medical care and significant family discord. The default mode network (DMN), a distributed but highly connected network of brain regions more active during rest than during task, is integrally involved in awareness. DMN dysfunction is common in AD, and disrupted communication between memory-related and self-related DMN networks is associated with anosognosia in AD patients. In addition, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is a key region of the “social brain” and also contributes to representations of the self. The exact classification of the TPJ within the DMN is unclear, though connections between the TPJ and DMN have been highlighted in multiple avenues of research. Here we discuss the relationship between the TPJ, DMN, and AD, as well as the potential involvement of the TPJ in anosognosia in AD. We review past and present findings to raise attention to the TPJ, with a specific emphasis on neuroimaging technologies which suggest a pivotal role of the TPJ within large-scale brain networks linked to anosognosia in AD.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. There is still no available disease-modifying strategy against PD, whose management is mainly symptomatic. A growing amount of preclinical evidence shows that a complex interplay between autophagy dysregulation, mitochondrial impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and excessive neuroinflammation underlies PD pathogenesis. Identifying key molecules linking these pathological cellular processes may substantially aid in our deeper understanding of PD pathophysiology and the development of novel effective therapeutic approaches. Emerging preclinical evidence indicates that apelin, an endogenous neuropeptide acting as a ligand of the orphan G protein-coupled receptor APJ, may play a key neuroprotective role in PD pathogenesis, via inhibition of apoptosis and dopaminergic neuronal loss, autophagy enhancement, antioxidant effects, endoplasmic reticulum stress suppression, as well as prevention of synaptic dysregulation in the striatum, excessive neuroinflammation, and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Underlying signaling pathways involve phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and inositol requiring kinase 1α/XBP1/C/EBP homologous protein. Herein, we discuss the role of apelin/APJ axis and associated molecular mechanisms on the pathogenesis of PD <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> and provide evidence for its challenging therapeutic potential.</p>

     alt="14-3-3ζ is crucial for the conversion of labile short-term object recognition memory into stable long-term memory"/>
<p>The upregulation of 14-3-3ζ facilitates the transformation of labile object recognition memory (ORM) into stable ORM and causes the increase in brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) expression, which further aids in the consolidation of newly formed ORM to long-term memory. The blockage of either 14-3-3ζ or BDNF expression abolishes the formation of long-term ORM (LT-ORM).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The consolidation of new memories into long-lasting memories is multistage process characterized by distinct temporal dynamics. However, our understanding on the initial stage of transformation of labile memory of recent experience into stable memory remains elusive. Here, with the use of rats and mice overexpressing a memory enhancer called regulator of G protein signaling 14 of 414 amino acids (RGS14<sub>414</sub>) as a tool, we show that the expression of RGS14<sub>414</sub> in male rats' perirhinal cortex (PRh), which is a brain area crucial for object recognition memory (ORM), enhanced the ORM to the extent that it caused the conversion of labile short-term ORM (ST-ORM) expected to last for 40 min into stable long-term ORM (LT-ORM) traceable after a delay of 24 hr, and that the temporal window of 40 to 60 min after object exposure not only was key for this conversion but also was the time frame when a surge in 14-3-3ζ protein was observed. A knockdown of 14-3-3ζ gene abrogated both the increase in 14-3-3ζ protein and the formation of LT-ORM. Furthermore, this 14-3-3ζ upregulation increased brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) levels in the time frame of 60 min and 24 hr and 14-3-3ζ knockdown decreased the BDNF levels, and a deletion of BDNF gene produced loss in mice ability to form LT-ORM. Thus, within 60 min of object exposure, 14-3-3ζ facilitated the conversion of labile ORM into stable ORM, whereas beyond the 60 min, it mediated the consolidation of the stable memory into long-lasting ORM by regulating BDNF signaling.</p>

<p>This is the first study to demonstrate functional as well as structural plasticity of the central olfactory networks, following surgical treatment for olfactory dysfunction. Our results help to confirm the neuroanatomical corelates of olfactory function and dysfunction.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is more common than hearing loss, partial blindness, or blindness and can have a significant impact on the quality of life. Moreover, unexplained OD is an early biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases and increases 5-year mortality risk. Structural alterations in olfactory eloquent brain regions may represent the neuroanatomical correlates of OD. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced gray matter (GM) volume in areas of presumed olfactory relevance in patients with OD. However, being cross-sectional in nature, these studies do not provide evidence of causality, for which longitudinal work is required. At present, however, longitudinal studies addressing olfactory structural plasticity are limited, both in number and methodological approach: to our knowledge, such work has not included parallel functional imaging to confirm the relevance of structural change. We therefore performed a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study investigating structural and functional plasticity in 24 patients undergoing surgical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis, compared with 17 healthy controls. We demonstrated functionally significant structural plasticity within the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and temporal poles in patients 3 months after surgery. Of interest, GM volume decreased in these regions, in association with increased psychophysical scores and BOLD signal. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate both structural and functional plasticity of the central olfactory networks, thereby confirming these areas as neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory function/dysfunction.</p>

     alt="Functional brain network topology across the menstrual cycle is estradiol dependent and correlates with individual well-being"/>
<p>The topology of brain networks along the menstrual cycle (MC), estimated in 24 women (<i>N</i> = 24), is influenced by estradiol blood levels. The betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG), in the alpha frequency band, increased in the peri-ovulatory phase (a). The estradiol levels predicted the BC variance in rPCG (b) and, accordingly, its variations during the luteal phase (expressed as the difference between the mid-luteal and peri-ovulatory time points of the MC) correlated positively with the variation of the BC of the rPCG (c).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The menstrual cycle (MC) is a sex hormone-related phenomenon that repeats itself cyclically during the woman's reproductive life. In this explorative study, we hypothesized that coordinated variations of multiple sex hormones may affect the large-scale organization of the brain functional network and that, in turn, such changes might have psychological correlates, even in the absence of overt clinical signs of anxiety and/or depression. To test our hypothesis, we investigated longitudinally, across the MC, the relationship between the sex hormones and both brain network and psychological changes. We enrolled 24 naturally cycling women and, at the early-follicular, peri-ovulatory, and mid-luteal phases of the MC, we performed: (a) sex hormone dosage, (b) magnetoencephalography recording to study the brain network topology, and (c) psychological questionnaires to quantify anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and well-being. We showed that during the peri-ovulatory phase, in the alpha band, the leaf fraction and the tree hierarchy of the brain network were reduced, while the betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG) was increased. Furthermore, the increase in BC was predicted by estradiol levels. Moreover, during the luteal phase, the variation of estradiol correlated positively with the variations of both the topological change and environmental mastery dimension of the well-being test, which, in turn, was related to the increase in the BC of rPCG. Our results highlight the effects of sex hormones on the large-scale brain network organization as well as on their possible relationship with the psychological state across the MC. Moreover, the fact that physiological changes in the brain topology occur throughout the MC has widespread implications for neuroimaging studies.</p>

<p>Hypoxia has an immense effect on the retina, especially on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It causes cell damage and results in vision loss. In this study, the electrical RGC activity under hypoxic conditions is analyzed using a multielectrode array-based <i>ex vivo</i> model.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Several eye diseases, for example, retinal artery occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, are associated with retinal hypoxia. The lack of oxygen in the retina, especially in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causes cell damage up to cell degeneration and leads to blindness. Using multielectrode array recordings, an <i>ex vivo</i> hypoxia acute model was established to analyze the electrical activity of murine wild-type retinae under hypoxic stress conditions. Hypoxia was induced by exchanging the perfusion with oxygen-saturated medium by nitrogen-saturated medium. Hypoxic periods of 0 min (control) up to 60 min were tested on the retinae of adult female C57BL/6J mice. The electrical RGC activity vanished during hypoxia, but conditionally returned after the reestablishment of conventional test conditions. With increasing duration of hypoxia, the returning RGC activity decreased. After a hypoxic period of 30 min and a subsequent recovery time of 30 min, 59.43 ± 11.35% of the initially active channels showed a restored RGC activity. The survival rate of retinal cells after hypoxic stress was analyzed by a live/dead staining assay using two-photon laser scanning microscopy. For detailed information about molecular changes caused by hypoxia, a microarray gene expression analysis was performed. Furthermore, the effect of 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine, 1 mM) on retinae under hypoxic stress was tested. Treatment with taurine resulted in an increase in the RGC response rate after hypoxia and also increased the survival rate of retinal cells under hypoxic stress, confirming its potential as promising candidate for neuroprotective therapies of eye diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy: A recent review on outcomes and pathophysiology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Epilepsy is a debilitating disorder of uncontrollable recurrent seizures that occurs as a result of imbalances in the brain excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signals, that could stem from a range of functional and structural neuronal impairments. Globally, nearly 70 million people are negatively impacted by epilepsy and its comorbidities. One such comorbidity is the effect epilepsy has on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which plays a role in the control of blood circulation, respiration and gastrointestinal function. These epilepsy-induced impairments in the circulatory and respiratory systems may contribute toward sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although, various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of epilepsy on ANS, the linking pathological mechanism still remains unclear. Channelopathies and seizure-induced damages in ANS-control brain structures were some of the causal/pathological candidates of cardiorespiratory comorbidities in epilepsy patients, especially in those who were drug resistant. However, emerging preclinical research suggest that neurotransmitter/receptor dysfunction and synaptic changes in the ANS may also contribute to the epilepsy-related autonomic disorders. Thus, pathological mechanisms of cardiorespiratory dysfunction should be elucidated by considering the modifications in anatomy and physiology of the autonomic system caused by seizures. In this regard, we present a comprehensive review of the current literature, both clinical and preclinical animal studies, on the cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy and elucidate the possible pathological mechanisms of these findings, in hopes to prevent SUDEP especially in patients who are drug resistant.</p>

     alt="Significant increases of the amygdala between immediate and late postpartum: Pronounced effects within the superficial subregion"/>
<p>Our longitudinal study revealed increases of the amygdala during the postpartum period. Volumes and subvolumes of the amygdala were analyzed by integrating imaging-based signal intensities with cytoarchitectonically defined probabilities.</p>
<p>​</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Research exploring the underlying neuroanatomical correlates of early motherhood seems to suggest that the period after giving birth is marked by tissue increases in the mother's brain. While some studies point to the amygdala as one of the areas undergoing postpartum changes, existing analyses did not discriminate between the different subregions of this functionally heterogeneous structure. Thus, to further extend this understudied field of research and to better understand the potential role of the amygdala when transitioning to motherhood, we applied an advanced region-of-interest technique that enabled us to analyze the amygdala as a whole as well as its different subareas, specifically the left and right centromedian (CM), laterobasal (LB), and superficial (SF) regions. Comparing the brains of 14 healthy women between immediate postpartum (within 1–2 days of childbirth) and late postpartum (at 4–6 weeks after childbirth), we revealed increases of the amygdala. However, effects manifested differentially across subareas, with particularly strong effects for the SF region, moderate effects for the CM region, and no effects for the LB region. These findings might reflect region-specific adaptations of the mother's brain tuning into the distinct and ever-changing needs of a newborn, either as a cause for it or as a consequence thereof.</p>

     alt="Efficient extra-mitochondrial aerobic ATP synthesis in neuronal membrane systems"/>
<p>Comparison of mitochondrial and extramitochondrial activity in neuronal membrane systems. In the last years, literature reports that the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) machinery is expressed not only on the inner mitochondrial membrane but also on other membranous structures. In order to highlight the similarities and differences between these two entities, in this work, we compared the activity of mitochondrial OxPhos with that expressed in isolated myelin and rod outer segments.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The nervous system displays high energy consumption, apparently not fulfilled by mitochondria, which are underrepresented therein. The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) activity, a mitochondrial process that aerobically provides ATP, has also been reported also in the myelin sheath and the rod outer segment (OS) disks. Thus, commonalities and differences between the extra-mitochondrial and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism were evaluated in bovine isolated myelin (IM), rod OS, and mitochondria-enriched fractions (MIT). The subcellular fraction quality and the absence of contamination fractions have been estimated by western blot analysis. Oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were stimulated by conventional (pyruvate + malate or succinate) and unconventional (NADH) substrates, observing that oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis by IM and rod OS are more efficient than by MIT, in the presence of both kinds of respiratory substrates. Mitochondria did not utilize NADH as a respiring substrate. When ATP synthesis by either sample was assayed in the presence of 10–100 µM ATP in the assay medium, only in IM and OS it was not inhibited, suggesting that the ATP exportation by the mitochondria is limited by extravesicular ATP concentration. Interestingly, IM and OS but not mitochondria appear able to synthesize ATP at a later time with respect to exposure to respiratory substrates, supporting the hypothesis that the proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain is buffered by membrane phospholipids. The putative transfer mode of the OxPhos molecular machinery from mitochondria to the extra-mitochondrial structures is also discussed, opening new perspectives in the field of neurophysiology.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The present review asks whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are able to define neural correlates of episodic memory within the hippocampus in Parkinson's disease (PD). Systematic searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, CINAHL, and EMBASE using search terms related to structural and functional MRI (fMRI), the hippocampus, episodic memory, and PD. Risk of bias was assessed for each study using the Newtown–Ottawa Scale. Thirty-nine studies met inclusion criteria; eight fMRI, seven diffusion MRI (dMRI), and 24 structural MRI (14 exploring whole hippocampus and 10 exploring hippocampal subfields). Critical analysis of the literature revealed mixed evidence from functional and dMRI, but stronger evidence from sMRI of the hippocampus as a biomarker for episodic memory impairment in PD. Hippocampal subfield studies most often implicated CA1, CA3/4, and subiculum volume in episodic memory and cognitive decline in PD. Despite differences in imaging methodology, study design, and sample characteristics, MRI studies have helped elucidate an important neural correlate of episodic memory impairment in PD with both clinical and theoretical implications. Natural progression of this work encourages future research on hippocampal subfield function as a potential biomarker of, or therapeutic target for, episodic memory dysfunction in PD.</p>

<p>Portacaval anastomosis (PCA) promoted spongiform degeneration at the cerebellar molecular layer. There was loss of Purkinje cells, microglia activation and increase expression of NLRP3 and aquaporin-4. By NMR spectroscopy, there was reduction in osmolytes that can be cause the cellular edema. PCA rats showed a motor deficiency in rotarod test.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The episodes of cerebral dysfunction, known as encephalopathy, are usually coincident with liver failure. The primary metabolic marker of liver diseases is the increase in blood ammonium, which promotes neuronal damage. In the present project, we used an experimental model of hepatic encephalopathy in male rats by portacaval anastomosis (PCA) surgery. Sham rats had a false operation. After 13 weeks of surgery, the most distinctive finding was vacuolar/spongiform neurodegeneration exclusively in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. This cerebellar damage was further characterized by metabolic, histopathological, and behavioral approaches. The results were as follows: (a) Cellular alterations, namely loss of Purkinje cells, morphological changes, such as swelling of astrocytes and Bergmann glia, and activation of microglia; (b) Cytotoxic edema, shown by an increase in aquaporin-4 and <i>N</i>-acetylaspartate and a reduction in taurine and choline-derivate osmolytes; (c) Metabolic adjustments, noted by the elevation of circulating ammonium, enhanced presence of glutamine synthetase, and increase in glutamine and creatine/phosphocreatine; (d) Inflammasome activation, detected by the elevation of the marker NLRP3 and microglial activation; (e) Locomotor deficits in PCA rats as assessed by the Rotarod and open field tests. These results lead us to suggest that metabolic disturbances associated with PCA can generate the cerebellar damage that is similar to morphophysiological modifications observed in amyloidogenic disorders. In conclusion, we have characterized a distinctive cerebellar multi-disruption accompanied by high levels of ammonium and associated with spongiform neurodegeneration in a model of hepatic hypofunctioning.</p>

<p>Glial cells of the cerebellum are still insufficiently classified. In this study we describe the subclassification of GLAST<sup>+</sup> precursors in the prospective white matter using immunophenotyping, transcriptomics, and transplantation assays. A subclass of GLAST<sup>+</sup> cells, which co-express astrocyte cell surface antigen-2 (ACSA-2), generates only parenchymal astrocytes—as revealed by protein expression, their genetic signature and transplantation. The absence of the astrocyte marker (ACSA-2) reveals GLAST<sup>+</sup> cells to maintain a multipotent potential, giving rise to interneurons, glia, and Bergmann glia.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The formation of the cerebellum is highly coordinated to obtain its characteristic morphology and all cerebellar cell types. During mouse postnatal development, cerebellar progenitors with astroglial-like characteristics generate mainly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, a subset of astroglial-like progenitors found in the prospective white matter (PWM) produces astroglia and interneurons. Characterizing these cerebellar astroglia-like progenitors and distinguishing their developmental fates is still elusive. Here, we reveal that astrocyte cell surface antigen-2 (ACSA-2), lately identified as ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 2 polypeptide, is expressed by glial precursors throughout postnatal cerebellar development. In contrast to common astrocyte markers, ACSA-2 appears on PWM cells but is absent on Bergmann glia (BG) precursors. In the adult cerebellum, ACSA-2 is broadly expressed extending to velate astrocytes in the granular layer, white matter astrocytes, and to a lesser extent to BG. Cell transplantation and transcriptomic analysis revealed that marker staining discriminates two postnatal progenitor pools. One subset is defined by the co-expression of ACSA-2 and GLAST and the expression of markers typical of parenchymal astrocytes. These are PWM precursors that are exclusively gliogenic. They produce predominantly white matter and granular layer astrocytes. Another subset is constituted by GLAST positive/ACSA-2 negative precursors that express neurogenic and BG-like progenitor genes. This population displays multipotency and gives rise to interneurons besides all glial types, including BG. In conclusion, this work reports about ACSA-2, a marker that in combination with GLAST enables for the discrimination and isolation of multipotent and glia-committed progenitors, which generate different types of cerebellar astrocytes.</p>

     alt="The synaptic blocker botulinum toxin A decreases the density and complexity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in the adult mouse hippocampus"/>
<p>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) sense glutamate released at synapses via direct synaptic contacts and through volume transmission, which regulates the OPC stem cell like property of self-renewal. In this study, we show that blocking synaptic transmission using botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) significantly decreased OPC numbers and resulted in cellular atrophy <i>in vivo</i> in the adult mouse hippocampus. Adult OPCs are responsible for life-long generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes and dysregulation of OPC function would potentially decrease their capacity for repair in pathological scenarios characterized by decreased synaptic activity, such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are responsible for generating oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the CNS. Life-long myelination is promoted by neuronal activity and is essential for neural network plasticity and learning. OPCs are known to contact synapses and it is proposed that neuronal synaptic activity in turn regulates their behavior. To examine this in the adult, we performed unilateral injection of the synaptic blocker botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) into the hippocampus of adult mice. We confirm BoNT/A cleaves SNAP-25 in the CA1 are of the hippocampus, which has been proven to block neurotransmission. Notably, BoNT/A significantly decreased OPC density and caused their shrinkage, as determined by immunolabeling for the OPC marker NG2. Furthermore, BoNT/A resulted in an overall decrease in the number of OPC processes, as well as a decrease in their lengths and branching frequency. These data indicate that synaptic activity is important for maintaining adult OPC numbers and cellular integrity, which is relevant to pathophysiological scenarios characterized by dysregulation of synaptic activity, such as age-related cognitive decline, Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Behavioral tests assaying digging can be difficult to interpret. We present a novel paradigm combining burrowing and free digging that can be used to explore digging motivation and sex-specific deficits.</p>
<p>​</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Digging behavior is often used to test motor function and repetitive behaviors in mice. Different digging paradigms have been developed for behaviors related to anxiety and compulsion in mouse lines generated to recapitulate genetic mutations leading to psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, the interpretation of these tests has been confounded by the difficulty of determining the motivation behind digging in mice. Digging is a naturalistic mouse behavior that can be focused toward different goals, that is foraging for food, burrowing for shelter, burying objects, or even for recreation as has been shown for dogs, ferrets, and human children. However, the interpretation of results from current testing protocols assumes the motivation behind the behavior often concluding that increased digging is a repetitive or compulsive behavior. We asked whether providing a choice between different types of digging activities would increase sensitivity to assess digging motivation. Here, we present a test to distinguish between burrowing and exploratory digging in mice. We found that mice prefer burrowing when the option is available. When food restriction was used to promote a switch from burrowing to exploration, males readily switched from burrowing to digging outside, while females did not. In addition, when we tested a model of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder that had shown inconsistent results in the marble burying test, the <i>Cc2d1a</i> conditional knockout mouse, we found greatly reduced burrowing only in males. Our findings indicate that digging is a nuanced motivated behavior and suggest that male and female rodents may perform it differently.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can provide original data to investigate age-related brain changes. We examined neural activity modulations induced by two multifocal tDCS procedures based on two distinct montages fitting two N-back task-based fMRI patterns (“compensatory” and “maintenance”) related to high working memory (WM) in a previous publication (Fernández-Cabello et al. Neurobiol Aging (2016);48:23–33). We included 24 participants classified as stable or decliners according to their 4-year WM trajectories following a retrospective longitudinal approach. Then, we studied longitudinal fMRI differences between groups (stable and decliners) and across multifocal tDCS montages (“compensatory” and “maintenance”) applied using a single-blind sham-controlled cross-over design. Decliners evidenced over-activation of non-related WM areas after 4 years of follow-up. Focusing on tDCS effects, among the decliner group, the “compensatory”-tDCS montage reduced the activity over the posterior regions where these subjects showed longitudinal hyperactivation. These results reinforce the notion that tDCS effects are characterized by an activity reduction and might be more noticeable in compromised systems. Importantly, the data provide novel evidence that cognitive trajectories predict tDCS effects in older adults.</p>

     alt="Cleaved PINK1 induces neuronal plasticity through PKA-mediated BDNF functional regulation"/>
<p>In healthy mitochondria, cleaved PINK1 retro-translocates to the cytosol, where it phosphorylates and activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA activation results in the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which subsequently relocates to the nucleus to promote the transcription of genes in CRE-localized domains. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the targets of CREB-mediated transcription. BDNF gets transcribed, translated, post-translationally cleaved, and released into the extracellular space, where it binds to the TRKβ receptor and triggers the synaptic delivery of PSD95.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) lead to early onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease in humans. In healthy neurons, full-length PINK1 (fPINK1) is post-translationally cleaved into different lower molecular weight forms, and cleaved PINK1 (cPINK1) gets shuttled to the cytosolic compartments to support extra-mitochondrial functions. While numerous studies have exemplified the role of mitochondrially localized PINK1 in modulating mitophagy in oxidatively stressed neurons, little is known regarding the physiological role of cPINK1 in healthy neurons. We have previously shown that cPINK1, but not fPINK1, modulates the neurite outgrowth and the maintenance of dendritic arbors by activating downstream protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in healthy neurons. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cPINK1 promotes neurite outgrowth remain to be elucidated. In this report, we show that cPINK1 supports neuronal development by modulating the expression and extracellular release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Consistent with this role, we observed a progressive increase in the level of endogenous cPINK1 but not fPINK1 during prenatal and postnatal development of mouse brains and during development in primary cortical neurons. In cultured primary neurons, the pharmacological activation of endogenous PINK1 leads to enhanced downstream PKA activity, subsequent activation of the PKA-modulated transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), increased intracellular production and extracellular release of BDNF, and enhanced activation of the BDNF receptor-TRKβ. Mechanistically, cPINK1-mediated increased dendrite complexity requires the binding of extracellular BDNF to TRKβ. In summary, our data support a physiological role of cPINK1 in stimulating neuronal development by activating the PKA-CREB-BDNF signaling axis in a feedforward loop.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Extensive alterations in gene regulatory networks are a typical characteristic of Huntington's disease (HD); these include alterations in protein-coding genes and poorly understood non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are associated with pathology caused by mutant huntingtin. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of ncRNAs involved in a variety of biological functions, including transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional modification of many targets, and likely contributed to the pathogenesis of HD. While a number of changes in lncRNAs expression have been observed in HD, little is currently known about their functions. Here, we discuss their possible mechanisms and molecular functions, with a particular focus on their roles in transcriptional regulation. These findings give us a better insight into HD pathogenesis and may provide new targets for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent evidence indicates that both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance are related to enhanced neurocognitive functioning in children by influencing brain structure and functioning. This study investigates the role of white matter microstructure in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning in healthy children. In total 92 children (mean age 9.1 years, range 8.0–10.7) were included in this study. Cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skill performance were assessed using performance-based tests. Neurocognitive functioning was assessed using computerized tests (working memory, inhibition, interference control, information processing, and attention). Diffusion tensor imaging was used in combination with tract-based spatial statistics to assess white matter microstructure as defined by fractional anisotropy (FA), axial and radial diffusivity (AD, RD). The results revealed positive associations of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. Information processing and motor response inhibition were associated with FA in a cluster located in the corpus callosum. Within this cluster, higher cardiovascular fitness and better gross motor skills were both associated with greater FA, greater AD, and lower RD. No mediating role was found for FA in the relationship of both cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills with neurocognitive functioning. The results indicate that cardiovascular fitness and gross motor skills are related to neurocognitive functioning as well as white matter microstructure in children. However, this study provides no evidence for a mediating role of white matter microstructure in these relationships.</p>

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting isolates viable, transduced cells, and sequencing of tagged cells identifies specific gene knockdowns associated with <i>in vivo</i> growth.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-based genetic screens offer unbiased and powerful tools for systematic and specific evaluation of phenotypes associated with specific target genes. CRISPR screens have been utilized heavily <i>in vitro</i> to identify functional coding and noncoding genes in a large number of cell types, including glioblastoma (GB), though no prior study has described the evaluation of CRISPR screening in GB <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we describe a protocol for targeting and transcriptionally repressing GB-specific long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system <i>in vivo</i>, with tumor growth in the mouse cerebral cortex. Given the target-specific parameters of each individual screen, we list general steps involved in transducing guide RNA libraries into GB tumor lines, maintaining sufficient coverage, as well as cortically injecting and subsequently isolating transduced screen tumor cell populations for analysis. Finally, in order to demonstrate the use of this technique to discern an essential lncRNA, HOTAIR, from a nonessential lncRNA, we injected a 1:1 (HOTAIR:control nonessential lncRNA knockdown) mixture of fluorescently tagged U87 GB cells into the cortex of eight mice, evaluating selective depletion of HOTAIR-tagged cells at 2 weeks of growth. Fluorescently tagged populations were analyzed via flow cytometry for hiBFP (control knockdown) and green fluorescent protein (HOTAIR knockdown), revealing 17% (<i>p</i> = 0.007) decrease in fluorescence associated with HOTAIR knockdown relative to control. The described <i>in vivo</i> CRISPR screening methodology thus appears to be an effective option for identifying noncoding (and coding) genes affecting GB growth within the mouse cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Infected primary hydatid cyst of the thigh [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hydatic cyst may occur in many organs such as the liver, lung, brain or heart with radiologic features of liver and lung involvement being well known. The musculo-skeletal site is infrequent accounting for 0.7–3% cases of all cases resulting from direct implantation of oncospheres more often than hematic dissemination. We report the case of an 18-year-old female student who visited our hospital because of a swelling in the posteroexternal aspect of the left thigh that had grown during the previous six months and had become tender in the previous month with setup of fever three days before admission. Superficial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a cystic mass of the posterior compartment of the thigh developed within the short chief of the biceps femoris. Serology for hydatid cyst was positive. The diagnosis of an infected hydatid cyst was suspected preoperatively, and the patient was given antibiotics and anthelminthic treatment. The cyst was then completely excised and the histopathologic exam confirmed the hydatic origin. The patient was put on oral anti-helminthics and has been on regular follow up for last twelve months with no evidence of recurrence. Hydatidosis rarely occurs in the soft tissues and the diagnosis is challenging particularly when it is secondary infected. Hydatid serology provides certainty in the diagnosis of echinococcosis when it is positive. When it’s negative, imaging (Ultrasound, Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) may be an approach for making the diagnosis revealing the most characteristic features of hydatid cyst.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Self-reported COVID-19 among physicians: An Egyptian online study during the pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract:  Background: COVID-19 causes a critical occupational risk to frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) who respond to the pandemic, as they are placed in environments with an increased risk of infection exposure. It is a public health priority to understand how transmission occurs to protect this vulnerable group of HCWs. This study was conducted to estimate the incidence of self-reported COVID-19 infection among physicians and its possible associated factors. Methods: An online national survey using Survey Monkey was initiated to collect sociodemographic e.g. age and sex, occupational e.g. place and duration of work, and clinical data e.g. COVID symptoms and laboratory investigations, and to describe affected physicians' diagnoses. Results: The self-reported incidence of COVID-19 infection was found to be 65.4% among studied physicians. The significant independent predictors of COVID-19 infection were  smoking, working as a frontline physician, having contact with a COVID-19 case, and working for less than ten years [ARR (95% CI): 3.0(1.6-5.7), 2.3(1.4-3.8), 2.1(1.2-3.6), and 1.8(1.2-2.9); respectively]. Conclusions: The incidence of COVID-19 infection among Egyptian physicians is relatively high. Smoking, being a frontline physician, having contact with a COVID-19 case, and working for less than 10 years are all factors associated with an increased risk of infection. There should be strict application of preventive measures, periodic screening for COVID-19 for early detection and isolation of infected HCWs together with effective vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of the performance of the Brazilian Portuguese Nottingham Health Profile in adult growth hormone deficiency and pulmonary hypertension [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) is a generic measure of perceived distress that has been used widely as an outcome measure in clinical practice and trials. The availability of two Brazilian datasets provided the opportunity to assess the psychometric performance of the NHP in different populations - adult growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The purpose of the study was to see how valuable the NHP could be in assessing outcomes in diseases where no disease-specific measures are available. Methods: Secondary analyses were performed with NHP data. Patients diagnosed with adult GHD or PH were administered the NHP during clinic visits on two occasions, two weeks apart. A disease-specific measure of quality of life (QoL) was also administered to the relevant sample of patients on each occasion. Results: The psychometric properties of the NHP were good for both disease groups. As expected, both samples reported high scores on energy level, the PH sample scored high on physical functioning and the GHD sample on emotional reactions. For both samples, most of the NHP sections were able to distinguish between groups of respondents with different ratings of perceived general health. While most sections of the NHP were relatively highly correlated with the QoL measures, pain and sleep did not seem to be important predictors of QoL in either of the samples. Conclusions: The use of the NHP in adult GHD and PH populations in Brazil is not recommended as there are high-quality disease-specific measures available for each disease. However, where no disease-specific measures are available, the NHP can provide good descriptive information of the impact of disease on different patient populations.

                Background: The scientific research into the varied factors that influence cricket performance has become a focal area for overall improved performance. Although there has been documented evidence for both anthropometry and physical fitness among elite cricketers, there is a paucity of evidence among the club cricket cohort. This pilot study aims to evaluate the anthropometric and fitness measurements among a pilot sample of university club cricketers (n = 17; 9 batsmen and 8 bowlers) in South Africa. Methods: Retrospective data were collected from the university’s male first cricket team of the 2019/2020 season. The data included both anthropometric (height, body mass, and body mass index) and physical fitness (explosive power, strength, Yo-Yo, speed and agility) parameters. The results exhibited for every parameter were presented according to height categories and player positions (batsman and bowler). Student t-tests were performed to determine the differences between fitness and anthropometric variables among both height categories and player positions. All data were analysed using SPSS (Version 26, IBM). The level of significance was set at p<0.05. Results: The results indicated significant differences for height categories with regards to stature (p = 0.000) and agility (p = 0.03). Significant differences were also evident for different player positions with regards to body fat percentage (p = 0.02) and vertical jump distance (p = 0.03). Conclusions: The findings of this pilot study indicated that cricketers who are shorter in stature are less superior with regards to anthropometric and fitness capabilities than their taller counterparts. In addition to being aware of the variances that exist for anthropometry, stature and fitness among cricketers at any level; this study provides implications for both coaches and sports scientists at the club level (under-researched level) in terms of how this can translate to player performances in accordance to height categories and player positions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: A case of tuberculosis lymphadenitis mimicking a gastric tumor [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Solitary tuberculosis of the upper gastrointestinal tract is a rare pathology that usually mimics the clinical and radiological features of malignant tumors. A gastric subepithelial tumor is usually detected during diagnostic endoscopy. Stomach tuberculosis, in particular, can appear as a subepithelial tumor of the stomach wall. Several cases of gastric tuberculosis imitating subepithelial gastric tumors have been reported recently. We describe the case of a patient with tuberculous lymphadenitis that mimics a submucosal gastric tumor. A 52-year-old female was admitted to our surgical department for epigastric pain and weight loss. Endoscopy was inconclusive; it revealed either a submucosal compression or an anterior submucosal lesion with erosive anterior gastropathy and a fistulous orifice located in the bulb. The patient was diagnosed with a gastric tumor and an endoscopic ultrasound demonstrated a rounded hypoechogenic antral lesion that was not vascularized and was distant from the gastric wall, whose five layers appeared of a normal aspect. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy. A biopsy was sent intraoperatively for frozen section examination, and concluded that the diagnosis was tuberculous intraperitoneal lymphadenitis. The patient received anti-tuberculosis treatment. This case demonstrates that gastric tuberculosis remains a challenging diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Models of heterogeneous dopamine signaling in an insect learning and memory center</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Linnie Jiang, Ashok Litwin-Kumar</p>

The <i>Drosophila</i> mushroom body exhibits dopamine dependent synaptic plasticity that underlies the acquisition of associative memories. Recordings of dopamine neurons in this system have identified signals related to external reinforcement such as reward and punishment. However, other factors including locomotion, novelty, reward expectation, and internal state have also recently been shown to modulate dopamine neurons. This heterogeneity is at odds with typical modeling approaches in which these neurons are assumed to encode a global, scalar error signal. How is dopamine dependent plasticity coordinated in the presence of such heterogeneity? We develop a modeling approach that infers a pattern of dopamine activity sufficient to solve defined behavioral tasks, given architectural constraints informed by knowledge of mushroom body circuitry. Model dopamine neurons exhibit diverse tuning to task parameters while nonetheless producing coherent learned behaviors. Notably, reward prediction error emerges as a mode of population activity distributed across these neurons. Our results provide a mechanistic framework that accounts for the heterogeneity of dopamine activity during learning and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Trip duration drives shift in travel network structure with implications for the predictability of spatial disease spread</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John R. Giles, Derek AT Cummings, Bryan T. Grenfell, Andrew J. Tatem, Elisabeth zu Erbach-Schoenberg, CJE Metcalf, Amy Wesolowski</p>

Human travel is one of the primary drivers of infectious disease spread. Models of travel are often used that assume the amount of travel to a specific destination decreases as cost of travel increases with higher travel volumes to more populated destinations. Trip duration, the length of time spent in a destination, can also impact travel patterns. We investigated the spatial patterns of travel conditioned on trip duration and find distinct differences between short and long duration trips. In short-trip duration travel networks, trips are skewed towards urban destinations, compared with long-trip duration networks where travel is more evenly spread among locations. Using gravity models to inform connectivity patterns in simulations of disease transmission, we show that pathogens with shorter generation times exhibit initial patterns of spatial propagation that are more predictable among urban locations. Further, pathogens with a longer generation time have more diffusive patterns of spatial spread reflecting more unpredictable disease dynamics.

Sharks (Selachimorpha) are iconic marine predators that have survived multiple mass extinctions over geologic time. Their prolific fossil record is represented mainly by isolated shed teeth, which provide the basis for reconstructing deep time diversity changes affecting different selachimorph clades. By contrast, corresponding shifts in shark ecology, as measured through morphological disparity, have received comparatively limited analytical attention. Here, we use a geometric morphometric approach to comprehensively examine tooth morphologies in multiple shark lineages traversing the catastrophic end-Cretaceous mass extinction—this event terminated the Mesozoic Era 66 million years ago. Our results show that selachimorphs maintained virtually static levels of dental disparity in most of their constituent clades across the Cretaceous–Paleogene interval. Nevertheless, selective extinctions did impact apex predator species characterized by triangular blade-like teeth. This is particularly evident among lamniforms, which included the dominant Cretaceous anacoracids. Conversely, other groups, such as carcharhiniforms and orectolobiforms, experienced disparity modifications, while heterodontiforms, hexanchiforms, squaliforms, squatiniforms, and †synechodontiforms were not overtly affected. Finally, while some lamniform lineages disappeared, others underwent postextinction disparity increases, especially odontaspidids, which are typified by narrow-cusped teeth adapted for feeding on fishes. Notably, this increase coincides with the early Paleogene radiation of teleosts as a possible prey source, and the geographic relocation of disparity sampling “hotspots,” perhaps indicating a regionally disjunct extinction recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals a complex morphological response to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction and highlights an event that influenced the evolution of modern sharks.

<p>LDT–VTA inputs optogenetic manipulation changes motivational drive and modifies preference.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) is a brainstem nucleus classically involved in REM sleep and attention, and that has recently been associated with reward-related behaviors, as it controls the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, modulating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. To further understand the role of LDT–VTA inputs in reinforcement, we optogenetically manipulated these inputs during different behavioral paradigms in male rats. We found that in a two-choice instrumental task, optical activation of LDT–VTA projections shifts and amplifies preference to the laser-paired reward in comparison to an otherwise equal reward; the opposite was observed with inhibition experiments. In a progressive ratio task, LDT–VTA activation boosts motivation, that is, enhances the willingness to work to get the reward associated with LDT–VTA stimulation; and the reverse occurs when inhibiting these inputs. Animals abolished preference if the reward was omitted, suggesting that LDT–VTA stimulation adds/decreases value to the stimulation-paired reward. In addition, we show that LDT–VTA optical activation induces robust preference in the conditioned and real-time place preference tests, while optical inhibition induces aversion. The behavioral findings are supported by electrophysiological recordings and c-fos immunofluorescence correlates in downstream target regions. In LDT–VTA ChR2 animals, we observed an increase in the recruitment of lateral VTA dopamine neurons and D1 neurons from nucleus accumbens core and shell; whereas in LDT–VTA NpHR animals, D2 neurons appear to be preferentially recruited. Collectively, these data show that the LDT–VTA inputs encode positive reinforcement signals and are important for different dimensions of reward-related behaviors.</p>

<p>This study investigated early and late processing of emotional stimuli in incarcerated violent offenders with psychopathic traits as compared to controls. Findings reveal no abnormal early responses in offenders but suggest specific late alterations in the neural processing of emotional stimuli.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Antisocial and psychopathic individuals are characterized by a reduced responsivity to affective information. Yet, the role of attentional processes as possible modulator of these deficits is poorly understood. The current study investigated early and late processing of emotional stimuli in a sample of incarcerated offenders while manipulating the attentional focus. Twenty-seven male violent offenders with psychopathic traits and 27 healthy controls completed two experimental tasks while electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected. Task 1 assessed indirect processing of emotional or neutral distractors during a perceptual judgment task, while Task 2 measured direct processing of the emotional or neutral stimuli and required participants to rate the stimuli regarding valence and arousal. EEG data indicated no differences in early stage processing (early posterior negativity) between the experimental groups. However, we found significant group differences with regard to the late processing stage (late positive potential, LPP). Controls showed increased LPP amplitudes in Task 2 as compared to Task 1, indicating that task demands (i.e., attentional focus) had an effect on the processing of the emotional stimuli. In contrast, LPP amplitudes in the violent offender group were largely unaffected by task demands, suggesting specific late alterations in the neural processing of emotional stimuli. In sum, this study provides new evidence for a modulatory impact of attention on affective information processing in male violent offenders with psychopathic traits.</p>

                Using a modern machine learning approach, we show that the I/O characteristics of cortical pyramidal neurons can be approximated, at the millisecond resolution (single spike precision), by a temporally convolutional neural network with five to eight layers. This computational complexity stems mainly from the interplay between NMDA receptors and dendritic morphology.

                Tan et al. show that the majority of LIN28 binding sites are found on non-miRNA transcripts like coding and ribosomal RNA. Binding to non-miRNA sites sequesters LIN28 protein and competitively inhibits the regulation of miRNAs. Non-miRNA sites can thus modulate the strength of cellular miRNA activity in cells.

They find that altered urea cycle metabolites and mitochondrial arginase 2 (Arg2) play important roles in Tug1/PGC1α-induced mitochondrial remodeling.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Actinin BioID reveals sarcomere crosstalk with oxidative metabolism through interactions with IGF2BP2</a></h4>

              
                Ladha et al. combine BioID, human cardiomyocytes, and CRISPR-Cas9 to interrogate the actinin interactome. This reveals 324 actinin proximity partners, including RNA-binding proteins that bind transcripts encoding ETC functional components. Among these RNA-binding proteins, IGF2BP2 directly binds actinin, and actinin-IGF2BP2 interactions regulate ETC transcript localization and metabolic adaptation to sarcomere function.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">GDF15 mediates the metabolic effects of PPARβ/δ by activating AMPK</a></h4>

              
                GDF15 is a stress response cytokine that regulates energy metabolism. Aguilar-Recarte et al. show that PPARβ/δ activation increases GDF15 levels, which contributes to the metabolic effect of this receptor and activates AMPK in skeletal muscle independently of GDF15 receptor GFRAL.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A transepithelial pathway delivers succinate to macrophages, thus perpetuating their pro-inflammatory metabolic state</a></h4>

              
                Succinate is emerging as a prominent pro-inflammatory metabolite. Fremder et al. show that transporter-mediated succinate uptake into macrophages is elevated to enhance and perpetuate inflammation. In IBD, high succinate metabolized by distinct gut bacteria may cause chronic inflammation. Hence, this pathway is a potential therapeutic target to treat inflammatory diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Twisting of the zebrafish heart tube during cardiac looping is a tbx5-dependent and tissue-intrinsic process</a></h4>

              
                Organ laterality refers to the left-right asymmetry in disposition and conformation of internal organs and is established during embryogenesis. The heart is the first organ to display visible left-right asymmetries through its left-sided positioning and rightward looping. Here, we present a new zebrafish loss-of-function allele for <i>tbx5a</i>, which displays defective rightward cardiac looping morphogenesis. By mapping individual cardiomyocyte behavior during cardiac looping, we establish that ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes rearrange in distinct directions. As a consequence, the cardiac chambers twist around the atrioventricular canal resulting in torsion of the heart tube, which is compromised in <i>tbx5a</i> mutants. Pharmacological treatment and ex vivo culture establishes that the cardiac twisting depends on intrinsic mechanisms and is independent from cardiac growth. Furthermore, genetic experiments indicate that looping requires proper tissue patterning. We conclude that cardiac looping involves twisting of the chambers around the atrioventricular canal, which requires correct tissue patterning by Tbx5a.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Left-right side-specific endocrine signaling complements neural pathways to mediate acute asymmetric effects of brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Brain injuries can interrupt descending neural pathways that convey motor commands from the cortex to spinal motoneurons. Here, we demonstrate that a unilateral injury of the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex of rats with completely transected thoracic spinal cord produces hindlimb postural asymmetry with contralateral flexion and asymmetric hindlimb withdrawal reflexes within 3 hr, as well as asymmetry in gene expression patterns in the lumbar spinal cord. The injury-induced postural effects were abolished by hypophysectomy and were mimicked by transfusion of serum from animals with brain injury. Administration of the pituitary neurohormones β-endorphin or Arg-vasopressin-induced side-specific hindlimb responses in naive animals, while antagonists of the opioid and vasopressin receptors blocked hindlimb postural asymmetry in rats with brain injury. Thus, in addition to the well-established involvement of motor pathways descending from the brain to spinal circuits, the side-specific humoral signaling may also add to postural and reflex asymmetries seen after brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Analysis of the Mechanosensor Channel Functionality of TACAN</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensitive ion channels mediate transmembrane ion currents activated by mechanical forces. A mechanosensitive ion channel called TACAN was recently reported. We began to study TACAN with the intent to understand how it senses mechanical forces and functions as an ion channel. Using cellular patch-recording methods we failed to identify mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Using membrane reconstitution methods we found that TACAN, at high protein concentrations, produces heterogeneous conduction levels that are not mechanosensitive and are most consistent with disruptions of the lipid bilayer. We determined the structure of TACAN using single particle cryo-EM and observe that it forms a symmetrical dimeric transmembrane protein. Each protomer contains an intracellular-facing cleft with a coenzyme-A cofactor, confirmed by mass spectrometry. The TACAN protomers are related in 3-dimensional structure to a fatty acid elongase, ELOVL. Whilst its physiological function remains unclear, we anticipate that TACAN is not a mechanosensitive ion channel.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning to stand with unexpected sensorimotor delays</a></h4>

              
                Human standing balance relies on self-motion estimates that are used by the nervous system to detect unexpected movements and enable corrective responses and adaptations in control. These estimates must accommodate for inherent delays in sensory and motor pathways. Here, we used a robotic system to simulate human standing in the anteroposterior direction about the ankles and impose sensorimotor delays into the control of balance. Imposed delays destabilized standing, but through training, participants adapted and re-learned to balance with the delays. Before training, imposed delays attenuated vestibular contributions to balance and triggered perceptions of unexpected standing motion, suggesting increased uncertainty in the internal self-motion estimates. After training, vestibular contributions partially returned to baseline levels and larger delays were needed to evoke perceptions of unexpected standing motion. Through learning, the nervous system accommodates balance sensorimotor delays by causally linking whole-body sensory feedback (initially interpreted as imposed motion) to self-generated balance motor commands.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Temporal pattern and synergy influence activity of ERK signaling pathways during L-LTP induction</a></h4>

              
                Long-lasting long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is a cellular mechanism of learning and memory storage. Studies have demonstrated a requirement for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in L-LTP produced by a diversity of temporal stimulation patterns. Multiple signaling pathways converge to activate ERK, with different pathways being required for different stimulation patterns. To answer whether and how different temporal patterns select different signaling pathways for ERK activation, we developed a computational model of five signaling pathways (including two novel pathways) leading to ERK activation during L-LTP induction. We show that calcium and cAMP work synergistically to activate ERK and that stimuli given with large inter-trial intervals activate more ERK than shorter intervals. Furthermore, these pathways contribute to different dynamics of ERK activation. These results suggest that signaling pathways with different temporal sensitivity facilitate ERK activation to diversity of temporal patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Causal neural mechanisms of context-based object recognition</a></h4>

              
                Objects can be recognized based on their intrinsic features, including shape, color, and texture. In daily life, however, such features are often not clearly visible, for example when objects appear in the periphery, in clutter, or at a distance. Interestingly, object recognition can still be highly accurate under these conditions when objects are seen within their typical scene context. What are the neural mechanisms of context-based object recognition? According to parallel processing accounts, context-based object recognition is supported by the parallel processing of object and scene information in separate pathways. Output of these pathways is then combined in downstream regions, leading to contextual benefits in object recognition. Alternatively, according to feedback accounts, context-based object recognition is supported by (direct or indirect) feedback from scene-selective to object-selective regions. Here, in three pre-registered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiments, we tested a key prediction of the feedback hypothesis: that scene-selective cortex causally and selectively supports context-based object recognition before object-selective cortex does. Early visual cortex (EVC), object-selective lateral occipital cortex (LOC), and scene-selective occipital place area (OPA) were stimulated at three time points relative to stimulus onset while participants categorized degraded objects in scenes and intact objects in isolation, in different trials. Results confirmed our predictions: relative to isolated object recognition, context-based object recognition was selectively and causally supported by OPA at 160–200 ms after onset, followed by LOC at 260–300 ms after onset. These results indicate that context-based expectations facilitate object recognition by disambiguating object representations in the visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct roles of nonmuscle myosin II isoforms for establishing tension and elasticity during cell morphodynamics</a></h4>

              
                Nonmuscle myosin II (NM II) is an integral part of essential cellular processes, including adhesion and migration. Mammalian cells express up to three isoforms termed NM IIA, B, and C. We used U2OS cells to create CRISPR/Cas9-based knockouts of all three isoforms and analyzed the phenotypes on homogenously-coated surfaces, in collagen gels, and on micropatterned substrates. In contrast to homogenously-coated surfaces, a structured environment supports a cellular phenotype with invaginated actin arcs even in the absence of NM IIA-induced contractility. A quantitative shape analysis of cells on micropatterns combined with a scale-bridging mathematical model reveals that NM IIA is essential to build up cellular tension during initial stages of force generation, while NM IIB is necessary to elastically stabilize NM IIA-generated tension. A dynamic cell stretch/release experiment in a three-dimensional scaffold confirms these conclusions and in addition reveals a novel role for NM IIC, namely the ability to establish tensional homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TMEM120A is a coenzyme A-binding membrane protein with structural similarities to ELOVL fatty acid elongase</a></h4>

              
                TMEM120A, also named as TACAN, is a novel membrane protein highly conserved in vertebrates and was recently proposed to be a mechanosensitive channel involved in sensing mechanical pain. Here we present the single particle cryo-EM structure of human TMEM120A which forms a tightly packed dimer with extensive interactions mediate by the N-terminal coiled coil domain (CCD), the C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD), and the re-entrant loop between the two domains. The TMD of each TMEM120A subunit contains six transmembrane helices (TMs) and has no clear structural feature of a channel protein. Instead, the six TMs form an α-barrel with a deep pocket where a coenzyme A (CoA) molecule is bound. Intriguingly, some structural features of TMEM120A resemble those of elongase for very long-chain fatty acid (ELOVL) despite low sequence homology between them, pointing to the possibility that TMEM120A may function as an enzyme for fatty acid metabolism, rather than a mechanosensitive channel.

                Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) 1 and 2 maintain stable cellular memories of early fate decisions by establishing heritable patterns of gene repression. PRCs repress transcription through histone modifications and chromatin compaction, but their roles in neuronal subtype diversification are poorly defined. We unexpectedly found that PRC2 is dispensable to preserve the morphogen-induced positional fates of spinal motor neurons (MNs), while PRC1 is essential for the specification of segmentally-restricted subtypes. Mutation of the core PRC1 component Ring1 in mice leads to increased chromatin accessibility and ectopic expression of a broad variety of fates determinants, including Hox transcription factors, while neuronal class-specific features are maintained. Loss of MN subtype identities in Ring1 mutants is due to the suppression of Hox networks by derepressed caudal Hox genes. These results indicate that PRC1 can function independently of de novo PRC2-dependent histone methylation to maintain chromatin topology and transcriptional memory at the time of neuronal differentiation.

                Sexually dimorphic courtship behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster develop from the activity of the sexual differentiation genes, doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru), functioning with other regulatory factors that have received little attention. The dissatisfaction gene (dsf) encodes an orphan nuclear receptor homologous to vertebrate Tlx and Drosophila tailless that is critical for the development of several aspects of female- and male-specific sexual behaviors. Here, we report the pattern of dsf expression in the central nervous system and show that the activity of sexually dimorphic abdominal interneurons that co-express dsf and dsx is necessary and sufficient for vaginal plate opening in virgin females and abdominal curling in males during courtship. We find that dsf activity results in different neuroanatomical outcomes in females and males, promoting and suppressing, respectively, female development and function of the DDAG neurons depending upon the sexual state of dsx expression. We posit that dsf and dsx interact to specify sex differences in the neural circuitry for dimorphic abdominal behaviors.

                BDNF has remarkable protective roles in the central nervous system to ensure neurons and glial cell survival and proper functions. The regulatory processes behind the BDNF expression have not been revealed completely. Here, it was explored whether Malat1 and Hotair lncRNAs play roles in the regulation of Bdnf expression level, modification of fingolimod downstream pathway, and oligodendrocytes precursor cells maturation. By Hotair and Malat1 downregulation, their regulatory mechanism on Bdnf expression was investigated. Immunostaining and RT-qPCR assays were employed to assess the effects of fingolimod and lncRNAs on OPCs maturation. The results represented that Hotair and Malat1 lncRNAs may regulate Bdnf expression in primary glial cells significantly, and also can coordinate fingolimod stimulatory effect on Bdnf expression. Furthermore, Malat1 may have a role in the last stages of the intrinsic oligodendrocyte myelination. Here it was demonstrated that these lncRNAs have critical roles in the Bdnf level, fingolimod mechanism of action, and OPCs maturation. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of neurotrophins leads to a better comprehension of the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disorder and designing more effective treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Immediate Impact of Yogic Breathing on Pulsatile Cerebrospinal Fluid Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a clear fluid bathing the central nervous system (CNS), undergoes pulsatile movements, and plays a critical role for the removal of waste products from the brain including amyloid beta, a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. Regulation of CSF dynamics is critical for maintaining CNS health, and increased pulsatile CSF dynamics may alter brain's waste clearance due to increased mixing and diffusion. As such, understanding the mechanisms driving CSF movement, and interventions that influence its resultant removal of wastes from the brain is of high scientific and clinical impact. Since pulsatile CSF dynamics is sensitive and synchronous to respiratory movements, we are interested in identifying potential integrative therapies such as yogic breathing to regulate and enhance CSF dynamics, which has not been reported before. Here, we investigated the pre-intervention baseline data from our ongoing randomized controlled trial, and examined whether yogic breathing immediately impacts pulsatile CSF dynamics compared to spontaneous breathing. We utilized our previously established non-invasive real-time phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging (RT-PCMRI) approach using a 3T MRI instrument, and computed and rigorously tested differences in CSF velocities (instantaneous, respiratory, cardiac 1st and 2nd harmonics) at the level of foramen magnum during spontaneous versus four yogic breathing patterns. In examinations of 18 healthy participants (eight females, ten males; mean age 34.9 {+/-} 14 (SD) years; age range: 18-61 years), we discovered immediate increase in cranially-directed velocities of instantaneous-CSF 16% - 28% and respiratory-CSF 60% - 118% during yogic versus spontaneous breathing, with most statistically significant changes during deep abdominal breathing (28%, p=0.0008, and 118%, p=0.0001, respectively). Further, cardiac pulsation was the primary source of pulsatile CSF during all breathing conditions except during deep abdominal breathing, when there was a comparable contribution of respiratory and cardiac 1st harmonic power [0.59 {+/-} 0.78], demonstrating respiration can be the primary regulator of CSF depending on individual differences in breath depth and location. Further work is needed to investigate the impact of sustained training yogic breathing on increased pulsatile CSF dynamics and brain waste clearance for CNS health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phox2b mutation mediated by Atoh1 expression impaired respiratory rhythm and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia</a></h4>

              
                Retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) neurons are involved in central chemoreception and respiratory control. Lineage tracing studies demonstrate RTN neurons to be derived from Phox2b and Atoh1 expressing progenitor cells in rhombere 4. Phox2b exon 3 mutations cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), producing an impaired respiratory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia. Our goal was to investigate the extent to which a conditional mutation of Phox2b within Atoh1-derived cells might affect a) respiratory rhythm; b) ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia and c) number of RTN-chemosensitive neurons. Here, we used a transgenic mouse line carrying a conditional Phox2b{Delta}8 mutation activated by cre-recombinase. We crossed them with Atoh1Cre mice. Ventilation was measured by whole body plethysmograph during neonate and adult life. In room air, experimental and control groups showed similar basal ventilation; however, Atoh1Cre/Phox2b{Delta}8 increased breath irregularity. The hypercapnia and hypoxia ventilatory responses were impaired in neonates. In contrast, adult mice recovered ventilatory response to hypercapnia, but not to hypoxia. Anatomically, we observed a reduction of the Phox2b+/TH- expressing neurons within the RTN region. Our data indicates that conditionally expression of Phox2b mutation by Atoh1 affect development of the RTN neurons and are essential for the activation of breathing under hypoxic and hypercapnia condition, providing new evidence for mechanisms related to CCHS neuropathology

                In degenerative retinal disorders, rod and cone photoreceptors die, causing vision impairment and blindness. Downstream neurons survive but undergo morphological and physiological remodeling, with some retinal ganglion cells (RGC) exhibiting heightened spontaneous firing. Retinoic acid (RA) has been implicated as the key signaling molecule that induces RGC hyperactivity, obscuring RGC light responses and reducing light avoidance behaviors triggered by residual rods and cones. However, evidence that RA-dependent remodeling corrupts image-forming vision has been lacking. Here we show that disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits RA synthesis, and BMS 493, an RA receptor (RAR) inhibitor, reduce RGC hyperactivity and augment image detection in visually impaired mice. Functional imaging of visual cortical neurons shows that disulfiram and BMS 493 sharpen orientation-tuning and strengthen response fidelity to naturalistic scenes. These findings establish a causal link between RA-induced retinal hyperactivity and vision impairment and define molecular targets and candidate drugs for boosting image-forming vision in retinal degeneration.

                Neural stem cells (NSCs) have great potential in the application of neurodegenerative disease therapy, drug screening and disease modeling. NSC can be generated by reprogramming from terminally differentiated cells with transcription factors or small molecules. However, current methods for producing NSCs involve the danger of integrating foreign genes into the genome and the problem of low efficiency. Here, we report an efficient method to generate NSCs from human skin-derived fibroblasts with microRNA (mir-302a) in 2-3 days. The induced NSCs (iNSCs) have more than 90% of purity. Their morphology is similar to regular NSCs, expressing key markers including Nestin, Pax6 and Sox2, and can be expanded for more than 20 passages in vitro. They can also differentiate into functional neuron progeny, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes as well. Those cells can elicit action potential, can be xeno-transplanted into the brain of immune-deficient mice, and can survive and differentiate in vivo without tumor formation. This study shows that a single part of pluripotency-inducing mir-302 cluster can drive fibroblasts reprogramming, providing a general platform for high-efficiency generation of individual-specific human NSCs for studies of neuron system development and regenerative cell therapy.

                Atmospheric Particulate Matter (PM) is one of the leading environmental risk factors for the global burden of disease. Increasing epidemiological studies demonstrated that PM plays a significant role in CNS demyelinating disorders; however, there is no direct testimony of this, and yet the molecular mechanism by which the occurrence remains unclear. Using multiple in vivo and in vitro strategies, in the present study we demonstrate that PM exposure aggravates neuroinflammation, myelin injury, and dysfunction of movement coordination ability via boosting microglial pro inflammatory activities, in both the pathological demyelination and physiological myelinogenesis animal models. Indeed, pharmacological disturbance combined with RNA seq and ChIP seq suggests that TLR-4/NF-{kappa}B signaling mediated a core network of genes that control PM triggered microglia pathogenicity. In summary, our study defines a novel atmospheric environmental mechanism that mediates PM aggravated microglia pathogenic activities, and establishes a systematic approach for the investigation of the effects of environmental exposure in neurologic disorders.

                Normative modeling is an emerging and innovative framework for mapping individual differences at the level of a single subject or observation in relation to a reference model. It involves charting centiles of variation across a population in terms of mappings between biology and behavior which can then be used to make statistical inferences at the level of the individual. The fields of computational psychiatry and clinical neuroscience have been slow to transition away from patient versus healthy control analytic approaches, likely due to a lack of tools designed to properly model biological heterogeneity of mental disorders. Normative modeling provides a solution to address this issue and moves analysis away from case-control comparisons that rely on potentially noisy clinical labels. In this article, we define a standardized protocol to guide users through, from start to finish, normative modeling analysis using the Predictive Clinical Neuroscience toolkit (PCNtoolkit). We describe the input data selection process, provide intuition behind the various modeling choices, and conclude by demonstrating several examples of downstream analyses the normative model results may facilitate, such as stratification of high-risk individuals, subtyping, and behavioral predictive modeling.

                Methods to visualize gene expression in the Drosophila central nervous system are important in fly neurogenetic studies. In this chapter, we describe a detailed protocol that sequentially combines in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and immunostaining to detect mRNA and protein expression in whole-mount Drosophila larval and adult central nervous systems. We demonstrate the application of in situ HCR in comparisons of nervous system gene expression between Drosophila species, and in the validation of single-cell RNA-Seq results in the fly nervous system. Our protocol provides a simple, robust, multiplexable, and relatively affordable means to quantitatively visualize gene expression in the nervous system of flies, facilitating its general use in fly neurogenetic studies.

                Purpose: When the speech motor system encounters errors, it generates adaptive responses to compensate for the errors. We previously showed that adaptive responses to task-irrelevant errors are significantly smaller than responses to task-relevant errors when errors are introduced gradually. The current study aimed to examine responses to task-irrelevant and task-relevant errors when errors are introduced suddenly. Method: We used an adaptation paradigm in which participants experienced task-relevant errors (induced by formant-shift perturbations) and task-irrelevant errors (induced by formant-clamp perturbations). For one group of participants (N = 30), we applied the perturbations gradually. The second group of participants (N = 30) received the perturbations suddenly. We designed the perturbations based on participant-specific vowel configurations such that a participant's first and second formants of /{varepsilon}/ were perturbed toward their /ae/. To estimate adaptive responses, we measured formant changes (within 0-100 ms of the vowel onset) in response to the formant perturbations. Results: We found that (1) the difference between adaptive responses to formant-shift and formant-clamp perturbations was the smallest for the suddenly introduced perturbations, and (2) responses to formant-shift perturbations positively correlated with responses to formant-clamp perturbations for the suddenly (but not gradually) introduced perturbations. Conclusions: These results showed that the speech motor system responds to task-relevant errors and task-irrelevant errors more differently when errors are introduced gradually than suddenly. Overall, the speech motor system evaluates the relevance of errors and uses its evaluation to modulate its adaptive responses to errors.

                Purkinje cells (PCs) are spontaneously active neurons of the cerebellar cortex that inhibit glutamatergic projection neurons within the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) that in turn provide the primary cerebellar output. Brief reductions in PC firing rapidly increase DCN neuron firing. However, prolonged reductions in PC inhibition, as seen in some disease states, certain types of transgenic mice, and in acute slices of the cerebellum, do not evoke large sustained increases in DCN firing. Here we test whether there is a mechanism of spike-frequency adaptation in DCN neurons that could account for these properties. We find that prolonged optogenetic suppression of PC synapses in vivo transiently elevates PC firing that strongly adapts within ten seconds. We perform current-clamp recordings at near physiological temperature in acute brain slices to examine how DCN neurons respond to prolonged depolarizations. Adaptation in DCN neurons is exceptionally slow and bidirectional. A depolarizing current step evokes large initial increases in firing that decay to less than 20% of the initial increase within approximately ten seconds. Such slow adaptation could allow DCN neurons to adapt to prolonged changes in PC firing while maintaining their linear firing frequency-current relationship on subsecond time scales.

                Prolonged exposure to loud noise has been shown to affect inner ear sensory hair cells in a variety of deleterious manners, including damaging the stereocilia core. The damaged sites can be visualized as gaps in phalloidin staining of F-actin, and the enrichment of monomeric actin at these sites, along with an actin nucleator and crosslinker, suggests that localized remodeling occurs to repair the broken filaments. Herein we show that gaps in mouse auditory hair cells are largely repaired within one week of traumatic noise exposure through the incorporation of newly synthesized actin. Additionally, we report that XIRP2 is required for the repair process and facilitates the enrichment of monomeric {gamma}-actin at gaps through its LIM domain-containing C-terminus. Our study describes a novel process by which hair cells can recover from sub-lethal hair bundle damage and which may contribute to recovery from temporary hearing threshold shifts and the prevention of age-related hearing loss.

                Background: Quantitative EEG (qEEG) can capture changes in brain activity that follow a stroke. Accordingly, EEG metrics could be used to monitor patients state and recovery. Although qEEG metrics traditionally focus on oscillatory activity, recent findings highlight the importance of aperiodic (power-law) structure in characterizing pathological brain states. Objective: To assess neurophysiological impairment and recovery from mono-hemispheric stroke by means of the Spectral Exponent (SE), a metric that reflects EEG slowing and quantifies the power-law decay of the EEG Power Spectral Density (PSD). To relate neurophysiological recovery with patients functional outcome. Methods: Eighteen patients (n=18) with Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) ischaemic stroke were retrospectively enrolled for this study. Patients underwent EEG recording in the sub-acute phase (T0) and after 2 months of physical rehabilitation (T1). Sixteen healthy controls (HC; n=16) matched by age and sex were enrolled as a normative group. SE values and narrow-band PSD were estimated for each recording. We compared SE and band-power between patients and HC, and between the affected (AH) and unaffected hemisphere (UH) at T0 and T1 in patients. Results: At T0, stroke patients showed significantly more negative SE values than HC (p=0.003), reflecting broad-band EEG slowing. Moreover, SE over the AH was consistently more negative compared to the UH and showed a renormalization at T1 in our patient sample. This SE renormalization significantly correlated with NIHSS improvement (R= 0.63, p=0.005). Conclusions: SE is a reliable readout of the electric changes occurring in the brain after an ischaemic cortical lesion. Moreover, SE holds the promise to be a robust method to assess stroke impairment as well as to monitor and predict functional outcome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Three-level Sleep Stage Classification Based on Wrist-worn Accelerometry Data Alone</a></h4>

              
                Objective: The use of wearable sensor devices on daily basis to track real-time movements during wake and sleep has provided opportunities for automatic sleep quantification using such data. Existing algorithms for classifying sleep stages often require large training data and multiple input signals including heart rate and respiratory data. We aimed to examine the capability of classifying sleep stages using sensible features directly from accelerometers only with the aid of advanced recurrent neural networks. Materials and Methods: We analyzed a publicly available dataset with accelerometry data in 5s epoch length and polysomnography assessments. We developed long short-term memory (LSTM) models that take the 3-axis accelerations, angles, and temperatures from concurrent and historic observation windows to predict wake, REM and non-REM sleep. Leave-one-subject-out experiments were conducted to compare and evaluate the model performance with conventional nonsequential machine learning models using metrics such as multiclass training and testing accuracy, weighted precision, F1 score and area-under-the-curve (AUC). Results: Our sequential analysis framework outperforms traditional non-sequential models in all aspects of model evaluation metrics. We achieved an average of 65% and a maximum of 81% validation accuracy for classifying three sleep labels even with a relatively small training sample of clinical visitors. The presence of two additional derived variables, local variability and range, have shown to strongly improve the model performance. Discussion : Results indicate that it is crucial to account for deep temporal dependency and assess local variability of the features. The post-hoc analysis of individual model performances on subjects' demographic characteristics also suggest the need of including pathological samples in the training data in order to develop robust machine learning models that are capable of capturing normal and anomaly sleep patterns in the population.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A systematic data-driven approach to analyze sensor-level EEG connectivity: Identifying robust phase-synchronized network components using surface Laplacian with spectral-spatial PCA</a></h4>

              
                Although conventional averaging across predefined frequency bands reduces the complexity of EEG functional connectivity (FC), it obscures the identification of resting-state brain networks (RSN) and impedes accurate estimation of FC reliability. Extending prior work, we combined scalp current source density (CSD; spherical spline surface Laplacian) and spectral-spatial PCA to identify FC components. Phase-based FC was estimated via debiased weighted phase-locking index from CSD-transformed resting EEGs (71 sensors, 8 min, eyes open/closed, 35 healthy adults, 1-week retest). Spectral PCA extracted 6 robust alpha and theta factors (86.6% variance). Subsequent spatial PCA for each spectral factor revealed seven robust regionally-focused (posterior, central, frontal) and long-range (posterior-anterior) alpha components (peaks at 8, 10 and 13 Hz) and a midfrontal theta (6 Hz) component, accounting for 37.0% of FC variance. These spatial FC components were consistent with well-known networks (e.g., default mode, visual, sensorimotor), and four were sensitive to eyes open/closed conditions. Most FC components had good-to-excellent internal consistency (odd/even epochs, eyes open/closed) and test-retest reliability (ICCs [&ge;] .8). Moreover, the FC component structure was generally present in subsamples (session x odd/even epoch, or smaller subgroups [n = 7-10]), as indicated by similarity of factor loadings across PCA solutions. Apart from systematically reducing FC dimensionality, our approach avoids arbitrary thresholds and allows quantification of meaningful and reliable network components that may prove to be of high relevance for basic and clinical research applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intracrine Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Maintains Hippocampal Neural Stem Cell Quiescence</a></h4>

              
                In the dentate gyrus (DG) of the adult mouse hippocampus, neural stem cells (NSCs) balance self-renewal and differentiation to produce neurons that support hippocampal function. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a well-known supporting factor for adult neurogenesis, but conflicting studies have left it uncertain how VEGF signals to NSCs. Here, we identified a VEGF-VEGFR2 intracrine signaling mechanism within adult DG NSCs that prevents their exhaustion. We show both in vitro and in vivo that NSC-VEGF loss caused cell-autonomous exhaustion of adult DG NSCs. In contrast, extracellular VEGF was neither necessary nor sufficient to maintain NSC quiescence or to stimulate VEGFR2 signaling, most likely due to sheddase-mediated cleavage of extracellular VEGFR2 ligand binding domains. Our findings support an exclusively intracellular mechanism for VEGF signaling in adult DG NSCs, thereby providing resolution to previously conflicting studies and suggesting cellular source can dictate the functional impact of soluble ligands in DG NSCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Aging-related olfactory loss is associated with olfactory stem cell transcriptional alterations in humans</a></h4>

              
                Presbyosmia, or aging related olfactory loss, occurs in a majority of humans over age 65 years, yet remains poorly understood, with no specific treatment options. The olfactory epithelium (OE) in the nasal fossa is the peripheral organ for olfaction, and is subject to acquired damage, suggesting a likely site of pathology in aging. OE basal stem cells reconstitute the neuroepithelium in response to cell loss under normal conditions. In aged OE, patches of respiratory-like metaplasia have been observed histologically, consistent with a failure in normal neuroepithelial homeostasis or repair. Accordingly, we have focused on identifying cellular and molecular changes in presbyosmic OE. Combining psychophysical testing with olfactory mucosa biopsy analysis, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and human olfactory culture studies, we identified evidence for inflammation-associated changes in the OE stem cells of presbyosmic patients. The presbyosmic basal stem cells exhibited increased expression of genes involved in response to cytokines or stress, or the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. To facilitate further study of human OE stem cells, we developed an adult human basal cell culture model. Characterization of cultures using scRNA-seq confirmed maintenance of a reserve stem cell-like phenotype, and brief cytokine exposure in basal cell cultures resulted in increased expression of TP63, a transcription factor acting to prevent OE stem cell differentiation. Our data are consistent with a process by which aging-related inflammatory changes in OE stem cells may contribute to presbyosmia, via the disruption of normal epithelial homeostasis, suggesting that OE stem cells may represent a rational therapeutic target for restoration of olfaction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel approach to evaluate alpha-synuclein seeding shows a wide heterogeneity in multiple system atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Several in vitro and in vivo findings have consistently shown that alpha-synuclein derived from multiple system atrophy (MSA) subjects has more seeding capacity than Parkinson disease-derived alpha-synuclein. However, reliable detection of alpha-synuclein derived from MSA using seeded amplification assays, such as the Real-Time Quaking-induced Conversion, has remained challenging. Here we demonstrate that the interaction of the Thioflavin T dye with alpha-synuclein from MSA and Parkinson disease patients can be modulated by the type of salt, pH, and ionic strength used to generate strain-specific reaction buffers. Employing this novel approach, we have generated a streamlined Real-Time Quaking-induced Conversion assay capable of categorizing MSA brains according to their alpha-synuclein seeding behavior, and to unravel a previously unrecognized heterogeneity in seeding activity between different brain regions of a given individual that goes beyond immunohistochemical observations and provide a framework for future molecular subtyping of MSA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of motor neurons and motor activity in zebrafish requires F-actin nucleation by Fmn2b</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cytoskeletal remodelling plays a pivotal role in the establishment of neuronal connectivity during development and in plasticity in adults. Mutations in the cytoskeleton regulatory protein Formin-2 (Fmn2) are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like intellectual disability, though its function in neuronal morphogenesis has not been characterised in vivo. Results: Here we develop a loss-of-function model for fmn2b, the zebrafish orthologue of Fmn2, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. fmn2b mutants display motor deficits starting from the earliest motor responses in the embryo. We find that fmn2b is expressed in motor neurons and its loss reduces motor neuron innervation of the axial muscles without affecting myotome integrity. The translocation of caudal primary (CaP) motor neuron outgrowth is compromised in fmn2b mutants, while rostral primary (RoP) motor neurons have missing soma or stall at the horizontal myoseptum. Strikingly, axon collateral branching of the motor neurons is severely compromised and results in reduced synaptic coverage of the myotome. Rescue experiments identify the requirement for Fmn2-mediated actin nucleation for motor neuron outgrowth and arborisation. Conclusions: The zebrafish loss-of-function model of Fmn2 reveals the specific requirement of F-actin polymerisation by Fmn2 in neuromuscular development. It also underscores the role of Fmn2 in motor neuropathies, especially as a proportion of individuals harbouring mutations in Fmn2 present with hypotonia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age and sex dependent variability of type 2 dopamine receptors in the human brain: A large-scale PET cohort</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: The dopamine system contributes to a multitude of functions ranging from reward and motivation to learning and movement control, making it a key component in goal-directed behavior. Altered dopaminergic function is observed in neurological and psychiatric conditions. Numerous factors have been proposed to influence dopamine function, but due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous data analysis methods in previous studies their specific and joint contributions remain unresolved. METHODS: In this cross-sectional register-based study we investigated how age, sex, body mass index (BMI), as well as cerebral hemisphere and regional volume influence striatal type 2 dopamine receptor (D2R) availability in the human brain. We analyzed a large historical dataset (n=156, 120 males and 36 females) of [11C]raclopride PET scans performed between 2004 and 2018. RESULTS: Striatal D2R availability decreased through age for both sexes and was higher in females versus males throughout age. BMI and striatal D2R availability were weakly associated. There was no consistent lateralization of striatal D2R. The observed effects were independent of regional volumes. These results were validated using two different spatial normalization methods, and the age and sex effects also replicated in an independent sample (n=135). CONCLUSIONS: D2R density is dependent on age and sex, which may contribute to the vulnerability of neurological and psychiatric conditions involving altering D2R expression.

                The role of postnatal experience in mammalian cortical development, while long appreciated, is poorly understood at the resolution of cell types. To explore this issue, we used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to profile the mouse visual cortex at different times in postnatal life with and without visual experience. The identities of glutamatergic cell types in upper layers (L) (L2/3/4) were established following eye opening. L2/3 cell types formed a spatial continuum, defined by the graded expression of ~200 genes that included candidates associated with synapse formation and axon projection specificity. These patterns required visual input for both their establishment and maintenance. By contrast to upper-layer glutamatergic neurons, the remaining neuronal and non-neuronal types were established in a vision-independent fashion. Our results demonstrate that vision acts preferentially in the specification of cortical cell types and provide a framework for exploring experience-dependent cortical development at the cellular and molecular level.

                There is a limited understanding of age differences in functional connectivity during memory encoding. In the present study, a sample of cognitively healthy adult participants (n=488), a subsample of whom had longitudinal cognitive and brain structural data spanning 8 years back, underwent fMRI while performing an associative memory encoding task. We investigated 1) age changes in whole-brain connectivity during memory encoding; whether 2) encoding connectivity patterns overlap with the activity signatures of specific cognitive processes and whether 3) connectivity changes associated with memory encoding related to longitudinal brain structural and cognitive changes. Age was associated with decreased intranetwork connectivity and increased connectivity during encoding. Task-connectivity between mediotemporal and posterior parietal regions -- which overlapped with areas involved in mental imagery -- was related to better memory performance only in older age. The connectivity patterns supporting memory performance in older age reflected preservation of thickness of the medial temporal cortex. These investigations collectively indicate that functional patterns of connectivity should be interpreted in accordance with a maintenance rather than a compensation account.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spectral inference reveals principal cone-integration rules of the zebrafish inner retina</a></h4>

              
                In the vertebrate retina, bipolar cells integrate the signals from different cone types at two main sites: directly, via dendritic inputs in the outer retina, and indirectly, via axonal inputs in the inner retina. Of these, the functional wiring of the indirect route, involving diverse amacrine cell circuits, remains largely uncharted. However, because cone-photoreceptor types differ in their spectral sensitivities, insights into the total functional cone-integration logic of bipolar cell might be gained by linking spectral responses across these two populations of neurons. To explore the feasibility of such a "spectral-circuit-mapping" approach, we here recorded in vivo responses of bipolar cell presynaptic terminals in larval zebrafish to widefield but spectrally resolved flashes of light. We then mapped the results onto the previously established spectral sensitivity functions of the four cones. We find that this approach could explain ~95% of the spectral and temporal variance of bipolar cell responses by way of a simple linear model that combined weighted inputs from the cones with four stereotyped temporal components. This in turn revealed several notable integration rules of the inner retina. Overall, bipolar cells were dominated by red-cone inputs, often alongside equal sign inputs from blue- and green-cones. In contrast, UV-cone inputs were uncorrelated with those of the remaining cones. This led to a new axis of spectral opponency which was mainly set-up by red-/green-/blue-cone "Off" circuits connecting to "natively-On" UV-cone circuits in the outermost fraction of the inner plexiform layer - much as how key colour opponent circuits are established in mammals. Beyond this, and despite substantial temporal diversity that was not present in the cones, bipolar cell spectral tunings were surprisingly simple. They either approximately resembled both opponent and non-opponent spectral motifs already present in the cones or exhibited a stereotyped non-opponent broadband response. In this way, bipolar cells not only preserved the efficient spectral representations in the cones, but also diversified them to set up a total of six dominant spectral motifs which included three axes of spectral opponency. More generally, our results contribute to an emerging understanding of how retinal circuits for colour vision in ancestral cone-tetrachromats such as zebrafish may be linked to those found in mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Information theory-based approach towards studying anti-coincidence detection via graded amplitude dendritic action potentials.</a></h4>

              
                In contrast to typical all or none action potential, recent discovery of graded amplitude action potentials in cortical neurons enabled the dendrites to perform XOR computation, previously thought to be performed only at network level. Thus, these special neurons can perform anti-coincidence detection at the dendritic level, but a lot is unanswered about this phenomenon. Can such experimentally observed dendritic action potential generating system transmit information about stimuli having varying degrees of temporal overlap? Can the system add to the repertoire of computations performed at dendritic level by enhancing the information transmission about varying amplitude stimuli? In this information theory-based study done in single compartment and two-compartment dendritic models, it is shown that such a system can indeed transmit information about the temporal overlap of stimuli as well as amplitudes of stimuli even at high input noise levels. First, the calculation of mutual information between single stimulus and response i.e. I(S;R) with varying noise showed that the information about temporally overlapping nature of stimuli is precisely transmitted by such a system. Secondly, the time evolution of mutual information was simulated through data from the system and it positively reinforced the above-mentioned result. Next, varying amplitude input stimuli was provided to the system and calculation of mutual information between two stimuli and one response i.e. I(S1,S2;R) with varying noise levels revealed that such a system optimally transmits the information about stimuli even at high noise levels. Finally, calculation of this information measurement with respect to time in an experiment with constant overlap but varying input amplitude again positively reinforced the result.

Such stimuli selectively activate nociceptors and produce EEG features which correlate with pain intensity. The rodent LEP has been proposed to be a translational biomarker of nociception and pain, however its validity has been questioned because of reported differences in the classes of nociceptive fibres mediating the response. Here we use a machine learning, trial by trial analysis approach on wavelet-denoised LEPs generated by stimulation of the plantar hindpaw of rats. The LEP amplitude was more strongly related to behavioural response than to laser stimulus energy. A simple decision tree classifier using LEP features was able to predict behavioural responses with 73% accuracy. An examination of the features used by the classifier showed that mutually exclusive short and long latency LEP peaks were clearly seen in single-trial data, yet were not evident in grand average data pooled from multiple trials. This bimodal distribution of LEP latencies was mirrored in the paw withdrawal latencies which were preceded and predicted by the LEP responses. The proportion of short latency events was increased after intradermal application of high dose capsaicin (to defunctionalise TRPV1 expressing nociceptors), suggesting they were mediated by A{delta}-fibres (specifically AMH-I). These findings demonstrate that both C- and A{delta}-fibres contribute to rodent LEPs and concomitant behavioural responses, providing a real-time assay of specific fibre function in conscious animals. Single-trial analysis approaches can improve the utility of LEPs as a translatable biomarker of pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual evoked feedforward-feedback travelling waves organize neural activity across the cortical hierarchy in mice</a></h4>

              
                Sensory processing is distributed among many brain regions that interact via feedforward and feedback signaling. It has been hypothesized that neuronal oscillations mediating feedforward and feedback interactions organize into travelling waves. However, stimulus evoked travelling waves of sufficient spatial scale have never been demonstrated directly. Here, we show that simple visual stimuli reliably evoke two traveling waves with spatial wavelengths that cover much of the cerebral hemisphere in awake mice. 30-50Hz feedforward waves arise in primary visual cortex (V1) and propagate rostrally, while 3-6Hz feedback waves originate in the association cortex and flow caudally. The phase of the feedback wave modulates the amplitude of the feedforward wave and synchronizes firing between V1 and parietal cortex. Altogether, these results provide direct experimental evidence that visual evoked travelling waves percolate through the cerebral cortex and coordinate neuronal activity across broadly distributed networks mediating visual processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diffusely abnormal white matter converts to T2 lesion volume in the absence of acute inflammation</a></h4>

              
                Diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM), characterised by biochemical changes of myelin in the absence of frank demyelination, has been associated with clinical progression in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). However, little is known about changes of DAWM over time and their relation to focal white matter lesions (FWML). The objectives of this work were: 1) To characterize the longitudinal evolution of FWML, DAWM, and DAWM that transforms into FWML, and 2) To determine whether gadolinium enhancement, known to be associated with the development of new FWML, is also related to DAWM voxels that transform into FWML. Our data included 4220 MRI scans of 689 SPMS participants, followed for 156 weeks and 2677 scans of 686 RRMS participants, followed for 96 weeks. FWML and DAWM were segmented using a previously validated, automatic thresholding technique based on normalized T2 intensity values. Using longitudinally registered images, DAWM voxels at each visit that transformed into FWML on the last MRI scan as well as their overlap with gadolinium enhancing lesion masks were identified. Our results showed that the average yearly rate of conversion of DAWM-to-FWML was 1.27cc for SPMS and 0.80cc for RRMS. FWML in SPMS participants significantly increased (t=3.9; p=0.0001) while DAWM significantly decreased (t=-4.3 p<0.0001) and the ratio FWML:DAWM increased (t=12.7; p<0.00001). RRMS participants also showed an increase in the FWML:DAWM Ratio (t=6.9; p<0.00001) but without a significant change of the individual volumes. Gadolinium enhancement was associated with 7.3% and 18.7% of focal New T2 lesion formation in the infrequent scans of the RRMS and SPMS cohorts, respectively. In comparison, only 0.1% and 0.0% of DAWM-to-FWML voxels overlapped with gadolinium enhancement. We conclude that DAWM transforms into FWML over time, in both RRMS and SPMS. DAWM appears to represent a form of pre-lesional pathology that contributes to T2 lesion volume increase over time, independent of new focal inflammation and gadolinium enhancement.

	<p>Astrocytes support and modulate neuronal activity through the release of L-lactate. The suggested roles of astrocytic lactate in the brain encompass an expanding range of vital functions, including central control of respiration and cardiovascular performance, learning, memory, executive behaviour and regulation of mood. Studying the effects of astrocytic lactate requires tools that limit the release of lactate selectively from astrocytes. Here, we report the validation in vitro of novel molecular constructs derived from enzymes originally found in bacteria, that when expressed in astrocytes, interfere with lactate handling. When lactate 2-monooxygenase derived from M. smegmatis was specifically expressed in astrocytes, it reduced intracellular lactate pools as well as lactate release upon stimulation. D-lactate dehydrogenase derived from L. bulgaricus diverts pyruvate towards D-lactate production and release by astrocytes, which may affect signalling properties of lactate in the brain. Together with lactate oxidase, which we have previously described, this set of transgenic tools can be employed to better understand astrocytic lactate release and its role in the regulation of neuronal activity in different behavioural contexts.</p>

	<p>Brain image segmentation is one of the most time-consuming and challenging procedures in a clinical environment. Recently, a drastic increase in the number of brain disorders has been noted. This has indirectly led to an increased demand for automated brain segmentation solutions to assist medical experts in early diagnosis and treatment interventions. This paper aims to present a critical review of the recent trend in segmentation and classification methods for brain magnetic resonance images. Various segmentation methods ranging from simple intensity-based to high-level segmentation approaches such as machine learning, metaheuristic, deep learning, and hybridization are included in the present review. Common issues, advantages, and disadvantages of brain image segmentation methods are also discussed to provide a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of existing methods. From this review, it is found that deep learning-based and hybrid-based metaheuristic approaches are more efficient for the reliable segmentation of brain tumors. However, these methods fall behind in terms of computation and memory complexity.</p>

                <p>Astrocytes provide neurons with diffusible factors that promote synapse formation and maturation. In particular, glypican-4/GPC4 released from astrocytes promotes the maturation of excitatory synapses. Unlike other secreted factors, GPC4 contains the C-terminal GPI-anchorage signal. However, the mechanism by which membrane-tethered GPC4 is released from astrocytes is unknown. Using mouse primary astrocyte cultures and a quantitative luciferase-based release assay, we show that GPC4 is expressed on the astrocyte surface via a GPI-anchorage. Soluble GPC4 is robustly released from the astrocytes largely by proteolytic shedding and, to a lesser extent, by GPI-anchor cleavage, but not by vesicular release. Pharmacological, overexpression, and loss of function screens showed that ADAM9 in part mediates the release of GPC4 from astrocytes. The released GPC4 contains the heparan sulfate side chain, suggesting that these release mechanisms provide the active form that promotes synapse maturation and function. Overall, our studies identified the release mechanisms and the major releasing enzyme of GPC4 in astrocytes and will provide insights into understanding how astrocytes regulate synapse formation and maturation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Here, we report the independent discovery and validation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) as a modulator of &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;Syn)-induced pathology and toxicity in cell-based Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) models. We identified SCD as top altered gene from transcriptional profiling in primary neurons exogenously expressing &alpha;Syn with the amplified familial PD mutation 3K. Thus, we sought to further explore SCD as a therapeutic target in neurodegeneration. We report that SCD inhibitors are toxic to early human and rat neuron cultures while displaying minimal toxicity to late cultures. The fatty acid product of SCD, oleic acid (OLA), fully rescues this toxicity in early cultures, suggesting on-target toxicity. Furthermore, SCD inhibition rescues &alpha;Syn 3K-induced toxicity in late primary neurons. We also confirm that SCD inhibitors reduce formation of &alpha;Syn accumulations, while OLA increases these accumulations in an &alpha;Syn 3K neuroblastoma model. However, we identify a caveat with this model where &alpha;Syn 3K levels can be suppressed by high SCD inhibitor concentrations, obscuring true effect size. Further, we show that both SCD1 or SCD5 knock-down reduce &alpha;Syn 3K accumulations and toxicity, making both a putative drug target. Overall, we confirm key findings of published data on SCD inhibition and its benefits in &alpha;Syn accumulation and stress models. The differential neurotoxicity induced by SCD inhibition based on neuron culture age must be accounted for when researching SCD in neuron models and has potential clinical implications. Lastly, our gene profiling studies also revealed novel putative genes connected to &alpha;Syn neurotoxicity that are worth further study.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The term "memory strength" generally refers to how well one remembers something. But more precisely it contains multiple modalities, such as how easily, how accurately, how confidently and how vividly we remember it. In human, these modalities of memory strength are dissociable. In this study, we asked whether we can isolate a behavioral component that is dissociable from others in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks in mice, which potentially reflect a modality of memory strength. Using a virus-mediated inducible method, we ablated immature neurons in the dentate gyrus in mice after we trained the mice with hippocampus-dependent memory tasks normally. In memory retrieval tests, these ablated mice initially showed intact performance. However, the ablated mice ceased learned behavior prematurely within a trial compared with control mice. In addition, the ablated mice showed shorter duration of individual episodes of learned behavior. Both affected behavioral measurements point to persistence of learned behavior. Thus, the effect of the postlearning manipulation showed dissociation between initial performance and persistence of learned behavior. These two behavioral components are likely to reflect different brain functions and be mediated by separate mechanisms, which might represent different modalities of memory strength. These simple dissociable measurements in widely used behavioral paradigms would be useful to understand detailed mechanisms underlying the expression of learned behavior and potentially different modalities of memory strength in mice. We also discuss a potential role that immature neurons in the dentate gyrus may play in persistence of learned behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Heterogeneous Expression of Nuclear Encoded Mitochondrial Genes Distinguishes Inhibitory and Excitatory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mitochondrial composition varies by organ and their constituent cell types. This mitochondrial diversity likely determines variations in mitochondrial function. However, the heterogeneity of mitochondria in the brain remains underexplored despite the large diversity of cell types in neuronal tissue. Here, we used molecular systems biology tools to address whether mitochondrial composition varies by brain region and neuronal cell type in mice. We reasoned that proteomics and transcriptomics of microdissected brain regions combined with analysis of single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNAseq) could reveal the extent of mitochondrial compositional diversity. We selected nuclear encoded gene products forming complexes of fixed stoichiometry, such as the respiratory chain complexes and the mitochondrial ribosome, as well as molecules likely to perform their function as monomers, such as the family of SLC25 transporters. We found that the proteome encompassing these nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and obtained from microdissected brain tissue segregated the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex from each other. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts could only segregate cell types and brain regions when the analysis was performed at the single-cell level. In fact, single-cell mitochondrial transcriptomes were able to distinguish glutamatergic and distinct types of GABAergic neurons from one another. Within these cell categories, unique SLC25A transporters were able to identify distinct cell subpopulations. Our results demonstrate heterogeneous mitochondrial composition across brain regions and cell types. We postulate that mitochondrial heterogeneity influences regional and cell type-specific mechanisms in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Temporal Correlates to Monaural Edge Pitch in the Distribution of Interspike Interval Statistics in the Auditory Nerve</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Pitch is a perceptual attribute enabling perception of melody. There is no consensus regarding the fundamental nature of pitch and its underlying neural code. A stimulus which has received much interest in psychophysical and computational studies is noise with a sharp spectral edge. High-pass (HP) or low-pass (LP) noise gives rise to a pitch near the edge frequency (monaural edge pitch; MEP). The simplicity of this stimulus, combined with its spectral and autocorrelation properties, make it an interesting stimulus to examine spectral versus temporal cues that could underly its pitch. We recorded responses of single auditory nerve (AN) fibers in chinchilla to MEP-stimuli varying in edge frequency. Temporal cues were examined with shuffled autocorrelogram (SAC) analysis. Correspondence between the population&rsquo;s dominant interspike interval and reported pitch estimates was poor. A fuller analysis of the population interspike interval distribution, which incorporates not only the dominant but all intervals, results in good matches with behavioral results, but not for the entire range of edge frequencies that generates pitch. Finally, we also examined temporal structure over a slower time scale, intermediate between average firing rate and interspike intervals, by studying the SAC envelope. We found that, in response to a given MEP stimulus, this feature also systematically varies with edge frequency, across fibers with different characteristic frequency (CF). Because neural mechanisms to extract envelope cues are well established, and because this cue is not limited by coding of stimulus fine-structure, this newly identified slower temporal cue is a more plausible basis for pitch than cues based on fine-structure.</p>

                Oligodendrocytes wrap multiple lamellae of their membrane, myelin, around axons of the central nervous system (CNS), to improve impulse conduction. Myelin synthesis is specialised and dynamic, responsive to local neuronal excitation. Subtle pathological insults are sufficient to cause significant neuronal metabolic impairment, so myelin preservation is necessary to safeguard neural networks. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent demyelinating disease of the CNS. In MS, inflammatory attacks against myelin, proposed to be autoimmune, cause myelin decay and oligodendrocyte loss, leaving neurons vulnerable. Current therapies target the prominent neuroinflammation but are mostly ineffective in protecting from neurodegeneration and the progressive neurological disability. People with MS have substantially higher levels of extracellular glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter. This impairs cellular homeostasis to cause excitotoxic stress. Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK channels) could preserve myelin or allow its recovery by protecting cells from the resulting excessive excitability. This review evaluates the role of excitotoxic stress, myelination and BK channels in MS pathology, and explores the hypothesis that BK channel activation could be a therapeutic strategy to protect oligodendrocytes from excitotoxic stress in MS. This could reduce progression of neurological disability if used in parallel to immunomodulatory therapies.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> is a relatively large-headed and stocky iguanodontian dinosaur from the latest Early Cretaceous of Spain. Its braincase is known from three specimens. Similar to that of other dinosaurs, it shows a mosaic ossification pattern in which most of the bones seem to have fused together indistinguishably while a few (frontoparietal, basioccipital) might have remained loosely attached. The endocasts of the three specimens are described based on CT data and digital reconstructions. They show unmistakable morphological similarities with the endocast of closely related taxa, such as <i>Sirindhorna khoratensis</i> (which is close in age but from Thailand). This supports a high conservatism of the endocranial cavity. The issue of volumetric correspondence between endocranial cavity and brain in dinosaurs is analyzed. Although a brain-to-endocranial cavity (BEC) index of 0.50 has been traditionally used, we employ instead 0.73. This is indeed the mid-value between the situation in adults of <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i> and <i>Gallus gallus</i>, which are members of the extant bracketing taxa of dinosaurs (Crocodilia and Aves). We thence gauge the level of encephalization of <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> through the calculation of the encephalization quotient (EQ), which remains valuable as a metric for assessing the degree of cognitive function in extinct taxa, especially those with fully ossified braincases like dinosaurs and other archosaurs. The EQ obtained for <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> (3.611) suggests that this species was significantly more encephalized than most if not all extant nonavian, nonmammalian amniotes. Our work adds to the growing body of data concerning theoretical cognitive capabilities in dinosaurs and supports the idea that an increasing encephalization was fostered not only in theropods but also in parallel in the shorter-lived lineage of ornithopods. <i>P. valdearinnoensis</i> was ill-equipped to respond to theropod dinosaurs and possibly lived in groups as a strategy to mitigate the risk of being predated upon. We hypothesize that group-living and protracted caring of juveniles in this and possibly many other iguanodontian ornithopods favored a degree of encephalization that was outstanding by reptile standards.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Contraceptive Use Dropout-adjusted Unmet Need for Family Planning [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the last two decades, unmet need for family planning in Indonesia remains stagnant, and contraceptive discontinuation has increased. These two indicators describe the risk of unwanted pregnancy in a population. Therefore, this study aims to develop an accurate calculation of the unmet need for family planning in Indonesia.  Method: The study uses 2017 IDHS data to compare unmet need at survey-time and five years preceding the survey, measured by contraceptive calendar data that measured history of contraceptive use within five years preceding the survey. Unmet need at five years preceding the survey is measured by calculating the proportion of months not using contraceptive to the duration of months exposed to pregnancy in a period of 69 months. The study population is married women in Indonesia, with a sample size of 35,681.   Results: Unmet need with contraceptive calendar calculation is higher than unmet need at survey-time. A difference of 3% concerns an additional of nearly 1.6 million unwanted pregnancies. This study proves that the high number of contraceptive discontinuations is directly proportional to higher unmet need with contraceptive calendar calculation.  Conclusion: In Indonesia, with a relatively high contraceptive discontinuation rate, the calculation of unmet need using the calendar method is more precise than at survey-time method. The study results suggest the use of unmet need calendar for countries with high contraceptive discontinuation rate and provision of primary health care that is responsive to a potential unwanted pregnancy.

                Mixed infections with two or more species of Plasmodium are frequently reported due to vector factors, parasite factors (formation of hypnozoites) and host factors (residing in endemic areas, travel to endemic areas, inadequately treated previous infection, lack of compliance to therapy). Here we report a case of a 33-year-old Saudi female who had a significant travel history, and a peripheral blood smear (PBS) revealed mixed infection with P. falciparum and P. vivax. The case was successfully treated with a combination therapy of artemisinin and primaquine with follow up testing at three, seven, 14, and 28 days. Mixed malaria infections are especially reported in travelers to endemic areas. Hence, adequate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the cases contributes majorly to preventing relapse and controlling the disease. Travel consultations should be given to all travelers before their trips to endemic countries.

                Background: Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukins 12 and 23. It is approved for treatment of Crohn’s disease (CD) in adults; however, there is a paucity of data regarding its use in pediatric CD. We describe our experience using ustekinumab in anti-TNF refractory CD pediatric patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review on pediatric patients with CD who were started on ustekinumab from January 2016 to November 2018. We collected patient’s clinical history, previous treatment history, surgeries related to CD, disease severity, as measured by abbrPCDAI, and endoscopic severity as recorded by SES-CD before and after ustekinumab. Results: We identified 10 patients with CD who were started on ustekinumab due to non-response to currently approved agents. Seven patients needed augmented maintenance dosing every 4-6 weeks to achieve clinical response or remission. Six of these seven patients had therapeutic drug monitoring during the course of treatment, with five patients showing subtherapeutic drug levels of <4.5 μg/mL while on standard maintenance dosing every 8 weeks, and four patients showing therapeutic drug levels of >4.5 μg/mL on augmented dosing interval. The remaining three patients were on standard maintenance dosing for the duration of treatment. Conclusion: In this retrospective chart review, 7 out of 10 patients with anti-TNF refractory pediatric-onset CD required augmented maintenance doses of ustekinumab to achieve clinical response or remission. A prospective study is needed to define appropriate ustekinumab dosing and interval in management of pediatric CD.

                <p>Pain is a recognized association with LGI1-/ CASPR2-antibodies. Of 147 patients, pain was experienced by 17/33 (52%) CASPR2- versus 20/108 (19%) LGI1-antibody patients (p=0.0005), and identified as neuropathic in 89% versus 58% of these, respectively. Typically, normal nerve conduction studies and reduced intraepidermal nerve fibre densities were observed in subsets of both cohorts. In LGI1-antibody patients, pain responded to immunotherapy (p=0.008), often rapidly, with greater residual patient-rated impairment observed in CASPR2-antibody patients (p=0.019). Serum CASPR2-antibodies, but not LGI1-antibodies, bound <i>in vitro</i> to unmyelinated human sensory neurons and rodent dorsal root ganglia, suggesting pathophysiological differences which may underlie our clinical observations.</p>

                <p>by Nikolas Dovrolis, Katerina Kassela, Konstantinos Konstantinidis, Adamantia Kouvela, Stavroula Veletza, Ioannis Karakasiliotis</p>

Viral metagenomics, also known as virome studies, have yielded an unprecedented number of novel sequences, essential in recognizing and characterizing the etiological agent and the origin of emerging infectious diseases. Several tools and pipelines have been developed, to date, for the identification and assembly of viral genomes. Assembly pipelines often result in viral genomes contaminated with host genetic material, some of which are currently deposited into public databases. In the current report, we present a group of deposited sequences that encompass ribosomal RNA (rRNA) contamination. We highlight the detrimental role of chimeric next generation sequencing reads, between host rRNA sequences and viral sequences, in virus genome assembly and we present the hindrances these reads may pose to current methodologies. We have further developed a refining pipeline, the Zero Waste Algorithm (ZWA) that assists in the assembly of low abundance viral genomes. ZWA performs context-depended trimming of chimeric reads, precisely removing their rRNA moiety. These, otherwise discarded, reads were fed to the assembly pipeline and assisted in the construction of larger and cleaner contigs making a substantial impact on current assembly methodologies. ZWA pipeline may significantly enhance virus genome assembly from low abundance samples and virus metagenomics approaches in which a small number of reads determine genome quality and integrity.

Discovering sequence features that differentially direct cells to alternate fates is key to understanding both cellular development and the consequences of disease related mutations. We introduce Expected Pattern Effect and Differential Expected Pattern Effect, two black-box methods that can interpret genome regulatory sequences for cell type-specific or condition specific patterns. We show that these methods identify relevant transcription factor motifs and spacings that are predictive of cell state-specific chromatin accessibility. Finally, we integrate these methods into framework that is readily accessible to non-experts and available for download as a binary or installed via PyPI or bioconda at https://cgs.csail.mit.edu/deepaccess-package/.

Recent advancements in <i>in situ</i> methods, such as multiplexed <i>in situ</i> RNA hybridization and <i>in situ</i> RNA sequencing, have deepened our understanding of the way biological processes are spatially organized in tissues. Automated image processing and spot-calling algorithms for analyzing <i>in situ</i> transcriptomics images have many parameters which need to be tuned for optimal detection. Having ground truth datasets (images where there is very high confidence on the accuracy of the detected spots) is essential for evaluating these algorithms and tuning their parameters. We present a first-in-kind open-source toolkit and framework for <i>in situ</i> transcriptomics image analysis that incorporates crowdsourced annotations, alongside expert annotations, as a source of ground truth for the analysis of <i>in situ</i> transcriptomics images. The kit includes tools for preparing images for crowdsourcing annotation to optimize crowdsourced workers’ ability to annotate these images reliably, performing quality control (QC) on worker annotations, extracting candidate parameters for spot-calling algorithms from sample images, tuning parameters for spot-calling algorithms, and evaluating spot-calling algorithms and worker performance. These tools are wrapped in a modular pipeline with a flexible structure that allows users to take advantage of crowdsourced annotations from any source of their choice. We tested the pipeline using real and synthetic <i>in situ</i> transcriptomics images and annotations from the Amazon Mechanical Turk system obtained via Quanti.us. Using real images from <i>in situ</i> experiments and simulated images produced by one of the tools in the kit, we studied worker sensitivity to spot characteristics and established rules for annotation QC. We explored and demonstrated the use of ground truth generated in this way for validating spot-calling algorithms and tuning their parameters, and confirmed that consensus crowdsourced annotations are a viable substitute for expert-generated ground truth for these purposes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Label-free imaging and classification of live P. falciparum enables high performance parasitemia quantification without fixation or staining</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul Lebel, Rebekah Dial, Venkata N. P. Vemuri, Valentina Garcia, Joseph DeRisi, Rafael Gómez-Sjöberg</p>

Manual microscopic inspection of fixed and stained blood smears has remained the gold standard for <i>Plasmodium</i> parasitemia analysis for over a century. Unfortunately, smear preparation consumes time and reagents, while manual microscopy is skill-dependent and labor-intensive. Here, we demonstrate that deep learning enables both life stage classification and accurate parasitemia quantification of ordinary brightfield microscopy images of live, unstained red blood cells. We tested our method using both a standard light microscope equipped with visible and near-ultraviolet (UV) illumination, and a custom-built microscope employing deep-UV illumination. While using deep-UV light achieved an overall four-category classification of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> blood stages of greater than 99% and a recall of 89.8% for ring-stage parasites, imaging with near-UV light on a standard microscope resulted in 96.8% overall accuracy and over 90% recall for ring-stage parasites. Both imaging systems were tested extrinsically by parasitemia titration, revealing superior performance over manually-scored Giemsa-stained smears, and a limit of detection below 0.1%. Our results establish that label-free parasitemia analysis of live cells is possible in a biomedical laboratory setting without the need for complex optical instrumentation. We anticipate future extensions of this work could enable label-free clinical diagnostic measurements, one day eliminating the need for conventional blood smear analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dendritic normalisation improves learning in sparsely connected artificial neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex D. Bird, Peter Jedlicka, Hermann Cuntz</p>

Artificial neural networks, taking inspiration from biological neurons, have become an invaluable tool for machine learning applications. Recent studies have developed techniques to effectively tune the connectivity of sparsely-connected artificial neural networks, which have the potential to be more computationally efficient than their fully-connected counterparts and more closely resemble the architectures of biological systems. We here present a normalisation, based on the biophysical behaviour of neuronal dendrites receiving distributed synaptic inputs, that divides the weight of an artificial neuron’s afferent contacts by their number. We apply this dendritic normalisation to various sparsely-connected feedforward network architectures, as well as simple recurrent and self-organised networks with spatially extended units. The learning performance is significantly increased, providing an improvement over other widely-used normalisations in sparse networks. The results are two-fold, being both a practical advance in machine learning and an insight into how the structure of neuronal dendritic arbours may contribute to computation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">PPIDomainMiner: Inferring domain-domain interactions from multiple sources of protein-protein interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Seyed Ziaeddin Alborzi, Amina Ahmed Nacer, Hiba Najjar, David W. Ritchie, Marie-Dominique Devignes</p>

Many biological processes are mediated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Because protein domains are the building blocks of proteins, PPIs likely rely on domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Several attempts exist to infer DDIs from PPI networks but the produced datasets are heterogeneous and sometimes not accessible, while the PPI interactome data keeps growing.
We describe a new computational approach called “PPIDM” (Protein-Protein Interactions Domain Miner) for inferring DDIs using multiple sources of PPIs. The approach is an extension of our previously described “CODAC” (Computational Discovery of Direct Associations using Common neighbors) method for inferring new edges in a tripartite graph. The PPIDM method has been applied to seven widely used PPI resources, using as “Gold-Standard” a set of DDIs extracted from 3D structural databases. Overall, PPIDM has produced a dataset of 84, 552 non-redundant DDIs. Statistical significance (p-value) is calculated for each source of PPI and used to classify the PPIDM DDIs in Gold (9, 175 DDIs), Silver (24, 934 DDIs) and Bronze (50, 443 DDIs) categories. Dataset comparison reveals that PPIDM has inferred from the 2017 releases of PPI sources about 46% of the DDIs present in the 2020 release of the 3did database, not counting the DDIs present in the Gold-Standard. The PPIDM dataset contains 10, 229 DDIs that are consistent with more than 13, 300 PPIs extracted from the IMEx database, and nearly 23, 300 DDIs (27.5%) that are consistent with more than 214, 000 human PPIs extracted from the STRING database. Examples of newly inferred DDIs covering more than 10 PPIs in the IMEx database are provided.
Further exploitation of the PPIDM DDI reservoir includes the inventory of possible partners of a protein of interest and characterization of protein interactions at the domain level in combination with other methods. The result is publicly available at http://ppidm.loria.fr/.

                Background: Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a malignant disease of the urothelial cell lining the upper urinary tract from renal calyces, pelvises, and ureter down to the ureteral orifice. Urothelial carcinoma is a multifocal malignant tumor which tends to reoccur after treatment. Radical cystectomy shows that upper tract recurrence occurs in 0.75% to 6.4% of patients. The occurrence of contralateral UTUC after nephroureterectomy is rarer with a prevalence of 0.5%. Case presentation: The case of a 43-year-old male with metachronous bilateral UTUC was reported. The patient had undergone gemcitabine-cysplatine neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder cT2N0M0. Left hydronephrosis was discovered three months after the procedure. The patient was diagnosed with left UTUC cT4N0M0 of renal pyelum after a series of examinations. A left open radical nephroureterectomy was conducted to remove the mass followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. This was followed up with routine ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every three months with a “tumor-free” period of 26 months. Meanwhile, the patient was re-admitted with fever and an increase in creatinine value of 4.3. After further workups, the patient was diagnosed with UTUC cT2N0M0 of the right renal pyelum. A kidney sparring approach with laser evaporation of the tumor was conducted followed by eight cycles of Gemcitabine intracavity antegrade per nephrostomy. After the regimen was finished, an MRI evaluation was conducted to assess treatment results, and the mass had decreased. Conclusions: This report showed a rare case of urothelial cell carcinoma recurrences. From bladder urothelial carcinoma to left UTUC and then to contralateral UTUC. It is important to evaluate the upper tract to reduce the risk of recurrence.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A comparative study of red brick powder and lime as soft soil stabilizer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Soil has an important role to play in planning buildings because it supports the loads above it. Different types of soil with poor mechanical properties require more attention. Therefore, it is necessary to put in more effort to stabilize soil in order to improve its properties. This study aimed to compare the potential of lime and brick powder as stabilizers based on the values of California bearing ratio (CBR). Soil stabilization can be defined as the process of stabilizing soil properties by chemical or physical means to improve its engineering efficiency. The main objectives of stabilizing soil are to increase the bearing capacity of soil, to increase its resistance to weathering processes, and its permeability. Methods: In this work laboratory tests were done with disturbed and undisturbed soil samples. The proportions of lime or red brick powder additives mixed together are 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% of the original soil sample. From the results of the laboratory tests, the soil type obtained is MH soil based on the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The MH soil type is a low plasticity silt soil. Results: The study’s results showed that with the addition of lime and brick powder, the soil could be stabilized. In both soaked and unsoaked CBR tests, there was an increase in the CBR value for each proportion of the mixed additives. However, red brick powder had a significant increase of 15%. Conclusions: This study found a very large range of variations because of the many material requirements for each test. We suggest other researchers perform the CBR test by reducing the range of variations in the additives to get firm data and using our experimental procedure in this study for further research.

                Background: Hikikomori is a Japanese social withdrawal phenomenon which, in recent years, is spreading in western developed countries as well. Spending a lot of time secluded indoors, watching and playing with fictional narratives may be relatively common for Hikikomori people and may represent a protective factor for their psychological well-being.   Method: We evaluated the role of enjoying fictional narratives on empathy, relaxation, depression, and anxiety in people with Hikikomori experience, in relation to their daily consumption of fictional narratives and their emotional transportation toward fictional narratives. Hikikomori from one psychiatric clinic and three different support facilities were enrolled in this study. Multidimensional empathy scale, CES-D, STAI questionnaire, and relaxation inventory self-report scale were used as outcome measures.        Results: We found a significant correlation between empathy and emotional transportation toward fictional narratives and between relaxation during watching and reading fictional narratives and consumption frequency of fictional narratives.  We failed, however, to find any significant correlation with depression and anxiety.   Conclusions: These findings suggest a possible correlation between fiction and empathy/relaxation response; however, any causal relationship is not proven, consequently we deem that further investigations with a larger sample size are required for a better understanding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between socioeconomic factors and soft drink consumption among adults in Cambodia: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Soft drinks are an attractive and popular drink, consumed by many people to fulfill their energy. However, soft drink consumption is an important risk factor for non-communicable diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association between socioeconomic factors and soft drink consumption among adults in Cambodia.  Methods: A cross-sectional analytical study with multi-stage random sampling was used to select 749 respondents from 12 communes across 5 districts in Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia. A structured questionnaire was used to assess socioeconomic factors and soft drink consumption. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression. Crude odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confident intervals (CI) were calculated to show the strength of associations. Results: The overall prevalence of soft drink consumption was 44.73% (95%CI: 41.16-48.30%) across the sample population. The final model of multiple logistic regression showed only four factors to be significantly associated with soft drink consumption: gender, age, family size and income. Respondents most likely to consume soft drinks were men (AOR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.10-2.00; p=0.009), those aged 31-59 years (AOR: 1.93, 95%CI: 1.98-4.62; p<0.001), those in a household of less than 5 individuals (AOR: 1.38, 95%CI: 1.44-3.19; p=0.036), and those earning <300$/month (AOR: 1.59, 95%CI: 1.10-2.31; p=0.003). Conclusion: The prevalence of soft drink consumption in Cambodia is a major concern for public health. The predictive factors significantly associated with soft drink consumption identified by this study were gender, age, household size and income. Therefore, all stakeholders should contribute to social marketing and intervention focusing on reducing the consumption of soft drinks through advertising on social media, television and other popular media platforms. Furthermore, additional taxation of soft drinks should be considered.

                The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic forced athletes to learn to navigate a world void of athletic competition and contend with the intricacies that life during a pandemic brings. Similarly, those that dedicate their lives to these athletes such as sport psychology practitioners, sport medicine personnel, athletic trainers, or academic advisors (i.e., sport support professionals) also experienced an abrupt ending to their routines, and in some cases their livelihoods. These professionals have been pushed to modify their art and find ways to engage their community from a distance (e.g., virtually, or physically from a social distance). Sport support professionals are experiencing a collective loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper addresses the impact of a global pandemic and the subsequent issues faced by sport support professionals across diverse disciplines, emphasizing the significance of these relationships and the necessary adjustments to manage the cessation of these relationships.

                Background: Voluntary therapeutic interventions to reduce unwanted same-sex sexuality are collectively known as sexual orientation change efforts (SOCE).  Currently almost all evidence addressing the contested question whether SOCE is effective or safe consists of anecdotes or very small sample qualitative studies of persons who currently identify as sexual minority and thus by definition failed to change.  We conducted this study to examine the efficacy and risk outcomes for a group of SOCE participants unbiased by current sexual orientation.       Methods: We examined a convenience sample of 125 men who had undergone SOCE for homosexual-to-heterosexual change in sexual attraction, identity and behavior, and for positive and negative changes in psychosocial problem domains (depression, suicidality, self-harm, self-esteem, social function, and alcohol or substance abuse).  Mean change was assessed by parametric (t-test) and nonparametric (Wilcoxon sign rank test) significance tests.   Results: Exposure to SOCE was associated with significant declines in same-sex attraction (from 5.7 to 4.1 on the Kinsey scale, p <.000), identification (4.8 to 3.6, p < .000), and sexual activity (2.4 to 1.5 on a 4-point scale of frequency, p < .000). From 45% to 69% of SOCE participants achieved at least partial remission of unwanted same-sex sexuality; full remission was achieved by 14% for sexual attraction and identification, and 26% for sexual behavior.  Rates were higher among married men, but 4-10% of participants experienced increased same-sex orientation after SOCE.  From 0.8% to 4.8% of participants reported marked or severe negative psychosocial change following SOCE, but 12.1% to 61.3% reported marked or severe positive psychosocial change.  Net change was significantly positive for all problem domains.   Conclusion: SOCE was perceived as an effective and safe therapeutic practice by this sample of participants.  We close by offering a unifying understanding of discrepant findings within this literature and caution against broad generalizations of our results.

<p><i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants show impressive navigation capabilities during foraging. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges. Here, we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of <i>Cataglyphis nodus</i> males (♂), gynes (♀), and foragers (☿) by quantifying relative neuropil volumes, synaptic architecture, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe olfactory glomeruli. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex-specific and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Cataglyphis</i> desert ants are charismatic central place foragers. After long-ranging foraging trips, individual workers navigate back to their nest relying mostly on visual cues. The reproductive caste faces other orientation challenges, i.e. mate finding and colony foundation. Here we compare brain structures involved in spatial orientation of <i>Cataglyphis nodus</i> males, gynes, and foragers by quantifying relative neuropil volumes associated with two visual pathways, and numbers and volumes of antennal lobe (AL) olfactory glomeruli. Furthermore, we determined absolute numbers of synaptic complexes in visual and olfactory regions of the mushroom bodies (MB) and a major relay station of the sky-compass pathway to the central complex (CX). Both female castes possess enlarged brain centers for sensory integration, learning, and memory, reflected in voluminous MBs containing about twice the numbers of synaptic complexes compared with males. Overall, male brains are smaller compared with both female castes, but the relative volumes of the optic lobes and CX are enlarged indicating the importance of visual guidance during innate behaviors. Male ALs contain greatly enlarged glomeruli, presumably involved in sex-pheromone detection. Adaptations at both the neuropil and synaptic levels clearly reflect differences in sex-specific and caste-specific demands for sensory processing and behavioral plasticity underlying spatial orientation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cis-regulatory variants affect gene expression dynamics in yeast</a></h4>

              
                Evolution of <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences depends on how they affect gene expression and motivates both the identification and prediction of <i>cis</i>-regulatory variants responsible for expression differences within and between species. While much progress has been made in relating <i>cis</i>-regulatory variants to expression levels, the timing of gene activation and repression may also be important to the evolution of <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences. We investigated allele-specific expression (ASE) dynamics within and between <i>Saccharomyces</i> species during the diauxic shift and found appreciable <i>cis</i>-acting variation in gene expression dynamics. Within species ASE is associated with intergenic variants, and ASE dynamics are more strongly associated with insertions and deletions than ASE levels. To refine these associations we used a high-throughput reporter assay to test promoter regions and individual variants. Within the subset of regions that recapitulated endogenous expression we identified and characterized <i>cis</i>-regulatory variants that affect expression dynamics. Between species, chimeric promoter regions generate novel patterns and indicate constraints on the evolution of gene expression dynamics. We conclude that changes in <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences can tune gene expression dynamics and that the interplay between expression dynamics and other aspects expression are relevant to the evolution of <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural mechanisms of modulations of empathy and altruism by beliefs of others' pain</a></h4>

              
                Perceived cues signaling others' pain induce empathy which in turn motivates altruistic behavior toward those who appear suffering. This perception-emotion-behavior reactivity is the core of human altruism but does not always occur in real life situations. Here, by integrating behavioral and multimodal neuroimaging measures, we investigate neural mechanisms underlying modulations of empathy and altruistic behavior by beliefs of others' pain. We show evidence that lack of beliefs of others' pain reduces subjective estimation of others' painful feelings and decreases monetary donations to those who show pain expressions. Moreover, lack of beliefs of others' pain attenuates neural responses to their pain expressions within 200 ms after face onset and modulates neural responses to others' pain in the insular, post-central, and frontal cortices. Our findings suggest that beliefs of others’ pain provide a cognitive basis of human empathy and altruism and unravel the intermediate neural mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hsp40s play complementary roles in the prevention of tau amyloid formation</a></h4>

              
                The microtubule-associated protein, tau, is the major subunit of neurofibrillary tangles associated with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. In the cell, however, tau aggregation can be prevented by a class of proteins known as molecular chaperones. While numerous chaperones are known to interact with tau, though, little is known regarding the mechanisms by which these prevent tau aggregation. Here, we describe the effects of ATP-independent Hsp40 chaperones, DNAJA2 and DNAJB1, on tau amyloid-fiber formation, and compare these to the small heat-shock protein HSPB1. We find that the chaperones play complementary roles, with each preventing tau aggregation differently and interacting with distinct sets of tau species. Whereas HSPB1 only binds tau monomers, DNAJB1 and DNAJA2 recognize aggregation-prone conformers and even mature fibers. In addition, we find that both Hsp40s bind tau seeds and fibers via their C-terminal domain II (CTDII), with DNAJA2 being further capable of recognizing tau monomers by a second, distinct site in CTDI. These results lay out the mechanisms by which the diverse members of the Hsp40 family counteract the formation and propagation of toxic tau aggregates, and highlight the fact that chaperones from different families/classes play distinct, yet complementary roles in preventing pathological protein aggregation.
