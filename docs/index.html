                Background Chronic non-specific neck pain is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders affecting work and lifestyle. Physiotherapy techniques, such as stretching and strength training, have beneficial effects on neck pain. Telerehabilitation exercise programmes could readily address the growing concern of patient adherence to home-based exercise programmes, while being time- and cost-effective. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of telerehabilitation exercise intervention in females with chronic non-specific neck pain by measuring the pain score, disability index, cervical range of motion (CROM), cervical muscle endurance, and patient adherence. Methods In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 31 females (mean age 22.7 ± 2.1 years) were given a 6-week home-based exercise programme based on their assigned group: telerehabilitation (TR) – online software or conventional (CG) – exercise manual. Baseline measurements were collected using the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain), Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire, CROM using the CROM instrument, and cervical muscle endurance through the Craniocervical Flexion Test (CCFT), and repeated after six weeks, in addition to adherence. SPSS version 26.0 was used for all statistical analyses. Results Based on mixed model ANOVA measures (0 week and 6 weeks), within-group comparisons for both groups showed statistical significance in favour of the exercise programme, for all variables (p<0.05). Telerehabilitation group showed significantly more increase in cervical rotation ROM R (0.006) and L (0.03) post-exercise programme, and longer duration of treatment session (0.02) as compared to conventional group. Between-group comparisons showed no significant differences for all other variables. Conclusions Based on our findings, both groups showed significant improvement in neck pain, disability, cervical ROM, and cervical muscle endurance; however, no group was found superior to the other in this regard. While both groups showed good adherence to the frequency of sessions, telerehabilitation exhibited better adherence to the duration of the exercise sessions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-173/v1?src=rss">An integrated data pipeline for semantic data representation of the flame spray pyrolysis process [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Ongoing digitalization and data-driven developments in materials science and engineering (MSE) emphasize the growing importance of reusing research data and enabling machine accessibility, which requires robust data management and consistent semantic data representation. Ontologies have emerged as powerful tools for establishing interoperable and reusable data structures from inconsistent data structures. Despite advancements in semantic data representation for specific applications, integrating application ontologies with primary data repositories, such as electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), to feed world data remains an open task. As a use case in the MSE domain, this work presents a system based on semantic technologies from the point of view of engineers, developed with the help of information scientists, and unraveled on a small scale. The development of an application ontology (AO) was elaborated for flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) processes with the implementation of a data pipeline. The proposed FSP application ontology emerges from experimental in-house best-practice procedures and is adapted to the mid-level Project Material Digital core ontology (PMDco) to allow interoperability within the MSE domain. The pipeline retrieves manually acquired experimental data from an ELN, translates it into a machine-actionable format, and converts it into a Resource Description Framework (RDF) format to support semantic interoperability. The latter was stored in a triple store with a SPARQL interface, enabling findable and accessible datasets that are searchable and traceable. By creating semantically linked data structures in line with FAIR principles, this approach allows traceable and findable experimental results between stakeholders through both human-readable and machine-actionable formats. Seamless integration of the modular microservices of the data pipeline within established lab practices minimizes disruption while maintaining the software framework. The present work demonstrates the practical implementation of a FAIR data pipeline within a laboratory setting, paving the way for future data-centric science.

                Background Although observational studies demonstrate that higher levels of vascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of dementia, these associations might be explained by confounding or other biases. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic instruments to test causal relationships in observational data. We sought to determine if genetically predicted modifiable risk factors (type 2 diabetes mellitus, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and circulating glucose) are associated with dementia by meta-analysing published MR studies. Secondary objectives were to identify heterogeneity in effect estimates across primary MR studies and to compare meta-analysis results with observational studies. Methods MR studies were identified by systematic search of Web of Science, OVID and Scopus. We selected primary MR studies investigating the modifiable risk factors of interest. Only one study from each cohort per risk factor was included. A quality assessment tool was developed to primarily assess the three assumptions of MR for each MR study. Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure and outcome, effect estimates per unit increase, and measures of variation. Effect estimates were pooled to generate an overall estimate, I2 and Cochrane Q values using fixed-effect model. Results We screened 5211 studies and included 12 primary MR studies after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Higher genetically predicted body mass index was associated with a higher odds of dementia (OR 1.03 [1.01, 1.05] per 5 kg/m2 increase, one study, p=0.00285). Fewer hypothesized vascular risk factors were supported by estimates from MR studies than estimates from meta-analyses of observational studies. Conclusion Genetically predicted body mass index was associated with an increase in risk of dementia.

                Background The aim of this study was to observe and analyze vascular function in ‘prolonged sitting’, followed by a yoga asana routine and pranayama intervention. Participants in this study include those who work from desks in offices. The study required the participants to attend on three separate days at random, and they had to finish a computerized test on each day. On the first day, participants were required to complete a computer test while sitting still for four hours (with the exception of washroom breaks). The next day, they underwent a computerized test along with a pranayama intervention. Finally, on the last day, they underwent a computerized test along with a yoga asana intervention. At the start of the study and after two and four hours, we measured the diameter and velocity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA). Methods The study was a within-subjects prospective single-center trial conducted in the Department of Radio-Diagnosis and Imaging, Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India, between September 2022 and January 2023. Participants were asked to do one of the following ‘activities’ over successive weeks: Week 1 – Prolonged sitting; Week 2 – Pranayama intervention; and Week 3 – Yoga asana intervention during prolonged sitting. The baseline and follow-up variables of pulse velocity, endothelial thickness, and shear rate were assessed for normality through a Shapiro-Wilk Test. Results Our sample included 11 participants with moderate physical activity, five with high physical activity and one with low physical activity. Yoga asana intervention comprised participants sitting continuously for four hours, with a yoga asana intervention being provided every hour, lasting for 10 minutes. Conclusions Yoga asana improves vascular functions in prolonged sitting conditions. This routine can promote the concept of interrupted sitting and ways to reduce it with efficient yoga asana practice without changing the work culture and provide better physical relief.

Background <p>From smallpox to poliomyelitis, halting contagion transmission through simultaneous mass vaccination is ubiquitous and often perceived as the only possible solution. But implementing mass vaccination campaigns in large populations within a short period poses many challenges. For example, in Arequipa, Peru, sweeping mass vaccination campaigns conducted yearly over a single weekend have failed to achieve the required ‘herd immunity’ to halt canine rabies transmission. Contrary to the global paradigm of a simultaneous campaign, the 2022 Arequipa rabies campaign was implemented at the sub-district level (patches), with dates of the campaign staggered across 6 months.</p> Methods <p>We constructed a stochastic, metapopulation model to examine how the timing of pulsed vaccination campaigns across patches can affect metapopulation dynamics. We explore general metapopulation dynamics for pulsed vaccinations as well as parameterizing the model for canine rabies in Arequipa, Peru. We simulated how the timing of the planned vaccination campaign, staggered over 6 months versus a single yearly pulse, affected the prospects for regional rabies elimination.</p> Results <p>Metapopulation dynamics can affect the efficacy of pulsed vaccination campaigns. In the case of Arequipa, Peru, the planned staggered mass dog vaccination campaign has the potential for local elimination with the tradeoffs of increased time to elimination and increased outbreak size due to metapopulation dynamics.</p> Conclusions <p>Heterogeneities caused by control strategies enactment at sub-population scales should be accounted for when modeling transmission dynamics. In Arequipa, Peru, although metapopulation dynamics may allow for re-introduction of canine rabies in previously vaccinated patches when mass dog vaccination campaigns are staggered temporally over 6 months, continuous mass vaccination reaching recommended vaccination coverage levels is sufficient to eliminate canine rabies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012747">Identifying patterns differing between high-dimensional datasets with generalized contrastive PCA</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Eliezyer Fermino de Oliveira, Pranjal Garg, Jens Hjerling-Leffler, Renata Batista-Brito, Lucas Sjulson</p>

High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.

                <p>by Richard J. Wang, Yadira Peña-García, Muthuswamy Raveendran, R. Alan Harris, Thuy-Trang Nguyen, Marie-Claude Gingras, Yifan Wu, Lesette Perez, Anne D. Yoder, Joe H. Simmons, Jeffrey Rogers, Matthew W. Hahn</p>

Every mammal studied to date has been found to have a male mutation bias: male parents transmit more de novo mutations to offspring than female parents, contributing increasingly more mutations with age. Although male-biased mutation has been studied for more than 75 years, its causes are still debated. One obstacle to understanding this pattern is its near universality—without variation in mutation bias, it is difficult to find an underlying cause. Here, we present new data on multiple pedigrees from two primate species: aye-ayes (<i>Daubentonia madagascariensis</i>), a member of the strepsirrhine primates, and olive baboons (<i>Papio anubis</i>). In stark contrast to the pattern found across mammals, we find a much larger effect of maternal age than paternal age on mutation rates in the aye-aye. In addition, older aye-aye mothers transmit substantially more mutations than older fathers. We carry out both computational and experimental validation of our results, contrasting them with results from baboons and other primates using the same methodologies. Further, we analyze a set of DNA repair and replication genes to identify candidate mutations that may be responsible for the change in mutation bias observed in aye-ayes. Our results demonstrate that mutation bias is not an immutable trait, but rather one that can evolve between closely related species. Further work on aye-ayes (and possibly other lemuriform primates) should help to explain the molecular basis for sex-biased mutation.

                Background Machine learning and AI promise to revolutionize the way we leverage medical imaging data for improving care but require large datasets to train computational models that can be implemented in clinical practice. However, processing large and complex medical imaging datasets remains an open challenge. Methods To address this issue, we developed Med-ImageTools, a new Python open-source software package to automate data curation and processing while allowing researchers to share their data processing configurations more easily, lowering the barrier for other researchers to reproduce published works. Use cases We have demonstrated the efficiency of Med-ImageTools across three different datasets, resulting in significantly reduced processing times. Conclusions The AutoPipeline feature will improve the accessibility of raw clinical datasets on public archives, such as the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), the largest public repository of cancer imaging, allowing machine learning researchers to process analysis-ready formats without requiring deep domain knowledge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99130">Artesunate, EDTA, and colistin work synergistically against MCR-negative and -positive colistin-resistant Salmonella</a></h4>

              
                Discovering new strategies to combat the multidrug-resistant bacteria constitutes a major medical challenge of our time. Previously, artesunate (AS) has been reported to exert antibacterial enhancement activity in combination with β-lactam antibiotics via inhibition of the efflux pump AcrB. However, combination of AS and colistin (COL) revealed a weak synergistic effect against a limited number of strains, and few studies have further explored its possible mechanism of synergistic action. In this article, we found that AS and EDTA could strikingly enhance the antibacterial effects of COL against <i>mcr-1</i><sup>-</sup> and <i>mcr-1</i><sup>+</sup> <i>Salmonella</i> strains either in vitro or in vivo, when used in triple combination. The excellent bacteriostatic effect was primarily related to the increased cell membrane damage, accumulation of toxic compounds and inhibition of MCR-1. The potential binding sites of AS to MCR-1 (THR283, SER284, and TYR287) were critical for its inhibition of MCR-1 activity. Additionally, we also demonstrated that the CheA of chemosensory system and virulence-related protein SpvD were critical for the bacteriostatic synergistic effects of the triple combination. Selectively targeting CheA, SpvD, or MCR using the natural compound AS could be further investigated as an attractive strategy for the treatment of <i>Salmonella</i> infection. Collectively, our work opens new avenues toward the potentiation of COL and reveals an alternative drug combination strategy to overcome COL-resistant bacterial infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95828">A ‘torn bag mechanism’ of small extracellular vesicle release via limiting membrane rupture of en bloc released amphisomes (amphiectosomes)</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies showed an unexpected complexity of extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis pathways. We previously found evidence that human colorectal cancer cells in vivo release large multivesicular body-like structures en bloc. Here, we tested whether this large EV type is unique to colorectal cancer cells. We found that all cell types we studied (including different cell lines and cells in their original tissue environment) released multivesicular large EVs (MV-lEVs). We also demonstrated that upon spontaneous rupture of the limiting membrane of the MV-lEVs, their intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) escaped to the extracellular environment by a ‘torn bag mechanism’. We proved that the MV-lEVs were released by ectocytosis of amphisomes (hence, we termed them amphiectosomes). Both ILVs of amphiectosomes and small EVs separated from conditioned media were either exclusively CD63 or LC3B positive. According to our model, upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with autophagosomes, fragments of the autophagosomal inner membrane curl up to form LC3B positive ILVs of amphisomes, while CD63 positive small EVs are of multivesicular body origin. Our data suggest a novel common release mechanism for small EVs, distinct from the exocytosis of multivesicular bodies or amphisomes, as well as the small ectosome release pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87092">Il-6 signaling exacerbates hallmarks of chronic tendon disease by stimulating reparative fibroblasts</a></h4>

              
                Tendinopathies are debilitating diseases currently increasing in prevalence and associated costs. There is a need to deepen our understanding of the underlying cell signaling pathways to unlock effective treatments. In this work, we screen cell signaling pathways in human tendinopathies and find positively enriched IL-6/JAK/STAT signaling alongside signatures of cell populations typically activated by IL-6 in other tissues. In human tendinopathic tendons, we also confirm the strong presence and co-localization of IL-6, IL-6R, and CD90, an established marker of reparative fibroblasts. To dissect the underlying causalities, we combine IL-6 knock-out mice with an explant-based assembloid model of tendon damage to successfully connect IL-6 signaling to reparative fibroblast activation and recruitment. Vice versa, we show that these reparative fibroblasts promote the development of tendinopathy hallmarks in the damaged explant upon IL-6 activation. We conclude that IL-6 activates tendon fibroblast populations which then initiate and deteriorate tendinopathy hallmarks.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuroinflammation has been identified as an important pathological component of cognitive impairment, and translocator protein imaging has become a valuable tool for assessing its patterns. We aimed to obtain the exact distribution of neuroinflammation in cognitive impairment and its underlying mechanisms with amyloid-beta. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, two investigators searched literature databases for studies that measured translocator protein binding levels. This measurement was performed between healthy controls and subjects with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease via voxel-based positron emission tomography image analysis at the whole-brain level. This meta-analysis was performed with the anisotropic effect-size based algorithm. Neuroinflammation in patients with mild cognitive impairment was mainly concentrated in the left middle temporal gyrus and left amygdala. In Alzheimer’s disease patients, the brain regions involved were the left inferior temporal gyrus, left calcarine fissure/surrounding cortex, left parahippocampal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, and right middle temporal gyrus. In addition, neuroinflammation in patients with cognitive impairment was highly correlated with amyloid-beta deposition in the cortex. This study deepens our understanding of the patterns of neuroinflammation in patients with cognitive impairment and its interaction with amyloid-beta, providing potential insights for therapeutic approaches targeting neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease.</span>

Key findings include: (i) overlapping activation in the middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus across tasks, indicating a shared neural basis for creative thinking; (ii) distinct activation patterns, with the malevolent creative task showing greater activation and reduced functional connectivity in regions such as the right rolandic operculum and supramarginal gyrus compared to the benevolent creative task; (iii) similar neural activity patterns in regions like the middle frontal gyrus and lingual gyrus between the malevolent creative task and benevolent creative task may indicate overlapping cognitive processes. (iv) Correlations between task-specific neural activity and behavioral performance, including malevolence negatively correlating with functional connectivity in the rolandic operculum and middle cingulate cortex during the malevolent creative task, and benevolence correlating with functional connectivity in the parahippocampal gyrus and insula during the benevolent creative task. This study indicated distinct and shared neural correlates linked to malevolent and benevolent creativity.</span>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Fabry disease (FD) is an inborn error of the glycosphingolipid metabolism with variable kidney, heart, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. CNS-related FD manifestations include early ischemic stroke and white matter lesions (WMLs) related to cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD), possibly resulting in cognitive impairment. We studied 40 adult FD patients (17 male) to assess: (i) prevalence of cerebrovascular and cognitive manifestations in FD and their correlation with heart and renal involvement; and (ii) the potential value of serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels as an indicator of WMLs in FD. Methods: Patients underwent detailed diagnostic assessment related to FD, also including Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), neuropsychological tests, brain MRI to assess WMLs by the modified Fazekas score (mFS), and NfL determination by single-molecule array (SiMoA) (n = 22 FD patients vs. 15 healthy controls). Results: Overall, 4 FD patients had a history of ischemic stroke and 13/32 patients (40.6%) had an mFS &amp;amp;ge; 1. Almost two-thirds of FD patients (27/39, 69.2%) showed impairment on at least one cognitive test. On univariate analysis, only a reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate was associated with an increased likelihood of having WMLs on brain MRI. Serum NfL levels were higher in FD patients vs. controls, with a trend toward significance (p = 0.08). Conclusions: Mild-to-moderate CSVD is a characteristic brain &amp;amp;ldquo;signature&amp;amp;rdquo; in FD patients. Both cardiac and renal involvement correlate with WML load, but only renal involvement appears to be predictive of CNS damage. Brain microvascular damage is associated with mild cognitive impairment in FD, and serum NfL might represent a potential biomarker of CSVD in FD.</p>

	<p>Background: In our modern era, stress has become a pervasive challenge, affecting individuals across all ages and backgrounds. Acute or chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels are known to impair neurological function and hinder rehabilitation outcomes. Therefore, effective treatment methods that reduce stress, enhance mental health, and promote overall well-being are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seasonal impact of balneotherapy on distress, as measured by the General Symptoms Distress Scale (GSDS), and well-being, as assessed using the Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale (AIOS), and the effect of winter balneotherapy on salivary cortisol levels. Methods: In 2023, a multicenter, single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was carried out across six medical spa centers in Lithuania. Participants with a stress intensity greater than 3 points on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) underwent combined natural resource-based therapies over a 1- to 2-week treatment period. Outcomes were assessed using the General Symptom Distress and Arizona Integrative Outcomes scales, along with salivary cortisol measurements after winter intervention. Results: The results demonstrated a significant reduction in distress intensity by 1&amp;amp;ndash;3.5 points (VAS), with winter interventions showing greater efficacy compared to summer. Participants also experienced an increase in well-being by up to 3 points (VAS), improved stress management by up to 1.9 points (VAS), and a reduction in salivary cortisol levels by 0.9 units following winter-based treatments. Some gender differences emerged in specific groups. Conclusions: Our study provides robust evidence for the stress-reducing effects of balneotherapy, particularly highlighting the enhanced efficacy of winter interventions. These findings are especially relevant for neurological rehabilitation, where stress reduction and improved autonomic regulation can support neuroplasticity, recovery processes, and overall quality of life. This research offers valuable insights for developing holistic, seasonally optimized strategies to aid stress management and promote neurological health.</p>

	<p>Oxidative stress levels are exacerbated in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). This phenomenon feeds back into the overactivation of oxidase enzymes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), with the stimulation of their receptors (RAGE). These factors stimulate A&amp;amp;beta; peptide aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation through multiple pathways, which are addressed in this paper. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulatory effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on oxidant/antioxidant balance as an adjuvant treatment in patients with AD. The results obtained showed that NAC supplementation produced improved cognitive performance, decreased levels of oxidative stress markers, lowered activities of oxidase enzymes, increased antioxidant responses, and attenuated inflammatory and apoptotic markers. Moreover, NAC reversed mitochondrial dysfunction, lowered AGEs-RAGE formation, attenuated A&amp;amp;beta; peptide oligomerization, and reduced phosphorylation of tau, thereby halting the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and the progression of AD.</p>

	<p>Background: Patients with functional neurological disorder presenting as stroke mimics or functional stroke mimics (FSMs) pose significant diagnostic challenges. In the acute phase, especially when patients are present within the therapeutic window for acute reperfusion treatments, a misdiagnosis of FSM can lead to unnecessary and costly interventions. Despite its clinical importance, the literature on the risk factors for FSM is limited. This study aims to compare the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with FSM to those with confirmed acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Methods: This case&amp;amp;ndash;control study involved temporal matching between consecutive series of patients with FSM and controls with AIS from a single tertiary university hospital in southern Portugal. Results: A total of 188 patients were included: 64 cases (FSM) and 188 controls (AIS). The rate of stroke code activation and use of ambulance between was comparable between the two groups. The group of patients with FSM was younger (53.2 years vs. 69.5 years, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and had a higher proportion of females (52.4% vs. 47.6%, p = 0.001). There was no difference in terms of clinical severity at presentation. The proportion of specific signs, such as transcortical aphasia (3.1% vs. 20.9%, p = 0.014), gait abnormalities (15.6% vs. 33.9%, p = 0.004), and cranial nerve abnormalities (31.2% vs. 43.5%, p = 0.042), was lower in the FSM group compared to the AIS group. The proportion of patients on antithrombotic therapy (90.9% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.007) and antihypertensive drugs (78.5%, vs. 21.5%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) prior to the event was significantly higher in the AIS group. Likewise, the prevalence of cerebrovascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (14.3% vs. 85.7%, p = 0.005), arterial hypertension (23.8% vs. 76.2%, p = 0.001), and smoking (43.7% vs. 56.3%, p = 0.005) was lower in the FSM group compared to the AIS group. No statistically significant differences were observed in cholesterol levels or the prevalence of dyslipidemia between the two groups. Psychiatric comorbidities, including generalized anxiety disorder (71.4% vs. 28.6%, p = 0.05) and major depressive disorder (61.9% vs. 28.1%, p = 0.01), were more prevalent in the FSM group. Conclusions: Patients with FSM display different clinical and epidemiological profiles, with a higher likelihood of being younger, female, having prior psychiatric conditions, and lacking traditional cerebrovascular risk factors.</p>

	<p>This article delves into the intricate mechanisms underlying sensory integration in the executive control of movement, encompassing ideomotor activity, predictive capabilities, and motor control systems. It examines the interplay between motor and sensory functions, highlighting the role of the cortical and subcortical regions of the central nervous system in enhancing environmental interaction. The acquisition of motor skills, procedural memory, and the representation of actions in the brain are discussed emphasizing the significance of mental imagery and training in motor function. The development of this aspect of sensorimotor integration control can help to advance our understanding of the interactions between executive motor control, cortical mechanisms, and consciousness. Bridging theoretical insights with practical applications, it sets the stage for future innovations in clinical rehabilitation, assistive technology, and education. The ongoing exploration of these domains promises to uncover new pathways for enhancing human capability and well-being.</p>

                <p>The use of supervised machine learning to approximate poses in video recordings allows for rapid and efficient analysis of complex behavioral profiles. Currently, there are limited protocols for automated analysis of operant self-administration behavior. We provide a methodology to (1) obtain videos of training sessions via Raspberry Pi microcomputers or GoPro cameras, (2) obtain pose estimation data using the supervised machine learning software packages DeepLabCut (DLC) and Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA) with a local high-performance computer cluster, (3) compare standard Med-PC lever response versus quadrant time data generated from pose estimation regions of interest, and (4) generate predictive behavioral classifiers. Overall, we demonstrate proof of concept to use pose estimation outputs from DLC to both generate quadrant time results and obtain behavioral classifiers from SimBA during operant training phases.</p>

                <p>A common impairment in aging is age-related hearing loss (presbycusis), which manifests as impaired spectrotemporal processing. Presbycusis can be caused by a dysfunction of the peripheral and central auditory system, and these dysfunctions might differ between the sexes. To date, the circuit mechanisms in the central nervous system responsible for age-related auditory dysfunction remain mostly unknown. In the auditory cortex (ACtx), aging is accompanied by alteration in normal inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmission and changes in excitatory (NMDA and AMPA) synapses, but which circuits are affected has been unclear. Here we investigated how auditory cortical microcircuits change with age and if sex-dependent differences existed. We performed laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) combined with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from layer (L) 2/3 cells in the primary auditory cortex (A1) in young adult (2&ndash;3&nbsp;months) and aged (older than 18&nbsp;months) male and female CBA/CaJ mice which have normal peripheral hearing. We found that L2/3 cells in aged male animals display functional hypoconnectivity of inhibitory circuits originating from L2/3 and L4. Compared with cells from young adult mice, cells from aged male mice have weaker excitatory connections from L2/3. We also observed an increased diversity of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. These results suggest a sex-specific reduction and diversification in excitatory and inhibitory intralaminar cortical circuits in aged mice compared with young adult animals. We speculate that these unbalanced changes in cortical circuits contribute to the functional manifestations of age-related hearing loss in both males and females.</p>

                Abstract Background Nigella sativa L., known as black cumin, is thought to possess anti-inflammatory properties that may help alleviate related conditions. This study examined the effects of black cumin extract on levels of Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), both inflammatory markers. Methods The experimental design included a control group used solely for post-testing. Five groups of Wistar rats were studied: a negative control group (N), a dyslipidemia group as a positive control (P), a dyslipidemia group given black cumin (P1), a dyslipidemia group treated with atorvastatin (P2), and a dyslipidemia group receiving both atorvastatin and black cumin (P3).IL-1β and TNF-α levels were measured using ELISA, and statistical analysis was conducted using ANOVA followed by the Duncan test. Results After treatment, the average IL-1β levels were 38.26 pg/mL (N), 102.16 pg/mL (P), 57.05 pg/mL (P1), 29.16 pg/mL (P2), and 54.06 pg/mL (P3). The Duncan test indicated no significant differences in IL-1β levels among groups N, P2, and P3 (p>0.05), while group P exhibited the highest IL-1β levels, significantly different from the others. For TNF-α, average levels post-treatment were 30.42 pg/mL (N), 22.02 pg/mL (P), 27.25 pg/mL (P1), 16.33 pg/mL (P2), and 13.29 pg/mL (P3). The Duncan test showed that group P3 had the lowest TNF-α levels, which were not significantly different from P2 (p>0.05) but significantly different from groups P, P1, and N (p<0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, black cumin extract effectively reduces IL-1β levels in high-fat diet rat models, while the combination of atorvastatin and black cumin extract yields the most significant reduction in TNF-α levels.

                Background Migration is a social determinant of health, and migrants often face health inequalities compared to host populations. Migrants are underrepresented in health research in many European countries, including Belgium, which is concerning. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a comprehensive framework aimed at guiding research on migration and health within the WHO European Region. This initiative supports evidence-based policymaking among European member states by providing a foundational structure for examining various strategies and methodologies. The framework serves as a catalyst for discussion and critical analysis, contributing to the formulation of a global research agenda on migration and health under WHO’s leadership. Additionally, it outlines key research priorities and offers strategic recommendations to enhance the understanding and response to health issues related to migration. One of these recommendations calls on researchers to “maximise the use of existing data from research and routinely collected data in health information systems”. Objective The overarching aim of our Datahub initiative is to map available sources of datasets about access to and use of medicines among migrant populations, and test if and under which conditions they can be used in research, by taking the case of Flanders, Belgium. Methods This initiative will involve conducting a focused review to map datasets used for reporting access to and use of medicines among migrants, followed by a qualitative study with key informants; a structured analysis of ethical and legal challenges to be addressed when using the datasets we identified for research; and content description and evaluation of the different identified datasets. Results We assert that the results of our initiative will help presenting the diverse sources of data about medicines access or use among migrant populations. They will be also used to provide recommendations about enhancing the possibilities of retrieving, and using data, including recommendations for (legal, ethical, methodological) risk mitigation for retrieving and using these data.

                Background Hormonal changes in pregnancy and their induced effect on periodontal health are well documented. The present study is aimed at the potential repercussions of multiple pregnancies on periodontal health. Materials and methods Our study utilized data from key sections of the NHANES. All the pertaining and relevant data for the study is collected. Our exposure variable was the number of pregnancies, and the outcome variable was periodontal disease. The number of pregnancies is classified as one, two, three, four, or more. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, poverty/income ratio, marital status, and other variables. Multiple logistic regression models were employed to assess the impact of multiple pregnancies on periodontal disease. Result The crude and multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that none of the variables were significantly associated with the prevalence of periodontitis. In univariate analysis, patients with one or two pregnancies had higher odds of experiencing periodontitis (OR 1.154, 95% CI 0.748-1.779), (OR 1.464, 95% CI 0.864-2.483) respectively. However, these associations did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Within the limitation of the study, there is no significant relationship between parity and the prevalence of periodontitis, the longitudinal study may be warranted to delve deeper into any potential associations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-951/v2?src=rss">The effect of surface treatments on the bond strength of polyetheretherketone posts: a systematic review protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely used in the biomedical field due to its outstanding biological and mechanical properties. Originally employed as a temporary abutment in implantology, recent research has expanded its indications for more definitive applications, such as frameworks and dental post and core. This shift requires a thorough assessment of PEEK’s adhesion and mechanical characteristics. However, PEEK’s inert properties and intricate chemistry create difficulties in surface treatment, resulting in reduced surface energy and inadequate adhesion. Various physical and chemical modification techniques, including acid etching (e.g., 98% sulfuric acid), sandblasting with alumina oxide (Al₂O₃), plasma treatment, laser irradiation, silanization, and air abrasion with silica-coated particles, have been proposed to enhance PEEK’s bonding performance. Despite its numerous clinical trials, standardized protocols remain lacking. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of surface treatments on the bonding performance of PEEK posts. Methods A detailed search of the literature will be conducted across several databases including PubMed, Scopus and clinical trial registries. Additional databases such as Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Web of Science and EBSCO will also be included. The search strategy will target controlled randomized studies and non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of surface treatments on PEEK post adhesion strength. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) will be used to assess bias in non-randomized studies, while the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB II) tool will be employed for evaluating randomized controlled trials. Data extraction will focus on study design, treatment methods, outcomes and results. This systematic review protocol will adhere to the guidelines for systematic reviews outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Discussion The discussion will explore the implications of findings on clinical practice, highlighting the importance of enhancing PEEK’s bioactivity and surface energy to improve bonding efficacy in dental procedures. Moreover, it will suggest areas for future research to advance dental materials science, aiming to optimize the utilization of PEEK in dental applications Systematic review registration PROSPERO: CRD42024529783 (Registered on 08/04/2024).

                Background Recent studies have established that Medicinal Marijuana (MM) is beneficial in the treatment of spasms, sleep, and pain in adult patients with varying medical diagnoses and symptoms. However, MM has rarely been used for the treatment of Cerebral Palsy (CP) complications in adults. The aim of this literature review was to explore MM interventions globally, with a focus on identifying the best practice with MM for the treatment of complications of CP. Methods A literature search was performed using keywords and synonyms related to MM treatment and CP complications. Inclusions and exclusions were scoped to scholarly peer reviewed academic literature published 2019 to 2021 located in the Deakin Library collection. A screening process confirmed criteria adherence and identified additional papers in referencing. The papers were appraised and evaluated to ensure selections do not have perceived or actual bias. Results From 409 publications, 27 papers were selected for review because they investigated the benefits of MM treatment for patients with sleep, pain, and spasm complications. There was no literature found on the use of MM for adults with CP. Discussion Recent research has demonstrated that with an informed understanding of MM treatment adult patients with varying medical diagnoses and symptoms can use MM to manage sleep disruption and improve relaxation. Therefore, there are potential benefits for the use of MM in treating spasticity, pain, sleep and improvement of quality of life, and social and emotional wellbeing in adult patients with CP. No funding was sort or provided for this review and the results are specific to adults with CP, so they are not to be generalized to other populations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1367/v2?src=rss">“Unmasking the Uncommon”: A case series of multi-drug resistant Elizabethkingia meningoseptica causing late-onset sepsis and meningitis in preterm neonates [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is an uncommon nosocomial pathogen that causes meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis in neonates and in immunocompromised individuals. It exhibits resistance to many commonly employed first-line antibiotics used to treat gram-negative pathogens. Herein, we present three cases of late-onset sepsis with multi-drug resistant (MDR) Elizabethkingia meningoseptica in high-risk neonates. Case 1 was a one-day-old preterm low-birth-weight infant who presented with respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. The patient was intubated and administered empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal agents. Blood culture grew Candida krusei, hence Amphotericin B was initiated. Repeat blood culture on day 27 showed gram-negative bacilli, identified as Elizabethkingia meningoseptica by MALDI-TOF . Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) revealed resistance to Piperacillin/Tazobactam, but sensitivity to Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Minocycline. IV Vancomycin was administered, which resulted in clinical improvement and negative blood culture results. Case 2 was an eleven-day-old preterm, low-birth-weight baby who presented with fever. Initial investigations revealed normal complete blood counts (CBC) parameters and elevated CRP levels. Blood and CSF cultures isolated Elizabethkingia meningoseptica with a similar AST pattern. Intravenous Ciprofloxacin was initiated with clinical improvement and negative follow-up blood cultures. Case 3 was a one-day-old preterm baby, appropriate-to-gestational age, presenting with respiratory distress syndrome. The infant was intubated and started on inotropic support and intravenous antibiotics. Blood cultures on day 4 showed Elizabethkingia meningoseptica and Vancomycin was started. Follow-up cultures on days 6 and 14 grew Acinetobacter baumannii. A combination of Levofloxacin and Colistin was added, and blood cultures were negative after seven days, with clinical improvement. Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a significant cause of hospital-acquired infections, especially in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), leading to outbreaks. Clinicians must have a high degree of suspicion of E. meningoseptica for gram-negative bacilli causing sepsis and meningitis in high-risk patients. Recent technological advances have enabled accurate speciation to guide therapy and reduce morbidity and mortality rates.

                Background Multiplayer Virtual Reality-Based Simulations (MPVR-based simulations) with immersive 3D environments have become an important tool in interprofessional education (IPE). However, instruments to measure interprofessional socialization in MPVR-based education are limited. The Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS) is a useful tool for evaluating interprofessional socialization. This pilot study aimed to adapt and validate the ISVS-24 for use in interprofessional MPVR-based simulations settings. Methods Seventy-two participants, including anesthesiology residents (at novice, junior, and senior levels), general physicians, and nurses, were recruited voluntarily. The ISVS-24 was cross-culturally adapted and reviewed by experts for content validity in the MPVR simulation context. Participants completed the adapted ISVS after undergoing an interprofessional MPVR-based simulation. Structural validity was assessed using factorial analysis through principal component analysis. Content validity was measured using the mean content validity index (CVI). Consistency validity was evaluated with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC), and reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Results The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test indicated sampling adequacy (0.885), and Bartlett’s sphericity test was significant (χ2(42) = 472.725, p < 0.05). A three-section structure was confirmed. The mean CVI was 0.815, with 21 valid items (Aiken’s V ≥ 0.5). Among the 72 respondents, 40 were female (55.6%) and 32 were male (44.4%); 26 were anesthesiology residents (36.1%), 23 were general physicians (31.9%), and 23 were nurses (31.9%). The overall Cronbach’s alpha was 0.959. PCC for all items exceeded the r table value (> 0.232) with p < 0.05, showing significant item relationships. Conclusions The adapted version of ISVS for MPVR simulation-based education has good validity and reliability to assess interprofessional socialization in an MPVR-based simulation setting.

                Objective Toluene is the most abundant lipophilic aromatic compound in our environment. Exposure to toluene through inhalation is toxic to the cardiovascular system due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that trigger oxidative stress. This study aims to examine the response of coronary arteries to toluene inhalation exposure based on the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in coronary arteries, and levels of CYP2E1 with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) in the serum. Methods This was a true experimental study on Wistar rats with a post-test control group design. In total, 36 Wistar rats were divided into five experimental (X1–X5) and one control group. The experimental groups were exposed to 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, 12.8, and 25.6 mL of toluene, respectively. All groups, except control, received inhalation exposure for 14 d (6 h/d). Results In Wistar rats, toluene exposure significantly reduced the expression of SOD and CAT enzymes while it increased the expression of MDA and VCAM-1 in the coronary artery. Serum levels of CYP2E1 and Ox-LDL were unaffected. Conclusion Acute inhalation exposure to toluene significantly decreased SOD and CAT expression with increased MDA and VCAM-1 expression in coronary arteries. Other findings suggest that decreased CAT expression leads to increased VCAM-1 expression in the coronary artery.

                In 2009 a review of the state of child and adolescent physical and mental health care in the United States, appeared hopeful with the possibility of addressing the unmet health needs of our nation’s children in schools (Manning, 2009). Major legislation and sweeping strides for addressing the affordability of health care in the United States with The Affordable Care Act (ACA) which was codified into law and signed by President Obama, opening the possibility that the unmet physical and mental health needs of America’s youth may be reduced through the availability and affordability of health insurance for everyone (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010). Over the past 15 years, the health and mental health of children and adolescents in the United States have undergone notable changes, reflecting both progress and persistent challenges. While public health initiatives and policy advancements have improved access to care and contributed to reductions in asthma prevalence and teen pregnancy rates, other areas continue to demonstrate systemic challenges. The rising incidence of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, depression, suicidality and ADHD highlight the ongoing need for comprehensive health interventions at the public health level. Additionally, disparities in healthcare access, particularly among rural and low-income populations, remain significant barriers to the overall well-being of children and youth. The shortage of primary care providers, gaps in insurance coverage and the increasing burden on school-based health clinics further complicate care accessibility. This paper examines the evolving trends in child and adolescent health, emphasizing the critical role of policy, environmental changes and healthcare innovations in shaping outcomes. After almost 15 years of this call to action and implementation of the ACA we have made strides towards healthy outcomes for children and youth, evidencing that transformative, systemic change is not only possible, but necessary to ensure the well-being of future generations.

                <p>by Rodrigo Osuna-Orozco, Edward Castillo, Kameron Decker Harris, Samantha R. Santacruz</p>

Large-scale recordings of neural activity over broad anatomical areas with high spatial and temporal resolution are increasingly common in modern experimental neuroscience. Recently, recurrent switching dynamical systems have been used to tackle the scale and complexity of these data. However, an important challenge remains in providing insights into the existence and structure of recurrent linear dynamics in neural time series data. Here we test a scalable approach to time-varying autoregression with low-rank tensors to recover the recurrent dynamics in stochastic neural mass models with multiple stable attractors. We demonstrate that the parsimonious representation of time-varying system matrices in terms of temporal modes can recover the attractor structure of simple systems via clustering. We then consider simulations based on a human brain connectivity matrix in high and low global connection strength regimes, and reveal the hierarchical clustering structure of the dynamics. Finally, we explain the impact of the forecast time delay on the estimation of the underlying rank and temporal variability of the time series dynamics. This study illustrates that prediction error minimization is not sufficient to recover meaningful dynamic structure and that it is crucial to account for the three key timescales arising from dynamics, noise processes, and attractor switching.

Background <p>DNA methylation (DNAm) provides a window to characterize the impacts of environmental exposures and the biological aging process. Epigenetic clocks are often trained on DNAm using penalized regression of CpG sites, but recent evidence suggests potential benefits of training epigenetic predictors on principal components.</p> Methodology/findings <p>We developed a pipeline to simultaneously train three epigenetic predictors; a traditional CpG Clock, a PCA Clock, and a SuperLearner PCA Clock (SL PCA). We gathered publicly available DNAm datasets to generate i) a novel childhood epigenetic clock, ii) a reconstructed Hannum adult blood clock, and iii) as a proof of concept, a predictor of polybrominated biphenyl exposure using the three developmental methodologies. We used correlation coefficients and median absolute error to assess fit between predicted and observed measures, as well as agreement between duplicates. The SL PCA clocks improved fit with observed phenotypes relative to the PCA clocks or CpG clocks across several datasets. We found evidence for higher agreement between duplicate samples run on alternate DNAm arrays when using SL PCA clocks relative to traditional methods. Analyses examining associations between relevant exposures and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) produced more precise effect estimates when using predictions derived from SL PCA clocks.</p> Conclusions <p>We introduce a novel method for the development of DNAm-based predictors that combines the improved reliability conferred by training on principal components with advanced ensemble-based machine learning. Coupling SuperLearner with PCA in the predictor development process may be especially relevant for studies with longitudinal designs utilizing multiple array types, as well as for the development of predictors of more complex phenotypic traits.</p>

RNA abundance is controlled by rates of synthesis and degradation. Although mis-regulation of RNA turnover is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, how it contributes to cortical development is largely unknown. Here, we discover the landscape of RNA stability regulation in the cerebral cortex and demonstrate that intact RNA decay machinery is essential for corticogenesis in vivo. We use SLAM-seq to measure RNA half-lives transcriptome-wide across multiple stages of cortical development. Leveraging these data, we discover <i>cis</i>-acting features associated with RNA stability and probe the relationship between RNA half-life and developmental expression changes. Notably, RNAs that are up-regulated across development tend to be more stable, while down-regulated RNAs are less stable. Using compound mouse genetics, we discover CNOT3, a core component of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex linked to neurodevelopmental disease, is essential for cortical development. Conditional knockout of <i>Cnot3</i> in neural progenitors and their progeny in the developing mouse cortex leads to severe microcephaly due to altered cell fate and p53-dependent apoptosis. Finally, we define the molecular targets of CNOT3, revealing it controls expression of poorly expressed, non-optimal mRNAs in the cortex, including cell cycle-related transcripts. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned control of RNA turnover is crucial for brain development.

                <p>by Eléa A. Renaud, Ambre J. M. Maupin, Laurence Berry, Julie Bals, Yann Bordat, Vincent Demolombe, Valérie Rofidal, Florence Vignols, Sébastien Besteiro</p>

Several key cellular functions depend on proteins harboring an iron–sulfur (Fe-S) cofactor. As these Fe-S proteins localize to several subcellular compartments, they require a dedicated machinery for cofactor assembly. For instance, in plants and algae there are Fe-S cluster synthesis pathways localizing to the cytosol, but also present in the mitochondrion and in the chloroplast, 2 organelles of endosymbiotic origin. <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> is a plastid-bearing parasitic protist responsible for a pathology affecting humans and other warm-blooded vertebrates. We have characterized the <i>Toxoplasma</i> homolog of HCF101, originally identified in plants as a protein transferring Fe-S clusters to photosystem I subunits in the chloroplast. Contrarily to plants, we have shown that HCF101 does not localize to the plastid in parasites, but instead is an important component of the cytosolic Fe-S assembly (CIA) pathway which is vital for <i>Toxoplasma</i>. While the CIA pathway is widely conserved in eukaryotes, it is the first time the involvement of HCF101 in this pan-eukaryotic machinery is established. Moreover, as this protein is essential for parasite viability and absent from its mammalian hosts, it constitutes a novel and promising potential drug target.

The balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I) is essential for coordinating motor behavior, yet the differential roles of exocytosis regulators in this balance are less understood. In this study, we investigated the roles of 2 conserved exocytosis regulators, complexin/CPX-1 and CAPS/UNC-31, in excitatory versus inhibitory synapses at <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> neuromuscular junctions. <i>cpx-1</i> null mutants exhibited a marked increase in spontaneous release specifically at excitatory synapses, alongside an unequal reduction in excitatory and inhibitory evoked release. A clamping-specific knockin mutant, <i>cpx-1(Δ12)</i>, which preserved evoked release, also showed a biased enhancement in excitatory spontaneous release. Conversely, the <i>unc-31</i> null mutation, while maintaining normal spontaneous release, displayed a more pronounced reduction in evoked release at excitatory synapses. Notably, we found that CPX-1’s clamping function is dependent on UNC-31 and is sensitive to <i>external Ca</i><sup>2+</sup>. Pull-down experiments confirmed that CAPS/UNC-31 does not directly interact with complexin, implying an indirect regulatory mechanism. Moreover, complexin regulates activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, which is also UNC-31 dependent. The unexpected role of CAPS/UNC-31 in the absence of CPX-1 clamping function may underpin the synaptic E/I balance and coordinated behavioral outputs in different species.

An important question is whether the placenta is a source of, or merely a niche for, blood-forming hematopoietic stem cells. A recent PLOS Biology study suggests that the placenta does not directly give rise to hematopoietic stem cells.

<p>Analysis of the porcine cingulate sulcus was conducted using immunohistochemical techniques. Results showed a higher neuronal density within the depths of the cingulate sulcus (fundus), as well as decreased distance between neuronal cell bodies within the different cortical layers of the fundus.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cortical folding (gyrification) is a unique process by which the brain can expand and increase surface area while confined by the boundaries of the inner wall of the skull. Although there is still much debate about the exact mechanisms concerning the genetic and cellular factors involved in this process, gyrification results in a heterogenous organization of neuronal layering and cell types not seen in the smooth, lissencephalic brain of rodents. In this article, we describe differences in neuronal density and supporting cells within the depths (fundus) and adjacent walls of the cingulate sulcus of the porcine brain. We also measured the distance between pyramidal neurons within Layers III and V to investigate if the observed increase in density of neurons within the cingulate fundus is associated with a decrease in distance between neurons in these layers. We also identify the presence of the gigantopyramidal neuron within the fundus of the porcine cingulate sulcus, a pyramidal neuron subtype seen in nonhuman primates and human brains. Taken together, this article provides evidence that further supports the heterogeneous composition of the gyrified brain by describing the cellular organization of the porcine cingulate sulcus.</p>

                Zhang et al. report that MAIT cells protect against sterile lung injury by promoting cDC1 accumulation, which limits tissue damage through a DNGR-1-dependent pathway. Analysis of human IPF data suggests that MAIT cells may potentially modulate fibrosis.

                Tolve et al. demonstrate that AP-2 stabilizes GRID2IP to regulate synaptic function in Purkinje cells. Loss of AP-2 disrupts synaptic connectivity, alters network activity, and impacts motor coordination. This study highlights the importance of AP-2 in cerebellar function and its implications for neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98158">Molecular determinants of Neu5Ac binding to a tripartite ATP independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter</a></h4>

              
                <i>N</i> -Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) is a negatively charged nine-carbon amino sugar that is often the peripheral sugar in human cell-surface glycoconjugates. Some bacteria scavenge, import, and metabolize Neu5Ac or redeploy it on their cell surfaces for immune evasion. The import of Neu5Ac by many bacteria is mediated by tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters. We have previously reported the structures of SiaQM, a membrane-embedded component of the <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> TRAP transport system, (Currie et al., 2024). However, none of the published structures contain Neu5Ac bound to SiaQM. This information is critical for defining the transport mechanism and for further structure-activity relationship studies. Here, we report the structures of <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i> SiaQM with and without Neu5Ac. Both structures are in an inward (cytoplasmic side) facing conformation. The Neu5Ac-bound structure reveals the interactions of Neu5Ac with the transporter and its relationship with the Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites. Two of the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding sites are similar to those described previously. We identify a third metal-binding site that is further away and buried in the elevator domain. Ser300 and Ser345 interact with the C1-carboxylate group of Neu5Ac. Proteoliposome-based transport assays showed that Ser300-Neu5Ac interaction is critical for transport, whereas Ser345 is dispensable. Neu5Ac primarily interacts with residues in the elevator domain of the protein, thereby supporting the elevator with an operator mechanism. The residues interacting with Neu5Ac are conserved, providing fundamental information required to design inhibitors against this class of proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92906">Akkermansia muciniphila identified as key strain to alleviate gut barrier injury through Wnt signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                As the largest mucosal surface, the gut has built a physical, chemical, microbial, and immune barrier to protect the body against pathogen invasion. The disturbance of gut microbiota aggravates pathogenic bacteria invasion and gut barrier injury. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for microbiome-related disorders, where beneficial strain engraftment is a significant factor influencing FMT outcomes. The aim of this research was to explore the effect of FMT on antibiotic-induced microbiome-disordered (AIMD) models infected with enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC). We used piglet, mouse, and intestinal organoid models to explore the protective effects and mechanisms of FMT on ETEC infection. The results showed that FMT regulated gut microbiota and enhanced the protection of AIMD piglets against ETEC K88 challenge, as demonstrated by reduced intestinal pathogen colonization and alleviated gut barrier injury. <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> (<i>A. muciniphila</i>) and <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> (<i>B. fragilis</i>) were identified as two strains that may play key roles in FMT. We further investigated the alleviatory effects of these two strains on ETEC infection in the AIMD mice model, which revealed that <i>A. muciniphila</i> and <i>B. fragilis</i> relieved ETEC-induced intestinal inflammation by maintaining the proportion of Treg/Th17 cells and epithelial damage by moderately activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, while the effect of <i>A. muciniphila</i> was better than <i>B. fragilis</i>. We, therefore, identified whether <i>A. muciniphila</i> protected against ETEC infection using basal-out and apical-out intestinal organoid models. <i>A. muciniphila</i> did protect the intestinal stem cells and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and the protective effects of <i>A. muciniphila</i> were reversed by Wnt inhibitor. FMT alleviated ETEC-induced gut barrier injury and intestinal inflammation in the AIMD model. <i>A. muciniph</i>ila was identified as a key strain in FMT to promote the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells by mediating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86931">The Mycobacterium ulcerans toxin mycolactone causes destructive Sec61-dependent loss of the endothelial glycocalyx and vessel basement membrane to drive skin necrosis</a></h4>

              
                The drivers of tissue necrosis in <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> infection (Buruli ulcer disease) have historically been ascribed solely to the directly cytotoxic action of the diffusible exotoxin, mycolactone. However, its role in the clinically evident vascular component of disease aetiology remains poorly explained. We have now dissected mycolactone’s effects on human primary vascular endothelial cells in vitro. We show that mycolactone-induced changes in endothelial morphology, adhesion, migration, and permeability are dependent on its action at the Sec61 translocon. Unbiased quantitative proteomics identified a profound effect on proteoglycans, driven by rapid loss of type II transmembrane proteins of the Golgi, including enzymes required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) synthesis, combined with a reduction in the core proteins themselves. Loss of the glycocalyx is likely to be of particular mechanistic importance, since knockdown of galactosyltransferase II (beta-1,3-galactotransferase 6; B3GALT6), the GAG linker-building enzyme, phenocopied the permeability and phenotypic changes induced by mycolactone. Additionally, mycolactone depleted many secreted basement membrane components and microvascular basement membranes were disrupted in vivo during <i>M. ulcerans</i> infection in the mouse model. Remarkably, exogenous addition of laminin-511 reduced endothelial cell rounding, restored cell attachment and reversed the defective migration caused by mycolactone. Hence supplementing mycolactone-depleted extracellular matrix may be a future therapeutic avenue, to improve wound healing rates.

">Down syndrome with Alzheimers disease brains have increased iron and associated lipid peroxidation consistent with ferroptosis</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Cerebral microbleeds (MB) are associated with sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Down Syndrome with AD (DSAD). Higher MB iron may cause iron mediated lipid peroxidation. We hypothesize that amyloid deposition is linked to MB iron and that amyloid precursor protein (APP) triplication increases iron load and lipid peroxidation. METHODS: Prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of cognitively normal (CTL), AD and DSAD ApoE3,3 carriers were examined for proteins that mediated iron metabolism, antioxidant response, and amyloid processing in lipid rafts. RESULTS: Iron was 2-fold higher in DSAD than CTL and AD. Iron storage proteins and lipid peroxidation were increased in prefrontal cortex, but not in the cerebellum. The glutathione synthesis protein GCLM was decreased by 50% in both AD and DSAD. Activity of lipid raft GPx4, responsible for membrane repair, was decreased by at least 30% in AD and DSAD. DISCUSSION: DSAD shows greater lipid peroxidation than AD consistent with greater MBs and iron load.

">Noradrenaline and Acetylcholine shape Functional Connectivity organization of NREM substages: an empirical and simulation study</a></h4>

              
                Sleep onset is characterized by a departure from arousal, and can be separated into well-differentiated stages: NREM (which encompasses three substages: N1, N2 and N3) and REM (Rapid Eye Movement). Awake brain dynamics are maintained by various wake-promoting mechanisms, particularly the neuromodulators Acetylcholine (ACh) and Noradrenaline (NA), whose levels naturally decrease during the transition to sleep. The combined influence of these neurotransmitters on brain connectivity during sleep remains unclear, as previous models have examined them mostly in isolation or only in deep sleep. In this study, we employ a Whole Brain model to investigate how changes in brain neurochemistry during NREM sleep, specifically involving ACh and NA, affect the Functional Connectivity (FC) of the brain. Using a Wilson-Cowan whole brain model informed by an empirical connectome and a heterogeneous receptivity map of neuromodulators, we explore these dynamics. Initial FC analysis reveals distinct connectivity changes: a decrease in Locus Coeruleus (LC) connectivity with the cortex during N2 and N3, and a decrease in Basal Forebrain (BF) connectivity with the cortex during N3. Additionally, compared to Wakefulness (W), there is a transition to a more integrated state in N1 and a more segregated state in N3. We adjust the coupling and input-output slope of the Whole Brain model for ACh and NA, based on BF or LC priors, to show that region-specific neurotransmitter distribution is key to explaining their effects on FC. This work enhances our understanding of neurotransmitters' roles in modulating sleep stages and their significant contribution to brain state transitions between different states of consciousness, both in health and disease.

">Ubiquitin Proteasome System Components, RAD23A and USP13, Modulate TDP-43 Solubility and Neuronal Toxicity</a></h4>

              
                At autopsy, >95% of ALS cases display a redistribution of the essential RNA binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus into cytoplasmic aggregates. The mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43 is believed to be a key pathological driver in ALS. Due to its vital role in basic cellular mechanisms, direct depletion of TDP-43 is unlikely to lead to a promising therapy. Therefore, we have explored the utility of identifying modifier genes that modify its mislocalization or aggregation. We have previously shown that loss of rad-23 improves locomotor deficits in TDP-43 C. elegans models of disease and increases the degradation rate of TDP-43 in cellular models. To understand the mechanism through which these protective effects occur, we generated an inducible mutant TDP-43 HEK293 cell line. We find that knockdown of RAD23A reduces insoluble TDP-43 levels in this model and primary rat cortical neurons expressing human TDP-43A315T. Utilizing a discovery-based proteomics approach, we then explored how loss of RAD23A remodels the proteome. Through this proteomic screen, we identified USP13, a deubiquitinase, as a new potent modifier of TDP-43 induced aggregation and cytotoxicity. We find that knockdown of USP13 reduces the abundance of sarkosyl insoluble mTDP-43 in both our HEK293 model and primary rat neurons, reduces cell death in primary rat motor neurons, and improves locomotor deficits in C. elegans ALS models.

">Homeostasis After Injury: How Intertwined Inference and Control Underpin Post-Injury Pain and Behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Injuries are an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life, leading to an evolutionary mandate for powerful homeostatic processes of recovery and recuperation. The physiological responses of the body and the immune system must be coordinated with behaviour to allow protected time for this to happen and to prevent further damage to the affected bodily parts. Reacting appropriately requires an internal control system that represents the nature and state of the injury and specifies and withholds actions accordingly. We bring the formal uncertainties embodied in this system into the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We discuss nociceptive phenomena in light of this analysis, noting particularly the paradoxical behaviours associated with injury investigation, and the propensity for transitions from normative, tonic, to pathological, chronic, pain states. Importantly, these simulation results provide a quantitative account and enable us to sketch a much-needed roadmap for future theoretical and experimental studies on injury, tonic pain, and transition to chronic pain. Ultimately, we seek novel ways to target chronic pain.

">Successive failure triggered by motor exploration in a reinforcement-based reaching task</a></h4>

              
                Motor exploration, a key process in reinforcement-based motor learning, is triggered by suboptimal performance and leads to increased movement variability. Consequently, failure in one trial may increase the likelihood of failure in subsequent trials. If this pattern emerges, successive failures (SFs) are not merely events to be avoided but part of the trial-and-error process of identifying optimal movements, which can facilitate motor learning. This study investigated whether and how SFs occur above chance levels during a motor learning task with binary success/failure feedback and explored the relationship between SFs and motor learning outcomes. Thirty-three healthy young adults participated in the study, performing a reaching task to pass through a target without visual feedback of their hand position. Binary feedback was provided after each trial, indicating whether the hand trajectory overlapped with the target. The results showed that the probability of two SFs was significantly higher than the square of the overall failure probability, indicating that failure streaks occurred above chance levels. A computational model, in which motor variability comprised constant motor noise and exploratory variability regulated by recent reward history (where variability increased following failure), successfully explained SF emergence. However, the learning index, defined as the difference in failure probability between the first and latter halves of the experiment, was unrelated to SF emergence. Additionally, failure streaks disappeared when participants were asked to reach one of seven randomly selected targets in each trial, suggesting that introducing environmental variability can help alleviate SFs.

                The motile planula larva of the reef-building coral Acropora millepora exhibits a distinct scotophobic response characterized by full-body contraction and ciliary arrest when exposed to abrupt light dimming. Through behavioural assays, we confirmed reductions in larval swimming speed and alterations in vertical and horizontal movement patterns under alternating light and dark conditions. High-speed microscopic imaging revealed that ciliary activity ceases upon light dimming, while the body contracts into a rounded shape, influencing swimming behaviour. These responses suggest an adaptive mechanism for maintaining optimal positioning within the highly structured and complex light environment of reef habitats, critical for coral recruitment and survival.

                Electrical stimulation of the human brain has emerged as a powerful therapeutic modality, enabling the alteration of neural circuits underlying cognition and behavior. Recent evidence indicates that stimulation's effects on physiology and behavior depend on endogenous variation in brain state, as measured by field-potential recordings. Here, we describe a 60-channel brain-computer interface -- the Smart Neurostimulation System (SNS) -- that combines closed-loop analysis of spectral features of the field potential with multi-channel stimulation capabilities. We demonstrate system functionality via bench tests and from an in vivo ovine study exercising a subset of the device's functionality. Our ovine study shows that the SNS can reliably measure neural correlates of behavior (motion) and the physiological effects of stimulation. We demonstrate the safety of stimulation via histology following a 120-day stimulation study.

">Neural responses in early, but not late, visual cortex are well predicted by random-weight CNNs with sufficient model complexity</a></h4>

              
                Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were inspired by the organization of the primate visual system, and in turn have become effective models of the visual cortex, allowing for accurate predictions of neural stimulus responses. While training CNNs on brain-relevant object-recognition tasks may be an important pre-requisite to predict brain activity, the CNN's brain-like architecture alone may already allow for accurate prediction of neural activity. Here, we evaluated the performance of both task-optimized and brain-optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in predicting neural responses across visual cortex, and performed systematic architectural manipulations and comparisons between trained and untrained feature extractors to reveal key structural components influencing model performance. For human and monkey area V1, random-weight CNNs employing the ReLU activation function, combined with either average or max pooling, significantly outperformed other activation functions. Random-weight CNNs matched their trained counterparts in predicting V1 responses. The extent to which V1 responses can be predicted correlated strongly with the neural network's complexity, which reflects the non-linearity of neural activation functions and pooling operations. However, this correlation between encoding performance and complexity was significantly weaker for higher visual areas that are classically associated with object recognition, such as monkey IT. To test whether this difference between visual areas reflects functional differences, we trained neural network models on both texture discrimination and object recognition tasks. %, and analyzed the relationship between model complexity and task performance. Consistent with our hypothesis, model complexity correlated more strongly with performance on texture discrimination than object recognition. Our findings indicate that random-weight CNNs with sufficient model complexity allow for comparable prediction of V1 activity as trained CNNs, while higher visual areas require precise weight configurations acquired through training via gradient descent.

">Striatal and cerebellar interactions during reward-based motor performance</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed motor performance relies on the brain's ability to distinguish between actions that lead to successful and unsuccessful outcomes. The basal ganglia (BG) and cerebellum (CBL) are integral to processing performance outcomes, yet their functional interactions remain underexplored. This study scanned participants' brains with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) while they performed a skilled motor task for monetary rewards, where outcomes depended on their motor performance and also probabilistic events that were not contingent on their performance. We found successful motor outcomes increased activity in the ventral striatum (VS), a functional sub-region of the BG, whereas unsuccessful motor outcomes engaged the CBL. In contrast, for probabilistic outcomes unrelated to motor performance, the BG and CBL exhibited no differences in activity between successful and unsuccessful outcomes. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that VS-to-CBL connectivity was inhibitory following successful motor outcomes, suggesting that the VS may suppress CBL error processing for correct actions. Conversely, CBL-to-VS connectivity was inhibitory after unsuccessful motor outcomes, potentially preventing reinforcement of erroneous actions. Additionally, interindividual differences in task preference, assessed by having participants choose between performing the motor task or flipping a coin for monetary rewards, were related to inhibitory VS-CBL connectivity but not activity within the VS or CBL directly. These findings highlight a performance-mediated functional network between the VS and CBL, modulated by motivation and subjective preferences, supporting goal-directed behavior.

">Serial Dependence Predicts Generalization in Perceptual Learning</a></h4>

              
                Recent visual experiences systematically bias current perceptual reports, a phenomenon known as serial dependence. This study examines how serial dependence interacts with perceptual learning, specifically focusing on its role in learning generalization. We reanalyzed data from 50 observers who practiced the texture discrimination task (TDT) under three conditions designed to modulate learning generalization: consistent target location, alternating two target locations, and mixed with targetless trials (Harris et al., 2012); over 200,000 trials. Our analysis revealed substantial report biases toward the orientation of targets from previous trials, extending up to 10 trials back, much longer than previously reported. These biases, when accumulated across consistent trial sequences, nearly overshadowed responses to the current target. Remarkably, although TDT thresholds improved by 40% over the 8 days of training, the biases persisted despite the randomization of target orientations, with trial history being irrelevant to the current trial. The effect was most pronounced when current targets had low visibility, prior targets were highly visible, and prior targets appeared at the same location as the current target. Training conditions that facilitated learning generalization exhibited stronger and longer serial dependence effects from distant trial histories compared to conditions promoting specific learning. Across observers, stronger serial dependence from distant history was associated with greater learning transfer, suggesting that distant memory traces are essential for efficient learning. We propose that these extended memory traces integrate information across multiple trials to create a generalized learning template, preventing overfitting to specific stimuli thus enhancing learning transfer. In contrast, strong adaptation in the consistent target location condition disrupts these traces, thereby limiting generalization.

Neurons in these structures and adjacent structures also respond to spatial dimensions of self-motion such as running velocity (Carstensen et al., 2021; Robinson et al., 2024). Data and modeling suggest that these responses could be essential for guiding behaviors such as barrier avoidance and goal finding (Erdem and Hasselmo, 2012; 2014). However, these findings still leave the unanswered question: What are the features and what are the coordinate systems of these features that drive these egocentric neural responses? Here we present models of the potential circuit mechanisms generating egocentric responses in RSC. These can be generated based on coding of internal representations of barriers in head-centered coordinates of distance and angle that are transformed based on current running velocity for trajectory planning and obstacle avoidance. This hypothesis is compared with an alternate potentially complementary hypothesis that neurons in the same regions might respond to retinotopic position of features at the top, bottom or edges of walls as a precursor to head-centered coordinates. Alternate hypotheses include the forward scanning of trajectories (ray tracing) to test for collision with barriers, or the comparison of optic flow on different sides of the animal. These hypotheses generate complementary modeling predictions about how changes in environmental parameters could alter the neural responses of egocentric boundary cells that are presented here.

">Atypical plume-like events drive glutamate accumulation in metabolic stress conditions</a></h4>

              
                Neural glutamate homeostasis plays a key role in health and disease. In ischemic conditions, such as stroke, this homeostasis is severely disrupted since energy depletion and ion imbalances lead to more glutamate release and less uptake. We here used the fluorescent glutamate sensor SF iGluSnFR(A184V) to probe the effects of chemical ischemia on extracellular glutamate dynamics in situ, using organotypic slice cultures from mouse cortex. SF iGluSnFR imaging reported spontaneous glutamate release events, which indicate synchronous network activity, similar to calcium signals detected with GCaMP6f. In addition, glutamate imaging revealed local, asynchronous release events, which were atypically large and long-lasting and showed plume-like characteristics. Under baseline conditions plumes occurred with low frequency, were independent of network activity, and persisted in the presence of TTX. Plume induction was strongly favored by blocking glutamate uptake with TFB-TBOA, whereas blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) suppressed plumes. Upon inducing chemical ischemia plumes became more pronounced and overly abundant, which resulted in large-scale accumulation of extracellular glutamate. Similar plumes were recently also observed in models of cortical spreading depression and migraine. We therefore propose that plumes represent a more general phenomenon induced by glutamate uptake dysfunction, which may contribute to glutamate-related excitotoxicity in various neurodegenerative and neurological disorders.

">Novel neurofilament light (Nefl) E397K mouse models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2E (CMT2E) present early and chronic axonal neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most common hereditary peripheral neuropathy with an incidence of 1:2,500. CMT2 clinical symptoms include distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, toe and foot deformities, with some patients presenting with reduced nerve conduction velocity. Mutations in the neurofilament light chain (NEFL) gene result in a specific form of CMT2 disease, CMT2E. NEFL encodes the protein, NF-L, one of the core intermediate filament proteins that contribute to the maintenance and stability of the axonal cytoskeleton. To better understand the underlying biology of CMT2E disease and advance the development of therapeutics, we generated a Nefl+/E397K mouse model. While the Nefl+/E397K mutation is inherited in a dominant manner, we also characterized NeflE397K/E397K mice to determine whether disease onset, progression or severity would be impacted. Consistent with CMT2E, lifespan was not altered in these novel mouse models. A longitudinal electrophysiology study demonstrated significant in vivo functional abnormalities as early as P21 in distal latency, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and negative area. A significant reduction in the sciatic nerve axon area, diameter, and G-ratio was also present as early as P21. Evidence of axon sprouting was observed with disease progression. Through the twelve months measured, disease became more evident in all assessments. Collectively, these results demonstrate an early and robust in vivo electrophysiological phenotype and axonal pathology, making Nefl+/E397K and NeflE397K/E397K mice ideal for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches.

">Dose-dependent changes in global brain activity and functional connectivity following exposure to psilocybin: a BOLD MRI study in awake rats.</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin is a hallucinogen with complex neurobiological and behavioral effects. This is the first study to use MRI to follow functional changes in brain activity in response to different doses of psilocybin in fully awake, drug naive rats. Female and male rats were given IP injections of vehicle or psilocybin in doses of 0.03 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 3.0 mg/kg while fully awake during the imaging session. Changes in BOLD signal were recorded over a 20 min window. Data for resting state functional connectivity were collected approximately 35 min post injection All data were registered to rat 3D MRI atlas with 173 brain regions providing site-specific changes in global brain activity and changes in functional connectivity. Treatment with psilocybin resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in positive BOLD signal. The areas most affected by the acute presentation of psilocybin were the somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. Females were significantly more sensitive to the 0.3 mg/kg dose of psilocybin than males. There was a significant dose-dependent global increase in functional connectivity, highlighted by hyperconnectivity to the cerebellum. Brain areas hypothesized to be involved in loss of sensory filtering and organization of sensory motor stimuli such as the claustrum and the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortical loop were all affected by psilocybin in a dose-dependent manner. Indeed, the general neuroanatomical circuitry associated with the psychedelic experience was affected but the direction of the BOLD signal and pattern of activity between neural networks was inconsistent with the human literature.

">Peri-somatic modulation of diffracted light and its variation with consciousness</a></h4>

              
                Existing noninvasive neurophysiological recording methods can acquire neuronal correlates of consciousness, but they do not differentiate between conscious and unconscious states mechanistically. Here we describe a method that detects a new physical effect of apparent neural origin in the peri-somatic space that might allow such differentiation. This effect is a slow decrease in the intensity of diffracted low power laser light emitted within a photoelectronic device placed close to the body of an awake subject. It is markedly attenuated by general anesthesia in mice and unconsciousness in patients. Its direction is reversed when the device is exposed to live invertebrates or to the decapitated head of a euthanized mouse. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized biophysical phenomenon that appears to be related to consciousness.

">Sex-biased zinc responses modulate ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and social defects in Cttnbp2 mutant mice</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions influenced by genetic mutations, dietary factors, and sex-specific mechanisms, yet the interplay of these factors remains elusive. Here, we investigate the sex-biased responses of mutant mice carrying an ASD-associated mutation in Cttnbp2 to dietary zinc supplementation using behavioral assays, proteomic and bioinformatic analyses, and puromycin pulse labeling to assess protein synthesis. Our results demonstrate that zinc supplementation enhances ribosome biogenesis and increases the density and size of dendritic spines in male Cttnbp2 mutant mice, alleviating male-biased social deficits. Analyses of neuronal cultures further revealed that neurons, not astrocytes, respond to zinc to enhance protein synthesis. In contrast, female Cttnbp2 mutants exhibit resilience to differential zinc intake, even under zinc deprivation. Elevated mTOR phosphorylation and increased protein levels of translational initiation factors in female brains may provide a protective mechanism, reducing their sensitivity to zinc deficiency. Cttnbp2 mutations heighten male vulnerability to zinc deprivation, impairing social behaviors. These findings highlight zinc-regulated ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis as critical mediators of sex-specific ASD phenotypes, offering new insights into dietary interventions.

">Loss of white matter tracts and persistent microglial activation in the chronic phase of ischemic stroke in female rats and the effect of miR-20a-3p treatment</a></h4>

              
                Our previous studies showed that intravenous injections of the small non-coding RNA mir-20a-3p is neuroprotective for stroke in the acute phase and attenuates long-term cognitive impairment in middle-aged female rats. In this study, we evaluated postmortem brain pathology at 100+d after stroke in a set of behaviorally characterized animals. This included Sham (no stroke) controls or stroke animals that received either mir20a-3p at 4h, 24h and 70d iv post stroke (MCAo+mir20a-3p) or a scrambled oligo (MCAo+Scr). Brain volumetric features were analyzed with T2 weighted and Diffusion Tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by histological analysis. Principal component analysis of Fractional Anisotropy (FA)-diffusion tensor MRI measures showed that MCAo+Scr and MCAo+mir20a-3p groups differed significantly in the volume of white matter but not gray matter. Weil myelin-stained sections confirmed decreased volume of the corpus callosum, internal capsule and the anterior commissure in the ischemic hemisphere of MCAo+Scr animals compared to the non-ischemic hemisphere, while sham and MCAo+Mir-20a-3p showed no hemispheric asymmetries. The MCAo+Scr group also exhibited asymmetry in hemisphere and lateral ventricle volumes, with ventricular enlargement in the ischemic hemisphere as compared to the non-ischemic hemisphere. The numbers of microglia were significantly elevated in white matter tracts in the MCAo+Scr group, with a trend towards increased myelin phagocytic microglia in these tracts. Regression analysis indicated that performance on an episodic memory test (novel object recognition test; NORT) was associated with decreased white matter volume and increased microglial numbers. These data support the hypothesis that stroke-induced cognitive impairment is accompanied by white matter attrition and persistent microglial activation and is consistent with reports that cognitive deterioration resulting from vascular diseases, such as stroke, is associated with secondary neurodegeneration in regions distal from the initial infarction.

">Population-level morphological analysis of paired CO2- and odor-sensing olfactory neurons in D. melanogaster via volume electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic morphology is a defining characteristic of neuronal subtypes. In Drosophila, heterotypic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing different receptors display diverse dendritic morphologies, but whether such diversity exists among homotypic ORNs remains unclear. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy on cryofixed tissues, we analyzed the majority of CO2-sensing neurons (ab1C) and their odor-sensing neighbors (ab1D) in the D. melanogaster antenna. Surprisingly, ab1C neurons featured flattened, sheet-like dendrites, distinct from the cylindrical branches typical of odor-sensing neurons, and displayed remarkable diversity, ranging from plain sheets to tube-like structures that enclose several neighboring dendrites, forming dendrite-within-dendrite structures. Similarly, ab1D dendrites varied from simple, unbranched forms to numerously branched morphologies. These findings suggest that morphological heterogeneity is common even among homotypic ORNs, potentially expanding their functional adaptability and ranges of sensory physiological properties.

">Topological Analysis of Macaca mulatta's Cortical Structures Through the Lens of Poincare Duality</a></h4>

              
                Poincare duality from algebraic topology describes how shapes and spaces interrelate across different dimensions, linking structures of one scale to complementary structures at another. This suggests that densely packed neurons in certain brain areas may correspond to broader connectivity patterns, balancing local processing with global communication. Applying this framework to cortical histological images of Macaca mulatta, we analysed neuronal clustering, connectivity graphs and intensity distributions to identify self-dual structural patterns and reveal the contribution of local organization to large-scale network activity. Using image processing techniques such as contrast enhancement, edge detection and graph-theoretic modeling, we examined how dense neuron clusters correspond to functionally sparse regions and vice versa. We found that high-density neuronal zones form closed-loop topological structures that correspond to homology cycles, while sparser areas function as large-scale integrators, aligning with cohomology properties. Local connectivity hubs in neuron-dense regions support regional specialization, while large-scale, sparser areas, though less connected, facilitate global communication by acting as pathways for long-range integration. Graph-theoretic analysis of connectivity patterns confirmed a reciprocal relationship between clustering coefficients and global centrality. Statistical analysis using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests revealed conserved topological distributions across different cortical regions, supporting the hypothesis that cortical connectivity maintains structural invariance under local perturbations. These findings provide insights into the mathematical principles governing brain architecture, suggesting that topological methods can enhance our understanding of cortical function. Future research may extend these approaches to higher-dimensional embeddings, network theory in primate brains, functional neuroimaging, human disease modeling and artificial intelligence.

                There has been a long-term need for a low-cost, highly efficient, and high-fidelity epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) suitable for home-cage monitoring of small-animal models of epilepsy. We show an accessible, scalable, highly space and energy-efficient EMU capable of fulfilling chronic, continuous synchronized multiple animal monitoring jobs. Each rig within the EMU can provide 16-channel high-fidelity, DC-sensitive biopotential recordings, head acceleration monitoring, synchronized voltammetry applications, and video recording on one freely moving rat. We present the overall EMU architecture design and subsystem details in each recording rig. We demonstrate long-term continuous in vivo recordings of spontaneous seizure and seizure-associated spreading depolarization (SD) from freely moving rats prepared under the tetanus toxin model of temporal lobe epilepsy.

">Neuro-behavioral impact of Tourette-related striatal disinhibition in rats</a></h4>

              
                Tourette syndrome has been linked to reduced GABAergic inhibition, so called neural disinhibition, in the dorsal striatum. Dorsal-striatal neural disinhibition in animal models, caused by local microinfusion of GABA-A-receptor antagonists, produces striatal local field potential (LFP) spike-wave discharges and tic-like movements resembling motor tics. Here, we characterized further the neuro-behavioral impact of striatal disinhibition, by unilateral picrotoxin infusion into the anterior dorsal striatum, in adult male Lister hooded rats. In vivo electrophysiology under anesthesia revealed enhanced neuronal burst firing in the striatum, alongside spike-wave LFP discharges. In freely moving rats, striatal picrotoxin reliably induced tic-like movements, which mainly involved lifting of the contralateral forelimb and concomitant rotational movements of head and torso, as well as occasional rotations of the whole body around its long axis. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response was not affected, but startle reactivity tended to be reduced. Both locomotor and non-ambulatory movements, measured in photo-beam cages, were increased. Our findings suggest that, apart from generating tic- like movements, dorsal striatal disinhibition may contribute to hyperactivity, which is often comorbid with Tourette syndrome. Enhanced striatal burst firing may be important for these behavioral effects. Our findings do not support that striatal disinhibition contributes to PPI disruption, which has been associated with Tourette syndrome and suggested to contribute to tic generation.

">Phenotypic and Functional Alterations in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell-Derived Microglia in a Primate Model of Chronic Alcohol Consumption</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol-induced dysregulation of microglial activity is associated with neuroinflammation, cognitive decline, heightened risk for neurodegenerative diseases, alcohol dependence, and escalation of alcohol drinking. Given the challenge of longitudinally sampling primary microglia, we optimized an in vitro method to differentiate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from non-human primates (NHP) into microglia-like cells (induced-microglia; iMGL). The iMGLs displayed transcriptional profiles distinct from those of monocyte progenitors and closely resembling those of primary microglia. Notably, morphological features showed that differentiated iMGLs derived from NHPs with chronic alcohol consumption (CAC) possessed a more mature-like microglial morphology. Additionally, dysregulation in key inflammatory and regulatory markers alongside increased baseline phagocytic activity was observed in CAC-derived IMGLs in the resting state. Phenotypic and functional assessments following LPS stimulation indicated the presence of an immune-tolerant phenotype and enrichment of a CD86+ hyper-inflammatory subpopulation in iMGLs derived from ethanol-exposed animals. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that in vitro differentiation of PBMC offers a minimally invasive approach to studying the impact of CAC on microglial function revealing that CAC reshapes both functional and transcriptional profiles of microglia

">Cerebral blood perfusion across biological systems and the human lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Blood perfusion delivers oxygen and nutrients to all cells, making it a fundamental feature of brain organization. How cerebral blood perfusion maps onto micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain structure and function is therefore a key question in neuroscience. Here we analyze pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) data from 1,305 healthy individuals in the HCP Lifespan studies (5-100 years) to reconstruct a high-resolution normative cerebral blood perfusion map. At the cellular and molecular level, cerebral blood perfusion co-localizes with granular layer IV, biological pathways for maintenance of cellular relaxation potential and mitochondrial organization, and with neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors involved in vasomodulation. At the regional level, blood perfusion aligns with cortical arealization and is greatest in regions with high metabolic demand and resting-state functional hubs. Looking across individuals, blood perfusion is dynamic throughout the lifespan, follows micro-architectural changes in development, and maps onto individual differences in physiological changes in aging. In addition, we find that cortical atrophy in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (late-onset Alzheimer's disease, TDP-43C, and dementia with Lewy bodies) is most pronounced in regions with lower perfusion, highlighting the utility of perfusion topography as an indicator of transdiagnostic vulnerability. Finally, we show that ASL-derived perfusion can be used to delineate arterial territories in a data-driven manner, providing insights into how the vascular system is linked to human brain function. Collectively, this work highlights how cerebral blood perfusion is central to, and interlinked with, multiple structural and functional systems in the brain.

">Spatiotemporal Patterns Differentiate Hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripples from Interictal Epileptiform Discharges in Mice and Humans</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) are high-frequency oscillations critical for memory consolidation in mammals. Despite extensive characterization in rodents, their application as biomarkers to track and treat memory dysfunction in humans is limited by coarse spatial sampling, interference from interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), and lack of consensus on human SPW-R localization and morphology. We demonstrate that mouse and human hippocampal ripples share spatial, spectral and temporal features, which are clearly distinct from IEDs. In 1024-channel hippocampal recordings from APP/PS1 mice, SPW-Rs were distinguishable from IEDs by their narrow localization to the CA1 pyramidal layer, narrowband frequency peaks, and multiple ripple cycles on the unfiltered local field potential. In epilepsy patients, ripples showed similar narrowband frequency peaks and visible ripple cycles in CA1 and the subiculum but were absent in the dentate gyrus. Conversely, IEDs showed a broad spatial extent and wide-band frequency power. We introduce a semi-automated, human ripple detection toolbox ('ripmap') selecting optimal detection channels and separating event waveforms by low-dimensional embedding. Our approach improves ripple detection accuracy, providing a firm foundation for future human memory research.

">Protein Synthesis Blockade Prevents Fear Memory Reactivation via Inhibition of Engram Synapse Strengthening</a></h4>

              
                Memory relies on ensembles of engram cells in the brain. While previous studies have established the existence of these cells, the relationship between cellular and synaptic activity remains unclear. To address this, we applied the dual e-GRASP technique in mice to examine synaptic connectivity between the ventral CA1 and the basal amygdala during memory formation. We found that contextual fear conditioning increased engram-to-engram synapse (engram synapse) density and induced structural potentiation, highlighting their importance in associative memory. Additionally, we investigated the role of protein synthesis in memory formation by inducing retrograde amnesia using anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Single anisomycin-injected mice (1xANI) showed impaired natural recall but still displayed fear responses upon optogenetic reactivation of engram cells. In contrast, mice that received four anisomycin injections over six hours (4xANI) showed significantly impaired natural recall and failed to exhibit fear responses upon optogenetic reactivation. This behavioural phenotype was correlated with synaptic changes as 1xANI mice exhibited no significant reduction in engram synapse density but had significantly smaller spine size while 4xANI mice showed both significant reduction in engram synapse density and spine size. Our result indicate that protein synthesis inhibition significantly changes engram synapse density and spine size which correlatively affect fear memory natural recall and artificial reactivation.

">Differentiating unirradiated mice from those exposed to conventional or FLASH radiotherapy using MRI</a></h4>

              
                Background and purpose: The FLASH effect expands the therapeutic ratio of tumor control to normal tissue toxicity observed after delivery of ultra-high (>100 Gy/s FLASH-RT) vs. conventional dose rate radiation (CONV-RT). In this first exploratory study, we assessed whether ex-vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) could reveal long-term differences after FLASH-RT and CONV-RT whole-brain irradiation. Materials and methods: Female C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups: control (non-irradiated), conventional (CONV-RT 0.1 Gy/s), and ultra-high dose rates (FLASH-RT 1 pulse, 5.5 x 10^6 Gy/s), and received 10 Gy of whole-brain irradiation in a single fraction at 10 weeks of age. Mice were evaluated by Novel Object Recognition cognitive testing at 10 months post-irradiation and were sampled at 13 months post-irradiation. Ex-vivo brains were imaged with a 14.1 Tesla/26 cm magnet with a multimodal MRI protocol, including T2-weighted TurboRare (T2W) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences. Results: In accordance with previous results, cognitive tests indicated that animals receiving CONV-RT exhibited a decline in cognitive function, while FLASH-RT performed similarly to the controls. MRI showed decreased hippocampal mean intensity in the CONV-RT mice compared to controls but not in the FLASH-RT group. Comparing CONV-RT to control, we found significant changes in multiple whole-brain diffusion metrics, including the mean Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and Mean Apparent Propagator (MAP) metrics. By contrast, no significant diffusion changes were found between the FLASH-RT and control groups. In an exploratory analysis compared to controls, regional diffusion metrics were primarily altered in the basal forebrain and the insular cortex after CONV-RT, and after FLASH-RT, a trend reduction was also observed. Conclusion: This study presents initial evidence that MRI can uncover clear changes in the brain after CONV-RT but not after FLASH-RT. The MRI results aligned with the observed cognitive protection after FLASH-RT, indicating the potential use of MRI to analyze the FLASH response.

">The effects of reliable social feedback on language learning: insights from EEG and pupillometry</a></h4>

              
                Language learning is often a social process, and social feedback may play a motivational role. We examined the neurophysiological correlates of word learning with feedback varying in reliability and social content. Participants associated novel auditory words with objects and received social (video clips) or symbolic (static images) feedback. In a forced-choice task, participants learned to associate novel auditory words with known objects and received feedback that was either Social Reliable (correct), Social Unreliable (random), or Symbolic Reliable (correct). Post-training behavioral performance was better for words learned with social and symbolic reliable feedback. Stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and late positive complex (LPC) ERP amplitudes, as well as pupil dilation, showed differences as a function of feedback reliability and social content. In the reliable conditions, before feedback, SPN amplitude grew as learning progressed, likely due to the expectation of receiving positive feedback. During feedback, LPC amplitude for positive feedback diminished as learning progressed but not for negative feedback, which was likely consistently used for context updating. These effects were not observed for unreliable feedback, probably because its value was not used for updating information. Pupillometry results corroborated these findings, showing greater dilation for negative vs positive feedback in reliable conditions. Finally, when feedback was social, processing was associated with more frontal activation and behavioral performance was closely correlated with both ERP and pupillometry results. Overall, our findings show differential processing of feedback depending on its informational and social content, advancing our understanding of how social and cognitive processes interact to shape word learning.

">Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling through Müller glia regulates neuroprotection and the accumulation of immune cells in the rodent retina</a></h4>

              
                The purpose of this study was to investigate how Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling regulates glial phenotype, neuroprotection, and reprogramming of Muller glia (MG) into neurogenic MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in the adult mouse retina. We found that S1P-related genes were dynamically regulated following retinal damage. S1pr1 (encoding S1P receptor 1) and Sphk1 (encoding sphingosine kinase 1) are expressed at low levels by resting MG and are rapidly upregulated following acute damage. Overexpression of the neurogenic bHLH transcription factor Ascl1 in MG downregulates S1pr1, and inhibition of Sphk1 and S1pr1/3 enhances Ascl1-driven differentiation of bipolar-like cells and suppresses glial differentiation. Treatments that activate S1pr1 or increase retinal levels of S1P initiate pro-inflammatory NF{kappa}B-signaling in MG, whereas treatments that inhibit S1pr1 or decreased levels of S1P suppress NF{kappa}B-signaling in MG in damaged retinas. Conditional knock-out of NF{kappa}B-signaling in MG increases glial expression of S1pr1 but decreases levels of S1pr3 and Sphk1. Conditional knock-out (cKO) of S1pr1 in MG, but not Sphk1, enhances the accumulation of immune cells in acutely damaged retinas. cKO of S1pr1 is neuroprotective to ganglion cells, whereas cKO of Sphk1 is neuroprotective to amacrine cells in NMDA-damaged retinas. Consistent with these findings, pharmacological treatments that inhibit S1P receptors or inhibit Sphk1 had protective effects upon inner retinal neurons. We conclude that the S1P-signaling pathway is activated in MG after damage and this pathway acts secondarily to restrict the accumulation of immune cells, impairs neuron survival and suppresses the reprogramming of MG into neurogenic progenitors in the adult mouse retina.

">The role of human intraparietal sulcus in evidence accumulation revealed by EEG and model-informed fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Sequential sampling models propose that the repeated sampling of sensory information is a fundamental component of perceptual decision-making. Electroencephalographic investigations in humans have demonstrated motor-independent representations of evidence accumulation, but such observations have seldom been made in neuroimaging studies exploring the neuroanatomical origins of evidence accumulation. Here, we aimed to reveal the neuroanatomical locus of sensory evidence accumulation in the human brain by regressing an electrophysiological marker of evidence accumulation (centroparietal positivity, CPP) against changes in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal during perceptual decision-making. Our cross-modal imaging approach revealed a cluster within left intraparietal sulcus (IPS), located within putative lateral intraparietal area (region hIP3), for which BOLD signals scaled in relation to the slope of the CPP. Furthermore, the drift rate parameter of a drift diffusion model parametrically modulated BOLD activity within an overlapping region of left IPS. In contrast, parametric modulation by reaction time revealed a distributed fronto-parietal network, demonstrating the utility of our approach for isolating a discrete neuroanatomical locus of evidence accumulation. Together, our findings provide strong support for intraparietal sulcus involvement in the accumulation of sensory evidence during human perceptual decision-making.

">Modular architecture confers robustness to damage and facilitates recovery in spiking neural networks modeling in vitro neurons</a></h4>

              
                Impaired brain function is restored following injury through dynamic processes that involve synaptic plasticity. This restoration is supported by the brains inherent modular organization, which promotes functional separation and redundancy. However, it remains unclear how the modular structure interacts with synaptic plasticity, most notably in the form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), to define the damage response and recovery efficiency. In this work, we numerically modeled the response and recovery to damage of a neuronal network in vitro bearing a modular structure. Consistent with the in vitro observations, the in silico numerical model effectively captured the decline and subsequent recovery of spontaneous activity following the injury. We revealed that the modular structure confers robustness to injury, minimizes the decrease in neuronal activity, and promotes recovery via STDP. Finally, using the reservoir computing framework, we show that information representation in the neuronal network improves with the recovery of synchronous activity. Our work provides an experimental-numerical platform for predicting recovery in damaged neuronal networks and may help developing effective models for brain injury.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Non-response to initial treatment options for major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common clinical challenge with profound deleterious impacts for affected patients. Few treatments have received regulatory approval for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: A systematic search of United States and European Union clinical trials registries was conducted to identify Phase II, III, or IV clinical trials, with a last update posted on or after 1 January 2020, that were evaluating medications for TRD. For both the US and EU registries, the condition term &amp;amp;ldquo;treatment resistant depression&amp;amp;rdquo; and associated lower-level terms (per registry search protocol) were used. For the US registry, a secondary search using the condition term &amp;amp;ldquo;depressive disorders&amp;amp;rdquo; and the modifying term &amp;amp;ldquo;inadequate&amp;amp;rdquo; was also performed to capture registrations not tagged as TRD. Two additional searches were also conducted in the US registry for the terms &amp;amp;ldquo;suicide&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;anhedonia&amp;amp;rdquo; as transdiagnostic targets of investigational medications. Trials were categorized based on the primary mechanism of action of the trial&amp;amp;rsquo;s investigational medication. Results: Fifty clinical trials for TRD, 20 for anhedonia, and 25 for suicide were identified. Glutamate system modulation was the mechanism currently with the most compounds in development, including antagonists and allosteric modulators of NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, metabotropic type 2/3 glutamate receptors, and intracellular effector molecules downstream of glutamate signaling. Psychedelics have seen the greatest surge among mechanistic targets in the past 5 years, however, with psilocybin in particular garnering significant attention. Other mechanisms included GABA modulators, monoamine modulators, anti-inflammatory/immune-modulating agents, and an orexin type 2 receptor antagonist. Conclusions: These investigations offer substantial promise for more efficacious and potentially personalized medication approaches for TRD. Challenges for detecting efficacy in TRD include the heterogeneity within the TRD population stemming from the presumed variety of biological dysfunctions underlying the disorder, comorbid disorders, chronic psychosocial stressors, and enduring effects of prior serotonergic antidepressant medication treatments.</p>

	<p>Background: Posterior cervical fusion (PCF) is widely used for cervical spinal cord decompression with/without fusion. In our hybrid operating room, intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) is routinely used to verify screw placement. This study analyzed clinical and radiological outcomes after PCF and evaluated iCT benefits for detecting screw misplacement. Methods: Nineteen patients underwent PCF between March 2012 and April 2016 for degenerative (n = 6), neoplastic (n = 7), and traumatic (n = 6) conditions. Seven patients had primary PCF, while twelve underwent PCF following anterior fusion due to segmental instability with cervical malalignment (n = 11) or tumor progression (n = 1). Results: The mean patient age was 59 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11 years, with 63% male patients. The median follow-up was 21 months. PCF averaged 4.74 segments (range: 1&amp;amp;ndash;9). At follow-up, 79% reported pain improvement and normal sensorimotor function. Of six patients with preoperative paresis, five showed improved muscle strength. No persistent gait disturbances occurred. Complications requiring revision occurred in four patients (21%): three surgical site infections and one cerebrospinal fluid leak. One perioperative death occurred (5%). iCT detected incorrect screw placement in seven patients (36%), allowing the immediate repositioning of eight screws, preventing later revision surgeries. The overall fusion rate was 92%. Conclusions: PCF with iCT is safe and effective for various cervical spine pathologies, yielding good long-term clinical outcomes. iCT effectively detects and enables immediate correction of screw malposition, reducing revision surgery needs. This imaging modality demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for identifying clinically relevant screw malpositions.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is recognized as the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally, with its incidence rate projected to increase alongside ongoing population growth. However, the precise etiology of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease remains elusive. This article explores the inflammatory mechanisms linking gut microbiota to Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, emphasizing alterations in gut microbiota and their metabolites that influence the disease&amp;amp;rsquo;s progression through the bidirectional transmission of inflammatory signals along the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. Building on this mechanistic framework, this article further discusses research methodologies and treatment strategies focused on gut microbiota metabolites, including metabolomics detection techniques, animal model investigations, and therapeutic approaches such as dietary interventions, probiotic treatments, and fecal transplantation. Ultimately, this article aims to elucidate the relationship between gut microbiota metabolites and the inflammatory mechanisms underlying Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, thereby paving the way for novel avenues in the research and treatment of this condition.</p>
