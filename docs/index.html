Increasingly, ignitions are controlled by human activities either through suppression of wildfires or intentional ignition of prescribed fires. The southeastern United States leads the nation in prescribed fire, burning ca. 80% of the country’s extent annually. The COVID-19 pandemic...

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Reduced Dopamine Signaling Impacts Pyramidal Neuron Excitability in Mouse Motor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Dopaminergic modulation is essential for the control of voluntary movement; however, the role of dopamine in regulating the neural excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) is not well understood. Here, we investigated two modes by which dopamine influences the input/output function of M1 neurons. To test the direct regulation of M1 neurons by dopamine, we performed whole-cell recordings of excitatory neurons and measured excitability before and after local, acute dopamine receptor blockade. We then determined whether chronic depletion of dopaminergic input to the entire motor circuit, via a mouse model of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, was sufficient to shift M1 neuron excitability. We show that D1 receptor (D1R) and D2R antagonism altered subthreshold and suprathreshold properties of M1 pyramidal neurons in a layer-specific fashion. The effects of D1R antagonism were primarily driven by changes to intrinsic properties, while the excitability shifts following D2R antagonism relied on synaptic transmission. In contrast, chronic depletion of dopamine to the motor circuit with 6-hydroxydopamine induced layer-specific synaptic transmission-dependent shifts in M1 neuron excitability that only partially overlapped with the effects of acute D1R antagonism. These results suggest that while acute and chronic changes in dopamine modulate the input/output function of M1 neurons, the mechanisms engaged are distinct depending on the duration and origin of the manipulation. Our study highlights the broad influence of dopamine on M1 excitability by demonstrating the consequences of local and global dopamine depletion on neuronal input/output function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Discrete mechanical model of lamellipodial actin network implements molecular clutch mechanism and generates arcs and microspikes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David M. Rutkowski, Dimitrios Vavylonis</p>

Mechanical forces, actin filament turnover, and adhesion to the extracellular environment regulate lamellipodial protrusions. Computational and mathematical models at the continuum level have been used to investigate the molecular clutch mechanism, calculating the stress profile through the lamellipodium and around focal adhesions. However, the forces and deformations of individual actin filaments have not been considered while interactions between actin networks and actin bundles is not easily accounted with such methods. We develop a filament-level model of a lamellipodial actin network undergoing retrograde flow using 3D Brownian dynamics. Retrograde flow is promoted in simulations by pushing forces from the leading edge (due to actin polymerization), pulling forces (due to molecular motors), and opposed by viscous drag in cytoplasm and focal adhesions. Simulated networks have densities similar to measurements in prior electron micrographs. Connectivity between individual actin segments is maintained by permanent and dynamic crosslinkers. Remodeling of the network occurs via the addition of single actin filaments near the leading edge and via filament bond severing. We investigated how several parameters affect the stress distribution, network deformation and retrograde flow speed. The model captures the decrease in retrograde flow upon increase of focal adhesion strength. The stress profile changes from compression to extension across the leading edge, with regions of filament bending around focal adhesions. The model reproduces the observed reduction in retrograde flow speed upon exposure to cytochalasin D, which halts actin polymerization. Changes in crosslinker concentration and dynamics, as well as in the orientation pattern of newly added filaments demonstrate the model’s ability to generate bundles of filaments perpendicular (actin arcs) or parallel (microspikes) to the protruding direction.

                <p>by Daniel Cresta, Donald C. Warren, Christian Quirouette, Amanda P. Smith, Lindey C. Lane, Amber M. Smith, Catherine A. A. Beauchemin</p>

The endpoint dilution assay’s output, the 50% infectious dose (ID<sub>50</sub>), is calculated using the Reed-Muench or Spearman-Kärber mathematical approximations, which are biased and often miscalculated. We introduce a replacement for the ID<sub>50</sub> that we call Specific INfection (SIN) along with a free and open-source web-application, midSIN (https://midsin.physics.ryerson.ca) to calculate it. midSIN computes a virus sample’s SIN concentration using Bayesian inference based on the results of a standard endpoint dilution assay, and requires no changes to current experimental protocols. We analyzed influenza and respiratory syncytial virus samples using midSIN and demonstrated that the SIN/mL reliably corresponds to the number of infections a sample will cause per mL. It can therefore be used directly to achieve a desired multiplicity of infection, similarly to how plaque or focus forming units (PFU, FFU) are used. midSIN’s estimates are shown to be more accurate and robust than the Reed-Muench and Spearman-Kärber approximations. The impact of endpoint dilution plate design choices (dilution factor, replicates per dilution) on measurement accuracy is also explored. The simplicity of SIN as a measure and the greater accuracy provided by midSIN make them an easy and superior replacement for the TCID<sub>50</sub> and other <i>in vitro</i> culture ID<sub>50</sub> measures. We hope to see their universal adoption to measure the infectivity of virus samples.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Factors affecting aerosol SARS-CoV-2 transmission via HVAC systems; a modeling study</a></h4>

The role of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. To address this gap, we simulated the release of SARS-CoV-2 in a multistory office building and three social gathering settings (bar/restaurant, nightclub, wedding venue) using a well-mixed, multi-zone building model similar to those used by Wells, Riley, and others. We varied key factors of HVAC systems, such as the Air Changes Per Hour rate (ACH), Fraction of Outside Air (FOA), and Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values (MERV) to examine their effect on viral transmission, and additionally simulated the protective effects of in-unit ultraviolet light decontamination (UVC) and separate in-room air filtration. In all building types, increasing the ACH reduced simulated infections, and the effects were seen even with low aerosol emission rates. However, the benefits of increasing the fraction of outside air and filter efficiency rating were greatest when the aerosol emission rate was high. UVC filtration improved the performance of typical HVAC systems. In-room filtration in an office setting similarly reduced overall infections but worked better when placed in every room. Overall, we found little evidence that HVAC systems facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission; most infections in the simulated office occurred near the emission source, with some infections in individuals temporarily visiting the release zone. HVAC systems only increased infections in one scenario involving a marginal increase in airflow in a poorly ventilated space, which slightly increased the likelihood of transmission outside the release zone. We found that improving air circulation rates, increasing filter MERV rating, increasing the fraction of outside air, and applying UVC radiation and in-room filtration may reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission indoors. However, these mitigation measures are unlikely to provide a protective benefit unless SARS-CoV-2 aerosol emission rates are high (>1,000 Plaque-forming units (PFU) / min).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for switching from face-to-face to remote conference: An opportunity to estimate the reduction in GHG emissions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Valentin Guignon, Catherine Breton, Jérôme Mariette, François Sabot, Julien Fumey, Vincent Lefort, Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier</p>

In 2020, the world faced the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that drastically altered people’s lives. Since then, many countries have been forced to suspend public gatherings, leading to many conference cancellations, postponements, or reorganizations. Switching from a face-to-face to a remote conference became inevitable and the ultimate solution to sustain scientific exchanges at the national and the international levels. The same year, as a committee, we were in charge of organizing the major French annual conference that covers all computational biology areas: The “Journées Ouvertes en Biologie, Informatique et Mathématiques<i>”</i> (JOBIM). Despite the health crisis, we succeeded in changing the conference format from face to face to remote in a very short amount of time. Here, we propose 10 simple rules based on this experience to modify a conference format in an optimized and cost-effective way. In addition to the suggested rules, we decided to emphasize an unexpected benefit of this situation: a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to travel for scientific conference attendance. We believe that even once the SARS-CoV-2 crisis is over, we collectively will have an opportunity to think about the way we approach such scientific events over the longer term.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Universally valid reduction of multiscale stochastic biochemical systems using simple non-elementary propensities</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yun Min Song, Hyukpyo Hong, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Biochemical systems consist of numerous elementary reactions governed by the law of mass action. However, experimentally characterizing all the elementary reactions is nearly impossible. Thus, over a century, their deterministic models that typically contain rapid reversible bindings have been simplified with non-elementary reaction functions (e.g., Michaelis-Menten and Morrison equations). Although the non-elementary reaction functions are derived by applying the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) to deterministic systems, they have also been widely used to derive propensities for stochastic simulations due to computational efficiency and simplicity. However, the validity condition for this heuristic approach has not been identified even for the reversible binding between molecules, such as protein-DNA, enzyme-substrate, and receptor-ligand, which is the basis for living cells. Here, we find that the non-elementary propensities based on the deterministic total QSSA can accurately capture the stochastic dynamics of the reversible binding in general. However, serious errors occur when reactant molecules with similar levels tightly bind, unlike deterministic systems. In that case, the non-elementary propensities distort the stochastic dynamics of a bistable switch in the cell cycle and an oscillator in the circadian clock. Accordingly, we derive alternative non-elementary propensities with the stochastic low-state QSSA, developed in this study. This provides a universally valid framework for simplifying multiscale stochastic biochemical systems with rapid reversible bindings, critical for efficient stochastic simulations of cell signaling and gene regulation. To facilitate the framework, we provide a user-friendly open-source computational package, ASSISTER, that automatically performs the present framework.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Network potential identifies therapeutic miRNA cocktails in Ewing sarcoma</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Davis T. Weaver, Kathleen I. Pishas, Drew Williamson, Jessica Scarborough, Stephen L. Lessnick, Andrew Dhawan, Jacob G. Scott</p>

MicroRNA (miRNA)-based therapies are an emerging class of targeted therapeutics with many potential applications. Ewing Sarcoma patients could benefit dramatically from personalized miRNA therapy due to inter-patient heterogeneity and a lack of druggable (to this point) targets. However, because of the broad effects miRNAs may have on different cells and tissues, trials of miRNA therapies have struggled due to severe toxicity and unanticipated immune response. In order to overcome this hurdle, a network science-based approach is well-equipped to evaluate and identify miRNA candidates and combinations of candidates for the repression of key oncogenic targets while avoiding repression of essential housekeeping genes. We first characterized 6 Ewing sarcoma cell lines using mRNA sequencing. We then estimated a measure of tumor state, which we term network potential, based on both the mRNA gene expression and the underlying protein-protein interaction network in the tumor. Next, we ranked mRNA targets based on their contribution to network potential. We then identified miRNAs and combinations of miRNAs that preferentially act to repress mRNA targets with the greatest influence on network potential. Our analysis identified TRIM25, APP, ELAV1, RNF4, and HNRNPL as ideal mRNA targets for Ewing sarcoma therapy. Using predicted miRNA-mRNA target mappings, we identified miR-3613-3p, let-7a-3p, miR-300, miR-424-5p, and let-7b-3p as candidate optimal miRNAs for preferential repression of these targets. Ultimately, our work, as exemplified in the case of Ewing sarcoma, describes a novel pipeline by which personalized miRNA cocktails can be designed to maximally perturb gene networks contributing to cancer progression.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Detection of CYP2C19*2_ allele among Helicobacter pylori -infected patients in two tertiary hospitals of Khartoum, Sudan, 2019 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: CYP2C19*2 has been identified as the most common allelic variant of CYP2C19 affecting the response to Proton pump inhibitors (PPI). This study aims to detect CYP2C19*2 allele in H. pylori-infected Sudanese population, owing its probable effect on H. pylori eradication. Methods: Antral biopsies was collected from 30 patients attending endoscopy units. Extraction of DNA was performed through QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit. Samples were screened for Urease C (UreC) gene of H. pylori using conventional PCR. Detection of CYP2C19*2 was performed in positive H. pylori samples using Real time-PCR. Results: The mean age of patients was 40.7 (±20.2 SE). Positive samples for UreC were 24 (80%) samples. Among them, four samples (16.6%) were found positive for CYP2C19*2 allele presence. Gender was found to be statistically associated with the presence of the allele (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study illustrates that CYP2C19*2 is of modest prevalence among H. pylori-infected Sudanese population. The determination of genotypic and allelic frequencies of CYP2C19 gene among different populations will provide data to be used to personalize treatment according to individual genetic profile, and minimize the possible adverse side effects of CYP2C19 substrates.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Project PaThWay: protocol for a school-based health promotion intervention for prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) behavioral risk factors [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their behavioral risk factors (tobacco use, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol) among children and adolescents have garnered paramount importance under the Sustainable Development Goals. Methods: Project PaThWay is a school-based, two years, multi-component intervention to prevent key behavioral NCD risk factors among school-going children (classes 6-8th; 10-14 years) from private and public schools across two Indian cities (Pune and Bengaluru). We assessed the baseline knowledge, attitude, and behavior related to NCD risk factors (unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco use) of the participating students through a survey. The intervention was developed and designed for implementation by the trained teachers and similar-age peers, as facilitators. The teachers and peer leaders were trained through organising school-level orientation workshops for implementation of intervention activities, after baseline assessment. Year 1 of the intervention focuses on the knowledge and learnings and year 2 on enhancing the life-skills (leadership, communication, refusal, health advocacy, etc.). Regular monitoring visits by the project team to ensure intervention activities are being carried out as planned and providing continuous support. The end line evaluation will be done after the completion of two years’ intervention to evaluate the effectiveness of the Project PaThWay intervention. Outcome measures will include improved knowledge, positive attitude, improve behaviors related to diet, physical activity, and tobacco use, and enhanced skills in handling NCD risk factors. A process evaluation will explore several aspects of Project PaTHWay intervention (fidelity, dosage, reach, adaptations), social validity (acceptability, feasibility, utility). Conclusion: Project PaTHWay, having a multiple-component intervention, may offer the best chance for success, as it addresses multiple risk factors using multi-pronged strategies. The agents of intervention implementation are trained teachers and similar-age student peer leaders (as facilitators), one of the successful and effective approaches in school-based interventions globally and in India.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of ingestion of red dragon fruit extract on levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase after strenuous exercise in rats (Rattus norvegicus) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prolonged activation of skeletal muscles causes a decrease in the production of fatigue. Exercise with strenuous intensity causes an increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). An increase in free radicals causes oxidative stress resulting in damage to cell function to mitochondrial dysfunction, and fatigue. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant potential of red dragon fruit (RDF) to delay fatigue due to oxidative stress, which improves cell function in mitochondria. Methods: 25 male rats (Rattus norvegicus) aged three months were divided into five groups: Group K1 was N.A. (No Activity) but drinking and eating; Group K2 performed strenuous exercise without RDF treatment; Groups 3, 4, and 5 (P1, P2 and P3, respectively) performed strenuous exercise and were treated with 75 mg kg-1.bw, 150 mg kg-1.bw, and 300 mg kg-1.bw of RDF extract, respectively. The exercise for the rats involved intense swimming for 20 minutes every day, four days a week for 31 days.  Malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured with the ELISA and histopathology for muscle soleus and lung tissue. Results: Strenuous exercise followed by RDF extract ingestion was compared for fatigue in terms of duration and time; before (24.55±1.38 minute) and after (95.31±7.82 minute) and led to a significant difference of 39% (p<0.01). The study also compared MDA before and after RDF extract ingestion in the K2 vs. the P1 group (p<0.05). At the same time, P2 differed more significantly (p<0.01). This indicated a spread of free radicals and featured histopathological damage of muscle cells. However, ingestion of RDF extract leads to improvement of soleus muscle cells; thus, repairs cell function, delaying fatigue. Conclusion: This study confirmed that strenuous exercise, which causes an increase in ROS, intensifies free radicals with RDF extract ingestion and declines oxidative stress, repairing cell function and delaying fatigue.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">NMDA receptor modulation and severe acute respiratory syndrome treatment [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors is expressed in the human lungs and central nervous system.  NMDA receptor potentiation could increase calcium ion influx and promote downstream signaling mechanisms associated with cellular contractions that are disrupted in severe acute respiratory syndrome. Pharmacological effects generated by triggering glutamate receptor function in the brain, coupled with concurrent stimulation of the respiratory tract, may produce a synergetic effect, improving the airway smooth muscle function. A novel multipronged intervention to simultaneously potentiate NMDA receptors expressed both in the central nervous system and airway muscles would be helpful for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome that deteriorates peripheral and central nervous system function before causing death in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Distribution of imposter syndrome among medical students of Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Imposter syndrome (IS), suffering from self-doubt and fear, despite clear accomplishment and competencies, is often detected in medical students and adversely affects the well-being of the student. This study aimed at assessing the prevalence of IS among public and private medical students in Bangladesh. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional design among medical students in Bangladesh. Data were collected between February to July 2020 through snowball sampling technique across medical colleges in Bangladesh. Relative risk ratios (RRRs) with 95% CI were calculated to investigate the magnitude of association between imposter syndrome exposure and explanatory variables. Results: A total of 500 students participated in this study with approximately 47% and 53% of students studying at public and private medical colleges, respectively. Around 32% of medical students were exposed to IS (47% of public and 53% of private medical college students). Medical students were the most significantly associated with IS for third (RR: 1.487, CI: 1.068-2.071) and fourth-year students (RR: 1.493, CI: 1.043-2.136). Overall, we found that respondents aged 22 to 25 were 3.6% (RR:1.036, CI:0.801-1.339) more likely to be suffering from IS than their younger counterparts. Conclusion: Third and fourth-year medical students, in particular, require more care than others; teachers and authorities should provide them with proper guidance and care, encourage them, and thus grow their self-reliance and confidence.

                Orofacial pain represents a challenge for dentists, especially if with a non-odontogenic basis. Orofacial neuropathic pain is chronic, arduous to localize and develops without obvious pathology. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, coexist and negatively affect the condition. This article presents one case of atypical odontalgia and one of trigeminal neuralgia treated with psychological and psychopharmacologic tailored and adapted therapies, after conventional medications had failed.  In addition, an overview of the pathologies related to the challenging differential diagnosis in orofacial pain is given, since current data are insufficient.   A 68-year-old male complained of chronic throbbing, burning pain in a maxillary tooth, worsening upon digital pressure. Symptoms did not abate after conventional amitriptyline therapy; psychological intervention and antianxiety drug were supplemented and antidepressant agent dosage incremented; the patient revealed improvement and satisfaction with the multidisciplinary approach to his pathology. A 72-year-old male lamented chronic stabbing, intermittent, sharp, shooting and electric shock-like pain in an upper tooth, radiating and following the distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Pain did not recur after psychological intervention and a prescription of antidepressant and antianxiety agents, while conventional carbamazepine therapy had not been sufficient to control pain. Due to concern with comorbid psychiatric disorders, we adopted a patient-centered, tailored and balanced therapy, favourably changing the clinical outcome.  Comorbid psychiatric disorders have a negative impact on orofacial pain and dentists should consider adopting tailored therapies, such as psychological counselling and behavioural and psychopharmacologic strategies, besides conventional treatments. They also need to be familiar with the signs and symptoms of orofacial pain, recollecting a comprehensive view of the pathologies concerning the differential diagnosis. A prompt diagnosis prevents pain chronicity, avoiding an increase in complexity and a shift to orofacial neuropathic pain and legal claims.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The relationship between umbilical–portal–systemic venous shunt and outcome in 11 fetuses [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: To investigate the relationship between congenital umbilical–portal–systemic venous shunt (UPSVs) and fetal outcome. Methods: The ultrasonographic and genetic characteristics of 11 cases of UPSVS were retrospectively analyzed and followed up to postnatal. Results: Four cases of ductus venosus -- systemic shunt (DVSS), one case of extrahepatic portal -- systemic shunt (EHPSS), and one case of umbilical systemic shunt (USS) combined with intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (IHPSS), six cases of intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (IHPSS) were observed. chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 9.1% (1/11), other ultrasonic abnormalities in 54.5% (6/11), cardiothoracic ratio increase in 45.5% (5/11), fetal growth restriction in 36.4% (4/11), edema was in 9.1% (1/11) and live birth was in 72.7% (8/11). Conclusion: The incidence of IHPSS is the highest and the outcome is the best. Shunt of DVSS and IHPSS can be closed spontaneously after birth. When the prenatal diagnosis is congenital UPSVs, chromosomal abnormalities and other ultrasonic abnormalities should be required further examination, and the growth and development of the fetus should be closely monitored.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pancreatic cancer grading in pathological images using deep learning convolutional neural networks [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. The cancer grades define how aggressively the cancer will spread and give indication for doctors to make proper prognosis and treatment. The current method of pancreatic cancer grading, by means of manual examination of the cancerous tissue following a biopsy, is time consuming and often results in misdiagnosis and thus incorrect treatment. This paper presents an automated grading system for pancreatic cancer from pathology images developed by comparing deep learning models on two different pathological stains. Methods: A transfer-learning technique was adopted by testing the method on 14 different ImageNet pre-trained models. The models were fine-tuned to be trained with our dataset. Results: From the experiment, DenseNet models appeared to be the best at classifying the validation set with up to 95.61% accuracy in grading pancreatic cancer despite the small sample set. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in grading pancreatic cancer based on pathology images. Previous works have either focused only on detection (benign or malignant), or on radiology images (computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] etc.). The proposed system can be very useful to pathologists in facilitating an automated or semi-automated cancer grading system, which can address the problems found in manual grading.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Synchronous online learning during movement control order in higher education institutions: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Higher education institutions (HEI) are not spared from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The closure of campuses because of the movement control order (MCO) to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 has forced HEIs to adopt online learning, especially synchronous online learning (SOL). Although teaching and learning can be continued via SOL, retaining students’ interest and sustaining their engagement have not been sufficiently explored. This study presents a systematic review of the research pertaining to SOL associated with students’ interest and engagement in HEIs during the MCO environment. Methods: Five major online databases, i.e., EBSCOhost, Science Direct, Emerald, Scopus and Springer were searched to collect relevant papers published between 1st January 2010 to 15th June 2021 including conference proceedings, peer-reviewed papers and dissertations. Papers written in the English language, based in full-fledged universities, and with these five keywords: (i) synchronous online learning, (ii) engagement, (iii) interest, (iv) MCO/Covid-19 and (v) HEI, were included. Papers focussing on synchronous and asynchronous online learning in schools and colleges were excluded. Each paper was reviewed by two reviewers in order to confirm the eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: We found 31 papers of which six papers were related to SOL, engagement and interest in HEIs in the MCO environment. Our review presents three major findings: (i) limited research has been conducted on SOL associated with students’ engagement and interest, (ii) studies related to the context of HEIs in the MCO environment are limited, and (iii) the understanding of the new phenomena through qualitative research is insufficient. We highlight the SOL alignment with students’ engagement, interest, style preference, learner interaction effectiveness, behavior and academic performance. Conclusions: We believe that the findings of this study are timely and require attention from the research community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Digital taxation to promote frugal innovation in institutions of higher learning: a three-decade systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), digital taxation emerged as a tool for accelerating the economic growth of a nation. While Industry 4.0 focuses on enabling real-time decision-making with sophisticated technology to enhance productivity, digital taxation can serve as an important tool for improving business sustainability. Institutions of higher learning (IHL), which aim to design an IR 4.0 educational ecosystem, can embrace digital taxation, as they face various challenges with different resources. The literature indicates that frugal innovation through digital taxation in institutions of higher learning, can solve emerging resource challenges. Method: We present a systematic review of studies on digital taxation to promote frugal innovation published in the past three decades (1991 to 2021). We obtained a total of 21 papers from a ‘digital taxation’ keyword search, 10 of which were related to digital taxation. However, the 10 papers were not related to frugal innovation. Result: We present two major findings. Firstly, research on digital taxation for frugal innovation is scant. Secondly, challenges exist in digital taxation implementation, which requires further attention. Conclusion: We conclude this review with a recommendation for the conceptual framework, to highlight potential research warranting the attention of the research community.

                The 22nd annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2021, open-bio.org/events/bosc-2021/) was held online as a track of the 2021 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology / European Conference on Computational Biology (ISMB/ECCB) conference. Launched in 2000 and held every year since, BOSC is the premier meeting covering topics related to open source software and open science in bioinformatics. In 2020, BOSC partnered with the Galaxy Community Conference to form the Bioinformatics Community Conference (BCC2020); that was the first BOSC to be held online. This year, BOSC returned to its roots as part of ISMB/ECCB 2021. As in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic made it impossible to hold the conference in person, so ISMB/ECCB 2021 took place as an online meeting attended by over 2000 people from 79 countries. Nearly 200 people participated in BOSC sessions, which included 27 talks reviewed and selected from submitted abstracts, and three invited keynote talks representing a range of global perspectives on the role of open science and open source in driving research and inclusivity in the biosciences, one of which was presented in French with English subtitles.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prediction of the Effects of Synonymous Variants on SARS-CoV-2 Genome [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to a global pandemic since December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, which mutates at a higher rate. Multiple studies had been done to identify and study nonsynonymous mutations, which change amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. On the other hand, there is little study on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 synonymous mutations. Although these mutations do not alter amino acids, some studies suggest that they may affect viral fitness. This study aims to predict the effect of synonymous mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome.   Methods: A total of 30,229 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were retrieved from Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID) database and aligned using MAFFT. Then, the mutations and their respective frequency were identified. A prediction of RNA secondary structures and their base pair probabilities was performed to study the effect of synonymous mutations on RNA structure and stability. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis was also performed to measure the codon usage bias (CUB) of SARS-CoV-2.  Results: A total of 150 synonymous mutations were identified. The synonymous mutation identified with the highest frequency is C3037U mutation in the nsp3 of ORF1a, followed by C313U and C9286U mutation in nsp1 and nsp4 of ORF1a, respectively.   Conclusion: Among the synonymous mutations identified, C913U mutation in ORF1a and C26735U in membrane (M) protein may affect RNA secondary structure, reducing the stability of RNA folding and possibly resulting in a higher translation rate. However, lab experiments are required to validate the results obtained from prediction analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pneumococcal carriage and antibiotic susceptibility patterns in mother-baby pairs in a rural community in Eastern Uganda: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pneumococcal carriage predisposes children to pneumonia. Pneumonia poses a significant threat to the lives of children below five years old worldwide, contributing to a high number of hospitalizations and death. Morbidity and morbidity are especially common in children under five and the elderly, although any age group can be affected. This study aimed to estimate pneumococcal carriage and determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the pneumococci isolated from mother-baby pairs in Ngora district after the rollout of the pneumococcal vaccine. We hypothesized that high carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in mothers leads to carriage in their babies and hence a greater chance of contracting pneumonia. Methods: Consecutive sampling was used to select 152 mother-baby pairs from community visits and those seeking care at the health facility. We collected nasal swabs from both baby and mother for culture and sensitivity testing using Kirby-Bauer’s agar disc diffusion method. Results: This study found that there was a low prevalence of pneumococcal carriage in the mother-baby pair in the Ngora district. We also observed high rates of microbial resistance to penicillin, which is the first-line drug for the management of pneumonia in Uganda. Conclusions: The relationship between pneumococcal carriage and immunization status suggests that the pneumococcal vaccine is protective against the pneumococcal carriage. Resistance of S. pneumoniae to commonly used antibiotics was high.

                Autopsy and imaging studies have demonstrated a typical pattern of tau progression in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), spreading to previously unaffected regions in an anatomical sequence of ‘Braak’ stages. In a recent study, Pascoal et al. provide evidence that microgliosis colocalizes with tau in a Braak-like pattern, furthering the notion that microglial activation is strongly related to the propagation of tangle pathology.

                Chelaru et al. demonstrate that while pairwise interactions between visual cortical neurons capture the spiking patterns across multiple brain states, explaining the population dynamics in executive areas involves higher-order interactions. These results help elucidate the extent to which the multi-neuronal firing patterns in cortical populations can be predicted by interneuronal interactions.

                An early-warning model to predict in-hospital mortality on admission of COVID-19 patients at an emergency department (ED) was developed and validate using a Machine-Learning model. In total, 2782 patients were enrolled between March 2020 and December 2020, including 2106 patients (first wave) and 676 patients (second wave) in the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The first-wave patients were divided into two groups with 1474 patients used to train the model, and 632 to validate it. The 676 patients in the second wave were used to test the model. Age, 17 blood analytes and Brescia chest X-ray score were the variables processed using a Random Forests classification algorithm to build and validate the model. ROC analysis was used to assess the model performances. A web-based death-risk calculator was implemented and integrated within the Laboratory Information System of the hospital. The final score was constructed by age (the most powerful predictor), blood analytes (the strongest predictors were lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, Lymphocyte %, Ferritin std and Monocyte %), and Brescia chest X-ray score. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve obtained for the three groups (training, validating and testing) were 0.98, 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. The model predicts in-hospital mortality on the basis of data that can be obtained in a short time, directly at the ED on admission. It functions as a web-based calculator, providing a risk score which is easy to interpret. It can be used in the triage process to support the decision on patient allocation.

                Elucidating how synaptic molecules such as AMPA receptors mediate neuronal communication and tracking their dynamic expression during behavior is crucial to understand cognition and disease, but current technological barriers preclude large-scale exploration of molecular dynamics in vivo. We have developed a suite of innovative methodologies that break through these barriers: a new knockin mouse line with fluorescently tagged endogenous AMPA receptors, two-photon imaging of hundreds of thousands of labeled synapses in behaving mice, and computer-vision-based automatic synapse detection. Using these tools, we can longitudinally track how the strength of populations of synapses changes during behavior. We used this approach to generate an unprecedentedly detailed spatiotemporal map of synapses undergoing changes in strength following sensory experience. More generally, these tools can be used as an optical probe capable of measuring functional synapse strength across entire brain areas during any behavioral paradigm, describing complex system-wide changes with molecular precision.

                The sharing of research data is essential to ensure reproducibility and maximize the impact of public investments in scientific research.  Here we describe OpenNeuro, a BRAIN Initiative data archive that provides the ability to openly share data from a broad range of brain imaging data types following the FAIR principles for data sharing. We highlight the importance of the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard for enabling effective curation, sharing, and reuse of data. The archive presently shares more than 600 datasets including data from more than 20,000 participants, comprising multiple species and measurement modalities and a broad range of phenotypes. The impact of the shared data is evident in a growing number of published reuses, currently totalling more than 150 publications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal sequences during theta rely on behavior-dependent spatial maps</a></h4>

              
                Navigation through space involves learning and representing relationships between past, current and future locations. In mammals, this might rely on the hippocampal theta phase code, where in each cycle of the theta oscillation, spatial representations provided by neuronal sequences start behind the animal's true location and then sweep forward. However, the exact relationship between theta phase, represented position and true location remains unclear and even paradoxical. Here, we formalize previous notions of 'spatial' or 'temporal' theta sweeps that have appeared in the literature. We analyze single-cell and population variables in unit recordings from rat CA1 place cells and compare them to model simulations based on each of these schemes. We show that neither spatial nor temporal sweeps quantitatively accounts for how all relevant variables change with running speed. To reconcile these schemes with our observations, we introduce 'behavior-dependent' sweeps, in which theta sweep length and place field properties, such as size and phase precession, vary across the environment depending on the running speed characteristic of each location. These behavior-dependent spatial maps provide a structured heterogeneity that is essential for understanding the hippocampal code.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pathogenic LRRK2 control of primary cilia and Hedgehog signaling in neurons and astrocytes of mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Activating LRRK2 mutations cause Parkinson's disease, and pathogenic LRRK2 kinase interferes with ciliogenesis. Previously, we showed that cholinergic interneurons of the dorsal striatum lose their cilia in R1441C LRRK2 mutant mice (Dhekne et al., 2018). Here, we show that cilia loss is seen as early as 10 weeks of age in these mice and also in two other mouse strains carrying the most common human G2019S LRRK2 mutation. Loss of the PPM1H phosphatase that is specific for LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab GTPases yields the same cilia loss phenotype seen in mice expressing pathogenic LRRK2 kinase, strongly supporting a connection between Rab GTPase phosphorylation and cilia loss.  Moreover, astrocytes throughout the striatum show a ciliation defect in all LRRK2 and PPM1H mutant models examined. Hedgehog signaling requires cilia, and loss of cilia in LRRK2 mutant rodents correlates with dysregulation of Hedgehog signaling as monitored by in situ hybridization of <i>Gli1 </i>and <i>Gdnf </i>transcripts. Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra secrete a Hedgehog signal that is sensed in the striatum to trigger neuroprotection; our data support a model in which LRRK2 and PPM1H mutant mice show altered responses to critical Hedgehog signals in the nigrostriatal pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Susceptibility rhythm to bacterial endotoxin in myeloid clock-knockout mice</a></h4>

              
                Local circadian clocks are active in most cells of our body. However, their impact on circadian physiology is still under debate. Mortality by endotoxic (LPS) shock is highly time-of-day dependent and local circadian immune function such as the cytokine burst after LPS challenge has been assumed to be causal for the large differences in survival. Here, we investigate the roles of light and myeloid clocks on mortality by endotoxic shock. Strikingly, mice in constant darkness (DD) show a three-fold increased susceptibility to LPS as compared to mice in light-dark conditions. Mortality by endotoxic shock as a function of circadian time is independent of light-dark cycles as well as myeloid CLOCK or BMAL1 as demonstrated in conditional knockout mice. Unexpectedly, despite the lack of a myeloid clock these mice still show rhythmic patterns of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF,α MCP-1, IL-18 and IL-10 in peripheral blood as well as time-of-day and site dependent traffc of myeloid cells. We speculate that systemic time-cues are sufficient to orchestrate innate immune response to LPS by driving immune functions such as cell traffcking and cytokine expression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Relationships between community composition, productivity and invasion resistance in semi-natural bacterial microcosms</a></h4>

              
                Common garden experiments that inoculate a standardised growth medium with synthetic microbial communities (i.e. constructed from individual isolates or using dilution cultures) suggest that the ability of the community to resist invasions by additional microbial taxa can be predicted by the overall community productivity (broadly defined as cumulative cell density and/or growth rate). However, to the best of our knowledge, no common garden study has yet investigated the relationship between microbial community composition and invasion resistance in microcosms whose compositional differences reflect natural, rather than laboratory-designed, variation. We conducted experimental invasions of two bacterial strains (<i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> and <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>) into laboratory microcosms inoculated with 680 different mixtures of bacteria derived from naturally occurring microbial communities collected in the field. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterise microcosm starting composition, and high-throughput assays of community phenotypes including productivity and invader survival, we determined that productivity is a key predictor of invasion resistance in natural microbial communities, substantially mediating the effect of composition on invasion resistance. The results suggest that similar general principles govern invasion in artificial and natural communities, and that factors affecting resident community productivity should be a focal point for future microbial invasion experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PP2A/B55α substrate recruitment as defined by the retinoblastoma-related protein p107</a></h4>

              
                Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translation modification essential in cell signaling. This study addresses a long-standing question as to how the most abundant serine/threonine Protein Phosphatase 2 (PP2A) holoenzyme, PP2A/B55α, specifically recognizes substrates and presents them to the enzyme active site. Here, we show how the PP2A regulatory subunit B55α recruits p107, a pRB-related tumor suppressor and B55α substrate. Using molecular and cellular approaches, we identified a conserved region 1 (R1, residues 615-626) encompassing the strongest p107 binding site. This enabled us to identify an 'HxRVxxV<sub>619-625</sub>' short linear motif (SLiM) in p107 as necessary for B55α binding and dephosphorylation of the proximal pSer-615 <i>in vitro</i> and in cells. Numerous B55α/PP2A substrates, including TAU, contain a related SLiM C-terminal from a proximal phosphosite, 'p[ST]-P-x(4,10)-[RK]-V-x-x-[VI]-R'. Mutation of conserved SLiM residues in TAU dramatically inhibits dephosphorylation by PP2A/B55α, validating its generality. A data-guided computational model details the interaction of residues from the conserved p107 SLiM, the B55α groove, and phosphosite presentation. Altogether these data provide key insights into PP2A/B55α mechanisms of substrate recruitment and active site engagement, and also facilitate identification and validation of new substrates, a key step towards understanding PP2A/B55α role in multiple cellular processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Collagen polarization promotes epithelial elongation by stimulating locoregional cell proliferation</a></h4>

              
                Epithelial networks are commonly generated by processes where multicellular aggregates elongate and branch. Here we focus on understanding cellular mechanisms for elongation, using an organotypic culture system as a model of mammary epithelial anlage. Isotropic cell aggregates broke symmetry and slowly elongated when transplanted into collagen 1 gels. The elongating regions of aggregates displayed enhanced cell proliferation that was necessary for elongation to occur. Strikingly, this loco-regional increase in cell proliferation occurred where collagen 1 fibrils reorganized into bundles which were polarized with the elongating aggregates. Applying external stretch as a cell-independent way to reorganize the ECM, we found that collagen polarization stimulated regional cell proliferation to precipitate symmetry-breaking and elongation. This required b1-integrin and ERK signaling. We propose that collagen polarization supports epithelial anlagen elongation by stimulating loco-regional cell proliferation. This could provide a long-lasting structural memory of the initial axis that is generated when anlage break symmetry.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Excitatory and inhibitory receptors utilize distinct post- and trans-synaptic mechanisms in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors at postsynapses mediate fast synaptic transmission upon binding of the neurotransmitter. Post- and trans-synaptic mechanisms through cytosolic, membrane, and secreted proteins have been proposed to localize neurotransmitter receptors at postsynapses. However, it remains unknown which mechanism is crucial to maintain neurotransmitter receptors at postsynapses. In this study, we ablated excitatory or inhibitory neurons in adult mouse brains in a cell-autonomous manner. Unexpectedly, we found that excitatory AMPA receptors remain at the postsynaptic density upon ablation of excitatory presynaptic terminals. In contrast, inhibitory GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors required inhibitory presynaptic terminals for their postsynaptic localization. Consistent with this finding, ectopic expression at excitatory presynapses of neurexin 3alpha, a putative trans-synaptic interactor with the native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex, could recruit GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to contacted postsynaptic sites. These results establish distinct mechanisms for the maintenance of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic receptors in the mature mammalian brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cell and circuit origins of fast network oscillations in the mammalian main olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Neural synchrony generates fast network oscillations throughout the brain, including the main olfactory bulb (MOB), the first processing station of the olfactory system. Identifying the mechanisms synchronizing neurons in the MOB will be key to understanding how network oscillations support the coding of a high-dimensional sensory space. Here, using paired recordings and optogenetic activation of glomerular sensory inputs in MOB slices, we uncovered profound differences in principal mitral cell (MC) vs. tufted cell (TC) spike-time synchrony: TCs robustly synchronized  across fast- and slow-gamma frequencies, while MC synchrony was weaker and concentrated in slow-gamma frequencies. Synchrony among both cell types was enhanced by shared glomerular input but was independent of intraglomerular lateral excitation. Cell-type differences in synchrony could also not be traced to any difference in the synchronization of synaptic inhibition. Instead, greater TC than MC synchrony paralleled the more periodic firing among resonant TCs than MCs and emerged in patterns consistent with densely synchronous network oscillations. Collectively, our results thus reveal a mechanism for parallel processing of sensory information in the MOB via differential TC vs. MC synchrony, and further contrast mechanisms driving fast network oscillations in the MOB from those driving the sparse synchronization of irregularly-firing principal cells throughout cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Presynaptic stochasticity improves energy efficiency and helps alleviate the stability-plasticity dilemma</a></h4>

              
                When an action potential arrives at a synapse there is a large probability that no neurotransmitter is released. Surprisingly, simple computational models suggest that these synaptic failures enable information processing at lower metabolic costs. However, these models only consider information transmission at single synapses ignoring the remainder of the neural network as well as its overall computational goal. Here, we investigate how synaptic failures affect the energy efficiency of models of entire neural networks that solve a goal-driven task. We find that presynaptic stochasticity and plasticity improve energy efficiency and show that the network allocates most energy to a sparse subset of important synapses. We demonstrate that stabilising these synapses helps to alleviate the stability-plasticity dilemma, thus connecting a presynaptic notion of importance to a computational role in lifelong learning. Overall, our findings present a set of hypotheses for how presynaptic plasticity and stochasticity contribute to sparsity, energy efficiency and improved trade-offs in the stability-plasticity dilemma.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Different B cell subpopulations show distinct patterns in their IgH repertoire metrics</a></h4>

              
                Several human B-cell subpopulations are recognized in the peripheral blood, which play distinct roles in the humoral immune response. These cells undergo developmental and maturational changes involving VDJ recombination, somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, altogether shaping their immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) repertoire. Here, we sequenced the IgH repertoire of naïve, marginal zone, switched and plasma cells from 10 healthy adults along with matched unsorted and <i>in silico</i> separated CD19<sup>+</sup> bulk B cells. Using advanced bioinformatic analysis and machine learning, we show that sorted B cell subpopulations are characterised by distinct repertoire characteristics on both the individual sequence and the repertoire level. Sorted subpopulations shared similar repertoire characteristics with their corresponding <i>in silico</i> separated subsets. Furthermore, certain IgH repertoire characteristics correlated with the position of the constant region on the IgH locus. Overall, this study provides unprecedented insight over mechanisms of B cell repertoire control in peripherally circulating B cell subpopulations.

                Charcot Marie Tooth diseases type 1A (CMT1A), caused by duplication of Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) gene, and CMT1B, caused by mutations in myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene are the two most common forms of demyelinating CMT (CMT1) and no treatments are available for either. Prior studies of the MpzSer63del mouse model of CMT1B have demonstrated that protein misfolding, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) contributed to the neuropathy. Heterozygous patients with an arginine to cysteine mutation in MPZ (MPZR98C) develop a severe infantile form of CMT1B which is modeled by MpzR98C/+ mice that also show ER-stress and an activated UPR. C3-PMP22 mice are considered to effectively model CMT1A. Altered proteostasis, ER-stress and activation of the UPR have been demonstrated in mice carrying Pmp22 mutations. To determine whether enabling the ER-stress/UPR and readjusting protein homeostasis would effectively treat these models of CMT1B and CMT1A we administered Sephin1/IFB-088/icerguestat, a UPR modulator which showed efficacy in the MpzS63del model of CMT1B, to heterozygous MpzR98C and C3-PMP22 mice. Mice were analyzed by behavioral, neurophysiological, morphological and biochemical measures. Both MpzR98C/+ and C3-PMP22 mice improved in motor function and neurophysiology. Myelination, as demonstrated by g-ratios and myelin thickness, improved in CMT1B and CMT1A mice and markers of UPR activation returned towards wild type values. Taken together our results demonstrate the capability of IFB-088 to treat a second mouse model of CMT1B and a mouse model of CMT1A, the most common form of CMT. Given the recent benefits of IFB-088 treatment in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Multiple Sclerosis animal models, these data demonstrate its potential in managing UPR and ER-stress for multiple mutations in CMT1 as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deficiency of p38α-MAPK in myeloid cells ameliorates symptoms and pathology of APP-transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice</a></h4>

              
                Microglial activation is a hall marker of Alzheimer disease (AD); its pathogenic role and regulating mechanisms are unclear. In APP-transgenic mice, we deleted p38-MAPK in the myeloid cell lineage from birth or specifically in microglia from 9 months, and analysed the AD pathology at the age of 4, 9 and 12 months. In both experimental settings, p38-MAPK deficiency decreased cerebral A{beta} and improved cognitive function in AD mice; however, p38-MAPK deficiency in whole myeloid cells was more effective than specifically in microglia in preventing AD pathogenesis. Deficiency of p38-MAPK in whole myeloid cells inhibited the inflammatory activation of individual microglia by 4 months, but enhanced it by 9 months. Inflammatory activation was essential for p38-MAPK deficiency to promote microglial internalization of A{beta} in the brain. In the investigation of mechanisms mediating different effects of p38-MAPK-deficient myeloid cells and p38-MAPK-deficient microglia on the pathogenesis of AD mice, we observed that p38-MAPK deficiency in peripheral myeloid cells reduced il-17a transcription in CD4-positive spleen cells. By cross-breeding APP-transgenic mice and IL-17a knockout mice, we further found that IL-17a deficiency activated microglia and decreased A{beta} deposits in AD mouse brain. In summary, our study shows that p38-MAPK deficiency in myeloid cells attenuates symptoms and pathology of APP-transgenic mice. As a potential mechanism, p38-MAPK-deficient peripheral myeloid cells reduces IL-17a-expressing T lymphocytes, and subsequently regulates cerebral A{beta} clearance in APP-transgenic mice. Together with our previous observations that a deficiency of p38-MAPK in neurons prevents AD pathogenesis, our study supports p38-MAPK as a novel target for AD therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Different brain systems support the aversive and appetitive sides of human pain-avoidance learning</a></h4>

              
                Both unexpected pain and unexpected pain absence can drive avoidance learning, but whether they do so via shared or separate neural and neurochemical systems is largely unknown. To address this issue, we combined an instrumental pain-avoidance learning task with computational modeling, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pharmacological manipulations of the dopaminergic (100 mg levodopa) and opioidergic (50 mg naltrexone) systems (N=83). Computational modeling provided evidence that untreated participants learned more from received than avoided pain. Our dopamine and opioid manipulations negated this learning asymmetry by selectively increasing learning rates for avoided pain. Furthermore, our fMRI analyses revealed that pain prediction errors were encoded in subcortical and limbic brain regions, whereas no-pain prediction errors were encoded in frontal and parietal cortical regions. However, we found no effects of our pharmacological manipulations on the neural encoding of prediction errors. Together, our results suggest that human pain-avoidance learning is supported by separate threat- and safety-learning systems, and that dopamine and endogenous opioids specifically regulate learning from successfully avoided pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain hubs defined in the group do not overlap with regions of high inter-individual variability</a></h4>

              
                Connector 'hubs' are brain regions with links to multiple networks. These regions are hypothesized to play a critical role in brain function. While hubs are often identified based on group-average functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, there is considerable inter-subject variation in the functional connectivity profiles of the brain, especially in association regions where hubs tend to be located. Here we investigated how group hubs are related to locations of inter-individual variability, to better understand if hubs are (a) relatively conserved across people, (b) locations with malleable connectivity, leading individuals to show variable hub profiles, or (c) artifacts arising from cross-person variation. To answer this question, we compared the locations of hubs and regions of strong idiosyncratic functional connectivity ("variants") in both the Midnight Scan Club and Human Connectome Project datasets. Group hubs defined based on the participation coefficient did not overlap strongly with variants. These hubs have relatively strong similarity across participants and consistent cross-network profiles. Consistency across participants was further improved when participation coefficient hubs were allowed to shift slightly in local position. Thus, our results demonstrate that group hubs defined with the participation coefficient are generally consistent across people, suggesting they may represent conserved cross-network bridges. More caution is warranted with alternative hub measures, such as community density, which are based on spatial proximity and show higher correspondence to locations of individual variability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors bidirectionally modulate intrinsic excitability of inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                The NMDA subtype glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play important roles in both physiological and pathological processes in the brain. Comparing to their critical roles in synaptic modifications and excitotoxicity in the excitatory neurons, much less is understood about the functional contributions of NMDARs to the inhibitory/GABAergic neurons. By using selective NMDAR inhibitors and potentiators, we here show that NMDARs bi-directionally modulate the intrinsic excitability (defined as spontaneous/evoked spiking activity and EPSP-spike coupling) in the inhibitory/GABAergic neurons. This modulation depends on GluN2C/2D- but not GluN2A/2B-containing NMDARs. We further show that NMDAR modulator EU1794-4 mostly enhances extrasynaptic NMDAR activity, and by using it we demonstrate a significant contribution of extrasynaptic NMDARs to the modulation of intrinsic excitability in the inhibitory neurons. Altogether, this bidirectional modulation of intrinsic excitability reveals a previously less appreciated importance of NMDARs in the second-to-second functioning of inhibitory/GABAergic neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural dynamics of retrieval suppression in abolishing item-specific cortical pattern of unwanted emotional memories</a></h4>

              
                When reminded of an unpleasant experience, people often try to exclude the unwanted memory from awareness in an effort to forget it, a process known as retrieval suppression. Yet, how fast can individual memories be targeted and controlled, and the neural dynamics in modulating cortical traces of individual memories, remain elusive. Here, using multivariate decoding analyses on time-domain and time-frequency-domain EEGs, we found that retrieval suppression of aversive memories was distinct from retrieval and passive viewing, when given a reminder. Specifically, early elevation of mid-frontal theta power during the first 500 ms distinguished retrieval suppression from passive viewing, suggesting that suppression recruited early active control processes. On an item-level, we could discern activities relating to individual memories during active retrieval-initially, based on perceptual responses to reminders (0-500 ms) and later, via the reinstatement and maintenance of the target aversive scenes (500-3000 ms). Critically, suppressing retrieval significantly weakened (during 420-600 ms) and eventually abolished these item-specific cortical patterns till cue disappeared (1200-3000 ms), suggesting the successful exclusion of the unwelcome memory from awareness. Suppression of item-specific cortical patterns bore behavioral consequences in predicting subsequent episodic forgetting. These findings provide unique insight into the neural dynamics underlying the control of unwelcome memories: upon perceiving an unwelcome reminder, people rapidly deploy inhibitory control to truncate retrieval within 500 ms, which likely terminate the reminder-to-memory conversion at around 500 ms that would ordinarily arise through hippocampal pattern completion. We concluded that both rapid and sustained control are critical in abolishing cortical patterns of individual memories, limiting unwelcome awareness, and precipitating later forgetting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A common neural currency account for social and non-social decisions</a></h4>

              
                To date, social and non-social decisions have been studied in isolation. Consequently, the extent to which social and non-social forms of decision uncertainty are integrated using shared neurocomputational resources remains elusive. Here, we address this question using simultaneous EEG-fMRI and a task in which decision evidence in social and non-social contexts varies along comparable scales. First, we identify comparable time-resolved build-up of activity in the EEG, akin to a process of evidence accumulation. We then use the endogenous trial-by-trial variability in the slopes of these accumulating signals to construct parametric fMRI predictors. We show that a region of the posterior-medial frontal cortex (pMFC) uniquely explains trial-wise variability in the process of evidence accumulation in both the social and non-social contexts. We further demonstrate a task-dependent coupling between the pMFC and regions of the human valuation system in dorso- and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC/vmPFC) across both contexts. Finally, we report domain-specific representations in regions known to encode the early decision evidence for each context. These results are suggestive of a domain-general decision-making architecture, whereupon domain-specific information is likely converted into a "common currency" in the dmPFC/vmPFC and accumulated for the decision in the pMFC.

                Humans are remarkably proficient at finding objects within a complex visual world. Current theories of attentional selection propose that this ability is mediated by target-specific preparatory activity in visual cortex, biasing visual processing in favor of the target object. In real-world situations, however, the retinal image that any object will produce is unknown in advance; its size, for instance, varies dramatically with the object's distance from the observer. Using fMRI, we show that preparatory activity is systematically modulated by expectations derived from scene context. Human participants searched for objects at different distances in scenes. Activity patterns in object-selective cortex during search preparation (while no objects were presented), resembled activity patterns evoked by viewing targets object in isolation. Crucially, this preparatory activity was modulated by distance, reflecting the predicted retinal image of the object at each distance. These findings reconcile current theories of attentional selection with the challenges of real-world vision.

                The self-other distinction is crucial in human social cognition and social interaction. Studies have found that oxytocin (OT) sharpens the self-other perceptual boundary but with mixed results. Further, little is known if the effect of OT on self-resemblance face perception exists, especially on its neural basis. Moreover, it is unclear if OT would influence the judgment in self-other discrimination when the other is a child or an adult. In the current double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effect of OT on self-face perception at both behavioral and neural levels. We morphed their faces with either an adult, a child, or a stranger face of either an adult or child. After being treated by either OT or placebo (PL), participants reported whether a morphed face resembles themselves while being scanned with fMRI. Behavioral results showed that people judged adult-morphed faces better than child-morphed faces. fMRI results showed that the OT group exhibited generally increased activities in the visual area and IFG for self-morphed faces. Such difference was more pronounced in the adult face compared to child face conditions. Multivariate fMRI analysis revealed that the OT group showed better classification between self-morphed versus other-morphed faces, indicating that OT increased self-other distinction, especially for adult faces and in the left hemisphere. Our study shows the significant effect of OT on self-referential brain processes, providing evidence for the potential OT's effect on a left hemisphere self network

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alone Again: Altered Activation in the Observation Execution System during Synchronization in High Loneliness Individuals</a></h4>

              
                Lonely people evaluate social exchanges and relationships negatively and display difficulties in interpersonal interaction. Interpersonal synchronization is crucial for achieving positive interactions, promoting affinity, closeness, and satisfaction. However, little is known about lonely individuals ability to synchronize and about the activity in the lonely brain while synchronizing. In the present neuroimaging study, 64 participants engaged in interpersonal synchronization, using a novel paradigm involving real dyadic interaction. Results show that high loneliness individuals exhibited a reduced ability to adapt their movement to their partners movement. Intriguingly, during periods in which participants adapted their movement, high loneliness individuals showed increased activation in the observation-execution (OE) system, specifically in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). They did not show increased activation in the dmPFC, which in the context of synchronization was suggested to be related to gap-monitoring. Based on these findings, we propose a model according to which lonely people may require a stronger activation of their OE system for movement alignment to compensate for some deficiency in their ability to synchronize. However, despite this hyper-activation, they still suffer from reduced synchronization capacity. Consequently, synchronization may be a relevant intervention area for the amelioration of chronic loneliness.

The main goal of the present study was to compare the dipsogenic responses induced by different thirst models as a function of two perinatal manipulation models, defined by the maternal free access to hypertonic sodium solution and a partial aortic ligation (PAL-W/Na) or a sham-ligation (Sham-W/Na). The programmed adult offspring of both perinatal manipulated models responded similarly when was challenged by overnight water dehydration or after a sodium depletion showing a reduced water intake in comparison to the non-programmed animals. However, when animals were evaluated after a body sodium overload, only adult Sham-W/Na offspring showed drinking differences compared to PAL and control offspring. By analyzing the central neurobiological substrates involved, a significant increase in the number of Fos + cells was found after sodium depletion in the subfornical organ of both programmed groups and an increase in the number of Fos + cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus was only observed in adult depleted PAL-W/Na. Our results suggest that perinatal programming is a phenomenon that differentially affects particular targets which induce specific dipsogenic responses depending on matching between perinatal programming conditions and the osmotic challenge in the latter environment. Probably, each programmed-drinking phenotype has a particular set point to elicit specific repertoires of mechanisms to reestablish fluid balance.

	<p>Individuals in healthy romantic relationships gain significant benefits to their psychological wellbeing and physiological health. Notably, the majority of relationship research has focused on how adult attachment influences these relationship outcomes while the role of olfaction remains an emerging research focus. The aim of the current study was to bring together these seemingly unrelated factors–attachment and olfaction–in an online quasi-experimental design. The participants were 401 undergraduate students, predominantly females, ranging in age from 17 to 70 years. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires that evaluated their attachment tendencies, olfactory ability and experiences in romantic relationships. Results indicated that attachment insecurity, across both attachment anxiety and avoidance, was associated with decreased olfactory functioning for females. These findings provide preliminary evidence that olfaction is related to romantic relationship maintenance and suggests that body odors could be fundamental for evoking the attachment system. These findings also elicit enticing new avenues of research which can assist psychologists to provide targeted treatments to individuals with olfactory deficits and insecure attachment tendencies.</p>

	<p>Children can easily link a novel word to a novel, unnamed object—something referred to as fast mapping. Despite the ease and speed with which children do this, their memories for novel fast-mapped words can be poor unless they receive memory supports such as further exposure to the words or sleep. Axelsson, Swinton, Winiger, and Horst (2018) found that 2.5-year-old children who napped after fast mapping had better retention of novel words than children who did not nap. Retention declined for those who did not nap. The children received no memory supports and determined the word–object mappings independently. Previous studies report enhanced memories after sleeping in children and adults, but the napping children’s retention in the Axelsson et al. study remained steady across time. We report a follow-up investigation where memory supports are provided after fast mapping to test whether memories would be enhanced following napping. Children’s retention of novel words improved and remained greater than chance; however, there was no nap effect with no significant difference between the children who napped and those who did not. These findings suggest that when memory supports are provided, retention improves, and the word–object mappings remain stable over time. When memory traces are weak and labile, such as after fast mapping, without further memory supports, sleeping soon after helps stabilise and prevent decay of word–object mappings.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurexins Regulate GABA Co-release by Dopamine Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are key regulators of basal ganglia functions. The axonal domain of these neurons is highly complex, with a large subset of non-synaptic release sites and a smaller subset of synaptic terminals from which glutamate or GABA are released. The molecular mechanisms regulating the connectivity of DA neurons and their neurochemical identity are unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that the trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules neurexins (Nrxns) regulate DA neuron neurotransmission. Conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons (DAT::Nrxns KO) revealed that loss of Nrxns does not impair the basic development and ultrastructural characteristics of DA neuron terminals. However, loss of Nrxns caused an impairment of DA transmission revealed as a reduced rate of DA reuptake following activity-dependent DA release, decreased DA transporter levels, increased vesicular monoamine transporter expression and impaired amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Strikingly, electrophysiological recording revealed an increase of GABA co-release from DA neuron axons in the striatum of the KO mice. These findings reveal that Nrxns act as key regulators of DA neuron connectivity and DA-mediated functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TRPV1-lineage somatosensory fibers communicate with taste neurons in the mouse parabrachial nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Trigeminal neurons supply somatosensation to craniofacial tissues. In mouse brain, ascending projections from medullary trigeminal neurons arrive at taste neurons in the autonomic parabrachial nucleus, suggesting taste neurons participate in somatosensory processing. However, the genetic cell types that support this convergence were undefined. Using Cre-directed optogenetics and in vivo neurophysiology in anesthetized mice of both sexes, here we studied whether TRPV1-lineage nociceptive and thermosensory fibers are primary neurons that drive trigeminal circuits reaching parabrachial taste cells. We monitored spiking activity in individual parabrachial neurons during photoexcitation of the terminals of TRPV1-lineage fibers that arrived at the dorsal spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis, which relays orofacial somatosensory messages to the parabrachial area. Parabrachial neural responses to oral delivery of taste, chemesthetic, and thermal stimuli were also recorded. We found that optical excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers frequently stimulated traditionally defined taste neurons in lateral parabrachial nuclei. The tuning of neurons across diverse tastes associated with their sensitivity to excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers, which only sparingly engaged neurons oriented to preferred tastes like sucrose. Moreover, neurons that responded to photostimulation of TRPV1-lineage afferents showed strong responses to temperature including noxious heat, which predominantly excited parabrachial bitter taste cells. Multivariate analyses revealed the parabrachial confluence of TRPV1-lineage signals with taste captured sensory valence information shared across aversive gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli. Our results reveal that trigeminal fibers with defined roles in thermosensation and pain communicate with parabrachial taste neurons. This multisensory convergence supports dependencies between gustatory and somatosensory hedonic representations in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptotagmin-7 enhances phasic dopamine release</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine released from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons modulates movement, motivation, and reward. In addition to their tonic firing pattern, dopamine neurons also fire high-frequency bursts that cause superlinear increases in dopamine release. To examine this poorly understood form of short-term plasticity, we used the fluorescent dopamine sensor dLight1.3b to examine the role of the calcium-binding protein synaptotagmin-7 (SYT7). We report that SYT7 mediates a hidden component of facilitation, which was unmasked by lowering initial release probability, or by low-frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. In Syt7 KO neurons, there was profound synaptic depression that significantly reduced release during stimulations that mimic in vivo firing patterns of SNc neurons. D2-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents in the SNc revealed a similar role for SYT7 in somatodendritic release. Our results indicate that SYT7 drives short-term facilitation of release from dopamine neurons, which likely underlies frequency-dependence of dopamine signaling in vivo.

	<p>Vocalization is an important part of social communication, not only for humans but also for mice. Here, we show in a mouse model that functional deficiency of Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing 2 (SPRED2), a protein ubiquitously expressed in the brain, causes differences in social ultrasound vocalizations (USVs), using an uncomplicated and reliable experimental setting of a short meeting of two individuals. SPRED2 mutant mice show an OCD-like behaviour, accompanied by an increased release of stress hormones from the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, both factors probably influencing USV usage. To determine genotype-related differences in USV usage, we analyzed call rate, subtype profile, and acoustic parameters (i.e., duration, bandwidth, and mean peak frequency) in young and old SPRED2-KO mice. We recorded USVs of interacting male and female mice, and analyzed the calls with the deep-learning DeepSqueak software, which was trained to recognize and categorize the emitted USVs. Our findings provide the first classification of SPRED2-KO vs. wild-type mouse USVs using neural networks and reveal significant differences in their development and use of calls. Our results show, first, that simple experimental settings in combination with deep learning are successful at identifying genotype-dependent USV usage and, second, that SPRED2 deficiency negatively affects the vocalization usage and social communication of mice.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the study was to systematically review the evidence on the effects of an acute bout of exercise on concurrent performance of core executive function (EF) during exercise in adults. Four electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and SportDiscus) were searched from inception dates to 30 December 2020. The literature searches were conducted using the combinations of two groups of relevant items related to exercise and executive function. Articles were limited to human studies in adults. The search process, study selection, data extraction, and study quality assessments were carried out independently by two researchers. A total of 4899 studies were identified. Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria. Of the 42 reported outcomes in the 22 studies, 13 (31%) of the 42 outcomes showed that core EF performance was enhanced during exercise and 14 (33%) found that core EF performance did not differ from control conditions. Fifteen (36%) found that core EF performance was impaired. Notably, improved EF performances tend to be observed during moderate-intensity exercise, whereas impaired EF performances were more likely to be observed at vigorous-high intensity. The review suggests mixed findings regarding the effects of an acute bout of exercise on concurrent performance of core EF. Exercise intensity seems to influence the effects. The underlying neural mechanisms remain to be elucidated.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive coding of pain prediction error in the anterior insula</a></h4>

              
                Background: To reduce the computational demands of the task of determining values, the brain is thought to engage in adaptive coding, where the sensitivity of some neurons to value is modulated by contextual information. There is good behavioural evidence that pain is coded adaptively, but controversy regarding the underlying neural mechanism. Additionally, there is evidence that reward prediction errors are coded adaptively, but no parallel evidence regarding pain prediction errors. Methods: We tested the hypothesis that pain prediction errors are coded adaptively by scanning 19 healthy adults with fMRI while they performed a cued pain task. Our analysis followed an axiomatic approach. Results: We found that the left anterior insula was the only region which was sensitive both to predicted pain magnitudes and the unexpectedness of pain delivery, but not to the magnitude of delivered pain. Conclusions: This pattern suggests that the left anterior insula is part of a neural mechanism that serves the adaptive prediction error of pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Formation of multinucleated globoid cells in Krabbe iPSC-derived microglia cultures: a preliminary investigation</a></h4>

              
                Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is a severe demyelinating, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency in glycosphingolipid catabolic enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC). Histologically, Krabbe disease is characterized by the appearance of large multinucleated globoid cells that express classical macrophage markers (both of brain-resident microglia and peripheral monocyte-derived). Globoid cells reside near areas of degeneration; however, their functional significance in disease progression remains unclear. In the current study, we differentiated microglia-like cells from iPSCs from a donor with infantile Krabbe disease and compared them to microglia generated from two healthy controls and two donors with the lysosomal storage disorder metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), which is genetically distinct from Krabbe disease but presents similarly in terms of severity of demyelination and neurodegeneration. We report the novel finding of prominent formation of giant multinucleated globoid cells from the microglia derived from the Krabbe donor, but not from healthy control or MLD donors. The Krabbe microglia displayed reduced IL-6 protein expression upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, and the multinucleated globoid cells themselves appeared deficient in phagocytosis of both disease-relevant myelin debris and E. coli, together hinting at an impairment of normal function. The formation of the globoid cells could be attenuated by fully replacing the medium following passaging, suggesting that yet-to-be determined secreted factors are influencing cell fusion in our culture system. While preliminary, our results imply that globoid cells may be detrimental in Krabbe disease by hindering the normal function of brain-residing macrophages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Functional Brain Reconfiguration During Sustained Pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain is constructed through complex interactions among multiple brain systems, but it remains unclear how functional brain network representations are dynamically reconfigured over time while experiencing pain. Here, we investigated the dynamic changes in the functional brain networks during 20-min capsaicin-induced sustained orofacial pain. In the early stage, the orofacial areas of the primary somatomotor cortex were separated from the other primary somatomotor cortices and integrated with subcortical and frontoparietal regions, constituting a brain-wide pain supersystem. As pain decreased over time, the subcortical and frontoparietal regions were separated from this pain supersystem and connected to multiple cerebellar regions. Machine-learning models based on these dynamic network features showed significant predictions of changes in pain experience across two independent datasets (n = 48 and 74). This study provides new insights into how multiple brain systems dynamically interact to construct and modulate pain experience, potentially advancing our mechanistic understanding of chronic pain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term imaging of the ventral nerve cord in behaving adult Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The dynamics and connectivity of neural circuits continuously change during an animal's lifetime on timescales ranging from milliseconds to days. Therefore, to investigate how biological networks accomplish remarkable cognitive and behavioral tasks, minimally invasive methods are needed to perform repeated measurements, or perturbations of neural circuits in behaving animals across time. Such tools have been developed to investigate the brain but similar approaches are lacking for comprehensively and repeatedly recording motor circuits in behaving animals. Here we describe a suite of microfabricated technologies that enable long-term, minimally invasive optical recordings of the adult Drosophila melanogaster ventral nerve cord (VNC)---neural tissues that are functionally equivalent to the vertebrate spinal cord. These tools consist of (i) a manipulator arm that permits the insertion of (ii) a compliant implant into the thorax to expose the imaging region of interest; (iii) a numbered, transparent polymer window that encloses and provides optical access to the inside of the thorax, and (iv) a hinged remounting stage that allows gentle and repeated tethering of an implanted animal for two-photon imaging. We validate and illustrate the utility of our toolkit in several ways. First, we show that the thoracic implant and window have minimal impact on animal behavior and survival while also enabling neural recordings from individual animals across at least one month. Second, we follow the degradation of chordotonal organ mechanosensory nerve terminals in the VNC over weeks after leg amputation. Third, because our tools allow recordings of the VNC with the gut intact, we discover waves of neural population activity following ingestion of a high-concentration caffeine solution. In summary, our microfabricated toolkit makes it possible to longitudinally monitor anatomical and functional changes in premotor and motor neural circuits, and more generally opens up the long-term investigation of thoracic tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel automated approach for improving standardization of the marble burying test enables quantification of burying bouts and activity characteristics</a></h4>

              
                The marble burying test is a commonly used paradigm to screen phenotypes in mouse models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The current methodological approach relies solely on reporting the number of buried marbles at the end of the test. By measuring the proxy of the behavior (buried marbles), rather than the behavior itself (burying bouts), many important characteristics regarding the temporal aspect of this assay are lost. Here we introduce a novel, automated method to quantify mouse behavior throughout the duration of the marble burying test with the focus on the burying bouts. Using open-source software packages, we trained a supervised machine learning algorithm (the classifier) to distinguish burying behavior in freely moving mice. In order to confirm the classifier's accuracy and uncover the behavioral meaning of the marble burying test, we performed marble burying test in three mouse models: Ube3am-/p+ (Angelman Syndrome model), Shank2-/- (autism model), and Sapap3-/- (obsessive-compulsive disorder model) mice. The classifier scored burying behavior accurately and consistent with the literature in the Ube3am-/p+ mice, which showed decreased levels of burying compared to controls. Shank2-/- mice showed a similar pattern of decreased burying behavior, which was not found in Sapap3-/- mice. Tracking mouse behavior throughout the test enabled us to quantify activity characteristics, revealing hypoactivity in Ube3am-/p+ and hyperactivity in the Shank2-/- mice, indicating that mouse activity is unrelated to burying behavior. Together, we demonstrate that our classifier is an accurate method for the analysis of the marble burying test, providing more information than the currently used methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Propofol modulates functional connectivity signatures of sustained attention</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention is a critical cognitive function reflected in an individuals whole-brain pattern of fMRI functional connectivity. However sustained attention is not a purely static trait. Rather, attention waxes and wanes over time. Do functional brain networks that underlie individual differences in sustained attention also underlie changes in attentional state? To investigate, we replicate the finding that a validated connectome-based model of individual differences in sustained attention tracks pharmacologically induced changes in attentional state. Specifically, preregistered analyses revealed that participants exhibited functional connectivity signatures of stronger attention when awake than when under deep sedation with the anesthetic agent propofol. Furthermore, this effect was relatively specific to the predefined sustained attention networks: propofol administration modulated strength of the sustained attention networks more than it modulated strength of canonical resting-state networks and a network defined to predict fluid intelligence, and the functional connections most affected by propofol sedation overlapped with the sustained attention networks. Thus, propofol modulates functional connectivity signatures of sustained attention within individuals. More broadly these findings underscore the utility of pharmacological intervention in testing both the generalizability and specificity of network-based models of cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amyloid-beta and tau pathologies are both necessary to induce novel stage-specific microglia subtypes during Alzheimer's disease progression.</a></h4>

              
                It is unknown whether specific microglia are selectively induced by amyloid-{beta}(A{beta}), tau pathologies, or both in combination. To address this, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing to profile mice bearing both A{beta} and tau pathologies during Alzheimer's disease (AD). We identify novel microglia subtypes induced in a disease stage-specific manner. We show that during early-stage disease, interferon signaling induces a subtype of microglia termed EADAM. During late-stage disease, a second microglia subtype termed LADAM is detected. While EADAM and LADAM-like microglia are observed in other neurodegenerative models, the magnitude and composition of subtype markers are distinct from microglia observed with AD-like pathology. The pattern of EADAM- and LADAM-associated gene expression is observed in microglia from human AD, during the early and late stages of disease, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that several siglec genes are selectively expressed in either EADAM or LADAM. Siglecg is expressed in white-matter-associated LADAM, and expression of the human orthologue of Siglecg is progressively elevated in AD-stage-dependent manner but not shown in non-AD tauopathy. Our findings imply that both A{beta} and tau pathologies are required for disease stage-specific induction of EADAM and LADAM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supports speech perception in listeners with cochlear implants</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear implants are neuroprosthetic devices that can restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulation, the acoustic information delivered by a cochlear implant does not convey the same level of spectral detail as that conveyed by normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants is typically poorer and more effortful than in listeners with normal hearing. The brain networks supporting speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants are not well understood, partly due to difficulties obtaining functional neuroimaging data in this population. In the current study, we assessed the brain regions supporting spoken word understanding in adult listeners with right unilateral cochlear implants (n=20) and matched controls (n=18) using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a quiet and non-invasive imaging modality with spatial resolution comparable to that of functional MRI. We found that while listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, overlapping with functionally-defined domain-general processing seen in a spatial working memory task. These results suggest that listeners with cochlear implants require greater cognitive processing during speech understanding than listeners with normal hearing, supported by compensatory recruitment in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

                The ability to sense, monitor, and control respiration - e.g., respiratory interoception (henceforth, respiroception) is a core homeostatic ability. Beyond the mere regulation of gas exchange, enhanced awareness of respiratory sensations is directly related to psychiatric symptoms such as panic and anxiety. Indeed, chronic breathlessness (dyspnea) is associated with a fourfold increase in the risk of developing depression and anxiety, and the regulation of the breath is a key aspect of many mindfulness-based approaches to the treatment of mental illness. Physiologically speaking, the ability to accurately monitor respiratory sensations is important for optimizing cardiorespiratory function during athletic exertion, and can be a key indicator of illness. Given the important role of respiroception in mental and physical health, it is unsurprising that there is increased interest in the quantification of respiratory psychophysiology across different perceptual and metacognitive levels of the psychological hierarchy. Compared to other more popular modalities of interoception, such as in the cardiac domain, there are relatively few methods available for measuring aspects of respiroception. Existing inspiratory loading tasks are difficult to administer and frequently require expensive medical equipment, or offer poor granularity in their quantification of respiratory-related perceptual ability. To facilitate the study of respiroception, we here present a new, fully automated and computer-controlled apparatus and psychophysiological method, which can flexibly and easily measure respiratory-related interoceptive sensitivity, bias and metacognition, in as little as 30 minutes of testing, using easy to make 3D printable parts.

                This paper introduces a novel EEG channel selection method to determine which channel interrelationships provide the best classification accuracy between a group of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a cohort of age matched healthy controls (HC). Thereby, determine which inter-relationships are more important for the in-depth dynamical analysis to further understand how neurodegenerative diseases such as AD affects global and local brain dynamics. The channel selection methodology uses kernel-based nonlinear manifold learning via Isomap and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (Isomap-GPLVM). The Isomap-GPLVM method is employed to learn both the spatial and temporal local similarities and global dissimilarities present within the EEG data structures. The resulting kernel (dis)similarity matrix is used as a measure of synchrony between EEG channels. Based on this information, channel-specific linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification is then used to determine which spatio-temporal channel inter-relationships are more important for in-depth dynamical analysis. In this work, the analysis of EEG data from HC and AD patients is presented as a case study. Our analysis shows that inter-relationships between channels in the fronto-parietal region and the rest are better at differentiating between AD and HC groups.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bilaterally Reduced Rolandic Beta Band Activity in Minor Stroke Patients</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Stroke patients with hemiparesis display decreased beta band (13-25 Hz) rolandic activity, correlating to impaired motor function. However, patients without significant weakness, with small lesions far from sensorimotor cortex, nevertheless exhibit bilateral decreased motor dexterity and slowed reaction times. We investigate whether these minor stroke patients also display abnormal beta band activity. Methods: Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data were collected from nine minor stroke patients (NIHSS < 4) without significant hemiparesis, at ~1 and ~6 months postinfarct, and eight age-similar controls. Rolandic relative beta power during matching tasks and resting state, and Beta Event Related (De)Synchronization (ERD/ERS) during button press responses were analyzed. Results: Regardless of lesion location, patients had significantly reduced relative beta power and ERS compared to controls. Abnormalities persisted over visits, and were present in both ipsi- and contra-lesional hemispheres, consistent with bilateral impairments in motor dexterity and speed. Conclusions: Minor stroke patients without severe weakness display reduced rolandic beta band activity in both hemispheres, which may be linked to bilaterally impaired dexterity and processing speed, implicating global connectivity dysfunction affecting sensorimotor cortex. Significance: Rolandic beta band activity may be a potential biomarker and treatment target, even for minor stroke patients with small lesions far from sensorimotor areas.

                Glioblastoma (GB) is the most aggressive, lethal and frequent primary brain tumor. It originates from glial cells and is characterized by rapid expansion through infiltration. GB cells interact with the microenvironment and healthy surrounding tissues, mostly neurons and vessels. GB cells project tumor microtubes (TMs) that contact with neurons and exchange signaling molecules related to Wingless/WNT, JNK, Insulin or Neuroligin-3 pathways. This cell to cell communication promotes GB expansion and neurodegeneration. Moreover, healthy neurons form glutamatergic functional synapses with GB cells which facilitate GB expansion and premature death in mouse GB xerograph models. Targeting signaling and synaptic components of GB progression may become a suitable strategy against glioblastoma. In a Drosophila GB model, we have determined the post-synaptic nature of GB cells with respect to neurons, and the contribution of post-synaptic genes expressed in GB cells to tumor progression. In addition, we document the presence of intratumoral synapses between GB cells, and the functional contribution of pre-synaptic genes to GB calcium dependent activity and expansion. Finally, we explore the relevance of synaptic genes in GB cells to the lifespan reduction caused by GB advance. Our results indicate that both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins play a role in GB progression and lethality.

As a consequence, the predominant use of male mice has become a standard in animal reseach, under the assumption that males are less variable than females. Similarly, to homogenize genetic background, neuroscience studies have almost exclusively used the C57BL/6 (B6) strain. Here, we examined individual differences in performance in the context of associative learning. We performed delayed eyeblink conditioning while recording locomotor activity in mice from both sexes in two strains (B6 and B6CBAF1). Further, we used a C-FOS immunostaining approach to explore brain areas involved in eyeblink conditioning across subjects, and correlate them with behavioral performance. We found that B6 male and female mice show comparable variability in this task and that females reach higher learning scores. We found a strong positive correlation across sexes between learning scores and voluntary locomotion. C-FOS immunostainings revealed positive correlations between C-FOS positive cell density and learning in the cerebellar cortex as well as multiple, previously unreported extra-cerebellar areas. We found consistent and comparable correlations in eyeblink performance and C-fos expression in B6 and B6CBAF1 females and males. Taken together, we show that differences in motor behavior and activity across brain areas correlate with learning scores during eyeblink conditioning across strains and sexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in visual search performance extend from artificial arrays to naturalistic environments.</a></h4>

              
                Visual search is a universal human activity in naturalistic environments. Traditionally, visual search is investigated under tightly controlled conditions, where head-restricted participants locate a minimalistic target in a cluttered array presented on a computer screen. Do classic findings of visual search extend to naturalistic settings, where participants actively explore complex, real-world scenes? Here, we leverage advances in virtual reality (VR) technology to relate individual differences in classic visual search paradigms to naturalistic search behavior. In a naturalistic visual search task, participants looked for an object within their environment via a combination of head-turns and eye-movements using a head-mounted display. Then, in a classic visual search task, participants searched for a target within a simple array of colored letters using only eye-movements. We tested how set size, a property known to limit visual search within computer displays, predicts the efficiency of search behavior inside immersive, real-world scenes that vary in levels of visual clutter. We found that participants' search performance was impacted by the level of visual clutter within real-world scenes. Critically, we also observed that individual differences in visual search efficiency in classic search predicted efficiency in real-world search, but only when the comparison was limited to the forward-facing field of view for real-world search. These results demonstrate that set size is a reliable predictor of individual performance across computer-based and active, real-world visual search behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic modulation of distinct inhibitory domains in granule cells of the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

              
                Early olfactory processing relies on a large population of inhibitory neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB), the granule cells (GCs). GCs inhibit the OB output neurons, the mitral and tufted cells (M/TCs), shaping their responses to odors both in the spatial and temporal domains, therefore, the activity of GCs is finely tuned by local and centrifugal excitatory and inhibitory inputs. While the circuit substrates underlying regulatory inputs onto GCs are well-established, how they are locally modulated remains unclear. Here, we examine the regulation of GABAergic inhibition onto GCs by acetylcholine, a main neuromodulatory transmitter released in the OB, by basal forebrain (BF) neurons. In acute brain slices from male and female mice, we show that activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) produces opposing effects on local and centrifugal inhibition onto GCs. By using electrophysiology, laser uncaging and optogenetics we show that the kinetics of GABAergic currents in GCs could be correlated with distal and proximal spatial domains from where they originate, along the GC somatodendritic axis. Proximal inhibition from BF afferents, is suppressed by activation of M2/M4-mAChRs. In contrast, distal local inhibition from deep short axon cells (dSACs) is enhanced by activation of M3-mAChRs. Furthermore, we show that the cholinergic enhancement of distal inhibition in GCs reduces the extent of dendrodendritic inhibition in MCs. Interestingly, the excitatory cortical feedback, which also targets the proximal region of GCs, was not modulated by acetylcholine, suggesting that muscarinic activation shifts the synaptic balance towards excitation in GCs. Together, these results suggest that BF cholinergic inputs to the OB fine tune GC-mediated inhibition of M/TCs by differentially modulating the proximal and distal domains of inhibition in GCs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical Spheroid Model for Studying the Effects of Ischemic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is a devastating neurological disorder and a leading cause of death and long-term disability. Despite many decades of research, there are still very few therapeutic options for patients suffering from stroke or its consequences. This is partially due to the limitations of current research models, including traditional in vitro models which lack the three-dimensional (3D) architecture and cellular make-up of the in vivo brain. 3D spheroids derived from primary postnatal rat cortex provide an in vivo-relevant model containing a similar cellular composition to the native cortex and a cell-synthesized extracellular matrix. These spheroids are cost-effective, highly reproducible, and can be produced in a high-throughput manner, making this model an ideal candidate for screening potential therapeutics. To study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of stroke in this model, spheroids were deprived of glucose, oxygen, or both oxygen and glucose for 24 hours. Both oxygen and oxygen-glucose deprived spheroids demonstrated many of the hallmarks of stroke, including a decrease in metabolism, an increase in neural dysfunction, and an increase in reactive astrocytes. Pretreatment of spheroids with the antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) mitigated the decrease in ATP seen after 24 hours of oxygen-glucose deprivation. Together, these results show the utility of our 3D cortical spheroid model for studying ischemic injury and its potential for screening stroke therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrinsic maturation of sleep output neurons regulates sleep ontogeny in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The maturation of sleep behavior across a lifespan (sleep ontogeny) is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon. Mammalian studies have shown that in addition to increased sleep duration, early life sleep exhibits stark differences compared to mature sleep with regard to the amount of time spent in certain sleep states. How intrinsic maturation of sleep output circuits contributes to sleep ontogeny is poorly understood. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits multifaceted changes to sleep from juvenile to mature adulthood. Here, we use a non-invasive probabilistic approach to investigate changes in sleep architecture in juvenile and mature flies. Increased sleep in juvenile flies is driven primarily by a decreased probability of transitioning to wake, and characterized by more time in deeper sleep states. Functional manipulations of sleep-promoting neurons in the dFB suggest these neurons differentially regulate sleep in juvenile and mature flies. Transcriptomic analysis of dFB neurons at different ages and a subsequent RNAi screen implicate genes involved in distinct molecular processes in sleep control of juvenile and mature flies. These results reveal that dynamic transcriptional states of sleep output neurons contribute to changes in sleep across the lifespan.

                Alzheimers disease (AD) is one of the foremost neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by beta-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques and significant progressive memory loss. In AD, astrocytes are known to take up and clear A{beta} plaques. However, how A{beta} induces pathogenesis and memory impairment in AD remains elusive. We report that normal astrocytes show non-cyclic urea metabolism, whereas A{beta}-treated astrocytes show switched-on urea cycle with upregulated enzymes and accumulated entering-metabolite aspartate, starting-substrate ammonia, end-product urea, and side-product putrescine. Gene-silencing of astrocytic ornithine decarboxylase-1 (ODC1), facilitating ornithine-to-putrescine conversion, boosts urea cycle and eliminates aberrant putrescine and its toxic by-products ammonia, H2O2, and GABA to recover from reactive astrogliosis and memory impairment in AD model. Our findings implicate that astrocytic urea cycle exerts opposing roles of beneficial A{beta} detoxification and detrimental memory impairment in AD. We propose ODC1-inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for AD to facilitate removal of toxic molecules and prevent memory loss.

                Chronic pain and depression are frequently comorbid and ketamine has emerged as a potentially promising therapy. But the molecular mechanisms underlying comorbid depressive symptoms in chronic pain and ketamine antidepressant effects remain elusive. Here, we show that Tiam1 orchestrates synaptic structural and functional remodeling in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neurons via actin cytoskeleton reorganization and synaptic NMDAR stabilization. This Tiam1-coordinated synaptic plasticity underpins ACC hyperactivity and drives chronic pain-induced depressive-like behaviors. Ketamine induces sustained antidepressant effects in chronic pain by blocking Tiam1-mediated synaptic structural and functional plasticity in ACC neurons. Our results reveal Tiam1 as a key factor in the pathophysiology of chronic pain-induced depression and in the sustained antidepressant effects of ketamine in ACC neurons.

                Excitation-inhibition (EI) balance may be required for the organisation of brain dynamics to a phase transition, criticality, which confers computational benefits. Brain pathology associated with EI imbalance may therefore occur due to a deviation from criticality. However, evidence linking critical dynamics with EI imbalance-induced pathology is lacking. Here, we studied the effect of EI imbalance-induced epileptic seizures on brain dynamics, using in vivo whole-brain 2-photon imaging of GCaMP6s larval zebrafish at single-neuron resolution. We demonstrate the importance of EI balance for criticality, with EI imbalance causing a loss of whole-brain critical statistics. Using network models we show that a reorganisation of network topology drives this loss of criticality. Seizure dynamics match theoretical predictions for networks driven away from a phase transition into disorder, with the emergence of chaos and a loss of network-mediated separation, dynamic range and metastability. These results demonstrate that EI imbalance drives a pathological deviation from criticality.

                Coordinated movement is thought to be simplified by the nervous system through the activation of muscle synergies. Current approaches to muscle synergy extraction rely on dimensionality reduction algorithms that impose limiting constraints. To capture large-scale interactions between muscle activations, a more generalised approach that considers the complexity and nonlinearity of the motor system is required. Here we developed a novel framework for muscle synergy extraction that relaxes model assumptions by using a combination of information- and network theory and dimensionality reduction. This novel framework can capture spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal interactions, producing distinct spatial groupings and both tonic and phasic temporal patterns. Furthermore, our framework identifies submodular structures in the extracted synergies that exemplify the fractal modularity of the human motor system. To demonstrate the versatility of the methodology, we applied it to two benchmark datasets of arm and whole-body reaching movements. Readily interpretable muscle synergies spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales were identified that demonstrated significant task dependence, ability to capture trial-to-trial fluctuations, a scale-invariance with dataset complexity and a substantial concordance across participants. Finally, we position this framework as a bridge between existing models and recent network-theoretic endeavours by discussing the continuity and novelty of the presented findings.

                A long-range circuit linking anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to primary visual cortex (V1) has been previously proposed to mediate visual selective attention in mice during visually guided behaviour. Here we used in vivo two-photon functional imaging to measure endogenous activity of ACC neurons projecting to layer 1 of V1 (ACC-V1axons) in mice either passively viewing stimuli or performing a go/no-go visually guided task. We observed that while ACC-V1axons were recruited under these conditions, this was not linked to enhancement of neural or behavioural measures of sensory coding. Instead, ACC-V1axon activity was observed to be associated with licking behaviour, modulated by reward, and biased towards task relevant sensory cortex.

                Many natural sounds have frequency spectra composed of integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. This property, known as harmonicity, plays an important role in auditory information processing. However, the extent to which harmonicity influences the processing of sound features beyond pitch is still unclear. This is interesting because harmonic sounds have lower information entropy than inharmonic sounds. According to predictive processing accounts of perception, this property could produce more salient neural responses due to the brain weighting of sensory signals according to their uncertainty. In the present study, we used electroencephalography to investigate brain responses to harmonic and inharmonic sounds commonly occurring in music: piano tones and hi-hat cymbal sounds. In a multi-feature oddball paradigm, we measured mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a responses to timbre, intensity, and location deviants in listeners with and without congenital amusia, an impairment of pitch processing. As hypothesized, we observed larger amplitudes and earlier latencies for harmonic compared to inharmonic sounds for both MMN and P3a responses. These harmonicity effects were modulated by sound feature. Moreover, the difference in P3a latency between harmonic and inharmonic sounds was larger for controls than amusics. We propose an explanation of these results based on predictive coding and discuss the relationship between harmonicity, information entropy, and precision weighting of prediction errors.

                The search for psychiatric biomarkers has remained elusive, in part, due to high comorbidity, low specificity, and poor concordance between neurobiological abnormalities and existing diagnostic categories. Developmental shifts in symptom expression and brain function across the lifespan further complicate biomarker identification. Recent studies suggest that focusing on cognition may be a pathway forward: Cognitive dysfunction is a common feature across psychiatric disorders. Individual differences in cognition may reflect variability in the connectivity of underlying neurocognitive brain networks, and predict psychopathology at different developmental periods. In the present study we identified brain-based dimensions of general cognitive capacity and psychopathology using sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA) in a sample of 7,383 preadolescents from the Adolescent Brian Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. This analysis revealed correlated patterns of functional connectivity with cognitive control capacity and psychopathology. Specifically, the results identified a single connectome-based latent brain variate that was positively correlated with performance on cognitive measures across domains and negatively correlated with parent-reported psychopathology across diagnoses and domains. Functional connectivity loadings for the brain variate were across distributed cortical and subcortical brain networks and a dose-dependent relationship with psychopathology based upon the cumulative number of psychiatric diagnoses was observed. These findings provide preliminary evidence for a connectome-based biomarker that indexes individual differences in cognitive control and predicts transdiagnostic psychopathology in a dose-dependent fashion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Separating neural oscillations from aperiodic 1/f activity: challenges and recommendations</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological power spectra typically consist of two components: An aperiodic part usually following an 1/f power law P{propto}1/f{beta} and periodic components appearing as spectral peaks. While the investigation of the periodic parts, commonly referred to as neural oscillations, has received considerable attention, the study of the aperiodic part has only recently gained more interest. The periodic part is usually quantified by center frequencies, powers, and bandwidths, while the aperiodic part is parameterized by the y-intercept and the 1/f exponent {beta}. For investigation of either part, however, it is essential to separate the two components. In this article, we scrutinize two frequently used methods, FOOOF (Fitting Oscillations & One-Over-F) and IRASA (Irregular Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis), that are commonly used to separate the periodic from the aperiodic component. We evaluate these methods using diverse spectra obtained with electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and local field potential (LFP) recordings relating to three independent research datasets. Each method and each dataset poses distinct challenges for the extraction of both spectral parts. The specific spectral features hindering the periodic and aperiodic separation are highlighted by simulations of power spectra emphasizing these features. Through comparison with the simulation parameters defined a priori, the parameterization error of each method is quantified. Based on the real and simulated power spectra, we evaluate the advantages of both methods, discuss common challenges, note which spectral features impede the separation, assess the computational costs, and propose recommendations on how to use them.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding of cortex-wide brain activity from local recordings of neural potentials</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Electrical recordings of neural activity from brain surface have been widely employed in basic neuroscience research and clinical practice for investigations of neural circuit functions, brain-computer interfaces, and treatments for neurological disorders. Traditionally, these surface potentials have been believed to mainly reflect local neural activity. It is not known how informative the locally recorded surface potentials are for the neural activities across multiple cortical regions. Approach. To investigate that, we perform simultaneous local electrical recording and wide-field calcium imaging in awake head-fixed mice. Using a recurrent neural network model, we try to decode the calcium fluorescence activity of multiple cortical regions from local electrical recordings. Main results. The mean activity of different cortical regions could be decoded from locally recorded surface potentials. Also, each frequency band of surface potentials differentially encodes activities from multiple cortical regions so that including all the frequency bands in the decoding model gives the highest decoding performance. Despite the close spacing between recording channels, surface potentials from different channels provide complementary information about the large-scale cortical activity and the decoding performance continues to improve as more channels are included. Finally, we demonstrate the successful decoding of whole dorsal cortex activity at pixel-level using locally recorded surface potentials. Significance. These results show that the locally recorded surface potentials indeed contain rich information of the large-scale neural activities, which could be further demixed to recover the neural activity across individual cortical regions. In the future, our cross-modality inference approach could be adapted to virtually reconstruct cortex-wide brain activity, greatly expanding the spatial reach of surface electrical recordings without increasing invasiveness. Furthermore, it could be used to facilitate imaging neural activity across the whole cortex in freely moving animals, without requirement of head-fixed microscopy configurations.

                ADHD have been associated with social cognitive impairments across the lifespan, but no studies have specifically addressed the presence of abnormalities in eye-gaze processing in the adult brain. This study investigated the neural basis of eye-gaze perception in adults with ADHD using event-related potentials (ERP). Twenty-three ADHD and 23 controls performed a delayed face-matching task with neutral faces that had either direct or averted gaze. ERPs were classified using microstate analyses. ADHD and controls displayed similar P100 and N170 microstates. ADHD was associated with cluster abnormalities in the attention-sensitive P200 to direct gaze, and in the N250 related to facial recognition. For direct gaze, source localization revealed reduced activity in ADHD for the P200 in the left/midline cerebellum, as well as in a cingulate-occipital network at the N250. These results suggest brain impairments involving eye-gaze decoding in adults with ADHD, suggesting that neural deficits persist across the lifespan.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unifying turbulent dynamics framework distinguishes different brain states</a></h4>

              
                Recently, significant advances have been made by identifying the levels of synchronicity of the underlying dynamics of a given brain state. This research has demonstrated that unconscious dynamics tend to be more synchronous than those found in conscious states, which are more asynchronous. Here we go beyond this dichotomy to demonstrate that the different brain states are always underpinned by spatiotemporal chaos but with dissociable turbulent dynamics. We investigated human neuroimaging data from different brain states (resting state, meditation, deep sleep, and disorders of consciousness after coma) and were able to distinguish between them using complementary model-free and model-based measures of turbulent information transmission. Our model-free approach used recent advances describing a measure of information cascade across spatial scales using tools from turbulence theory. Complementarily, our model-based approach used exhaustive in silico perturbations of whole-brain models fitted to the empirical neuroimaging data, which allowed us to study the information encoding capabilities of the brain states. Overall, the current framework demonstrates that different levels of turbulent dynamics are fundamental for describing and differentiating between brain states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial signatures of anesthesia-induced burst-suppression differ between primates and rodents</a></h4>

              
                During deep anesthesia, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal of the brain alternates between bursts of activity and periods of relative silence (suppressions). The origin of burst-suppression and its distribution across the brain remain matters of debate. In this work, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the brain areas involved in anesthesia-induced burst-suppression across four mammalian species: humans, long-tailed macaques, common marmosets, and rats. At first, we determined the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in human EEG-fMRI data. Applying this method to animal fMRI datasets, we found distinct burst-suppression signatures in all species. The burst-suppression maps revealed a marked inter-species difference: in rats the entire neocortex engaged in burst-suppression, while in primates most sensory areas were excluded--predominantly the primary visual cortex. We anticipate that the identified species-specific fMRI signatures and whole-brain maps will guide future targeted studies investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of burst-suppression in unconscious states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Optimal Policy Model for Concurrent Uncertainty Estimation During Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                We often postpone or even avoid making decisions when we feel uncertain. Uncertainty estimation is not an afterthought of decision making but a dynamic process that accompanies decision making in parallel and affects decision making. To study concurrent uncertainty estimation during decision making, we adapted the classic random-dots motion direction discrimination task to allow a reaction-time measure of uncertainty responses. Subjects were asked to judge whether a patch of random dots was moving left or right. In addition, they could seek assistance by choosing to look at a second stimulus that had the same direction but high coherence any time during the task. The task allows us to measure the reaction time of both the perceptual decisions and the uncertainty responses. The subjects were more likely to choose the uncertainty response when the motion coherence was low, while their reaction times of the uncertainty responses showed individual variations. To account for the subjects' behavior, we created an optimal policy decision model in which decisions are based on the value functions computed from the accumulated evidence using a drift-diffusion process. Model simulations captured key features of the subjects' choices, reaction times, and proportions of uncertainty responses. Varying model parameters explained individual variations in the subjects and the correlations between decision accuracy, proportions of uncertainty responses, and reaction times at the individual level. Our model links perceptual decisions and value-based decisions and indicates that concurrent uncertainty estimation may be based on comparisons between values of uncertainty responses and perceptual decisions, both of which may be derived from the same evidence accumulation process during decision making. It provides a theoretical framework for future investigations, including the ones that aim at the underlying neural mechanism.

	<p>We aimed to evaluate diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in infants born extremely preterm, to determine the effect of erythropoietin (Epo) on DTI, and to correlate DTI with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age for infants in the Preterm Erythropoietin Neuroprotection (PENUT) Trial. Infants who underwent MRI with DTI at 36 weeks postmenstrual age were included. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III). Generalized linear models were used to assess the association between DTI parameters and treatment group, and then with neurodevelopmental outcomes. A total of 101 placebo- and 93 Epo-treated infants underwent MRI. DTI white matter mean diffusivity (MD) was lower in placebo- compared to Epo-treated infants in the cingulate and occipital regions, and occipital white matter fractional isotropy (FA) was lower in infants born at 24–25 weeks vs. 26–27 weeks. These values were not associated with lower BSID-III scores. Certain decreases in clustering coefficients tended to have lower BSID-III scores. Consistent with the PENUT Trial findings, there was no effect on long-term neurodevelopment in Epo-treated infants even in the presence of microstructural changes identified by DTI.</p>

	<p>The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that has been linked to changes in brain structure and function as well as to different biological subtypes of the disease. The present study aimed to investigate the association of APOE ε4 genotypes with brain functional impairment, as assessed by quantitative EEG (qEEG) in patients on the AD continuum. The study population included 101 amyloid positive patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 50) and AD (n = 51) that underwent resting-state EEG recording and CSF Aβ42 analysis. In total, 31 patients were APOE ε4 non-carriers, 42 were carriers of one, and 28 were carriers of two APOE ε4 alleles. Quantitative EEG analysis included computation of the global field power (GFP) and global field synchronization (GFS) in conventional frequency bands. Amyloid positive patients who were carriers of APOE ε4 allele(s) had significantly higher GFP beta and significantly lower GFS in theta and beta bands compared to APOE ε4 non-carriers. Increased global EEG power in beta band in APOE ε4 carriers may represent a brain functional compensatory mechanism that offsets global EEG slowing in AD patients. Our findings suggest that decreased EEG measures of global synchronization in theta and beta bands reflect brain functional deficits related to the APOE ε4 genotype in patients that are on a biomarker-verified AD continuum.</p>

	<p>Asymmetrical lower limb weakness is an early symptom and significant contributor to the progressive worsening of walking ability in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may effectively increase neural drive to the more-affected lower limb and, therefore, increase symmetrical activation. Four PwMS (1 female, age range: 27–57) underwent one session each of 3 mA or SHAM tDCS over the motor cortex corresponding to their more-affected limb followed by 20 min of treadmill walking at a self-selected speed. Two min into the treadmill task, the subjects were injected with the glucose analog [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Immediately after treadmill walking, the subjects underwent whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Glucose uptake (GU) values were compared between the legs, the spatial distribution of FDG was assessed to estimate glucose uptake heterogeneity (GUh), and GU asymmetry indices (AIs) were calculated. After tDCS, GU was altered, and GUh was decreased in various muscle groups in each subject. Additionally, AIs went from asymmetric to symmetric after tDCS in the subjects that demonstrated asymmetrical glucose uptake during SHAM. These results indicate that tDCS improved GU asymmetries, potentially from an increased neural drive and a more efficient muscle activation strategy of the lower limb in PwMS.</p>

	<p>In the field of time psychology, the functional significance of the contingent negative variation (CNV) component in time perception and whether the processing mechanisms of sub- and supra-second are similar or different still remain unclear. In the present study, event-related potential (ERP) technology and classical temporal discrimination tasks were used to explore the neurodynamic patterns of sub- and supra-second time perception. In Experiment 1, the standard interval (SI) was fixed at 500 ms, and the comparison interval (CI) ranged from 200 ms to 800 ms. In Experiment 2, the SI was fixed at 2000 ms, and the CI ranged from 1400 ms to 2600 ms. Participants were required to judge whether the CI was longer or shorter than the SI. The ERP results showed similar CNV activity patterns in the two experiments. Specifically, CNV amplitude would be more negative when the CI was longer or closer to the memorized SI. CNV peak latency increased significantly until the CI reached the memorized SI. We propose that CNV amplitude might reflect the process of temporal comparison, and CNV peak latency might represent the process of temporal decision-making. To our knowledge, it is the first ERP task explicitly testing the two temporal scales, sub- and supra-second timing, in one study. Taken together, the present study reveals a similar functional significance of CNV between sub- and supra-second time perception.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep disorders and sleep problems commonly occur in adults with ADHD and add to functional impairment. Evidence-based treatments for sleep could improve function in the adult ADHD population. Methods: A literature review was conducted to present the clinical science informing treatment of sleep in adults with ADHD. Results: Six systematic prospective studies of sleep intervention in adults with ADHD were identified. Three of these, all including well-characterized ADHD patients, offered evidence for a significant effect of morning light therapy. Across the studies, preliminary evidence for melatonin, behavioral therapy, and weighted blankets were also found. Implication: Low-risk interventions such as light therapy may improve sleep in adults with ADHD, but many sleep interventions currently in use remain unstudied in the ADHD population. Considerations for evidence-informed practice and future research directions are discussed.</p>

                Background: Banks and financial institutions are vulnerable to money laundering (ML) as a result of crime proceeds infiltrating banks in the form of significant cash deposits. Improved financial crime compliance processes and systems enable anti-ML (AML) analysts to devote considerable time and effort to case investigation and process quality work, thereby lowering financial risks by reporting suspicious activity in a timely and effective manner. This study uses Job Characteristics Theory (JCT) to evaluate the AML system through the job satisfaction and motivation of its users. The purpose of this study is to determine how satisfied AML personnel are with their jobs and how motivated they are to work with the system. Methods: This cross-sectional study used JCT to investigate the important elements impacting employee satisfaction with the AML system. The five core dimensions of the job characteristics were measured using a job diagnostic survey. The respondents were employees working in the AML department of a Malaysian bank, and the sample group was chosen using a purposive sampling approach. A total of 100 acceptable replies were gathered and analysed using various statistical approaches. A motivating potential score was generated for each employee based on five main job characteristics. Results: Findings revealed that five core job characteristics, namely, skill diversity, task identity, task importance, autonomy and feedback, positively influence the AML system employees’ job satisfaction. However, skill variety and autonomy are found to be low, which are reflected in the poor motivating potential score. Conclusion: This study examined the characteristics of the AML system and its users’ job satisfaction. Findings revealed that task significance is the most widely recognised characteristic, followed by feedback and task identity. However, there is a lack of skill variety and autonomy, which must be addressed to improve employee satisfaction with the AML system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Seroprevalence and characterisation of herpes simplex virus from human immunodeficiency virus in samples collected from two provinces in South Africa: a retrospective study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a widely distributed human pathogen that is known for its ulcerative lesions at the infection site. HSV can cause persistent infection in the host that is often followed by a period of latency within the neurons. Considering the high rate of HIV infection in South Africa, it is important to assess the seroprevalence of HSV with a focus to determine the epidemiological association between HSV-DNA and HIV-1 in the population. Methods: A total of 44 sera samples were screened for HSV and HIV-1 using the highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA positive samples were characterized using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the positivity of both viruses and to further differentiate HSV into HSV-1 and -2. Thereafter, the samples were analysed for relatedness using phylogenetic analysis. Results: Of the 44 samples, 36 (81.8%) were positive for HIV-1, while 35 (79.5%) were positive for HSV when screened with ELISA kits. The PCR results, with the use of type specific primers, showed that 4/35 (11.4%) samples were specific for HSV-1 while 30/35 (85.7%) were specific for HSV-2. Statistical analysis performed using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test showed that there is a significant relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 transmission. Conclusions:There is a significant relationship between HSV-2 and HIV-1 in the study population. Our study shows that some of the HSV-2 isolates are not related to the clinical isolate SD90e from South Africa, suggesting diversity in HSV-2 viral transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">State transitions through inhibitory interneurons in a cortical network model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Bryson, Samuel F. Berkovic, Steven Petrou, David B. Grayden</p>

Inhibitory interneurons shape the spiking characteristics and computational properties of cortical networks. Interneuron subtypes can precisely regulate cortical function but the roles of interneuron subtypes for promoting different regimes of cortical activity remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the impact of fast spiking and non-fast spiking interneuron subtypes on cortical activity using a network model with connectivity and synaptic properties constrained by experimental data. We found that network properties were more sensitive to modulation of the fast spiking population, with reductions of fast spiking excitability generating strong spike correlations and network oscillations. Paradoxically, reduced fast spiking excitability produced a reduction of global excitation-inhibition balance and features of an inhibition stabilised network, in which firing rates were driven by the activity of excitatory neurons within the network. Further analysis revealed that the synaptic interactions and biophysical features associated with fast spiking interneurons, in particular their rapid intrinsic response properties and short synaptic latency, enabled this state transition by enhancing gain within the excitatory population. Therefore, fast spiking interneurons may be uniquely positioned to control the strength of recurrent excitatory connectivity and the transition to an inhibition stabilised regime. Overall, our results suggest that interneuron subtypes can exert selective control over excitatory gain allowing for differential modulation of global network state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Visual perception of texture regularity: Conjoint measurements and a wavelet response-distribution model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hua-Chun Sun, David St-Amand, Curtis L. Baker Jr., Frederick A. A. Kingdom</p>

Texture regularity, such as the repeating pattern in a carpet, brickwork or tree bark, is a ubiquitous feature of the visual world. The perception of regularity has generally been studied using multi-element textures in which the degree of regularity has been manipulated by adding random jitter to the elements’ positions. Here we used three-factor Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurement (MLCM) for the first time to investigate the encoding of regularity information under more complex conditions in which element spacing and size, in addition to positional jitter, were manipulated. Human observers were presented with large numbers of pairs of multi-element stimuli with varying levels of the three factors, and indicated on each trial which stimulus appeared more regular. All three factors contributed to regularity perception. Jitter, as expected, strongly affected regularity perception. This effect of jitter on regularity perception is strongest at small element spacing and large texture element size, suggesting that the visual system utilizes the edge-to-edge distance between elements as the basis for regularity judgments. We then examined how the responses of a bank of Gabor wavelet spatial filters might account for our results. Our analysis indicates that the peakedness of the spatial frequency (SF) distribution, a previously favored proposal, is insufficient for regularity encoding since it varied more with element spacing and size than with jitter. Instead, our results support the idea that the visual system may extract texture regularity information from the moments of the SF-distribution across orientation. In our best-performing model, the variance of SF-distribution skew across orientations can explain 70% of the variance of estimated texture regularity from our data, suggesting that it could provide a candidate read-out for perceived regularity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau‐Atrophy Variability Reveals Phenotypic Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tau neurofibrillary tangles (T) are the primary driver of downstream neurodegeneration (N) and subsequent cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is substantial variability in the T-N relationship – manifested in higher or lower atrophy than expected for level of tau in a given brain region. The goal of this study was to determine if region-based quantitation of this variability allows for identification of underlying modulatory factors, including polypathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cortical thickness (N) and <sup>18</sup>F-Flortaucipir SUVR (T) were computed in 104 gray matter regions from a cohort of cognitively-impaired, amyloid-positive (A+) individuals. Region-specific residuals from a robust linear fit between SUVR and cortical thickness were computed as a surrogate for T-N mismatch. A summary T-N mismatch metric defined using residuals were correlated with demographic and imaging-based modulatory factors, and to partition the cohort into data-driven subgroups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The summary T-N mismatch metric correlated with underlying factors such as age and burden of white matter hyperintensity lesions. Data-driven subgroups based on clustering of residuals appear to represent different biologically relevant phenotypes, with groups showing distinct spatial patterns of higher or lower atrophy than expected.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data support the notion that a measure of deviation from a normative relationship between tau burden and neurodegeneration across brain regions in individuals on the AD continuum captures variability due to multiple underlying factors, and can reveal phenotypes, which if validated, may help identify possible contributors to neurodegeneration in addition to tau, which may ultimately be useful for cohort selection in clinical trials.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Sorbitol is a severity biomarker for PMM2‐CDG with therapeutic implications</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor increases PMM enzyme activity in a PMM2-CDG worm-model. Epalrestat also decreases sorbitol level in diabetic neuropathy. We evaluated the genetic, biochemical and clinical characteristics including the Nijmegen Progression CDG Rating Scale, urine polyol levels and fibroblast glycoproteomics in PMM2-CDG patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed PMM enzyme measurements, multiplexed proteomics and glycoproteomics in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts before and after epalrestat treatment. Safety and efficacy of 0.8mg/kg/day oral epalrestat were studied in a child with PMM2-CDG for 12 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PMM enzyme activity increased post-epalrestat treatment. Compared to controls, 24% of glycopeptides had reduced abundance in PMM2-deficient fibroblasts, 46% of which improved upon treatment. Total protein N-glycosylation improved upon epalrestat treatment bringing overall glycosylation towards the control fibroblasts’ glycosylation profile. Sorbitol levels were increased in the urine of 74% of PMM2-CDG patients and correlated with the presence of peripheral neuropathy, and CDG severity rating scale. In the child with PMM2-CDG on epalrestat treatment, ataxia scores improved together with significant growth improvement. Urinary sorbitol levels nearly normalized in 3 months and blood transferrin glycosylation normalized in 6 months.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Epalrestat improved PMM enzyme activity, N-glycosylation and glycosylation biomarkers in vitro. Leveraging cellular glycoproteome assessment, we provided a systems-level view of treatment efficacy and discovered potential novel biosignatures of therapy response. Epalrestat was well-tolerated and led to significant clinical improvements in the first PMM2-CDG pediatric patient treated with epalrestat. We also propose urinary sorbitol as a novel biomarker for disease severity and treatment response in future clinical trials in PMM2-CDG.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Knowledge, attitude, and behaviours on diet, physical activity, and tobacco use among school students: A cross-sectional study in two Indian states [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are escalating in India and can be attributed to behavioural risk factors such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use that began in early years. Understanding adolescents’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviours (KAB) related to NCD risk factors would inform the development of school-based health programmes to prevent NCDs. Methods: Sixth-grade students (n=1026) in 20 schools (10 private, 10 public) from two Indian cities (n=667 from Pune; n=359 from Bengaluru) participated in a KAB survey in 2019. Differences in KAB by gender, school type within cities were investigated. Results: Knowledge about the harms of tobacco use was higher than knowledge about a healthy diet and importance of physical activity. Only a small proportion of students did not eat breakfast (8.7%) or fruits (11.3%) daily. Only 33.4% of students read nutrition labels before choosing their food. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity of less than an hour per day was reported by 42.5% of students. Approximately one-third of students had ever tried smoking tobacco (30.1%), smokeless tobacco (30.5%), and e-cigarettes (32.4%). Differences in these behaviours by gender and school type showed that both boys, girls and students of private and public schools are vulnerable. Conclusions: The study findings highlight that knowledge is low for thematic areas like diet and physical activity. While knowledge of tobacco related harms is better but the prevalence of ever tobacco use was found to be high. Socio-demographic factors such as school type and gender had a varying effect on various KAB indicators. There is a need to strengthen health education activities by developing context-specific health intervention materials by engaging school children, their parents, teachers, and communities to promote healthy behaviours among adolescents. Need to augment school health programmes in India with a differential approach based on the issues, specific to school type and city.

                Background: Rural clinics still have X-ray facilities that produce physical films, which are sent to the nearest hospital for evaluation.  Purchasing digitalization facilities is costly, thus, sending digitized films to the radiologist may be a solution.  This can be achieved via digital photo capture.  However, there can be different output resolutions that may not be optimized for online diagnosis.  This paper investigates if digitized X-ray films can be enhanced using image processing techniques of Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Normalized-CLAHE (N-CLAHE) and Min-Max Normalized-CLAHE (MMCLAHE).        Methods: We collected and digitized 21 X-ray films with low, medium, and high resolutions and implemented the CLAHE, N-CLAHE and MMCLAHE image enhancement. These methods introduced a limit to clip the histogram of image intensities so as to reduce any noise amplification before file compression with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).  Quantitative metrics of the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean-Squared Error (MSE) were used to compare the accuracies between digitized and processed X-ray films.  A qualitative evaluation was performed by a medical practitioner to validate the accuracy of enhanced digitized X-ray.  Results: It had been found that both CLAHE and MMCLAHE provided good average PSNR values of 31dB - 32dB and produced low MSE values compared to N-CLAHE.  The results of qualitative evaluation attained 89.9% correct diagnosis on nine randomly selected images.  Generally, the evaluation indicated that the results fulfill the acceptable criteria for further evaluation and there seemed to be no pathological differences observed. Conclusion: This paper presented a proof of concept on an implementation of the CLAHE technique and its variations on digitized X-ray films.  This paper had shown potential improvements with the proposed enhancement methods that may contribute to an increase efficiency in healthcare processes at rural clinics.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Intracranial hypertension in an adult-onset Still’s disease patient initially presented with prolonged fever [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This article describes the case of a 19-year-old woman who presented with prolonged fever, positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and splenomegaly. Pulmonary infiltrates were discovered and the patient was treated for community-acquired pneumonia, with no clinical amelioration. A more thorough evaluation was subsequently made, revealing elevated serum IgE and IgG4 levels and negative ANA tested by the hospital’s laboratory with two methods. During hospitalization thrombocytopenia, liver function test impairment, and evanescent rash during some febrile episodes developed. Vomiting also presented without any concomitant symptoms or signs; a funduscopic examination was consequently ordered, showing bilateral papilledema. Brain imaging was totally normal but a lumbar puncture revealed elevated opening pressure and lymphocytic pleocytosis along with low cerebrospinal fluid lactate dehydrogenase (CSF LDH). The patient was empirically treated with antimicrobials, dexamethasone, and acetazolamide and had immediate clinical and laboratory improvement. Diagnostic workup, however, was negative for an infectious agent; antimicrobials were ceased but the patient continued to improve. Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) was considered as the working diagnosis because the patient fulfilled Yamaguchi criteria, responded to corticosteroids, and an alternative diagnosis was lacking. Nevertheless, because of the patient’s atypical features a trial to discontinue dexamethasone was undertaken, leading to immediate recurrence; the possibility of a self-limiting viral illness was excluded. Thrombocytopenia was attributed to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) that complicated AOSD. Corticosteroid reinitiation combined with methotrexate fully controlled all clinical and laboratory parameters. One month later papilledema had disappeared and the patient remained symptom-free even without acetazolamide. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of an AOSD case presenting intracranial hypertension without cerebral imaging abnormalities and neurological or meningeal symptoms and signs, as well as with the initial observation of serum IgG4 elevation. A classic regimen combined with acetazolamide led to a positive outcome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy safety and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for prophylactic treatment in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients with severe hemophilia often present with painful joint and soft tissue bleeding which may restrict them from their daily activities. The current standard of care still relies on a regular prophylactic factor VIII (FVIII), which has a high daily treatment burden. Recently, rurioctocog alfa pegol, a third-generation recombinant FVIII with a modification in its polyethylene glycol (PEG) component, has been developed. Several trials have studied this synthetic drug as bleeding prophylaxis in severe hemophilia A. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. Methods: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA guidelines. Data were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Wiley Online Library, and CINAHL (via EBSCOhost). Study qualities were assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Modified Jadad scales. Results: Four studies involving 517 previously treated severe hemophilia A patients were included in this study. The pooled mean of total annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and hemostatic efficacy was 2.59 (95% CI = 2.04–3.14) and 92% (95% CI = 85%–97%), respectively. Only 30 (2.3%) non-serious and one (1.4%) serious adverse events were considered related to rurioctocog alfa pegol treatment. At the end of the studies, no development of FVIII inhibitory antibodies was observed. None of the developed binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG-FVIII, or PEG was correlated to the treatment efficacy and safety. Conclusions: Despite the limited availability of direct comparison studies, our analyses indicate that rurioctocog alfa pegol could serve as a safe and effective alternative for bleeding prophylaxis in previously treated hemophilia A patients. Moreover, it appears to have low immunogenicity, which further increases the safety profile of the drug in such clinical conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Reframing organizations in the digital age: A qualitative study exploring institutional social media adoption [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social media is changing the modern academic landscape; this study sought to explore how organizational structures support or inhibit the harnessing of social media use in academic contexts and knowledge translation. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using framework analysis based on the Bolman and Deal’s Four-Frame Model—structural, human resources, political and symbolic. The research team used the snowball sampling technique to recruit participants following the completion of each participant’s semi-structured interview. A member check was completed to ensure rigour. Results: 16 social media educators and experts from several countries participated in the study. Study findings showed that within the Structural Frame, institution types were reported to have with diverse hierarchical structures, ranging from strict to malleable: hospital-based (strict), education institutional-based and online only groups (malleable). The Human Resources Frame revealed that most participants’ social media organizations operated on unpaid volunteer staff. The training of these staff was primarily via role-modeling and mentorship. Regarding the Political Frame, social media helped participants accumulate scholarly currency and influence within their field of practice. Symbolic Frame showed a wide range of traditional to non-traditional organizational supports, which interacted with both intrinsic to extrinsic motivation. Conclusions: Bolman and Deal’s Four-Frame Model framework may serve as an effective guideline for academic leaders who wish to strategically implement or enhance social media use into their organizations. The key insights that we have gained from our participants are how new emerging forms of scholarly pursuits can be more effectively enabled or hindered by the attributes of the organization within which these are occurring.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Thermal comfort optimization through bioclimatic design in Mediterranean cities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bioclimatic design is an approach based on local climate which improves thermal qualities and indoor comfort. Buildings follow this process to minimize negative effects on the environment. However, this approach is still not suitable in developed countries. This study aims to investigate Mediterranean local bioclimatic strategies’ impact on thermal comfort efficiency in housing, by examining architectural elements and treatments. Methods: We adopted a descriptive, analytical, and comparative methodology, complemented with a software simulation, within a qualitative and quantitative approach. Investigation and methodological tools were based on technical information including plans, elevations, photos, and documentation. The approach consisted of multiple stages: a literature review interpreting the concept of bioclimatic design, as well as thermal comfort variables and common Mediterranean building features. Moreover, the paper showcases three examples of successful Mediterranean passive houses. Furthermore, the paper presents a case- studyhouse in Alex West, Alexandria, designed in the Mediterranean Revival style. Results: The results showed that the most influencing building features on thermal comfort were the low-pitched roofs and the top chimney, which achieved 12.6% and 5% improvement in the summer and 13% and 6.8% in winter, respectively. The pergola and porch elements barely had an effect when placed on the northern façade. However, on the southern façade, a positive contribution in the summer by 1.4% and 3.4% respectively were reported, but a slight negative impact in winter by 0.5% and 2% respectively. Conclusions:  We examined the impact of common Mediterranean building features , and compared thermal comfort results between case-study houses. Features focusing on passive design for cooling rather than heating, allowing wind flow for maximized natural ventilation, using ventilated pitched roof spaces, using sun shading elements in the proper facades and angles, help passive thermal regulation. The study proposes recommendations for optimizing thermal comfort in residential buildings in Alexandria, Egypt.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) does not respond well to immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. Chronic activation of microglia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of PPMS. The antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) reduces the activity of human microglia and has neuroprotective effects in vitro.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a single-arm, phase II futility trial of 200 mg oral HCQ twice daily for 18 months. In an effort to investigate disability worsening in the absence of overt focal inflammation, we excluded participants with contrast enhancing lesions on a screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary end point was ≥20% worsening on the timed 25-foot walk measured between 6 and 18 months of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Based on original trial data, 40% of the cohort were expected to worsen. We used a Simon 2-stage design to compare a null hypothesis of 40% of the cohort worsening against the one-sided alternative of 20%. Using a 5% type 1 error rate and 80% power, HCQ treatment would be deemed successful if fewer than 10 of 35 participants experienced clinically significant worsening. The study met its primary end point, as only 8 of 35 participants worsened between 6 and 18 months. HCQ was overall well-tolerated, with adverse events in 82% and serious adverse events in 12% of participants. All serious adverse events were unlikely related to HCQ use.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>HCQ treatment was associated with reduced disability worsening in people with PPMS. HCQ is a promising treatment candidate in PPMS and should be investigated further in randomized controlled clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Stacked deep analytic model for human activity recognition on a UCI HAR database [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Owing to low cost and ubiquity, human activity recognition using smartphones is emerging as a trendy mobile application in diverse appliances such as assisted living, healthcare monitoring, etc. Analysing this one-dimensional time-series signal is rather challenging due to its spatial and temporal variances. Numerous deep neural networks (DNNs) are conducted to unveil deep features of complex real-world data. However, the drawback of DNNs is the un-interpretation of the network's internal logic to achieve the output. Furthermore, a huge training sample size (i.e. millions of samples) is required to ensure great performance. Methods In this work, a simpler yet effective stacked deep network, known as Stacked Discriminant Feature Learning (SDFL), is proposed to analyse inertial motion data for activity recognition. Contrary to DNNs, this deep model extracts rich features without the prerequisite of a gigantic training sample set and tenuous hyper-parameter tuning. SDFL is a stacking deep network with multiple learning modules, appearing in a serialized layout for multi-level feature learning from shallow to deeper features. In each learning module, Rayleigh coefficient optimized learning is accomplished to extort discriminant features. A subject-independent protocol is implemented where the system model (trained by data from a group of users) is used to recognize data from another group of users. Results Empirical results demonstrate that SDFL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including DNNs like Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Belief Network, etc., with ~97% accuracy from the UCI HAR database with thousands of training samples. Additionally, the model training time of SDFL is merely a few minutes, compared with DNNs, which require hours for model training. Conclusions The supremacy of SDFL is corroborated in analysing motion data for human activity recognition requiring no GPU but only a CPU with a fast- learning rate.

                Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder, categorized into various subtypes. Post-infection IBS may be attributed to the release of cytolethal distending toxin B (CdtB), which cross-reacts with the adhesion protein vinculin responsible for normal intestinal contractility. Objective: This study aims to identify anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin levels in IBS patients compared to healthy control. Subjects and methods: This retrospective case-control study was conducted on 100 subjects with IBS, as determined by a questionnaire based on Rome III criteria, recruited from the outpatient clinics of the Tropical Medicine at Mansoura University Hospital from January 2019 to January 2020. Results: The optical density (OD) results of the anti-vinculin and anti-CdtB levels were significantly elevated in patients with IBS (1.58±0.496 OD, 2.47±0.60 OD)  when compared to control subjects (1.13±0.249 OD, 2.1±0.24 OD), respectively with P=0.001 for both.  Anti-vinculin level was significantly higher in the IBS-D subtype than the other subtypes (P=0.001) while, Anti-CdtB was significantly elevated in IBS-C, IBS-D subgroups compared to control subjects (P=0.001). Conclusion: Findings of the present study support the hypothesis that IBS results from post-infectious disorders initiated by bacterial enteritis. A hypothesis could be applied to all IBS subgroups. On the other hand. These biomarkers might reflect the post-infectious state's severity.

                Background Due to the high demand of robots to perform several industrial tasks, such as welding, machining, pick and place, position control in robotics has attracted high attention recently. Controllers’ improvement is also continuous specifically in terms of design simplicity and performance accuracy. This research plans to obtain the SimMechanics model of a two-degree of freedom (DOF) robot and to propose an integrated controller of a proportional–derivative (PD) controller and a fuzzy logic (FL) controller. Methodology The SimMechanics model of the 2-DOF robot is obtained using MATLAB SimMechanics toolbox from a CAD assembly design of the 2-DOF robot. Then, the proposed PD-FL integrated controller is designed and simulated in MATLAB Simulink. The PD controller is widely used for its simplicity, but it doesn’t have a satisfactory performance in difficult tasks. Furthermore, the FL controller is also easy for design and implementation even by non-experts in control theory, but it has the disadvantage of long computational time for multi-input systems due to the increased fuzzy rules. Results The FL controller is integrated with the PD controller for enhanced performance of the 2-DOF robot. The PD-FL integrated controller is developed and tested to control the 2-DOF robot for point-to-point position control and also tip trajectory tracking (TTT) such as triangular TTT and rhombic TTT. Conclusion The PD-FL integrated controller demonstrates enhanced performance compared to the conventional PD controller in both point-to-point position control and TTT. Furthermore, the PD-FL integrated controller has the advantage of less fuzzy rules which helps to overcome the computational time issue of the FL controller.

                Background: In November 2011, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care released guidelines for screening women at average breast cancer risk. Weak recommendations (framed using GRADE methodology) were made for screening women aged 50 to 74 years every two to three years, and for not screening women aged 40 to 49 years. Methods: We conducted an interrupted time series analysis using administrative data to examine bilateral mammography use before and after a national guideline dissemination strategy targeting primary care physicians. Women aged 40 to 74 years living in Ontario or Alberta from 30th November 2008 to 30th November 2014 were included. Strata included age, region of residence, neighbourhood income quintile, immigration status, and education level. Results: In both provinces, mammography use rates were lower in the post-intervention period (527 vs. 556 and 428 vs. 465/1000 participant-months - the monthly screening rate/1000 - in Ontario and Alberta, respectively). In Ontario, mammography trends decreased following guideline release to align with recommendations for women aged 40 to 74 (decrease of 2.21/1000 women, SE 0.26/1000, p<0.0001). In Alberta, mammography trends decreased for women aged 40 to 49 years (3/1000 women, SE 0.32, p<0.001) and 50 to 69 (2.9/1000 women, SE 0.79, p<0.001), but did not change for women aged 70 to 74 (0.7/1000 women, SE 1.23, p=0.553). In both provinces, trends in mammography use rates were sustained for up to three years after guideline release. Conclusions: The guideline dissemination strategy appeared to increase uptake of guideline-concordant screening practice in women aged 40 to 49 years in Ontario and Alberta and for women aged 50 to 74 years in Ontario. Further work is required to understand these findings and whether shared decision making about mammography between women and providers increased among women considering mammography.

     alt="Hemispheric cortical atrophy and chronic microglial activation following mild focal ischemic stroke in adult male rats"/>
<p>Localised injection of ET-1 to the motor cortex resulted in focal ischemic damage causing neuronal loss. Despite the asymptomatic nature of this model of stroke, lacking motor or cognitive impairment, chronic inflammation and hemispheric atrophy developed over time. These findings highlight that even mild stroke can result in long-term pathological outcomes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Animal modeling has played an important role in our understanding of the pathobiology of stroke. The vast majority of this research has focused on the acute phase following severe forms of stroke that result in clear behavioral deficits. Human stroke, however, can vary widely in severity and clinical outcome. There is a rapidly building body of work suggesting that milder ischemic insults can precipitate functional impairment, including cognitive decline, that continues through the chronic phase after injury. Here we show that a small infarction localized to the frontal motor cortex of rats following injection of endothelin-1 results in an essentially asymptomatic state based on motor and cognitive testing, and yet produces significant histopathological change including remote atrophy and inflammation that persists up to 1 year. While there is understandably a major focus in stroke research on mitigating the acute consequences of primary infarction, these results point to progressive atrophy and chronic inflammation as additional targets for intervention in the chronic phase after injury. The present rodent model provides an important platform for further work in this area.</p>

     alt="Iron deficiency in pregnancy: Influence on sleep, behavior, and molecular markers of adult male offspring"/>
<p>The exercise during the adult life of the offspring, associated with iron supplementation during the pregnancies, proved to be of benefit. However, no relation was found between iron restriction in fetal programming and the occurrence of restless legs syndrome phenotype.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Iron restriction during pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency and changes in the dopaminergic system in the adulthood of offspring, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) is closely related to these changes. Objectives: Analyze whether iron restriction during pregnancy would cause changes in the behavior, sleep, and dopaminergic system of the male offspring. In addition, we aimed to assess whether exercise would be able to modulate these variables. The pregnant rats (Wistar) were divided into four groups with different concentrations of iron in the diet: standard (St), supplementation (Su), restriction since weaning (R1), and restriction only during pregnancy (R2). After birth, the offspring were assigned to their respective groups according to the dams diet (St, Su, R1, and R2) and distributed into sedentary (SD) and exercised (EX) (for 8 weeks of training), reaching eight groups of offspring (O): OSt SD, OSt EX, OSu SD, OSu EX, OR1 SD, OR1 EX, OR2 SD, and OR2 EX. Sleep, behavior, and analysis of key genes of dopaminergic system (D2, DAT) were performed after 8 weeks. The results for trained offspring that the mother received supplementation diet were the most expressive, with increased freezing and the OR1 SD group showed an increase in DAT protein content. These changes may have been due to the association between the dams diet during pregnancy and the practice of exercise by the offspring. The different concentrations of iron during pregnancy caused changes in the offspring, however, they were not associated with fetal programming in the context of RLS.</p>

                Neurological symptoms and varying levels of central nervous system (CNS) immunopathology have been described in COVID-19. Recent reports suggest an increased level of innate immune activation associated with CNS border areas, as well as a compartmentalized cytokine response and dysregulated, auto-reactive CSF immune profile. However, it remains contested whether these changes reflect bystander effects of systemic inflammation or relate to CNS-specific viral infection. In this article, we summarize some of the key findings pertaining this ongoing debate and highlight directions for future investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The dorsal raphe nucleus in the control of energy balance</a></h4>

              
                Energy balance is orchestrated by an extended network of highly interconnected nuclei across the central nervous system. While much is known about the hypothalamic circuits regulating energy homeostasis, the ‘extra-hypothalamic’ circuits involved are relatively poorly understood. In this review, we focus on the brainstem’s dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), integrating decades of research linking this structure to the physiologic and behavioral responses that maintain proper energy stores. DRN neurons sense and respond to interoceptive and exteroceptive cues related to energy imbalance and in turn induce appropriate alterations in energy intake and expenditure.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">How REM sleep shapes hypothalamic computations for feeding behavior</a></h4>

              
                The electrical activity of diverse brain cells is modulated across states of vigilance, namely wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Enhanced activity of neuronal circuits during NREM sleep impacts on subsequent awake behaviors, yet the significance of their activation, or lack thereof, during REM sleep remains unclear. This review focuses on feeding-promoting cells in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) that express the vesicular GABA and glycine transporter (vgat) as a model to further understand the impact of REM sleep on neural encoding of goal-directed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Genome instability independent of type I interferon signaling drives neuropathology caused by impaired ribonucleotide excision repair</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in RNASEH2 are linked to Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Aditi et al. show that RNASEH2 is necessary for neurogenesis and to avoid activation of interferon-responsive genes. These defects are rescued by p53 but not cGAS inactivation, suggesting that DNA damage signaling, not neuroinflammation, accounts for neuropathology in this class of disease.
