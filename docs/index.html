                Caveolins are a family of transmembrane proteins located in caveolae, small lipid raft invaginations of the plasma membrane. The roles of caveolin-enriched lipid rafts are diverse, and include mechano-protection, lipid homeostasis, metabolism, transport, and cell signaling. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and other caveolins were described in endothelial cells and later in various other cell types of the central nervous system (CNS), including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and pericytes. This pancellular presence of caveolins demands a better understanding of their functional roles in each cell type. In this review we describe the various functions of Cav-1 in the cells of normal and pathological brains. Several emerging preclinical findings suggest that Cav-1 could represent a potential therapeutic target in brain disorders.

">Food texture preference reveals multisensory contributions of gustatory organs in behaviour and physiology</a></h4>

              
                Summary Food presents a multisensory experience, with visual, taste, and olfactory cues being important in allowing an animal to determine the safety and nutritional value of a given substance. Texture, however, remains a surprisingly unexplored aspect, despite providing key information about the state of the food through properties such as hardness, liquidity, and granularity. Food perception is achieved by specialised sensory neurons, which themselves are defined by the receptor genes they express. While it was assumed that sensory neurons respond to one or few closely-related stimuli, more recent findings challenge this notion and support evidence that certain sensory neurons are more broadly tuned. In the Drosophila taste system, gustatory neurons respond to cues of opposing hedonic valence or to olfactory cues. Here, we identified that larvae ingest and navigate towards specific food substrate hardnesses, and probed the role of gustatory organs in this behaviour. By developing a genetic tool targeting specifically gustatory organs, we show that these organs are major contributors for evaluation of food texture and ingestion decision-making. We find that ablation of gustatory organs not only results in loss of chemosensation, but also navigation and ingestion preference to varied substrate textures. Furthermore, we show that certain neurons in the primary taste organ exhibit varied and concurrent physiological responses to mechanical and multimodal stimulation. We show that individual neurons house independent mechanisms for multiple sensory modalities, challenging assumptions about capabilities of sensory neurons. We propose that further investigations, across the animal kingdom, may reveal higher sensory complexity than currently anticipated.

">Pan-cortical cellular imaging in freely behaving mice using a miniaturized micro-camera array microscope (mini-MCAM)</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how circuits in the brain simultaneously coordinate their activity to mediate complex ethnologically relevant behaviors requires recording neural activities from distributed populations of neurons in freely behaving animals. Current miniaturized imaging microscopes are typically limited to imaging a relatively small field of view, precluding the measurement of neural activities across multiple brain regions. Here we present a miniaturized micro-camera array microscope (mini-MCAM) that consists of four fluorescence imaging micro-cameras, each capable of capturing neural activity across a 4.5 mm x 2.55 mm field of view (FOV). Cumulatively, the mini-MCAM images over 30 mm2 area of sparsely expressed GCaMP6s neurons distributed throughout the dorsal cortex, in regions including the primary and secondary motor, somatosensory, visual, retrosplenial, and association cortices across both hemispheres. We demonstrate cortex-wide cellular resolution in vivo Calcium (Ca2+) imaging using the mini-MCAM in both head-fixed and freely behaving mice.

">Generative deep learning models for cognitive performance trajectories in real-world scenarios</a></h4>

              
                The increasing prevalence of cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, imposes significant challenges on healthcare systems and society. The ability to predict the future cognitive performance (CP) is crucial for professionals in neuropsychology, and real-world data emerges as an important source of complete and reliable information. However, its inherent complexities requires the use of advanced models to make predictions. To do so, we have implemented and compared three deep learning predictive strategies from CP trajectories: multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The three models showed robustness on their predictions in different patient datasets. The CNN was the most suitable architecture due to its local pattern recognition capabilities and its robustness to overfitting. Therefore, professionals can have a complementary support for targeting treatment approaches to patients needs and anticipate undesired outcomes (e.g. cognitive impairment). Nonetheless, further studies are needed to validate whether neuropsychological interventions based on score predictions lead to improved intervention efficacy compared to traditional approaches for controlled patient groups.

">Walking entrains unique oscillations for central and peripheral visual detection</a></h4>

              
                It is important to investigate perception in the context of natural behaviour in order to reach a holistic account of how sensory processes are coordinated with actions. In particular, the effect of walking upon perceptual and cognitive functions has recently been investigated in the context of how common voluntary actions may dynamically impact upon visual detection. This work has revealed that walking can enhance peripheral visual processing, and that during walking, performance on a visual detection task oscillates through good and bad periods within the phases of the stride-cycle. Here, we extend this work by examining whether oscillations in visual detection performance are uniform across the visual field while walking. Participants monitored parafoveal (~3.7 d.v.a) and peripheral (~7 d.v.a) locations left/right of fixation for the onset of targets while walking at a natural pace in wireless virtual reality. For targets at all locations accuracy, reaction times and response likelihood oscillated within each individual's stride-cycle, at primarily 2 or 4 cycles per stride. Importantly, oscillations in accuracy and reaction time shared the same frequency at both locations but were decreased in amplitude and phase-lagged in the periphery, revealing an interaction between visual field locations and oscillations in performance. Together, these results demonstrate that oscillations in visual performance entrained by the stride-cycle occur with unique amplitudes and phases across the visual field.

">"Magnetic Sand" : Illusions of Interactivity</a></h4>

              
                We found a series of new illusions, in which actions performed near a random white-noise display lead to the perception that the display is altered interactively with the observer's actions. The perceptions resemble interactions with a box of magnetic sand, where the hand can leave traces, or attract and repulse grains in its vicinity. 1) the observer puts a finger very close to a dynamic noise display, slowly moving as though drawing a letter or a shape. A trace appears left in the finger's path, decaying within 500 ms or so. 2) When the observer moves their palm toward and away from the display, opening and closing their fingers as if grabbing and releasing grains of sand, the random dots appear as though they were magnetically attracted to or repelled by the fingers. 3) When an open hand close to the display is slowly moved back and forth laterally, the nearby dots appear to get attracted to or captured by the fingers and thus appear to move with them. 4) The same kind of action capture occurs even when the hand is not visible, moving behind the display. These illusions are robust across a wide range of parameters, including frame rate, luminance contrast, dot size (spatial frequency), and finger movement factors. Inter-subject variability is not correlated across illusion types, and the illusions also diverge in behavior across dynamic and static noise conditions. This indicates that multiple mechanisms are involved to different extents across illusions. Several known visual motion detectors and other low-level mechanisms may be involved in seeding the perceptual phenomena. However, a complete explanation would require mechanisms of action capture, whereby the internal model of the person's actions and their predicted consequences organizes visual attention and processing of the random stimulus components.

">Evaluating theories of neural information integration during visual search</a></h4>

              
                The brain routes and integrates information from many sources during behavior. A number of models explain this phenomenon within the framework of mixed selectivity theory, yet it is difficult to compare their predictions to understand how neurons and circuits integrate information. In this work, we apply time-series partial information decomposition [PID] to compare models of integration on a dataset of superior colliculus [SC] recordings collected during a multi-target visual search task. On this task, SC must integrate target guidance, bottom-up salience, and previous fixation signals to drive attention. We find evidence that SC neurons integrate these factors in diverse ways, including decision-variable selectivity to expected value, functional specialization to previous fixation, and code-switching (to incorporate new visual input).

">A lasting impact of serotonergic psychedelics on visual processing and behavior</a></h4>

              
                Serotonergic psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin) have shown potential for treating psychiatric disorders, with therapeutic effects lasting weeks after a single dose. Predictive processing theories posit that psychedelics work by loosening priors or high-level beliefs, including ingrained biases that have become pathological, leading to shifts in bottom-up vs top-down information processing that reconfigure perception, cognition, and mood. Because 5-HT2A receptors, the primary target of psychedelics, are enriched in visual cortices, we investigated whether psychedelics alter visual processing in a manner consistent with predictive processing theories. People who recently (<3 weeks) used 5-HT2A-agonist psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) exhibited slowed response latencies and increased cortical involvement in generating saccades to targets in predictable locations, along with a generalization of sensory prediction errors (i.e., deviance detection) during passive visual processing. Individuals who recently used a 5-HT1A-selective psychedelic (5-MeO-DMT) displayed similar changes in saccade production, but unaltered deviance detection, suggesting circuit-specific effects. Mice administered DOI (5-HT2A-agonist) exhibited altered deviance detection within primary visual cortex (V1), along with weakened top-down feedback to V1 from higher cortical area ACa. These results concord with the hypothesis that psychedelics shift the balance from top-down to bottom-up in sensory cortical circuits -- an effect that persists beyond the acute exposure period.

">Co-Transplantation-Based Human-Mouse Chimeric Brain Models to Study Human Glial-Glial and Glial-Neuronal Interactions</a></h4>

              
                Human-mouse chimeric brain models, generated by transplanting human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural cells, are valuable for studying the development and function of human neural cells in vivo. Understanding glial-glial and glial-neuronal interactions is essential for unraveling the complexities of brain function and developing treatments for neurological disorders. To explore these interactions between human neural cells within an intact brain environment, we employe a co-transplantation strategy involving the engraftment of hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells along with primitive macrophage progenitors into the neonatal mouse brain. This approach creates human-mouse chimeric brains containing human microglia, macroglia (astroglia and oligodendroglia), and neurons. Using super-resolution imaging and 3D reconstruction techniques, we examine the dynamics between human neurons and glia, unveiling human microglia engulfing immature human neurons, microglia pruning synapses of human neurons, and significant interactions between human oligodendrocytes and neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the chimeric brain uncovers a close recapitulation of the human glial progenitor cell population, along with a dynamic stage in astroglial development that mirrors the processes found in the human brain. Furthermore, cell-cell communication analysis highlights significant neuronal-glial and glial-glial interactions, especially the interaction between adhesion molecules neurexins and neuroligins. This innovative co-transplantation model opens up new avenues for exploring the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying human neurological diseases. It holds particular promise for studying disorders where glial-neuronal interactions and non-cell-autonomous effects play crucial roles.

">Glia control experience-dependent plasticity in an olfactory critical period</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experience during developmental critical periods has lifelong consequences for circuit function and behavior, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which experience causes these changes are not well understood. The Drosophila antennal lobe houses synapses between olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and downstream projection neurons (PNs) in stereotyped glomeruli. Many glomeruli exhibit structural plasticity in response to early-life odor exposure, indicating a general sensitivity of the fly olfactory circuitry to early sensory experience. We recently found that glia regulate the development of the antennal lobe in young adult flies, leading us to ask if glia also drive experience-dependent plasticity. Here we define a critical period for structural and functional plasticity of OSN-PN synapses in the ethyl butyrate (EB)-sensitive glomerulus VM7. EB exposure for the first two days post-eclosion drives large-scale reductions in glomerular volume, presynapse number, and post-synaptic activity. The highly conserved engulfment receptor Draper is required for this critical period plasticity. Specifically, ensheathing glia upregulate Draper expression, invade the VM7 glomerulus, and phagocytose OSN presynaptic terminals in response to critical-period EB exposure. Crucially, synapse pruning during the critical period has long-term consequences for circuit function since both OSN-PN synapse number and spontaneous activity of PNs remain persistently decreased. These data demonstrate experience-dependent pruning of synapses in olfactory circuitry and argue that the Drosophila antennal lobe will be a powerful model for defining the function of glia in critical period plasticity.

">Molecular and cellular rhythms in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies have shown that there are rhythms in gene expression in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, the contribution of different cell types and potential variation by sex has not yet been determined. Of particular interest are excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, as interactions between these cell types are essential for regulating the excitation/inhibition balance and controlling many of the cognitive functions regulated by the PFC. In this study, we identify cell-type specific rhythms in the translatome of PV and pyramidal cells in the mouse PFC and assess diurnal rhythms in PV cell electrophysiological properties. We find that while core molecular clock genes are conserved and synchronized between cell types, pyramidal cells have nearly twice as many rhythmic transcripts as PV cells (35% vs. 18%). Rhythmic transcripts in pyramidal cells also show a high degree of overlap between sexes, both in terms of which transcripts are rhythmic and in the biological processes associated with them. Conversely, in PV cells, rhythmic transcripts from males and females are largely distinct. Moreover, we find sex-specific effects of phase on action potential properties in PV cells that are eliminated by environmental circadian disruption. Together, this study demonstrates that rhythms in gene expression and electrophysiological properties in the mouse PFC vary by both cell type and sex. Moreover, the biological processes associated with these rhythmic transcripts may provide insight into the unique functions of rhythms in these cells, as well as their selective vulnerabilities to circadian disruption.

">Bayesian inference in arm posture perception</a></h4>

              
                To configure our limbs in space the brain must compute their position based on sensory information provided by mechanoreceptors in the skin, muscles, and joints. Because this information is corrupted by noise, the brain is thought to process it probabilistically, and integrate it with prior belief about arm posture, following Bayes rule. Here, we combined computational modeling with behavioral experimentation to test this hypothesis. The model conceives the perception of arm posture as the combination of a probabilistic kinematic chain composed by the shoulder, elbow, and wrist angles, compromised with additive Gaussian noise, with a Gaussian prior about these joint angles. We tested whether the model explains errors in a VR-based posture-matching task better than a model that assumes a uniform prior. Human participants (N=20) were required to align their unseen right arm to a target posture, presented as a visual configuration of the arm in the horizontal plane. Results show idiosyncratic biases in how participants matched their unseen arm to the target posture. We used maximum likelihood estimation to fit the Bayesian model to these observations and retrieve key parameters including the prior means and its variance-covariance structure. The Bayesian model including a Gaussian prior explained the response biases and variance much better than a model with a uniform prior. The prior varied across participants, consistent with the idiosyncrasies in arm posture perception, and in alignment with previous behavioral research. Our work clarifies the biases in arm posture perception within a new perspective on the nature of proprioceptive computations.

">The Role of Glucocorticoid and Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in the Reward-Enhancing Effects of Nicotine in the ICSS Procedure in Male and Female Rats</a></h4>

              
                Tobacco use disorder is a chronic disorder that affects more than one billion people worldwide and causes the death of millions each year. The rewarding properties of nicotine are critical for the initiation of smoking. Previous research has shown that the activation of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) plays a role in nicotine self-administration in rats. However, the role of GRs in the acute rewarding effects of nicotine are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of the GR antagonist mifepristone and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine on the reward-enhancing effects of nicotine using the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure in adult male and female rats. The rats were prepared with ICSS electrodes in the medial forebrain bundle and then trained on the ICSS procedure. Nicotine lowered the brain reward thresholds and decreased response latencies similarly in male and female rats. These findings suggest that nicotine enhances the rewarding effects of ICSS and has stimulant properties. Treatment with the GR antagonist mifepristone did not affect the reward-enhancing effects of nicotine but increased response latencies, suggesting a sedative effect. Mecamylamine did not affect the brain reward thresholds or response latencies of the control rats, but prevented the nicotine-induced decrease in brain reward thresholds and reward latencies. These findings indicate that the rewarding effects of nicotine are mediated via the activation of nAChRs, and that the activation of GRs does not contribute to the acute rewarding effects of nicotine. These studies enhance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying tobacco use disorder.

">Diverse Calcium Signaling in Astrocytes: Insights from a Computational Model</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are complex cells that influence a variety of brain functions and behaviors. They are active cells that show a sharp increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to neurotransmitters (events called Ca2+ signals). The main source of intracellular Ca2+ is the stores in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), released by the activation of IP3 receptor channels on the ER membrane. As neurons, astrocytes from different brain regions show distinct Ca2+ signals. In addition, astrocytes can also show different patterns of Ca2+ responses. It is not yet clear how the diversity of astrocyte response emerge from the same mechanisms. Here we present a two variable astrocyte compartmental model for the Ca2+ and IP3 dynamics. We show that Ca2+ signals with different characteristics can emerge from changing the parameters associated with the Ca2+ and IP3 dynamics and the transmembrane current. We also show that global Ca2+ signals are required for the model to trigger different patterns of Ca2+ responses. The model present here can be used to simulate astrocytes from different brain regions and with distinct types of response.

                Introduction Mitochondria are cell organelles that function as the cell’s main power plant, producing ATP, the main energy molecule in cells. Mitochondria play an important role in the context of neuroprotection, and mitochondrial function has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent research in the field of neuroprotection has focused on the development of therapies that target mitochondria. Natural ingredients have long been used in traditional medicine and show potential as neuroprotective agents. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords natural agents, herb*, neuroprotective, and mitochondria. The data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, A factorial map illustrating the leading contributors of papers, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, qualitative analysis, and word cloud. Conclusions Natural Agent Neurotropik is a natural substance that influences the brain’s nervous system and peripheral nervous system, enhancing cognition, mood, and brain function. Derived from herbs, spices, and herbal products, it has advantages over other natural agents in energy production, brain biogenesis, and neuroprotection.

                <p>CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing represents an exciting avenue to study genes of unknown function and can be combined with genetically encoded tools such as fluorescent proteins, channelrhodopsins, DREADDs, and various biosensors to more deeply probe the function of these genes in different cell types. However, current strategies to also manipulate or visualize edited cells are challenging due to the large size of Cas9 proteins and the limited packaging capacity of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). To overcome these constraints, we developed an alternative gene editing strategy using a single AAV vector and mouse lines that express Cre-dependent Cas9 to achieve efficient cell-type specific editing across the nervous system. Expressing Cre-dependent Cas9 from a genomic locus affords space to package guide RNAs for gene editing together with Cre-dependent, genetically encoded tools to manipulate, map, or monitor neurons using a single virus. We validated this strategy with three common tools in neuroscience: ChRonos, a channelrhodopsin, for studying synaptic transmission using optogenetics, GCaMP8f for recording Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients using photometry, and mCherry for tracing axonal projections. We tested these tools in multiple brain regions and cell types, including GABAergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens, glutamatergic neurons projecting from the ventral pallidum to the lateral habenula, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and proprioceptive neurons in the periphery. This flexible approach could help identify and test the function of novel genes affecting synaptic transmission, circuit activity, or morphology with a single viral injection.</p>

                <p>Previous studies have shown that ligands that bind to sigma-2 receptor/TMEM97 (s<SUB>2</SUB>R/TMEM97), a transmembrane protein, have anxiolytic/antidepressant-like properties and relieve neuropathic pain-like effects in rodents. Despite medical interest in s<SUB>2</SUB>R/TMEM97, little affective and pain behavioral characterization has been done using transgenic mice, which limits the development of s<SUB>2</SUB>R/TMEM97 as a viable therapeutic target. Using wild-type (WT) and global <I>Tmem97</I> knock-out (KO) mice, we sought to identify the contribution of <I>Tmem97</I> in modulating affective and pain-like behaviors using a battery of affective and pain assays, including open field, light/dark preference, elevated plus maze, forced swim test, tail suspension test, and the mechanical sensitivity tests. Our results demonstrate that female <I>Tmem97</I> KO mice show less anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in light/dark preference and tail suspension tests but not in an open field, elevated plus maze, and forced swim tests at baseline.

                Background This study seeks to examine the causal link between financial deepening, national security, ecological footprint, and economic growth in Nigeria, in order to contribute to the contradicting evidence on economic growth drivers. Methods The dynamic ARDL model was employed as the baseline model to establish the link between the phenomena, and the FMOLS and DOLS as robust models using time series data spanning from 1995 to 2022. The FMOLS and DOLS models take into consideration the presence of endogeneity, cross-sectional dependency, and heterogeneity. Results The results demonstrate that whereas ecological footprint has positive and significant long-term relationships with economic growth, financial deepening and national security have negative and significant long-run relationships with economic growth. There was a 34% and 50% correction to the short-term to long-term adjustment speed, respectively. The findings of the Granger causality, interaction terms, marginal (ME), and threshold (TH) effects demonstrate: a) a significant bidirectional causal relationship between national security and economic growth, as well as a one-way significant causal link between financial deepening and economic growth; b) changes in national security and ecological footprint have a significant and negative impact on the financial deepening effect on economic growth; c) significant negative and marginal effects of national security on economic growth, as well as significant positive marginal effects of ecological footprints on economic growth; and d) the impact of financial deepening on economic growth becomes apparent when the increases in the marginal effect of the ecological footprint reach a critical limit over the ( TH CO 2 = 0.981) threshold. Conclusions This study highlights the significant link between Nigeria’s financial deepening, national security, ecological footprint, and economic growth. It recommends that viable policies be put in place to support the development of financial institutions, increasing security infrastructure investment, and promoting renewable energy use for sustainable environment and reduced carbon emissions.

                Background: The microbiota in the intestine is made up of trillions of living bacteria that coexist with the host. Administration of antibiotics during neonatal infection causes depletion of gut flora resulting in gut dysbiosis. Over the last few decades, probiotics have been created and promoted as microbiota management agents to enrich gut flora. Probiotics decrease the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the gut of preterm neonates, reducing the frequency of nosocomial infections in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICUs). Methods: The systematic review will include randomized control trials (RCTs) of premier neonates with sepsis. Studies will be retrieved from global databases like Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus via EBSCO host, MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Ovid, Web of Science, ProQuest Medical Library, Microsoft academic, and DOAJ by utilizing database-specific keywords. Screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal of included research will be carried out separately by two review writers. Findings will be reported in accordance with the PRISMS-P 2020 guidelines. Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review will help to translate the evidence-based information needed to encourage the implementation of potential research output in the field of neonatal intensive care, guide best clinical practise, assist policy making and implementation to prevent gut dysbiosis in neonates with sepsis by summarising and communicating the evidence on the topic. PROSPERO registration number: This systematic review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) on 10th March 2022. The registration number is CRD42022315980.

                The 2020 world population data sheet indicates that world population is projected to increase from 7.8 billion in 2020 to 9.9 billion by 2050 (Increase of more than 25%). Due to the expected growth in human population, the demand for meats that could improve health status and provide therapeutic benefits is also projected to rise. The dromedary also known as the Arabian camel, or one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius), a pseudo ruminant adapted to arid climates, has physiological, biological and metabolic characteristics which give it a legendary reputation for surviving in the extreme conditions of desert environments considered restrictive for other ruminants. Camel meat is an ethnic food consumed across the arid regions of Middle East, North-East Africa, Australia and China. For these medicinal and nutritional benefits, camel meat can be a great option for sustainable meat worldwide supply. A considerable amount of literature has been published on technological aspects and quality properties of beef, lamb and pork but the information available on the technological aspects of the meat of the one humped camel is very limited. Camels are usually raised in less developed countries and their meat is as nutritionally good as any other traditional meat source. Its quality also depends on the breed, sex, age, breeding conditions and type of muscle consumed. A compilation of existing literature related to new technological advances in packaging, shelf-life and quality of camel meat has not been reviewed to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, this review attempts to explore the nutritional composition, health benefits of camel meat, as well as various technological and processing interventions to improve its quality and consumer acceptance. This review will be helpful for camel sector and highlight the potential for global marketability of camel meat and to generate value added products.

                <p>by Pau Clusella, Linus Manubens-Gil, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Mara Dierssen</p>

Cognitive disorders, including Down syndrome (DS), present significant morphological alterations in neuron architectural complexity. However, the relationship between neuromorphological alterations and impaired brain function is not fully understood. To address this gap, we propose a novel computational model that accounts for the observed cell deformations in DS. The model consists of a cross-sectional layer of the mouse motor cortex, composed of 3000 neurons. The network connectivity is obtained by accounting explicitly for two single-neuron morphological parameters: the mean dendritic tree radius and the spine density in excitatory pyramidal cells. We obtained these values by fitting reconstructed neuron data corresponding to three mouse models: wild-type (WT), transgenic (TgDyrk1A), and trisomic (Ts65Dn). Our findings reveal a dynamic interplay between pyramidal and fast-spiking interneurons leading to the emergence of gamma activity (∼40 Hz). In the DS models this gamma activity is diminished, corroborating experimental observations and validating our computational methodology. We further explore the impact of disrupted excitation-inhibition balance by mimicking the reduction recurrent inhibition present in DS. In this case, gamma power exhibits variable responses as a function of the external input to the network. Finally, we perform a numerical exploration of the morphological parameter space, unveiling the direct influence of each structural parameter on gamma frequency and power. Our research demonstrates a clear link between changes in morphology and the disruption of gamma oscillations in DS. This work underscores the potential of computational modeling to elucidate the relationship between neuron architecture and brain function, and ultimately improve our understanding of cognitive disorders.

The practical application of new single molecule protein sequencing (SMPS) technologies requires accurate estimates of their associated sequencing error rates. Here, we describe the development and application of two distinct parameter estimation methods for analyzing SMPS reads produced by fluorosequencing. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based approach, extends whatprot, where we previously used HMMs for SMPS peptide-read matching. This extension offers a principled approach for estimating key parameters for fluorosequencing experiments, including missed amino acid cleavages, dye loss, and peptide detachment. Specifically, we adapted the Baum-Welch algorithm, a standard technique to estimate transition probabilities for an HMM using expectation maximization, but modified here to estimate a small number of parameter values directly rather than estimating every transition probability independently. We demonstrate a high degree of accuracy on simulated data, but on experimental datasets, we observed that the model needed to be augmented with an additional error type, N-terminal blocking. This, in combination with data pre-processing, results in reasonable parameterizations of experimental datasets that agree with controlled experimental perturbations. A second independent implementation using a hybrid of DIRECT and Powell’s method to reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) between simulations and the real dataset was also developed. We compare these methods on both simulated and real data, finding that our Baum-Welch based approach outperforms DIRECT and Powell’s method by most, but not all, criteria. Although some discrepancies between the results exist, we also find that both approaches provide similar error rate estimates from experimental single molecule fluorosequencing datasets.

                <p>by Marcus Ghosh, Gabriel Béna, Volker Bormuth, Dan F. M. Goodman</p>

Animals continuously detect information via multiple sensory channels, like vision and hearing, and integrate these signals to realise faster and more accurate decisions; a fundamental neural computation known as multisensory integration. A widespread view of this process is that multimodal neurons linearly fuse information across sensory channels. However, does linear fusion generalise beyond the classical tasks used to explore multisensory integration? Here, we develop novel multisensory tasks, which focus on the underlying statistical relationships between channels, and deploy models at three levels of abstraction: from probabilistic ideal observers to artificial and spiking neural networks. Using these models, we demonstrate that when the information provided by different channels is not independent, linear fusion performs sub-optimally and even fails in extreme cases. This leads us to propose a simple nonlinear algorithm for multisensory integration which is compatible with our current knowledge of multimodal circuits, excels in naturalistic settings and is optimal for a wide class of multisensory tasks. Thus, our work emphasises the role of nonlinear fusion in multisensory integration, and provides testable hypotheses for the field to explore at multiple levels: from single neurons to behaviour.

                <p>by Xun Fu, Jack Withers, Juri A. Miyamae, Talia Y. Moore</p>

Computational models of musculoskeletal systems are essential tools for understanding how muscles, tendons, bones, and actuation signals generate motion. In particular, the OpenSim family of models has facilitated a wide range of studies on diverse human motions, clinical studies of gait, and even non-human locomotion. However, biological structures with many joints, such as fingers, necks, tails, and spines, have been a longstanding challenge to the OpenSim modeling community, especially because these structures comprise numerous bones and are frequently actuated by extrinsic muscles that span multiple joints—often more than three—and act through a complex network of branching tendons. Existing model building software, typically optimized for limb structures, makes it difficult to build OpenSim models that accurately reflect these intricacies. Here, we introduce ArborSim, customized software that efficiently creates musculoskeletal models of highly jointed structures and can build branched muscle-tendon architectures. We used ArborSim to construct toy models of articulated structures to determine which morphological features make a structure most sensitive to branching. By comparing the joint kinematics of models constructed with branched and parallel muscle-tendon units, we found that among various parameters—the number of tendon branches, the number of joints between branches, and the ratio of muscle fiber length to muscle tendon unit length—the number of tendon branches and the number of joints between branches are most sensitive to branching modeling method. Notably, the differences between these models showed no predictable pattern with increased complexity. As the proportion of muscle increased, the kinematic differences between branched and parallel models units also increased. Our findings suggest that stress and strain interactions between distal tendon branches and proximal tendon and muscle greatly affect the overall kinematics of a musculoskeletal system. By incorporating complex muscle-tendon branching into OpenSim models using ArborSim, we can gain deeper insight into the interactions between the axial and appendicular skeleton, model the evolution and function of diverse animal tails, and understand the mechanics of more complex motions and tasks.

                <p>by Sarah Schwöbel, Dimitrije Marković, Michael N. Smolka, Stefan Kiebel</p>

In cognitive neuroscience and psychology, reaction times are an important behavioral measure. However, in instrumental learning and goal-directed decision making experiments, findings often rely only on choice probabilities from a value-based model, instead of reaction times. Recent advancements have shown that it is possible to connect value-based decision models with reaction time models. However, typically these models do not provide an integrated account of both value-based choices and reaction times, but simply link two types of models. Here, we propose a novel integrative joint model of both choices and reaction times by combining a computational account of Bayesian sequential decision making with a sampling procedure. This allows us to describe how internal uncertainty in the planning process shapes reaction time distributions. Specifically, we use a recent context-specific Bayesian forward planning model which we extend by a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to obtain both choices and reaction times. As we will show this makes the sampler an integral part of the decision making process and enables us to reproduce, using simulations, well-known experimental findings in value based-decision making as well as classical inhibition and switching tasks. Specifically, we use the proposed model to explain both choice behavior and reaction times in instrumental learning and automatized behavior, in the Eriksen flanker task and in task switching. These findings show that the proposed joint behavioral model may describe common underlying processes in these different decision making paradigms.

In 2020, the WHO launched its first global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer, outlining an ambitious set of targets for countries to achieve over the next decade. At the same time, new tools, technologies, and strategies are in the pipeline that may improve screening performance, expand the reach of prophylactic vaccines, and prevent the acquisition, persistence and progression of oncogenic HPV. Detailed mechanistic modelling can help identify the combinations of current and future strategies to combat cervical cancer. Open-source modelling tools are needed to shift the capacity for such evaluations in-country. Here, we introduce the Human papillomavirus simulator (HPVsim), a new open-source software package for creating flexible agent-based models parameterised with country-specific vital dynamics, structured sexual networks, and co-transmitting HPV genotypes. HPVsim includes a novel methodology for modelling cervical disease progression, designed to be readily adaptable to new forms of screening. The software itself is implemented in Python, has built-in tools for simulating commonly-used interventions, includes a comprehensive set of tests and documentation, and runs quickly (seconds to minutes) on a laptop. Performance is greatly enhanced by HPVsim’s multi-scale modelling functionality. HPVsim is open source under the MIT License and available via both the Python Package Index (via pip install) and GitHub (hpvsim.org).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The physiological aging process is well known for functional decline in visual abilities. Among the components of the visual system, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG) and superior colliculus (SC) provide a good model for aging investigations, as these structures constitute the main visual pathways for retinal inputs reaching the visual cortex. However, there are limited data available on quantitative morphological and neurochemical aspects in DLG and SC across lifespan. Here, we used optical density to determine immunoexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and design-based stereological probes to estimate the neuronal number, total volume, and layer volume of the DLG and SC in marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), ranging from 36 to 143 months of age. Our results revealed an age-related increase in total volume and layer volume of the DLG, with an overall stability in SC volume. Furthermore, a stable neuronal number was demonstrated in DLG and superficial layers of SC (SCv). A decrease in GFAP immunoexpression was observed in both visual centers. The results indicate region-specific variability in volumetric parameter, possibly attributed to structural plastic events in response to inflammation and compensatory mechanisms at the cellular and subcellular level. Additionally, the DLG and SCv seem to be less vulnerable to aging effects in terms of neuronal number. The neuropeptidergic data suggest that reduced GFAP expression may reflect morphological atrophy in the astroglial cells. This study contributes to updating the current understanding of aging effects in the visual system and stablishes a crucial foundation for future research on visual perception throughout the aging process.</p>

                Background As a post-COVID complication in children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is important because of its varied and life-threatening manifestations. With this background, this study attempts to focus on MIS-C cases in an underprivileged rural setting in north-eastern India, with most patients being treated with methylprednisolone rather than intravenous immunoglobulin due to financial constraints. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study at MGM Medical College, 27 MIS-C cases diagnosed following WHO criteria were included. Laboratory and radiological investigations, including echocardiography, were performed as required for diagnosis and to assess prognosis. Most patients were treated with methylprednisolone. A follow-up assessment was done six weeks after discharge for any residual impairment. Results The most frequently affected age group was 5–10 years (59.28%), while respiratory (48.14%) and cardiac (40.74%) were the most commonly involved systems. Logistic regression studies established a significant association between serum ferritin level and prolonged hospital stay (coefficient 0.0674, p=0.0041), possibly due to greater complications in cases with high ferritin levels. Organ impairment was found to increase the need for inotrope use (coefficient 3.8797, p=0.00584). Most cases were treated with methylprednisolone alone (85.18%) with a favourable response and no death occurred. Conclusion The favourable response in cases treated with methylprednisolone only affirms the effectiveness of the drug as a cheaper alternative in a resource-poor setting. The study highlights that higher ferritin levels in complicated cases leads to prolonged hospitalisation and the increased need for inotropes in cases with organ impairment.

                Background It is important and challenging to distinguish between acute myocardial infarction and Wellens syndrome due to its time to intervention. Difficulties in differentiating between subtypes could mean the patients are overtreated or receive undertreatment. Case report A 57-year-old man was referred to our emergency ward with acute onset of chest pain. Electrocardiograms changes were suggestive of type A Wellens syndrome. Nitroglycerin was administrated, the patient's chest pain disappeared, and we planned an early invasive strategy. He had a previous documented electrocardiogram before he went for catheterization and based on the second electrocardiogram changes were suggestive of an ST-elevation. As the result of the invasive strategy, it was found that there was single-vessel disease, critical occlusion in the middle of the left anterior descending artery coronary artery with collateral from the right coronary artery. After two days of observation in the Intensive Cardiovascular Care Unit, the patient improved and was transferred to Low Care Unit. Conclusions The case highlights Wellens syndrome in acute critical occlusion with collateral artery.

                Background Removal of the microbial deposits (plaque and calculus) by performing effective scaling and root planing (SRP) is the fundamental step for managing periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). Various adjuncts in the form of mouthwash, gels, and toothpaste are also being used as adjuncts to SRP for managing periodontitis. Recently, Lycium barbarum (L. barbarum), commonly known as goji berry or wolfberry, has gained popularity for managing chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, its efficacy in managing periodontitis has never been explored. Hence the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of goji berry mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash for managing periodontitis. Methods 60 adult participants were divided randomly using computer-generated random sequences into two groups (case group: L. barbarum mouthwash (Males: 16; Female: 14); control group: 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (Males: 14; Females: 16)). The changes in the gingival index (Gi), plaque index (Pi), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), microbial load, and antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were noted at the baseline, at 15 days and one month. Results A significant reduction in the mean PPD, Pi, and Gi was seen from baseline to one month in both the control (P-value=0.006, 0.027, and 0.036 respectively) and test groups (P-value=0.035, 0.000, and 0.000 respectively). CAL was reduced significantly only in the control group. However, the antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were significantly increased only in the test group. Conclusion Goji berry mouthwash along with SRP reduced the Gi, Pi, BOP, and PPD in patients with periodontitis. However, no statistically significant difference was noted between the use of goji berry and chlorhexidine mouthwash. Goji berry mouthwash was more effective than chlorhexidine in increasing the antioxidant levels in saliva.

                Background The goal of eliminating tuberculosis has not yet shown a bright spot. Specifically for HIV patients (PLHIV), WHO has made it a special category as a pillar for eliminating tuberculosis. The tuberculosis screening has not yet reached the national target because it is carried out manually by health workers, requiring optimization following technological developments. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of tuberculosis case finding using a self-assessment paradigm in HIV patients. Methods This research was cross-sectional. The data obtained from HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application for 3 months each was analyzed using the compare mean independent t-test. Then the Chi-squared test was carried out on the E-TIBI screening characteristic variables. Result In total, there were 921 respondents with 148 (16%) presumptive TB. It was found that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in the number of presumptive TB cases found in HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application. The person with presumptive TB showed 20 of 24 characteristic variables that were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion E-TIBI can increase the tuberculosis case finding in HIV patients so it has the potential to be implemented as a screening tool in the PLHIV community.

                Background Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) stands as the third most fatal malignancy worldwide, accounting for over 830,000 fatalities annually. This pressing concern has spurred extensive research into potential early diagnostic biomarkers, with a particular focus on the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in recognizing angiogenesis within HCC. VEGF offers an intricate insight into the angiogenic processes, among its multifaceted advantages. Methods We systematically curated articles from PubMed and Epistemonikos, concentrating on the determination of VEGF’s diagnostic cutoff value, sensitivity, and specificity for HCC. Employing the PRISMA 2020 flowchart, we meticulously delineated the process of article selection. Results In total, our review encompasses nine studies, encompassing 576 HCC patients, subject to qualitative analysis. The collective findings indicate that the specificity of VEGF outweighs its sensitivity, indicating its aptitude in distinguishing HCC from both a healthy population and other high-risk conditions, most notably in comparison with these high-risk conditions. Specificity holds pivotal significance as a preferred parameter for a screening test, endorsing the prospective utility of VEGF in HCC screening. Conclusions For individuals, especially those within the normal alpha-fetoprotein range, VEGF may serve as a viable alternative for HCC screening, facilitating the differentiation of this condition from other high-risk conditions.

                Multimorbidity and the associated consumption of multiple medications are common among the older population, posing a significant health concern. This leads to an increased incidence of side effects, adverse drug reactions, and higher healthcare costs for the individual, their family, and the country’s overall healthcare expenditure. Older adults experience complications due to the natural aging process and polypharmacy. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables of medications play a crucial role in their recovery and overall health. While many studies have highlighted the rising incidence of multimorbidity among older adults, they often overlook the importance of optimizing medication therapy to reduce complications, side effects, adverse drug reactions, falls, and improve medication adherence. This narrative review focuses on the impact of polypharmacy on older adults, age-related pharmacokinetic changes, pharmacodynamics in this population, and various methods to optimize pharmacotherapy. The findings of this review aim to provide healthcare providers with a better understanding of how to optimize pharmacotherapies and reduce drug-related complications in older adults.

                Background Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in resource-limited countries relies primarily on bacteriological confirmation using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain or culture. However, this method has low sensitivity due to suboptimal sampling and techniques. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes are crucial in the pathogenesis of granulomatous inflammation and immune reactions. We investigated the usefulness of the haematological parameters and their ratios, like the Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Monocyte to Lymphocyte ratio (MLR), for diagnosing tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively grouped 114 patients with fever into those diagnosed with TB and control groups. We obtained their haematological data and calculated their derived ratios. The ratios obtained from the two groups were compared. Their sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results Haematological parameters like MLR were higher in TB patients than in the control group. Although NLR was not significantly increased, MLR was significantly increased with p values <0.05. These tests had low sensitivity but high specificity. Conclusion Serum NLR and MLR emerge as valuable tools in TB diagnosis. Their simplicity and cost-effectiveness render them particularly suitable for screening and recurrence monitoring in rural and remote settings, thereby mitigating loss to follow-up.

                Background Astrometeorology is an ancient science, that deals the relationship between planet position and weather events. Several Indian studies proved that Astrometeorology could be a complementary method to improve numerical weather forecast accuracy. Since 2011, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University is conducting astrometeorological research and devised a novel concept “Planet Activeness Chart”. The principle is that “planets’ influence on a location’s weather varies throughout the day and may be negative, inactive, active, highly active and rule depending on their angle to that location”. Most existing astromet studies used planetary position to predict the occurrence of weather events (yes/no) but failed to capture intensity of the event. The “Planet Activeness Concept” could address this limitation and enhance forecast usability. Methods A study was carried out from 2018 to 2021 with six years data (2011-16) to verify the “Planet activeness” on hourly rainfall and windspeed events in Tamil Nadu. The frequency of planet activeness for a weather event was calculated by dividing the number of times a planet was in the selected activeness during a specific event category by the total number of events. Results The results indicated that negative state of the Sun, active status of the Saturn, Uranus, Venus and Moon were positively associated with rainfall intensity. The windy planet Mercury and Neptune at active state, the Sun and Saturn at rule state, Venus and Uranus at negative state, Jupiter at highly active state had significant influence on the increased wind speed. Conclusion Applying the planet activeness concept with azimuth could enhance the accuracy and usability of Astrometeorological forecasts. This study establishes a mathematical relationship between planet activeness and weather as a first step to understand the science behind this relationship. It is suggested to study different combination of planet activeness during a weather event for more insights.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91685">Factorized visual representations in the primate visual system and deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Object classification has been proposed as a principal objective of the primate ventral visual stream and has been used as an optimization target for deep neural network models (DNNs) of the visual system. However, visual brain areas represent many different types of information, and optimizing for classification of object identity alone does not constrain how other information may be encoded in visual representations. Information about different scene parameters may be discarded altogether (‘invariance’), represented in non-interfering subspaces of population activity (‘factorization’) or encoded in an entangled fashion. In this work, we provide evidence that factorization is a normative principle of biological visual representations. In the monkey ventral visual hierarchy, we found that factorization of object pose and background information from object identity increased in higher-level regions and strongly contributed to improving object identity decoding performance. We then conducted a large-scale analysis of factorization of individual scene parameters – lighting, background, camera viewpoint, and object pose – in a diverse library of DNN models of the visual system. Models which best matched neural, fMRI, and behavioral data from both monkeys and humans across 12 datasets tended to be those which factorized scene parameters most strongly. Notably, invariance to these parameters was not as consistently associated with matches to neural and behavioral data, suggesting that maintaining non-class information in factorized activity subspaces is often preferred to dropping it altogether. Thus, we propose that factorization of visual scene information is a widely used strategy in brains and DNN models thereof.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89292">Nucleotide binding to the ATP-cone in anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases allosterically regulates activity by modulating substrate binding</a></h4>

              
                A small, nucleotide-binding domain, the ATP-cone, is found at the N-terminus of most ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalytic subunits. By binding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) it regulates the enzyme activity of all classes of RNR. Functional and structural work on aerobic RNRs has revealed a plethora of ways in which dATP inhibits activity by inducing oligomerisation and preventing a productive radical transfer from one subunit to the active site in the other. Anaerobic RNRs, on the other hand, store a stable glycyl radical next to the active site and the basis for their dATP-dependent inhibition is completely unknown. We present biochemical, biophysical, and structural information on the effects of ATP and dATP binding to the anaerobic RNR from <i>Prevotella copri</i>. The enzyme exists in a dimer–tetramer equilibrium biased towards dimers when two ATP molecules are bound to the ATP-cone and tetramers when two dATP molecules are bound. In the presence of ATP, <i>P. copri</i> NrdD is active and has a fully ordered glycyl radical domain (GRD) in one monomer of the dimer. Binding of dATP to the ATP-cone results in loss of activity and increased dynamics of the GRD, such that it cannot be detected in the cryo-EM structures. The glycyl radical is formed even in the dATP-bound form, but the substrate does not bind. The structures implicate a complex network of interactions in activity regulation that involve the GRD more than 30 Å away from the dATP molecules, the allosteric substrate specificity site and a conserved but previously unseen flap over the active site. Taken together, the results suggest that dATP inhibition in anaerobic RNRs acts by increasing the flexibility of the flap and GRD, thereby preventing both substrate binding and radical mobilisation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91327">Early parafoveal semantic integration in natural reading</a></h4>

              
                Humans can read and comprehend text rapidly, implying that readers might process multiple words per fixation. However, the extent to which parafoveal words are previewed and integrated into the evolving sentence context remains disputed. We investigated parafoveal processing during natural reading by recording brain activity and eye movements using MEG and an eye tracker while participants silently read one-line sentences. The sentences contained an unpredictable target word that was either congruent or incongruent with the sentence context. To measure parafoveal processing, we flickered the target words at 60 Hz and measured the resulting brain responses (i.e. <i>Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging, RIFT</i>) during fixations on the pre-target words. Our results revealed a significantly weaker tagging response for target words that were incongruent with the previous context compared to congruent ones, even within 100ms of fixating the word immediately preceding the target. This reduction in the RIFT response was also found to be predictive of individual reading speed. We conclude that semantic information is not only extracted from the parafovea but can also be integrated with the previous context before the word is fixated. This early and extensive parafoveal processing supports the rapid word processing required for natural reading. Our study suggests that theoretical frameworks of natural reading should incorporate the concept of deep parafoveal processing.

">Poor Self-Reported Sleep is Associated with Prolonged White Matter T2 Relaxation in Psychotic Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Background: Schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are characterized by white matter (WM) abnormalities, however, their relationship with illness presentation is not clear. Sleep disturbances are common in both disorders, and recent evidence suggests that sleep plays a critical role in WM physiology. Therefore, it is plausible that sleep disturbances are associated with impaired WM integrity in these disorders. To test this hypothesis, we examined the association of self-reported sleep disturbances with WM transverse (T2) relaxation times in patients with SZ spectrum disorders and BD with psychotic features. Methods: 28 patients with psychosis (17 BD-I, with psychotic features and 11 SZ spectrum disorders) were included. Metabolite and water T2 relaxation times were measured in the anterior corona radiata at 4T. Sleep was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: PSQI total score showed a moderate to strong positive correlation with water T2 (r = 0.64, p<0.001). Linear regressions showed that this association was specific to sleep disturbance but was not a byproduct of exacerbation in depressive, manic, or psychotic symptoms. In our exploratory analysis, sleep disturbance was correlated with free water percentage, suggesting that increased extracellular water may be a mechanism underlying the association of disturbed sleep and prolonged water T2 relaxation. Conclusion: Our results highlight the connection between poor sleep and WM abnormalities in psychotic disorders. Future research using objective sleep measures and neuroimaging techniques suitable to probe free water is needed to further our insight into this relationship.

">Apparent Diffusion Coefficient fMRI shines a new light on white matter resting-state connectivity, as compared to BOLD</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) detects spontaneous low-frequency oscillations in the MRI signal at rest. When they occur simultaneously in distant brain regions, they define functional connectivity (FC) between these regions. While blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI serves as the most widely used contrast for rs-fMRI, its reliance on neurovascular coupling poses challenges in accurately reflecting neuronal activity, resulting in limited spatial and temporal specificity and reduced sensitivity in white matter regions. To overcome these limitations, apparent diffusion coefficient fMRI (ADC-fMRI) is emerging as a promising alternative. This approach captures neuronal activity by monitoring changes in ADC resulting from activity-driven neuromorphological alterations such as transient cell swelling. Using graph theory analysis of resting-state FC networks, this study confirms that ADC-fMRI mirrors the positive correlations observed in BOLD-fMRI in the gray-to-gray matter edges (GM-GM), while diverging significantly from BOLD-fMRI for white-to-white matter (WM-WM) connections. While comparable average clustering and average node strength were found for GM-GM connections, higher average clustering (p < 10-3) and average node strength (p < 10-3) for ADC-fMRI in WM-WM edges suggests that it captures different information to BOLD in the WM. In addition, a significantly higher FC similarity between subjects for ADC-fMRI (mean 0.70, 95% CI [0.68, 0.72]) than BOLD-fMRI (0.38 [0.31, 0.44]) in WM-WM connections suggests a higher reliability of ADC-fMRI in this brain tissue type, demonstrating its broader applicability across the entire brain and reduced sensitivity to physiological noise. Taken together, these results indicate a higher sensitivity and robustness of ADC-fMRI in the WM, and encourage its use, together with careful mitigation of vascular contributions, to further investigate WM functional connectivity.

">A scene with an invisible wall - navigational experience shapes visual scene representation</a></h4>

              
                Human navigation heavily relies on visual information. Although many previous studies have investigated how navigational information is inferred from visual features of scenes, little is understood about the impact of navigational experience on visual scene representation. In this study, we examined how navigational experience influences both the behavioral and neural responses to a visual scene. During training, participants navigated in the virtual reality (VR) environments which we manipulated navigational experience while holding the visual properties of scenes constant. Half of the environments allowed free navigation (navigable), while the other half featured an 'invisible wall' preventing the participants to continue forward even though the scene was visually navigable (non-navigable). During testing, participants viewed scene images from the VR environment while completing either a behavioral perceptual identification task (Experiment1) or an fMRI scan (Experiment2). Behaviorally, we found that participants judged a scene pair to be significantly more visually different if their prior navigational experience varied, even after accounting for visual similarities between the scene pairs. Neurally, multi-voxel pattern of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) distinguished visual scenes based on prior navigational experience alone. These results suggest that the human visual scene cortex represents information about navigability obtained through prior experience, beyond those computable from the visual properties of the scene. Taken together, these results suggest that scene representation is modulated by prior navigational experience to help us construct a functionally meaningful visual environment.

">An orbitocortical-thalamic circuit suppresses binge alcohol-drinking.</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol consumption remains a significant global health challenge, causing millions of direct and indirect deaths annually. Intriguingly, recent work has highlighted the prefrontal cortex, a major brain area that regulates inhibitory control of behaviors, whose activity becomes dysregulated upon alcohol abuse. However, whether an endogenous mechanism exists within this brain area that limits alcohol consumption is unknown. Here we identify a discrete GABAergic neuronal ensemble in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) that is selectively recruited during binge alcohol-drinking and intoxication. Upon alcohol intoxication, this neuronal ensemble suppresses binge drinking behavior. Optogenetically silencing of this population, or its ablation, results in uncontrolled binge alcohol consumption. We find that this neuronal ensemble is specific to alcohol and is not recruited by other rewarding substances. We further show, using brain-wide analysis, that this neuronal ensemble projects widely, and that its projections specifically to the mediodorsal thalamus are responsible for regulating binge alcohol drinking. Together, these results identify a brain circuit in the mOFC that serves to protect against binge drinking by halting alcohol intake. These results provide valuable insights into the complex nature of alcohol abuse and offers potential avenues for the development of mOFC neuronal ensemble-targeted interventions.

">Simultaneous dual-color calcium imaging in freely-behaving mice</a></h4>

              
                Miniaturized fluorescence microscopes (miniscopes) enable imaging of calcium events from a large population of neurons with single-cell resolution in freely behaving animals. Traditionally, miniscopes have only been able to record from a single fluorescence wavelength. Here, we present a new open-source dual-channel Miniscope that simultaneously records two wavelengths in freely behaving animals, providing more flexibility and function. To enable simultaneous acquisition of two fluorescent wavelengths, we incorporated two CMOS sensors with two independent sets of emission filters into a single Miniscope. This enables us to acquire images at the full frame rate that the CMOS sensor supports while simultaneously eliminating crosstalk between channels, which allows imaging fluorophores that heavily overlap in their emission spectrums (for example, GFP and tdTomato). We adopted a design that enables adjusting the position of one imaging sensor along the light path to match the focal plane of the other sensor, providing additional flexibility for calibration. To validate our dual-channel Miniscope in vivo, we imaged hippocampal CA1 region that co-expressed a dynamic calcium indicator (GCaMP) and a static nuclear signal (constitutively active tdTomato) while mice ran on a linear track. We used GCaMP signals to investigate spatial coding in the hippocampus and tdTomato signals as a landmark for registration of neurons across recording sessions. Our results suggest that, even when neurons were registered across recording sessions using tdTomato signals, hippocampal spatial coding changes over time as previously reported. In conclusion, our novel dual-channel Miniscope enables imaging of two fluorescence wavelengths in the same focal plane with minimal crosstalk between the two channels, opening the doors to a multitude of new experimental possibilities.

">New Atg9 phosphorylation sites regulate autophagic trafficking in glia</a></h4>

              
                We previously identified a role for dAuxilin (dAux), the fly homolog of Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), in glial autophagy contributing to Parkinson's disease (PD). To further dissect the mechanism, we present evidence here that lack of glial dAux enhanced the phosphorylation of the autophagy-related protein Atg9 at two newly identified threonine residues, T62 and T69. Enhanced Atg9 phosphorylation in the absence of glial dAux is potentially regulated through the master autophagy regulator Atg1, as the presence of which is required for Atg9 to interact with dAux in an otherwise separate condition. The enhanced Atg9 phosphorylation promotes autophagosome formation and Atg9 trafficking to the autophagosomes in glia. Whereas the expression of the non-phosphorylatable Atg9 variants suppresses the lack of dAux-induced increase in both autophagosome formation and Atg9 trafficking to autophagosome, the expression of the phophomimetic Atg9 variants restores the lack of Atg1-induced decrease in both events. Notably, Atg9 phosphorylation at T62 and T69 contributes to DA neurodegeneration and locomotor dysfunction implicated in PD. Thus, we have identified a dAux-Atg1-Atg9 axis relaying signals through the Atg9 phosphorylation at T62 and T69; these findings further elaborate the mechanism of dAux regulating glial autophagy and highlight the significance of protein degradation pathway in glia contributing to PD.

">Retinal bipolar cells borrow excitability from electrically coupled inhibitory interneurons to amplify excitatory synaptic transmission</a></h4>

              
                Bipolar cells of the retina carry visual information from photoreceptors in the outer retina to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the inner retina. Bipolar cells express L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels at the synaptic terminal, but generally lack other types of channels capable of regenerative activity. As a result, the flow of information from outer to inner retina along bipolar cell processes is generally passive in nature, with no opportunity for signal boost or amplification along the way. Here we report the surprising discovery that blocking voltage-gated Na+ channels profoundly reduces the synaptic output of one class of bipolar cell, the type 6 ON bipolar cell (CBC6), despite the fact that the CBC6 itself does not express voltage-gated Na+ channels. Instead, CBC6 borrows voltage-gated Na+ channels from its neighbor, the inhibitory AII amacrine cell, with whom it is connected via an electrical synapse. Thus, an inhibitory neuron aids in amplification of an excitatory signal as it moves through the retina, ensuring that small changes in the membrane potential of bipolar cells are reliably passed onto downstream RGCs.

">Hierarchical cortical plasticity in congenital sight impairment</a></h4>

              
                A robust learning system balances adaptability to new experiences with stability of its foundational architecture. To investigate how the human brain implements this we used a new approach to study plasticity and stability across hierarchical processing stages in visual cortex. We compare the rod system of individuals born with rod-only photoreceptor inputs (achromatopsia) to the typically developed rod system, allowing us to dissociate impacts of life-long versus transient responses to altered input. Cortical input stages (V1) exhibited high stability, with structural hallmarks of deprivation and no retinotopic reorganisation. However, plasticity manifested as reorganised read-out of these inputs by higher-order cortex, in a pattern that could compensate for the lower resolution of a rod-only system and its lack of high-density foveal input. We propose that these hierarchical dynamics robustly optimize processing of available input and could reflect a broader principle of brain organisation with important implications for emerging sight-recue therapies.

">Hippocampal-entorhinal cognitive maps and cortical motor system represent action plans and their outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Efficiently interacting with the environment requires weighing and selecting among multiple alternative actions based on their associated outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these processes are still debated. We showed that forming relations between arbitrary action-outcome associations involved building a cognitive map. Using a novel immersive virtual reality paradigm, participants learned 2D abstract motor action-outcome associations and later compared action combinations while their brain activity was monitored with fMRI. We observed a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans. Furthermore, hippocampal activity scaled with the 2D similarity between outcomes of these action plans. Conversely, the supplementary motor area (SMA) represented individual actions, showing a stronger response to overlapping action plans. Crucially, the connectivity between hippocampus and SMA was modulated by the similarity between the action plans, suggesting their complementary roles in action evaluation. These findings provide evidence for the role of cognitive maps in action selection, challenging classical models of memory taxonomy and its neural bases.

                KCNB1 encodes the Kv2.1 potassium channel alpha subunit. De novo pathogenic variants of KCNB1 with loss-of-function (LOF) properties have been associated with neurodevelopmental and epileptic disorders (DEE) diagnosed in early childhood. The study aims to characterize a knock-out (KO) zebrafish line targeting kcnb1 (kcnb1+/- and kcnb1-/-). We examined the spatial expression of kcnb1, as well as phenotypic behavior, cellular, and electrophysiological activity of fish during early development stages. In wild-type larval zebrafish, kcnb1 was found in various regions of the central nervous system but was undetected in the KO model. Both kcnb1+/- and kcnb1-/- zebrafish displayed impaired swimming behavior and epilepsy-like features that persisted through embryonic and larval development, with variable severity. When exposed to the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), mutant fish showed elevated locomotor activity and epileptiform-like electrographic activity. In addition, PTZ-exposed kcnb1-/- larvae exhibited higher bdnf mRNA expression and activated c-Fos positive neurons in the telencephalon. In this KO model, neuronal circuits, muscle fibers and neuromuscular junction organization remained unaffected, including normal AchR cluster distribution, although a decreased AchE mRNA expression was observed. kcnb1 KO zebrafish develops early DEE-like phenotypes that affects neuronal functions. This study highlights the relevance of the model for investigating developmental neuronal signaling pathways in KCNB1-related DEEs.

">Atypical chemokine receptor 3 regulates synaptic removal in disease astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes participate in the clearance of obsolete or unwanted neuronal synapses. However, the molecular machinery recruited for the recognition of synapses is not fully clarified, especially in pathological conditions. Here, we investigated the phagocytic process through individual gene silencing using a druggable gene library. Our study demonstrates that astrocyte-mediated synapse engulfment is regulated by the Atypical chemokine receptor 3 (Ackr3). Mechanistically, we have shown that Ackr3 recognizes phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-bound Cxcl12 at synaptic terminals both in vitro and in cell culture thus serving as a novel marker of synaptic dysfunction. Notably, both the receptor and its ligand are overexpressed in post-mortem AD human brains, and downregulation of the receptor in AD mouse models (5xFAD) significantly diminishes astrocyte-mediated synaptic elimination. Overall, this work unveils a novel, possibly targetable mechanism of astrocyte-mediated synaptic engulfment implicated in the most common neurodegenerative disease.

">Ultra-high temporal resolution 4D angiography using arterial spin labeling with subspace reconstruction</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To achieve ultra-high temporal resolution non-contrast 4D angiography with improved spatiotemporal fidelity. Methods: Continuous data acquisition using 3D golden-angle sampling following an arterial spin labeling preparation allows for flexibly reconstructing 4D dynamic angiograms at arbitrary temporal resolutions. However, k-space data is often temporally "binned" before image reconstruction, negatively affecting spatiotemporal fidelity and limiting temporal resolution. In this work, a subspace was extracted by linearly compressing a dictionary constructed from simulated curves of an angiographic kinetic model. The subspace was used to represent and reconstruct the voxelwise signal timecourse at the same temporal resolution as the data acquisition without temporal binning. Physiological parameters were estimated from the resulting images using a Bayesian fitting approach. A group of 8 healthy subjects were scanned and the in-vivo results reconstructed by different methods were compared. Due to difficulty of obtaining ground truth 4D angiograms with ultra-high temporal resolution, the in-vivo results were cross-validated with numerical simulations. Results: The proposed method enables 4D time-resolved angiography with much higher temporal resolution (14.7 ms) than previously reported (~50 ms) whilst maintaining high spatial resolution (1.1 mm isotropic). Blood flow dynamics were depicted in greater detail, thin vessel visibility was improved, and the estimated physiological parameters also exhibited more realistic spatial patterns with the proposed method. Conclusion: Incorporating a subspace compressed kinetic model into the reconstruction of 4D ASL angiograms notably improved the temporal resolution and spatiotemporal fidelity, which was subsequently beneficial for accurate physiological modeling.

">Postprandial sleep in short-sleeping Mexican cavefish</a></h4>

              
                Interaction between sleep and feeding behaviors are critical for adaptive fitness. Diverse species suppress sleep when food is scarce to increase the time spent foraging. Post-prandial sleep, an increase in sleep time following a feeding event, has been documented in vertebrate and invertebrate animals. While interactions between sleep and feeding appear to be highly conserved, the evolution of postprandial sleep in response to changes in food availability remains poorly understood. Multiple populations of the Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, have independently evolved sleep loss and increased food consumption compared to surface-dwelling fish of the same species, providing the opportunity to investigate the evolution of interactions between sleep and feeding. Here, we investigate effects of feeding on sleep in larval and adult surface fish, and two parallelly evolved cave populations of A. mexicanus. Larval surface and cave populations of A. mexicanus increase sleep immediately following a meal, providing the first evidence of postprandial sleep in a fish model. The amount of sleep was not correlated to meal size and occurred independently of feeding time. In contrast to larvae, postprandial sleep was not detected in adult surface or cavefish, that can survive for months without food. Together, these findings reveal that postprandial sleep is present in multiple short-sleeping populations of cavefish, suggesting sleep-feeding interactions are retained despite the evolution of sleep loss. These findings raise the possibility that postprandial sleep is critical for energy conservation and survival in larvae that are highly sensitive to food deprivation.

">Simulating a medical expertise: a robust novel stress induction paradigm in chronic pain patients</a></h4>

              
                Maladaptive stress responses may exacerbate chronic widespread pain (CWP) and deserve further investigations. Yet, existing paradigms lack relevance for individuals with this condition. Hence, we developed the Social Benefits Stress Test (SBST), adapted from the Trier Social Stress Test. Instead of a job interview, the patients task is to justify their inability to work in front of a simulated medical expert in social insurances. Forty women with a type of CWP: hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorders were included. After a 30-min baseline, they had 5 minutes to justify their inability to work, followed by an arithmetic task. After a recovery period, patients were fully debriefed. The psychophysiological stress response was captured using self-reported stress ratings, salivary cortisol and -amylase, and continuous physiological monitoring including heart rate variability (HRV). Compared to baseline, the analysis revealed a significant and transient increase in stress ratings during the stress task associated with a peak in salivary biomarkers concentrations. Physiological stress response was reported through HRV during the task with significant increase in heart rate, decrease in high frequency power (HF), increase in low frequency power (LF) and in LF/HF ratio. Stress ratings positively correlated with changes in salivary biomarkers and LF/HF ratio. The results validate the SBST as a relevant experimental model of social stress in CWP patients as it induced a reproducible moderate stress response across subjective and physiological measures. The SBST opens up for important new studies on the relationship between stress and maintenance of chronic pain.

">Genetic liability underlying reward-related comorbidity in psychiatric disorders involves the coincident functions of autism-linked ADGRL1 and hevin</a></h4>

              
                Comorbidity between psychiatric traits is thought to involve overlapping pleiotropic effects from sets of genes. Notably, substance abuse is a shared comorbid condition among various neurodevelopmental disorders with externalizing symptoms such as autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, thus hinting at the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as a site for predisposition underlying convergence of genetic influences in reward-related comorbidity. Here, we identify the autism-related gene encoding the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) Latrophilin-1/ADGRL1 as an essential transducer of reward mechanisms in the NAc. We found that ADGRL1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed throughout major NAc neuronal populations in mice. A mouse model of pan-neuronal Adgrl1 deficiency in the NAc displayed cocaine-seeking impairments in adult individuals denoting its role in drug-induced reinforcement and reward. Connecting molecular pathways of cocaine-induced learning, we uncover that ADGRL1 constitutes a functional receptor for autism-related cocaine effector molecule hevin/SPARCL1. Indeed, hevin interacts with membrane-expressed ADGRL1 and induces its internalization while stabilizing its uncleaved fraction. Moreover, hevin alters the formation of intercellular adhesion contacts mediated by ADGRL1 and Neurexin-1. Importantly, the functional constitutive coupling between ADGRL1 and various G protein pathways is selectively modulated by hevin stimulation with a bias toward Gi3, Gs, and G13 proteins. These findings unveil the dual role of ADGRL1 and hevin as genetic risk factors for both psychiatric disorders and substance abuse to define the molecular etiology of comorbidity.

">Asymmetric learning and adaptability to changes in relational structure during transitive inference</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals can generalise from local to global relationships in a transitive manner. Recent research has shown that asymmetrically biased learning, where beliefs about only the winners (or losers) of local comparisons are updated, is well-suited for inferring relational structures from sparse feedback. However, less is known about how belief-updating biases intersect with humans' capacity to adapt to changes in relational structure, where revaluing an item may have downstream implications for inferential knowledge pertaining to unchanged items. We designed a transitive inference paradigm involving one of two possible changepoints for which an asymmetric (winner- or loser-biased) learning policy was more or less optimal. Participants (N=83) exhibited differential sensitivity to changes in relational structure: whereas participants readily learned that a hitherto low-ranking item increased its rank, moving a high-ranking item down the hierarchy impaired downstream inferential knowledge. Behaviour best captured by an adaptive reinforcement learning model which exhibited a predominantly winner-biased learning policy but also modulated its degree of asymmetry as a function of its choice preference strength. Our results indicate that asymmetric learning not only accounts for efficient inference of latent relational structures, but also for differences in the ease with which learners accommodate structural changes.

">The bodily appearance of a virtual partner affects the activity of the action observation and action monitoring systems in a minimally interactive task</a></h4>

              
                One pending question in social neuroscience is whether interpersonal interactions are processed differently by the brain depending on the bodily characteristics of the interactor, i.e., their physical appearance. To address this issue, we engaged participants in a minimally interactive task with an avatar either showing bodily features or not while recording their brain activity using Electroencephalography (EEG) in order to investigate indices of action observation and action monitoring processing. Multivariate results showed that bodily compared to non-bodily appearance modulated parieto-occipital neural patterns throughout the entire duration of the observed movement and that, importantly, such patterns differ from the ones related to initial shape processing. Furthermore, among the electrocortical indices of action monitoring, only the early observational Positivity (oPe) was responsive to the bodily appearance of the observed agent under the specific task requirement to predict the partner movement. Taken together, these findings broaden the understanding of how bodily appearance shapes the spatiotemporal processing of an interactor movements. This holds particular relevance in our modern society, where human-virtual agent interactions are rapidly becoming ubiquitous .

	<p>Lateropulsion is a post-stroke phenomenon marked by an active push of the body across the midline towards the more affected side and/or a resistance of the weight shift towards the less affected side. Within the mechanisms of treatment, feedback systems have been shown to be effective. The aim of the present study was to create a body of knowledge by performing a literature review on the use of feedback mechanisms in the treatment of lateropulsion and to report two cases of lateropulsion patients who had undergone feedback-based treatment. Methods: The review was performed across five different databases (Embase, Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro) up to February 2024, and haptic feedback intervention was incorporated into the case series (with lateropulsion and ambulation capacity as the main variables). Results: In total, 211 records were identified and 6 studies were included after the review of the literature. The most used feedback modality was visual feedback. In the case series, positive results were observed from the intervention, particularly in the recovery of lateropulsion and balance, as well as in the improvement of gait for one patient. Patients demonstrated good adherence to the intervention protocol without adverse effects. Conclusions: Visual feedback is the most commonly used feedback modality in lateropulsion patients but other mechanisms such as haptic feedback also are feasible and should be taken into account. Larger sample sizes, extended follow-up periods, and the isolation of feedback mechanisms must be established to clarify evidence.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To study the correlation between positive cochlin tomoprotein testing (CTP), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and the auditory and vestibular function amongst patients with sudden hearing loss. Study Design: Prospective case series. Methods: We prospectively examined eight patients who presented with sudden hearing loss (&amp;amp;gt;60 dB) with or without vertigo or tinnitus. We performed an ELISA-based CTP detection test using middle ear lavage samples. In addition to the CTP examination, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed using different sequences (T1 and a T1 sequence with a contrast medium (CM), a T2 sequence, 4 h delayed intravenous gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D FLAIR)). Results: All patients with sudden hearing loss (&amp;amp;gt;60 dB) presented a non-specific contrast enhancement in the cochlea and vestibulum on the affected side on delayed 3D-FLAIR MRI. Four patients had a positive CTP test, suggesting a perilymphatic fistula (PLF). However, no specific MRI signal for a PLF was observed. Conclusions: Using multimodal diagnostic measures, such as CTP testing and different MRI sequences, no correlation could be found in patients with a PLF.</p>

                Background: Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) or Leriche syndrome, is a peripheral artery disease, specifically affecting the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries. Presentation of AIOD patients ranged from asymptomatic to having limb-threatening emergencies. Advances and innovations in endovascular devices have replaced surgical approach for AIOD treatment. Here we reported a 52-year-old man presenting with AIOD managed by endovascular approach using kissing stent technique. Case presentation: A 52-year-old man, with history of chronic coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, long-standing hypertension, and who was a heavy smoker, was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of long time with bilateral claudication and became leg rest pain. He had history of aorto-infrarenal occlusion known from previous percutaneous coronary intervention from right and left femoral artery access. Aortoiliac occlusive disease (TASC II Type D Class) diagnosis was made by lower extremity duplex ultrasound and CT angiography. The patient underwent urgent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with kissing stent technique. The patient was discharged 4 days after the procedure without any significant complaints, received optimal medical treatment, and was educated about smoking cessation. Conclusion: Treatment of AIOD should include both modification of risk factors and efforts to increase perfusion to the lower extremities. An endovascular approach is an excellent alternative and may replace surgical approach in complex aortoiliac obstructive disease. In this case report, an endovascular approach with kissing stent technique showed good results for the patient.

                Introduction The aim of the research was to demonstrate the efficiency of microorganisms and the effectiveness of biodegradation techniques on Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics. The research question was: What is the efficiency of LDPE-degrading microorganisms and the effectiveness of biodegradation techniques? Methods The systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Articles were obtained from Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), Embase, and Google Scholar. The DeCS/Mesh search terms were: Low-density polyethylene, efficiency, biodegradation, microbial consortia, fungi, bacteria. Inclusion criteria were: scientific articles that included bacteria, fungi, and microbial consortia reported as LDPE degraders that report the percentage of weight loss; articles published from January 2010 to October 2022, and publications in Spanish and English with open access. Exclusion criteria were: studies that do not report gravimetry, the biodegradation time of LDPE, and the genus or species of the polyethylene-degrading microorganism. Results Out of 483 studies found, 50 were included in this Systematic Review (SR). The most frequent study techniques were scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gravimetry, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and in the case of microorganisms, the most studied belonged to the genus Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Aspergillus. Regarding the isolation place, the most frequent mentioned in the reviewed articles were landfill soil and sanitary landfill soil. The efficiency of LDPE-degrading microorganisms was higher in bacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Pantoea spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Bacillus spp., which obtained a range of DE of 9.00-70.00%, 24.00-64%, 1.15 – 61.00%, 45.00%, and 1.5-40% with DT of 4-150, 120, 4-150, 30, and 30-120 days, respectively; in the case of fungi, the main microorganisms are Neopestalotiopsis phangngaensis, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Thyrostroma jaczewskii with efficiencies of 54.34, 48.78, and 46.34%, in 90 days, respectively; and the most efficient microbial consortia were from Enterobacter spp. and Pantoea sp. with 38.00 – 81.00%, in 120 days; and, Pseudomonas protegens, Stenotrophomonas sp., B. vallismortis and Paenibacillus sp. with 55. 00 – 75.00% in 120 days. Conclusions The most efficient microorganisms in LDPE degradation are Enterobacter spp., Pantoea spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Bacillus spp.; in fungi Neopestalotiopsis phangngaensis, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Thyrostroma jaczewskii; and in microbial consortia, those formed by Enterobacter spp. and Pantoea sp., and that of P. protegens, Stenotrophomonas sp., B. vallismortis and Paenibacillus sp.; and the most effective techniques used in LDPE biodegradation are SEM, gravimetry, and FTIR.

                Background Recent innovations are making radiology more advanced for patient and patient services. Under the immense burden of radiology practice, Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists in obtaining Computed Tomography (CT) images with less scan time, proper patient placement, low radiation dose (RD), and improved image quality (IQ). Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the positioning accuracy, RD, and IQ of AI-based automatic and manual positioning techniques for CT kidney ureters and bladder (CT KUB). Methods This prospective study included 143 patients in each group who were referred for computed tomography (CT) KUB examination. Group 1 patients underwent manual positioning (MP), and group 2 patients underwent AI-based automatic positioning (AP) for CT KUB examination. The scanning protocol was kept constant for both the groups. The off-center distance, RD, and quantitative and qualitative IQ of each group were evaluated and compared. Results The AP group (9.66±6.361 mm) had significantly less patient off-center distance than the MP group (15.12±9.55 mm). There was a significant reduction in RD in the AP group compared with that in the MP group. The quantitative image noise (IN) was lower, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the AP group than in the MP group (p<0.05). Qualitative IQ parameters such as IN, sharpness, and overall IQ also showed significant differences (p< 0.05), with higher scores in the AP group than in the MP group. Conclusions The AI-based AP showed higher positioning accuracy with less off-center distance (44%), which resulted in 12% reduction in RD and improved IQ for CT KUB imaging compared with MP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-744/v1?src=rss">Teacher attributes as predictors of assessment practices in public universities of Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Higher education teachers dwell on various classroom assessment practices. Their assessment practices play a significant part of the teaching learning process and in determining student achievement. In this respect, their different attributes determine the nature of their classroom assessment practices. This cross-sectional survey study aimed to examine differences in assessment practices among public university teachers with respect to their academic status, teaching experience, assessment training and specializations. Methods The study adopted Assessment Practices Inventory (API) which was distributed to a sample of 380 randomly selected teachers from four public universities. The majorities (93.4%) of questionnaires which were properly completed were entered to SPSS version 25 software and used for analysis. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used for analysis and Pillai’s Trace was utilized for interpretation of the results. Results The results showed that academic status (P= .000); teaching experience (P = .000); and assessment training (P =.030) had significant differences for the combined dependent variables (assessment practice). However, field of specialization (P =.130) did not show significant difference in the overall assessment practice although differences were observed in assessment design and interpretation. Conclusion Academic status, teaching experience, and assessment training are important attributes of teachers that shape their assessment practices. Therefore, as teachers hold the sole responsibility of classroom assessment, training and development courses in assessment, experience sharing and learning opportunities are necessary regardless of their specializations, academic status, and teaching experience.

                Abstract* Background Attachment style and object relation maturity have been linked to patterns of relating to others and mental health outcomes. However, little research has tested how these processes relate or the level of unique variance they each account for in outcomes. This study aimed to explore these issues. Methods A sample of n = 77 adults completed self-report scales of attachment style, splitting and dyadic splitting tendencies and mental distress (measured via the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8) scales). Questionnaires were completed online. Results The results suggested that anxious attachment and tendency towards splitting were related to higher levels of mental distress. Splitting was positively related to attachment anxiety and avoidance. However, a series of mediation models (testing the relationship between splitting and mental health, mediated by attachment avoidance and anxiety) suggested that anxious attachment did not predict unique variance in distress. Splitting remained related to mental distress but was not mediated by anxious or avoidant attachment styles. Conclusions The findings point towards potential links between two distinct aspects of systems that influence relating and psychological wellbeing. They also suggested that addressing both aspects will be beneficial in helping clients improve their relationships and well-being.

                Background The objective was to investigate the impact of physical activity (PA) teaching and learning approaches in healthcare professionals (HCPs) education on PA-related knowledge, confidence, and behaviour. Methods Eligible experimental studies investigated the effect of interventions that incorporate PA in to the undergraduate and postgraduate education, and continuous professional development of any HCP (medical doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, etc.) on PA-related outcomes including knowledge, perceptions, and confidence to prescribe PA. Six databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, Medline, and SPORTDiscus) were searched from inception to October 2022. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. A narrative data synthesis was undertaken to assess the overall effectiveness of the reviewed educational interventions: knowledge, perceptions, confidence, attitudes, beliefs, and changes in behaviour/practice. Results A total of 32 studies comprising 3,256 participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The most frequently employed learning approach in eligible studies was training workshops (n=13), followed by experiential learning (n=4). Half of the studies included knowledge as an outcome (n=16) and 10 studies each included a measure of confidence and changes in behaviour/practice. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=7), showed no improvement in any measure of knowledge, confidence, or behaviour. Two RCTs reported beneficial effects of experiential learning on confidence and perceived behavioural control. In non-randomised studies, training workshops and didactic input with and without simulated e-learning led to statistical improvements in knowledge, confidence, perceived competence, and attitudes. Discussion Most of the eligible studies lacked an adequate sample size, and, in many cases, there was a high loss to follow up which represents a threat to the internal validity of the studies. We found that a blended approach to teaching and learning supported with experiential or simulated experiences to improve the knowledge, perceived competence, and confidence to prescribe PA.

                Health systems are experiencing increasing pressures worldwide due to heightened service demands, demographic aging, stringent regulations, and economic constraints, making efficiency and efficacy in health management critical aspects. At the heart of this complexity, health managers seek to optimize resources and improve care delivery at a time when the adoption of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), becomes increasingly imperative. This necessity reflects not only the pursuit of innovation but also the urgency to adapt to an ever-evolving environment. However, the effective characterization, availability, and incorporation of these technologies as support tools still represent an emerging challenge that is insufficiently explored in the literature. In response, this project proposes the development of a framework of theoretical and practical guidelines for the implementation and management of digital tools in health systems in the age of AI. Adopting a mixed-methods approach that includes systematic review, analyses of commercial off-the-shelf solutions, and qualitative studies with health managers and practitioners, the aim is to map current technology use, identify gaps and best practices, and provide a guide for future direction. This project also intends to develop in co-creation with professionals in the field to ensure the relevance and practical applicability of the developed guidelines. The results are expected to not only contribute to the scientific literature but also offer an evidence-based guide to optimizing the use of digital technologies in health management, promoting a significant transformation in the development and adoption of innovative digital solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-740/v1?src=rss">Protocol for scoping review: Instruments for assessing vision-specific health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with visual impairment. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Childhood visual impairment (VI) is less common than in adults, but research has demonstrated that it can have significant long-term negative impacts on the health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) of children and adolescents. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of vision-specific instruments available for accurately assessing HR-QoL in children and adolescents with VI, particularly in resource-limited settings. The objective of this scoping review is to methodically evaluate the evidence pertaining to (1) the accessibility and usage of instruments specifically designed to assess HR-QoL in children and adolescents who have VI, (2) summarise studies on HR-QoL in children and adolescent with VI, and (3) describe the psychometric properties of vision-specific instruments used for assessing HR-QoL in children and adolescents with VI. The review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guideline (2020) for scoping reviews, utilizing frameworks by Arksey and O’Malley, and methodological enhancements suggested by Levac (2010). A systematic search will be performed through various databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost, to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English from inception until 31 December 2023. The EBSCOhost platform will include several databases, such as Academic Search Complete, APA PsycINFO, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and Open Dissertations. The extracted data will be analysed narratively using QualCoder 1.9 version, and the study’s findings will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The researchers anticipate that the literature will assist in exploring and relating various types of HR-QoL tools used globally. This review’s conclusion will help researchers ascertain research gaps in vision-related QoL instruments based on different economies, countries, and environments. This will further aid researchers in planning and developing tools suitable for African contexts and languages.

                Background Healthcare, like other industries, emphasizes performance, quality, and consumer experience while also attempting to reduce costs. However, high-quality healthcare remains paramount for vulnerable and ill patients. This study aimed to investigate parents' and caregivers' level of satisfaction with physiotherapy services provided to neuropediatric outpatients on the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study included 103 parents/caregivers of children with neurological disabilities that were randomly selected from different Emirates Health Services Hospitals in the UAE. Data was collected using the long-form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-III). Results The overall mean satisfaction was 159±7.73 (out of 250 points). Communication (20.36/25), interpersonal factors (20.17/35), and doctor-patient time (20.17/35) had the highest mean satisfaction scores (8.06/10). The lowest mean satisfaction scores were for access/availability/convenience (34.60/60), technical quality (33.17/50), and economic elements (23.83/40). Conclusion Despite participants’ overall satisfaction scores being positive, some service domains require improvement to improve satisfaction, specifically the access/availability/convenience, technical quality, and economic elements. These areas should be prioritized by service providers and managers to improve patients’ experiences and clinical outcomes.

<p>Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the “core” thalamocortical projection to the neocortex in the African elephant. In the elephant and other mammals with unusual skin (such as pachydermatous skin), layer 4 is cytoarchitecturally indistinct, possibly absent, and the thalamocortical input terminates primarily on the neurons forming the inner sublamina of layer 3.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although the mammalian cerebral cortex is most often described as a hexalaminar structure, there are cortical areas (primary motor cortex) and species (elephants, cetaceans, and hippopotami), where a cytoarchitecturally indistinct, or absent, layer 4 is noted. Thalamocortical projections from the core, or first order, thalamic system terminate primarily in layers 4/inner 3. We explored the termination sites of core thalamocortical projections in cortical areas and in species where there is no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 using the immunolocalization of vesicular glutamate transporter 2, a known marker of core thalamocortical axon terminals, in 31 mammal species spanning the eutherian radiation. Several variations from the canonical cortical column outline of layer 4 and core thalamocortical inputs were noted. In shrews/microchiropterans, layer 4 was present, but many core thalamocortical projections terminated in layer 1 in addition to layers 4 and inner 3. In primate primary visual cortex, the sublaminated layer 4 was associated with a specialized core thalamocortical projection pattern. In primate primary motor cortex, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was evident and the core thalamocortical projections terminated throughout layer 3. In the African elephant, cetaceans, and river hippopotamus, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was observed and core thalamocortical projections terminated primarily in inner layer 3 and less densely in outer layer 3. These findings are contextualized in terms of cortical processing, perception, and the evolutionary trajectory leading to an indistinct or absent cortical layer 4.</p>

<p>This study matched physiology and anatomical subregions in the chicken inferior colliculus. We found neural topographies for binaural sound localization cues, but, in contrast to the well-studied barn owl, there was no distinct differentiation of responses in the different subregions.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The sound localization behavior of the nocturnally hunting barn owl and its underlying neural computations is a textbook example of neuroethology. Differences in sound timing and level at the two ears are integrated in a series of well-characterized steps, from brainstem to inferior colliculus (IC), resulting in a topographical neural representation of auditory space. It remains an important question of brain evolution: How is this specialized case derived from a more plesiomorphic pattern? The present study is the first to match physiology and anatomical subregions in the non-owl avian IC. Single-unit responses in the chicken IC were tested for selectivity to different frequencies and to the binaural difference cues. Their anatomical origin was reconstructed with the help of electrolytic lesions and immunohistochemical identification of different subregions of the IC, based on previous characterizations in owl and chicken. In contrast to barn owl, there was no distinct differentiation of responses in the different subregions. We found neural topographies for both binaural cues but no evidence for a coherent representation of auditory space. The results are consistent with previous work in pigeon IC and chicken higher-order midbrain and suggest a plesiomorphic condition of multisensory integration in the midbrain that is dominated by lateral panoramic vision.</p>

<p>Sagittal section of adult mouse brain showing selective layer2 expression of gene <i>Lypd1</i> at the insular (Ins) and postrhinal (PoRh) cortex, representing rostrolateral and caudal parts of the mesocortical ring, with negative surrounding isocortical and allocortical areas.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Data mining was performed at the databases of the Allen Institute for Brain Science (<a target="_blank"
   class="accessionId"

   title="Link to external resource: RRID:SCR_017001">RRID:SCR_017001</a>) searching for genes expressed selectively throughout the adult mouse mesocortex (transitional cortex ring predicted within the concentric ring theory of mammalian cortical structure, in contrast with central isocortex [ICx] and peripheral allocortex). We aimed to explore a shared molecular profile selective of all or most mesocortex areas. This approach checks and corroborates the precision of other previous definitory criteria, such as poor myelination and high kainate receptor level. Another aim was to examine which cortical areas properly belong to mesocortex. A total of 34 positive adult selective marker genes of mesocortex were identified, jointly with 12 negative selective markers, making a total of 46 markers. All of them identify the same set of cortical areas surrounding the molecularly different ICx as well as excluding adjacent allocortex. Four representative mesocortex markers—<i>Crym</i>, <i>Lypd1</i>, <i>Cdh13</i>, and <i>Smoc2</i>—are amply illustrated, jointly with complementary material including <i>myelin basic protein</i>, to check myelination, and <i>Rorb</i>, to check layer 4 presence. The retrosplenial (ReSp) area, long held to be mesocortical, does not share any of the 46 markers of mesocortex and instead expresses <i>Nr4a2</i> and <i>Tshz2</i>, selective parahippocampal allocortex markers. Moreover, it is not hypomyelinic and lacks a <i>Rorb</i>-positive layer 4, aspects generally present in mesocortex. Exclusion of the ReSp area from the mesocortex ring reveals the latter to be closed at this locus instead by two adjacent areas previously thought to be associative visual ICx (reidentified here molecularly as postsplenial and parasplenial mesocortex areas). The concepts of ICx, mesocortex, and parahippocampal allocortex are thus subtly modified by substantial molecular evidence.</p>

     alt="Atypical Course of the Habenulo-Interpeduncular Tract in Chick Embryos"/>
<p>The retroflex tract is a prominent diencephalic landmark in vertebrates but seems absent in adult avian. Here, using BEN immunohistochemistry that specifically identifies fibers of this tract, we study their distribution from the habenular region to the interpeduncular complex. We found that many habenular fibers diverge in an atypical dispersed course through the thalamic cell mass and toward the prethalamic region (top figure). The diagram shows the atypical course of the fibers. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Classical studies of the avian diencephalon hardly mention the habenulo-interpeduncular tract (a.k.a. retroflex tract), although both the habenula (HB) (its origin) and the interpeduncular nuclear complex (its target) are present. Retroflex tract fibers were described at early embryonic stages but seem absent in the adult in routine stains. However, this tract is a salient diencephalic landmark in all other vertebrate lineages. It typically emerges out of the caudal HB, courses dorsoventrally across thalamic alar and basal plates just in front of the thalamo-pretectal boundary, and then sharply bends 90° caudalwards at paramedian basal plate levels (this is the “retroflexion”), to approach longitudinally via paramedian pretectum and midbrain the rostralmost hindbrain, specifically the prepontine median interpeduncular complex across isthmus and rhombomere 1. We systematize this habenulo-interpeduncular course into four parts named subhabenular, retrothalamic, tegmental, and interpeduncular. We reexamined the chicken habenulo-interpeduncular fibers at stages HH30 and HH35 (6.5- and 9-day incubation) by mapping them specifically with immunoreaction for BEN protein, a well-known marker. We found that only a small fraction of the stained retroflex tract fibers approaches the basal plate by coursing along the standard dorsoventral pathway in front of the thalamo-pretectal boundary. Many other habenular fibers instead diverge into atypical dispersed courses across the thalamic cell mass (implying alteration of the first subhabenular part of the standard course) before reaching the basal plate; this dispersion explains their invisibility. A significant number of such transthalamic habenular fibers cross orthogonally the zona limitans (ZLI) (the rostral thalamic boundary) and invade the caudal alar prethalamus. Here, they immediately descend dorsoventrally, just rostrally to the ZLI, until reaching the prethalamic basal plate, where they bend (retroflex) caudalwards, entering the thalamic basal paramedian area. These atypical fibers gradually fasciculate with the other groups of habenular efferent fibers in their final longitudinal approach to the hindbrain interpeduncular complex. We conclude that the poor visibility of this tract in birds is due to its dispersion into a diversity of atypical alternative routes, though all components eventually reach the interpeduncular complex. This case merits further analysis of the diverse permissive versus nonpermissive guidance mechanisms called into action, which partially correlate distinctly with successive diencephalic, mesencephalic, and hindbrain neuromeric fields and their boundaries.</p>

     alt="Excitatory Projections of Wide Field Collicular Neurons to the Nucleus of the Optic Tract in the Rat"/>
<p>We report a novel class of rat collicular neurons (SCWF<sub>NOT</sub>) with horizontally oriented and spiny-rich dendrites in the retinorecipient superficial layers of the superior colliculus. This subpopulation of excitatory wide field neurons invariably project to the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT), and some of them express the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The superficial layers of the mammalian superior colliculus (SC) contain neurons that are generally responsive to visual stimuli but can differ considerably in morphology and response properties. To elucidate the structure and function of these neurons, we combined extracellular recording and juxtacellular labeling, detailed anatomical reconstruction, and ultrastructural analysis of the synaptic contacts of labeled neurons, using transmission electron microscopy. Our labeled neurons project to different brainstem nuclei. Of particular importance are neurons that fit the morphological criteria of the wide field (WF) neurons and whose dendrites are horizontally oriented. They display a rather characteristic axonal projection pattern to the nucleus of optic tract (NOT); thus, we call them superior collicular WF projecting to the NOT (SCWF<sub>NOT</sub>) neurons. We corroborated the morphological characterization of this neuronal type as a distinct neuronal class with the help of unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. Our ultrastructural data demonstrate that SCWF<sub>NOT</sub> neurons establish excitatory connections with their targets in the NOT. Although, in rodents, the literature about the WF neurons has focused on their extensive projection to the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus, as a conduit for information to reach the visual association areas of the cortex, our data suggest that this subclass of WF neurons may participate in the optokinetic nystagmus.</p>

                E. Courvan et al. show that hypoxia and inflammatory signals synergize to induce rapid transcriptome turnover in macrophages. Using TimeLapse-seq to measure transcript degradation rates and gene expression simultaneously, they find that inflammation generates a distinct hypoxic state with characteristic signaling output, decreased ECM component production, and increased ribosome biosynthesis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84798">Hsp47 promotes biogenesis of multi-subunit neuroreceptors in the endoplasmic reticulum</a></h4>

              
                Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) deficiency is an important contributing factor to neurological and metabolic diseases. However, how the proteostasis network orchestrates the folding and assembly of multi-subunit membrane proteins is poorly understood. Previous proteomics studies identified Hsp47 (Gene: <i>SERPINH1</i>), a heat shock protein in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, as the most enriched interacting chaperone for gamma-aminobutyric type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors. Here, we show that Hsp47 enhances the functional surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in rat neurons and human HEK293T cells. Furthermore, molecular mechanism study demonstrates that Hsp47 acts after BiP (Gene: <i>HSPA5</i>) and preferentially binds the folded conformation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors without inducing the unfolded protein response in HEK293T cells. Therefore, Hsp47 promotes the subunit-subunit interaction, the receptor assembly process, and the anterograde trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Overexpressing Hsp47 is sufficient to correct the surface expression and function of epilepsy-associated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variants in HEK293T cells. Hsp47 also promotes the surface trafficking of other Cys-loop receptors, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and serotonin type 3 receptors in HEK293T cells. Therefore, in addition to its known function as a collagen chaperone, this work establishes that Hsp47 plays a critical and general role in the maturation of multi-subunit Cys-loop neuroreceptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93079">The breath shape controls intonation of mouse vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                Intonation in speech is the control of vocal pitch to layer expressive meaning to communication, like increasing pitch to indicate a question. Also, stereotyped patterns of pitch are used to create distinct sounds with different denotations, like in tonal languages and, perhaps, the 10 sounds in the murine lexicon. A basic tone is created by exhalation through a constricted laryngeal voice box, and it is thought that more complex utterances are produced solely by dynamic changes in laryngeal tension. But perhaps, the shifting pitch also results from altering the swiftness of exhalation. Consistent with the latter model, we describe that intonation in most vocalization types follows deviations in exhalation that appear to be generated by the re-activation of the cardinal breathing muscle for inspiration. We also show that the brainstem vocalization central pattern generator, the iRO, can create this breath pattern. Consequently, ectopic activation of the iRO not only induces phonation, but also the pitch patterns that compose most of the vocalizations in the murine lexicon. These results reveal a novel brainstem mechanism for intonation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92993">Involvement of TRPV4 in temperature-dependent perspiration in mice</a></h4>

              
                Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 (ANO1) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration. In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads, TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5). Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases that were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads, and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. Collectively, TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1, and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89903">Essential function of transmembrane transcription factor MYRF in promoting transcription of miRNA lin-4 during C. elegans development</a></h4>

              
                Precise developmental timing control is essential for organism formation and function, but its mechanisms are unclear. In <i>C. elegans</i>, the microRNA <i>lin-4</i> critically regulates developmental timing by post-transcriptionally downregulating the larval-stage-fate controller LIN-14. However, the mechanisms triggering the activation of <i>lin-4</i> expression toward the end of the first larval stage remain unknown. We demonstrate that the transmembrane transcription factor MYRF-1 is necessary for <i>lin-4</i> activation. MYRF-1 is initially localized on the cell membrane, and its increased cleavage and nuclear accumulation coincide with <i>lin-4</i> expression timing. MYRF-1 regulates <i>lin-4</i> expression cell-autonomously and hyperactive MYRF-1 can prematurely drive <i>lin-4</i> expression in embryos and young first-stage larvae. The tandem <i>lin-4</i> promoter DNA recruits MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> to form visible loci in the nucleus, suggesting that MYRF-1 directly binds to the <i>lin-4</i> promoter. Our findings identify a crucial link in understanding developmental timing regulation and establish MYRF-1 as a key regulator of <i>lin-4</i> expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95727">An atlas of brain-bone sympathetic neural circuits in mice</a></h4>

              
                There is clear evidence that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mediates bone metabolism. Histological studies show abundant SNS innervation of the periosteum and bone marrow-these nerves consist of noradrenergic fibers that immunostain for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine beta hydroxylase, or neuropeptide Y. Nonetheless, the brain sites that send efferent SNS outflow to bone have not yet been characterized. Using pseudorabies (PRV) viral transneuronal tracing, we report, for the first time, the identification of central SNS outflow sites that innervate bone. We find that the central SNS outflow to bone originates from 87 brain nuclei, sub-nuclei and regions of six brain divisions, namely the midbrain and pons, hypothalamus, hindbrain medulla, forebrain, cerebral cortex, and thalamus. We also find that certain sites, such as the raphe magnus (RMg) of the medulla and periaqueductal gray (PAG) of the midbrain, display greater degrees of PRV152 infection, suggesting that there is considerable site-specific variation in the levels of central SNS outflow to bone. This comprehensive compendium illustrating the central coding and control of SNS efferent signals to bone should allow for a greater understanding of the neural regulation of bone metabolism, and importantly and of clinical relevance, mechanisms for central bone pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94608">Perceptual error based on Bayesian cue combination drives implicit motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor system can recalibrate itself without our conscious awareness, a type of procedural learning whose computational mechanism remains undefined. Recent findings on implicit motor adaptation, such as over-learning from small perturbations and fast saturation for increasing perturbation size, challenge existing theories based on sensory errors. We argue that perceptual error, arising from the optimal combination of movement-related cues, is the primary driver of implicit adaptation. Central to our theory is the increasing sensory uncertainty of visual cues with increasing perturbations, which was validated through perceptual psychophysics (Experiment 1). Our theory predicts the learning dynamics of implicit adaptation across a spectrum of perturbation sizes on a trial-by-trial basis (Experiment 2). It explains proprioception changes and their relation to visual perturbation (Experiment 3). By modulating visual uncertainty in perturbation, we induced unique adaptation responses in line with our model predictions (Experiment 4). Overall, our perceptual error framework outperforms existing models based on sensory errors, suggesting that perceptual error in locating one’s effector, supported by Bayesian cue integration, underpins the sensorimotor system’s implicit adaptation.

	<p>The differential diagnosis between atypical Parkinsonian syndromes may be challenging and critical. We aimed to proposed a radiomics-guided deep learning (DL) model to discover interpretable DL features and further verify the proposed model through the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes. We recruited 1495 subjects for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) scanning, including 220 healthy controls and 1275 patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (IPD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Baseline radiomics and two DL models were developed and tested for the Parkinsonian diagnosis. The DL latent features were extracted from the last layer and subsequently guided by radiomics. The radiomics-guided DL model outperformed the baseline radiomics approach, suggesting the effectiveness of the DL approach. DenseNet showed the best diagnosis ability (sensitivity: 95.7%, 90.1%, and 91.2% for IPD, MSA, and PSP, respectively) using retained DL features in the test dataset. The retained DL latent features were significantly associated with radiomics features and could be interpreted through biological explanations of handcrafted radiomics features. The radiomics-guided DL model offers interpretable high-level abstract information for differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian disorders and holds considerable promise for personalized disease monitoring.</p>

Despite the heterogeneity of the included studies, the findings of most of the studies were similar in terms of increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection in PCOS patients. PCOS patients were reported to have a 51% higher risk of COVID-19 infection than non-PCOS women (HR =1.51). Many causes have been identified to play a role, most notably the overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and elevated levels of RAS-associated proteins, decreased serum levels of neuropilin-1 (sNRP1), elevated serum biomarkers such as platelet degranulation and coagulation cascade markers increased acute phase response, and lower levels of vitamin D could render PCOS patients susceptible to a chronic inflammatory state, which can also lead to difficulties and severe consequences, when impacted by COVID-19. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic also influenced psychological well-being, with an increase in the incidence and severity of depression and anxiety among PCOS patients in the COVID-19 pandemic era compared to healthy individuals. Conclusions Patients with PCOS are more likely to get infected with COVID-19 and display a higher affinity to severe infections and complications due to overlapping and confounding factors. These findings suggest that PCOS patients may need more medical attention when infected with COVID-19.

                <p>Phospholipids (PLs) are asymmetrically distributed at the plasma membrane. This asymmetric lipid distribution is transiently altered during calcium-regulated exocytosis, but the impact of this transient remodeling on presynaptic function is currently unknown. As phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) randomizes PL distribution between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane in response to calcium activation, we set out to determine its role in neurotransmission. We report here that PLSCR1 is expressed in cerebellar granule cells (GrCs) and that PLSCR1-dependent phosphatidylserine egress occurred at synapses in response to neuron stimulation. Synaptic transmission is impaired at GrC <I>Plscr1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> synapses, and both PS egress and synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis are inhibited in <I>Plscr1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> cultured neurons from male and female mice, demonstrating that PLSCR1 controls PL asymmetry remodeling and SV retrieval following neurotransmitter release. Altogether, our data reveal a novel key role for PLSCR1 in SV recycling and provide the first evidence that PL scrambling at the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for optimal presynaptic performance.</p>

                <p>Sex differences have complicated our understanding of the neurobiological basis of many behaviors that are key for survival. As such, continued elucidation of the similarities and differences between sexes is necessary to gain insight into brain function and vulnerability. The connection between the hippocampus (Hipp) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a crucial site where modulation of neuronal activity mediates reward-related behavior. Our previous work demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) of Hipp-&gt;NAc synapses is rewarding, and mice can establish learned associations between LTP of these synapses and the contextual environment in which LTP occurred. Here, we investigated sex differences in the mechanisms underlying Hipp-&gt;NAc LTP using whole-cell electrophysiology and pharmacology. We observed similarities in basal synaptic strength between males and females and found that LTP occurs postsynaptically with similar magnitudes in both sexes. However, key sex differences emerged as LTP in males required NMDA receptors (NMDAR), whereas LTP in females utilized an NMDAR-independent mechanism involving L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) and estrogen receptor &alpha; (ER&alpha;). We also uncovered sex-similar features as LTP in both sexes depended on CaMKII activity and occurred independently of dopamine-1 receptor (D1R) activation. Our results have elucidated sex-specific molecular mechanisms for LTP in an integral pathway that mediates reward-related behaviors, emphasizing the importance of considering sex as a variable in mechanistic studies. Continued characterization of sex-specific mechanisms underlying plasticity will offer novel insight into the neurophysiological basis of behavior, with significant implications for understanding how diverse processes mediate behavior and contribute to vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>The semantic knowledge stored in our brains can be accessed from different stimulus modalities. For example, a picture of a cat and the word "cat" both engage similar conceptual representations. While existing research has found evidence for modality-independent representations, their content remains unknown. Modality-independent representations could be semantic, or they might also contain perceptual features. We developed a novel approach combining word/picture cross-condition decoding with neural network classifiers that learned latent modality-independent representations from MEG data (25 human participants, 15 females, 10 males). We then compared these representations to models representing semantic, sensory, and orthographic features. Results show that modality-independent representations correlate both with semantic and visual representations. There was no evidence that these results were due to picture-specific visual features or orthographic features automatically activated by the stimuli presented in the experiment. These findings support the notion that modality-independent concepts contain both perceptual and semantic representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/27/e0790232024?rss=1">Regulation of the Mouse Ventral Tegmental Area by Melanin-Concentrating Hormone</a></h4>

              
                <p>Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) acts via its sole receptor MCHR1 in rodents and is an important regulator of homeostatic behaviors like feeding, sleep, and mood to impact overall energy balance. The loss of MCH signaling by MCH or MCHR1 deletion produces hyperactive mice with increased energy expenditure, and these effects are consistently associated with a hyperdopaminergic state. We recently showed that MCH suppresses dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, which principally receives dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the mechanisms underlying MCH-regulated dopamine release are not clearly defined. MCHR1 expression is widespread and includes dopaminergic VTA cells. However, as the VTA is a neurochemically diverse structure, we assessed <I>Mchr1</I> gene expression at glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic VTA cells and determined if MCH inhibited the activity of VTA cells and/or their local microcircuit. <I>Mchr1</I> expression was robust in major VTA cell types, including most dopaminergic (78%) or glutamatergic cells (52%) and some GABAergic cells (38%). Interestingly, MCH directly inhibited dopaminergic and GABAergic cells but did not regulate the activity of glutamatergic cells. Rather, MCH produced a delayed increase in excitatory input to dopamine cells and a corresponding decrease in GABAergic input to glutamatergic VTA cells. Our findings suggested that MCH may acutely suppress dopamine release while disinhibiting local glutamatergic signaling to restore dopamine levels. This indicated that the VTA is a target of MCH action, which may provide bidirectional regulation of energy balance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/27/e1175232024?rss=1">Complexity Matters: Normalization to Prototypical Viewpoint Induces Memory Distortion along the Vertical Axis of Scenes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scene memory is prone to systematic distortions potentially arising from experience with the external world. Boundary transformation, a well-known memory distortion effect along the near-far axis of the three-dimensional space, represents the observer's erroneous recall of scenes&rsquo; viewing distance. Researchers argued that normalization to the prototypical viewpoint with the high-probability viewing distance influenced this phenomenon. Herein, we hypothesized that the prototypical viewpoint also exists in the vertical angle of view (AOV) dimension and could cause memory distortion along scenes&rsquo; vertical axis. Human subjects of both sexes were recruited to test this hypothesis, and two behavioral experiments were conducted, revealing a systematic memory distortion in the vertical AOV in both the forced choice (<I>n</I> = 79) and free adjustment (<I>n</I> = 30) tasks. Furthermore, the regression analysis implied that the complexity information asymmetry in scenes&rsquo; vertical axis and the independent subjective AOV ratings from a large set of online participants (<I>n</I> = 1,208) could jointly predict AOV biases. Furthermore, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (<I>n</I> = 24), we demonstrated the involvement of areas in the ventral visual pathway (V3/V4, PPA, and OPA) in AOV bias judgment. Additionally, in a magnetoencephalography experiment (<I>n</I> = 20), we could significantly decode the subjects&rsquo; AOV bias judgments ~140&nbsp;ms after scene onset and the low-level visual complexity information around the similar temporal interval. These findings suggest that AOV bias is driven by the normalization process and associated with the neural activities in the early stage of scene processing.</p>

                <p>It was proposed that a reorganization of the relationships between cognitive functions occurs in dementia, a vision that surpasses the idea of a mere decline of specific domains. The complexity of cognitive structure, as assessed by neuropsychological tests, can be captured by exploratory graph analysis (EGA). EGA was applied to the neuropsychological assessment of people (humans) with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD; total <I>N</I> = 638). Both sexes were included. In AD, memory scores detach from the other cognitive functions, and memory subdomains reduce their reciprocal relation. SCD showed a pattern of segregated neuropsychological domains, and MCI showed a noisy and less stable pattern. Results suggest that AD drives a reorganization of cognitive functions toward a less-fractionated architecture compared with preclinical conditions. Cognitive functions show a reorganization that goes beyond the performance decline. Results also have clinical implications in test interpretations and usage.</p>

                <p>The canonical visual cycle employing RPE65 as the retinoid isomerase regenerates 11-<I>cis</I>-retinal to support both rod- and cone-mediated vision. Mutations of <I>RPE65</I> are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis that results in rod and cone photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss of affected patients at an early age. Dark-reared <I>Rpe65<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mouse has been known to form isorhodopsin that employs 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal as the photosensitive chromophore. The mechanism regulating 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal synthesis and the role of the endogenous 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal in cone survival and function remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that ablation of fatty acid transport protein-4 (FATP4), a negative regulator of 11-<I>cis</I>-retinol synthesis catalyzed by RPE65, increased the formation of 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal, but not 11-<I>cis</I>-retinal, in a light-independent mechanism in both sexes of RPE65-null <I>rd</I>12 mice. Both <I>rd</I>12 and <I>rd</I>12;<I>Fatp4<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup></I> mice contained a massive amount of all-<I>trans</I>-retinyl esters in the eyes, exhibiting comparable scotopic vision and rod degeneration. However, expression levels of M- and S-opsins as well as numbers of M- and S-cones surviving in the superior retinas of <I>rd</I>12;<I>Fatp4<sup>&ndash;/</sup></I><sup>&ndash;</sup> mice were at least twofold greater than those in age-matched <I>rd</I>12 mice. Moreover, FATP4 deficiency significantly shortened photopic <I>b</I>-wave implicit time, improved M-cone visual function, and substantially deaccelerated the progression of cone degeneration in <I>rd</I>12 mice, whereas FATP4 deficiency in mice with wild-type <I>Rpe65</I> alleles neither induced 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal formation nor influenced cone survival and function. These results identify FATP4 as a new regulator of synthesis of 9-<I>cis</I>-retinal, which is a "cone-tropic" chromophore supporting cone survival and function in the retinas with defective RPE65.</p>

                <p>The intricate relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and visual contrast detection variability has been the focus of numerous studies. However, the causal impact of prestimulus alpha traveling waves on visual contrast detection remains largely unexplored. In our research, we sought to discern the causal link between prestimulus alpha traveling waves and visual contrast detection across different levels of mental fatigue. Using electroencephalography alongside a visual detection task with 30 healthy adults (13 females; 17 males), we identified a robust negative correlation between prestimulus alpha forward traveling waves (FTWs) and visual contrast threshold (VCT). Inspired by this correlation, we utilized 45/&ndash;45&deg; phase-shifted transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in a sham-controlled, double-blind, within&ndash;subject experiment with 33 healthy adults (23 females; 10 males) to directly modulate these alpha traveling waves. After the application of 45&deg; phase-shifted tACS, we observed a substantial decrease in FTW and an increase in backward traveling waves, along with a concurrent increase in VCT, compared with the sham condition. These changes were particularly pronounced under a low fatigue state. The findings of state-dependent tACS effects reveal the potential causal role of prestimulus alpha traveling waves in visual contrast detection. Moreover, our study highlights the potential of 45/&ndash;45&deg; phase-shifted tACS in cognitive modulation and therapeutic applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/27/e2148232024?rss=1">Mutation of the ALS-/FTD-Associated RNA-Binding Protein FUS Affects Axonal Development</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aberrant condensation and localization of the RNA-binding protein (RBP) fused in sarcoma (FUS) occur in variants of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Changes in RBP function are commonly associated with changes in axonal cytoskeletal organization and branching in neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we asked whether branching defects also occur in vivo in a model of FUS-associated disease. We use two reported <I>Xenopus</I> models of ALS/FTD (of either sex), the ALS-associated mutant FUS(P525L) and a mimic of hypomethylated FUS, FUS(16R). Both mutants strongly reduced axonal complexity in vivo. We also observed an axon looping defect for FUS(P525L) in the target area, which presumably arises due to errors in stop cue signaling. To assess whether the loss of axon complexity also had a cue-independent component, we assessed axonal cytoskeletal integrity in vitro. Using a novel combination of fluorescence and atomic force microscopy, we found that mutant FUS reduced actin density in the growth cone, altering its mechanical properties. Therefore, FUS mutants may induce defects during early axonal development.</p>

                <p>While ipsilesional cortical electroencephalography has been associated with poststroke recovery mechanisms and outcomes, the role of the cerebellum and its interaction with the ipsilesional cortex is still largely unknown. We have previously shown that poststroke motor control relies on increased corticocerebellar coherence (CCC) in the low beta band to maintain motor task accuracy and to compensate for decreased excitability of the ipsilesional cortex. We now extend our work to investigate corticocerebellar network changes associated with chronic stimulation of the dentato-thalamo-cortical pathway aimed at promoting poststroke motor rehabilitation. We investigated the excitability of the ipsilesional cortex, the dentate (DN), and their interaction as a function of treatment outcome measures. Relative to baseline, 10 human participants (two women) at the end of 4&ndash;8&nbsp;months of DN deep brain stimulation (DBS) showed (1) significantly improved motor control indexed by computerized motor tasks; (2) significant increase in ipsilesional premotor cortex event-related desynchronization that correlated with improvements in motor function; and (3) significant decrease in CCC, including causal interactions between the DN and ipsilesional cortex, which also correlated with motor function improvements. Furthermore, we show that the functional state of the DN in the poststroke state and its connectivity with the ipsilesional cortex were predictive of motor outcomes associated with DN-DBS. The findings suggest that as participants recovered, the ipsilesional cortex became more involved in motor control, with less demand on the cerebellum to support task planning and execution. Our data provide unique mechanistic insights into the functional state of corticocerebellar-cortical network after stroke and its modulation by DN-DBS.</p>

                <p>Neurons are highly polarized cells that are composed of a single axon and multiple dendrites. Axon&ndash;dendrite polarity is essential for proper tissue formation and brain functions. Intracellular protein transport plays an important role in the establishment of neuronal polarity. However, the regulatory mechanism of polarized transport remains unclear. Here, we show that Rab6, a small GTPase that acts on the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking, plays key roles in neuronal polarization and brain development. Central nervous system-specific Rab6a/b double knock-out (Rab6 DKO) mice of both sexes exhibit severe dysplasia of the neocortex and the cerebellum. In the Rab6 DKO neocortex, impaired axonal extension of neurons results in hypoplasia of the intermediate zone. In vitro, deletion of Rab6a and Rab6b in cultured neurons from both sexes causes the abnormal accumulation of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) adjacent to the Golgi apparatus, which leads to defects in axonal extension and the loss of axon&ndash;dendrite polarity. Moreover, Rab6 DKO causes significant expansion of lysosomes in the soma in neurons. Overall, our results reveal that Rab6-mediated polarized transport of SVPs is crucial for neuronal polarization and subsequent brain formation.</p>

                <p>We previously showed that orexin neurons are activated by hypoxia and facilitate the peripheral chemoreflex (PCR)-mediated hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), mostly by promoting the respiratory frequency response. Orexin neurons project to the nucleus of the solitary tract (nTS) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). The PVN contributes significantly to the PCR and contains nTS-projecting corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons. We hypothesized that in male rats, orexin neurons contribute to the PCR by activating nTS-projecting CRH neurons. We used neuronal tract tracing and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to quantify the degree that hypoxia activates PVN-projecting orexin neurons. We coupled this with orexin receptor (OxR) blockade with suvorexant (Suvo, 20&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) to assess the degree that orexin facilitates the hypoxia-induced activation of CRH neurons in the PVN, including those projecting to the nTS. In separate groups of rats, we measured the PCR following systemic orexin 1 receptor (Ox1R) blockade (SB-334867; 1&nbsp;mg/kg) and specific Ox1R knockdown in PVN. OxR blockade with Suvo reduced the number of nTS and PVN neurons activated by hypoxia, including those CRH neurons projecting to nTS. Hypoxia increased the number of activated PVN-projecting orexin neurons but had no effect on the number of activated nTS-projecting orexin neurons. Global Ox1R blockade and partial Ox1R knockdown in the PVN significantly reduced the PCR. Ox1R knockdown also reduced the number of activated PVN neurons and the number of activated tyrosine hydroxylase neurons in the nTS. Our findings suggest orexin facilitates the PCR via nTS-projecting CRH neurons expressing Ox1R.</p>

                <p>The magnitude of dopamine signals elicited by rewarding events and their predictors is updated when reward value changes. It is actively debated how readily these dopamine signals adapt and whether adaptation aligns with model-free or model-based reinforcement&ndash;learning principles. To investigate this, we trained male rats in a pavlovian-conditioning paradigm and measured dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core in response to food reward (unconditioned stimulus) and reward-predictive conditioned stimuli (CS), both before and after reward devaluation, induced via either sensory-specific or nonspecific satiety. We demonstrate that (1) such devaluation reduces CS-induced dopamine release rapidly, without additional pairing of CS with devalued reward and irrespective of whether the devaluation was sensory-specific or nonspecific. In contrast, (2) reward devaluation did not decrease food reward-induced dopamine release. Surprisingly, (3) postdevaluation reconditioning, by additional pairing of CS with devalued reward, rapidly reinstated CS-induced dopamine signals to predevaluation levels. Taken together, we identify distinct, divergent adaptations in dopamine-signal magnitude when reward value is decreased: CS dopamine diminishes but reinstates fast, whereas reward dopamine is resistant to change. This implies that, respective to abovementioned findings, (1) CS dopamine may be governed by a model-based mechanism and (2) reward dopamine by a model-free one, where (3) the latter may contribute to swift reinstatement of the former. However, changes in CS dopamine were not selective for sensory specificity of reward devaluation, which is inconsistent with model-based processes. Thus, mesolimbic dopamine signaling incorporates both model-free and model-based mechanisms and is not exclusively governed by either.</p>

                <p>Synapsins are highly abundant presynaptic proteins that play a crucial role in neurotransmission and plasticity via the clustering of synaptic vesicles. The synapsin III isoform is usually downregulated after development, but in hippocampal mossy fiber boutons, it persists in adulthood. Mossy fiber boutons express presynaptic forms of short- and long-term plasticity, which are thought to underlie different forms of learning. Previous research on synapsins at this synapse focused on synapsin isoforms I and II. Thus, a complete picture regarding the role of synapsins in mossy fiber plasticity is still missing. Here, we investigated presynaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber boutons by combining electrophysiological field recordings and transmission electron microscopy in a mouse model lacking all synapsin isoforms. We found decreased short-term plasticity, i.e., decreased facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation, but increased long-term potentiation in male synapsin triple knock-out (KO) mice. At the ultrastructural level, we observed more dispersed vesicles and a higher density of active zones in mossy fiber boutons from KO animals. Our results indicate that all synapsin isoforms are required for fine regulation of short- and long-term presynaptic plasticity at the mossy fiber synapse.</p>

     alt="Emergence of the ZNF675 Gene During Primate Evolution–Influenced Human Neurodevelopment Through Changing HES1 Autoregulation"/>
<p>During primate evolution, structural changes in ZNF675 drove its ability to repress a primate-specific class of transposable elements (TEs) as part of the evolutionary arms race between ZNF genes and TEs. As an evolutionary by-stander effect, ZNF675 also became important for the expression of key neurodevelopmental genes, thereby changing the human neurodevelopmental gene regulatory program.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In this study, we investigated recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) in the 19p12 locus, which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. The two genes in this locus, <i>ZNF675</i> and <i>ZNF681</i>, arose via gene duplication in primates, and their presence in several pathological CNVs in the human population suggests that either or both of these genes are required for normal human brain development. ZNF675 and ZNF681 are members of the Krüppel-associated box zinc finger (KZNF) protein family, a class of transcriptional repressors important for epigenetic silencing of specific genomic regions. About 170 primate-specific KZNFs are present in the human genome. Although KZNFs are primarily associated with repressing retrotransposon-derived DNA, evidence is emerging that they can be co-opted for other gene regulatory processes. We show that genetic deletion of <i>ZNF675</i> causes developmental defects in cortical organoids, and our data suggest that part of the observed neurodevelopmental phenotype is mediated by a gene regulatory role of ZNF675 on the promoter of the neurodevelopmental gene Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1 (<i>HES1</i>). We also find evidence for the recently evolved regulation of genes involved in neurological disorders, microcephalin 1 and sestrin 3. We show that ZNF675 interferes with HES1 auto-inhibition, a process essential for the maintenance of neural progenitors. As a striking example of how some KZNFs have integrated into preexisting gene expression networks, these findings suggest the emergence of <i>ZNF675</i> has caused a change in the balance of <i>HES1</i> autoregulation. The association of <i>ZNF675</i> CNV with human developmental disorders and ZNF675-mediated regulation of neurodevelopmental genes suggests that it evolved into an important factor for human brain development.</p>

                Background The open field assay is used to study anxiety-related traits and anxiolytic drugs in rodents. This assay entails measuring locomotor activity and time spent in the center of a chamber that is maintained at ambient room temperature. However, the ambient temperature in most laboratories varies daily and seasonally and can differ between buildings. We sought to evaluate how varying ambient temperature and core body temperature (CBT) affected open field locomotor activity and center time of male wild-type (WT, C57BL/6) and Transient Receptor Potential Subfamily M Member 8 (Trpm8) knock-out (Trpm8-/- ) mice. TRPM8 is an ion channel that detects cool temperatures and is activated by icilin. Methods Mice were placed in the open field at 4°C and 23°C for 1 hour. Distance traveled and time spent in the center were measured. Mice were injected with icilin, M8-B, diazepam, or saline, and changes in activity level were recorded. Results The cooling agent icilin increased CBT and profoundly reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to controls. Likewise, cooling the ambient temperature to 4°C reduced distance traveled and center time of WT mice relative to Trpm8-/- mice. Conversely, the TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) reduced CBT and increased distance traveled and center time of WT mice when tested at 4°C. The TRPM8 antagonist (M8-B) had no effect on CBT or open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. The anxiolytic diazepam reduced CBT in WT and Trpm8-/- mice. When tested at 4°C, diazepam increased distance traveled and center time in WT mice but did not alter open field behavior of Trpm8-/- mice. Conclusions Environmental temperature and drugs that affect CBT can influence locomotor behavior and center time in the open field assay, highlighting temperature (ambient and core) as sources of environmental and physiologic variability in this commonly used behavioral assay.

                Background Climate change denial (CCD) has been found to be more pronounced among individuals with a conservative political orientation. Terror Management Theory posits that an individual’s worldview serves as a primary defense mechanism in coping with existential threats, such as the reality of climate change. Drawing on these premises, we conducted preliminary research investigating the impact of death priming on CCD from the Terror management theory perspective. Methods and results We administered a death priming task and measured CCD in its immediate wake or following a delay task. We confirmed among 219 Amazon’s MTurk participants that immediately following death priming, CCD was reduced among all participants. In the delayed death priming condition, we acquired preliminary evidence that CCD was heightened among Republican participants. Conclusions These findings demonstrate the relevance of death priming to CCD tendencies and potentially spawn future research regarding CCD as a particular form of coping with existential threats.

Neuromechanical studies investigate how the nervous system interacts with the musculoskeletal (MSK) system to generate volitional movements. Such studies have been supported by simulation models that provide insights into variables that cannot be measured experimentally and allow a large number of conditions to be tested before the experimental analysis. However, current simulation models of electromyography (EMG), a core physiological signal in neuromechanical analyses, remain either limited in accuracy and conditions or are computationally heavy to apply. Here, we provide a computational platform to enable future work to overcome these limitations by presenting NeuroMotion, an open-source simulator that can modularly test a variety of approaches to the full-spectrum synthesis of EMG signals during voluntary movements. We demonstrate NeuroMotion using three sample modules. The first module is an upper-limb MSK model with OpenSim API to estimate the muscle fibre lengths and muscle activations during movements. The second module is BioMime, a deep neural network-based EMG generator that receives nonstationary physiological parameter inputs, like the afore-estimated muscle fibre lengths, and efficiently outputs motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). The third module is a motor unit pool model that transforms the muscle activations into discharge timings of motor units. The discharge timings are convolved with the output of BioMime to simulate EMG signals during the movement. We first show how MUAP waveforms change during different levels of physiological parameter variations and different movements. We then show that the synthetic EMG signals during two-degree-of-freedom hand and wrist movements can be used to augment experimental data for regressing joint angles. Ridge regressors trained on the synthetic dataset were directly used to predict joint angles from experimental data. In this way, NeuroMotion was able to generate full-spectrum EMG for the first use-case of human forearm electrophysiology during voluntary hand, wrist, and forearm movements. All intermediate variables are available, which allows the user to study cause-effect relationships in the complex neuromechanical system, fast iterate algorithms before collecting experimental data, and validate algorithms that estimate non-measurable parameters in experiments. We expect this modular platform will enable validation of generative EMG models, complement experimental approaches and empower neuromechanical research.

                <p>by Bin Liu, Bodo Rosenhahn, Thomas Illig, David S. DeLuca</p>

Interpreting transcriptome data is an important yet challenging aspect of bioinformatic analysis. While gene set enrichment analysis is a standard tool for interpreting regulatory changes, we utilize deep learning techniques, specifically autoencoder architectures, to learn latent variables that drive transcriptome signals. We investigate whether simple, variational autoencoder (VAE), and beta-weighted VAE are capable of learning reduced representations of transcriptomes that retain critical biological information. We propose a novel VAE that utilizes priors from biological data to direct the network to learn a representation of the transcriptome that is based on understandable biological concepts. After benchmarking five different autoencoder architectures, we found that each succeeded in reducing the transcriptomes to 50 latent dimensions, which captured enough variation for accurate reconstruction. The simple, fully connected autoencoder, performs best across the benchmarks, but lacks the characteristic of having directly interpretable latent dimensions. The beta-weighted, prior-informed VAE implementation is able to solve the benchmarking tasks, and provide semantically accurate latent features equating to biological pathways. This study opens a new direction for differential pathway analysis in transcriptomics with increased transparency and interpretability.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002703">Limb-related sensory prediction errors and task-related performance errors facilitate human sensorimotor learning through separate mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anushka Oza, Adarsh Kumar, Apoorva Sharma, Pratik K. Mutha</p>

The unpredictable nature of our world can introduce a variety of errors in our actions, including sensory prediction errors (SPEs) and task performance errors (TPEs). SPEs arise when our existing internal models of limb-environment properties and interactions become miscalibrated due to changes in the environment, while TPEs occur when environmental perturbations hinder achievement of task goals. The precise mechanisms employed by the sensorimotor system to learn from such limb- and task-related errors and improve future performance are not comprehensively understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we performed a series of learning experiments wherein the location and size of a reach target were varied, the visual feedback of the motion was perturbed in different ways, and instructions were carefully manipulated. Our findings indicate that the mechanisms employed to compensate SPEs and TPEs are dissociable. Specifically, our results fail to support theories that suggest that TPEs trigger implicit refinement of reach plans or that their occurrence automatically modulates SPE-mediated learning. Rather, TPEs drive improved action selection, that is, the selection of verbally sensitive, volitional strategies that reduce future errors. Moreover, we find that exposure to SPEs is necessary and sufficient to trigger implicit recalibration. When SPE-mediated implicit learning and TPE-driven improved action selection combine, performance gains are larger. However, when actions are always successful and strategies are not employed, refinement in behavior is smaller. Flexibly weighting strategic action selection and implicit recalibration could thus be a way of controlling how much, and how quickly, we learn from errors.

                <p>by Alexandre Legrand, Clara Dahoui, Clément De La Myre Mory, Kodie Noy, Laura Guiguettaz, Margaux Versapuech, Clara Loyer, Margaux Pillon, Mégane Wcislo, Laurent Guéguen, Clarisse Berlioz-Torrent, Andrea Cimarelli, Mathieu Mateo, Francesca Fiorini, Emiliano P. Ricci, Lucie Etienne</p>

Sterile alpha motif domain-containing proteins 9 and 9-like (SAMD9/9L) are associated with life-threatening genetic diseases in humans and are restriction factors of poxviruses. Yet, their cellular function and the extent of their antiviral role are poorly known. Here, we found that interferon-stimulated human SAMD9L restricts HIV-1 in the late phases of replication, at the posttranscriptional and prematuration steps, impacting viral translation and, possibly, endosomal trafficking. Surprisingly, the paralog SAMD9 exerted an opposite effect, enhancing HIV-1. More broadly, we showed that SAMD9L restricts primate lentiviruses, but not a gammaretrovirus (MLV), nor 2 RNA viruses (arenavirus MOPV and rhabdovirus VSV). Using structural modeling and mutagenesis of SAMD9L, we identified a conserved Schlafen-like active site necessary for HIV-1 restriction by human and a rodent SAMD9L. By testing a gain-of-function constitutively active variant from patients with SAMD9L-associated autoinflammatory disease, we determined that SAMD9L pathogenic functions also depend on the Schlafen-like active site. Finally, we found that the constitutively active SAMD9L strongly inhibited HIV, MLV, and, to a lesser extent, MOPV. This suggests that the virus-specific effect of SAMD9L may involve its differential activation/sensing and the virus ability to evade from SAMD9L restriction. Overall, our study identifies SAMD9L as an HIV-1 antiviral factor from the cell autonomous immunity and deciphers host determinants underlying the translational repression. This provides novel links and therapeutic avenues against viral infections and genetic diseases.

                Background: The aim of the current study was to assess the patients with COVID-19 and the impact of vitamin D supplementation on the course of COVID-19. Methods: This prospective cohort study included patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 between December 2020 and December 2021. Patients' demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were analysed. Results: 301 participants were enrolled in the study. 46 (15,3%) had moderate, and 162 (53,8%) had severe COVID-19. 14 (4,7%) patients died, and 30 (10,0%) were admitted to the ICU due to disease worsening. The majority needed oxygen therapy (n=224; 74,4%). Average vitamin 25(OH)D3 levels were below optimal at the admittance, and vitamin D deficiency was detected in 205 individuals. More male patients were suffering from vitamin D deficiency. Patients with the more severe disease showed lower levels of vitamin 25(OH)D3 in their blood. The most severe group of patients had more symptoms that lasted significantly longer with progressing disease severity. This group of patients also suffered from more deaths, ICU admissions, and treatments with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and oxygen. Conclusion: Patients with the severe course of COVID-19 were shown to have increased inflammatory parameters, increased mortality, and higher incidence of vitamin D deficiency. The results suggest that the vitamin D deficiency might represent a significant risk factor for a severe course of COVID-19.

                Background: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a pathogenic bacterium that affects shrimp aquaculture; its infection can lead to severe production losses of up to 90%. On the other hand, plant phenolic compounds have emerged as a promising alternative to combat bacterial infections. The antibacterial and anti-virulence activity of the plant phenolic compounds quercetin, morin, vanillic acid, and protocatechuic acid against two strains of V. parahaemolyticus (Vp124 and Vp320) was evaluated. Methods: The broth microdilution test was carried out to determine phenolic compounds' antibacterial activity. Moreover, the biofilm-forming ability of V. parahaemolyticus strains in the presence of phenolic compounds was determined by total biomass staining assay using the cationic dye crystal violet. The semisolid agar displacement technique was used to observe the effect of phenolic compounds on the swimming-like motility of V. parahaemolyticus. Results: Results showed that phenolic compounds inhibited both strains effectively, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.8 to 35.03 mM. Furthermore, at 0.125 – 0.5 × MIC of phenolic compounds, V. parahaemolyticus biofilms biomass was reduced by 63.22 – 92.68%. Also, quercetin and morin inhibited the motility of both strains by 15.86 – 23.64% (Vp124) and 24.28 – 40.71% (Vp320). Conclusions: The results suggest that quercetin, morin, vanillic, and protocatechuic acids may be potential agents for controlling V. parahaemolyticus.

                Understanding the nature of life and its propensity for reproduction has long been a question that humans aspire to answer. Reproduction, a defining characteristic of life, fundamentally involves the replication of genetic material, be it DNA or RNA. The driving force behind this replication process has always intrigued scientists. In recent years, theories involving selfish genes, the RNA world, and entropic forces have been proposed by some scholars. These theories seem to suggest that life, as we know it, exists solely in Earth’s environment and is based on a single type of genetic material, either DNA or RNA. However, if we broaden our definition of life to include any replicable molecules, we might be able to transcend traditional thought. This could potentially enhance our understanding of the impetus behind DNA replication and provide deeper insights into the essence of life.

                Background: Several studies have resulted in controversial data about the recurrence or new incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C who were treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).   Aim: This observational study aimed to assess the occurrence rate of HCC in patients who developed a sustained virological response (SVR). METHOD:  A six-month prospective study was done at the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute [NHTMRI] in Cairo, Egypt on 150 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin. Patients were assigned into two groups according to their laboratory values to either receive sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (S/D/R) or receive only sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (S/D). The main outcome measure was the occurrence of HCC. Results: SVR-12 was 100%. 8.5% of patients developed HCC in the S/D/R group, while 0% in the S/D group. Conclusion:  New incidence or recurrence of HCC may occur in CHC genotype 4 cirrhotic patients receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (difficult to treat) although achieving SVR. The cause of HCC development in this study is cirrhosis, not the administered DAAs.

                Background Thoracic trauma is defined as a trauma that hits the chest wall directly or indirectly, either as a result of blunt or penetrating trauma. Thoracic trauma can occur in any age or genders, and become a life-threatening if the treatment isn’t immediate and appropriate. Methods This research was an observational study with a cohort retrospective design using secondary data in the form of thoracic trauma patients at The Zainoel Abidin General Hospital, Banda Aceh, Indonesia in the period January 2019-December 2020. The statistical analysis used were chi square for bivariate and multivariate analysis, spesifically logistic regression analysis was conducted to know which risk factor influences the most. Result There were 141 medical records used in this study, thoracic trauma was more common in men compared to women. The age group of 46-55 is the age group with the highest percentage of thoracic trauma patients, road traffic are the leading cause of thoracic trauma where the most common diagnosis is rib fractures. Significant factors that associated with the short outcome of thoracic trauma are thoracic trauma diagnosis (p=0,00), management of thoracic trauma (p=0,00), ventilator (p=0,04), duration of ventilator (p=0.01), sepsis (p=0,00), qSOFA score (p=0,00) and injury severity score (p=0,00). Conclusions Vehicle accidents contributed to a considerable number of traumatic chest injuries in this study. Diagnosis, management of trauma, days of ventilation, qSOFA score, injury severity score, and development of sepsis were associated with the short-term outcome among thoracic trauma patients. Injury severity score seems to be the most influential variable in this study, the lower the better it is. Road safety intervention is urgently needed to control the underlying problems in this study.

                Background As Thailand’s population ages, promoting senior citizens’ quality of life (QoL) is crucial. In 2017, the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security launched the “elderly school” initiative to foster lifelong learning and enhance the QoL among senior citizens. However, comprehensive evaluations of its impact on QoL remain limited. Methods This cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the policy’s effect on QoL in Phetchabun province, Thailand. Using quota and systematic sampling, 1,374 senior citizens aged 60-80 participated. Propensity score matching (PSM) with a 1:1 match was employed to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of attending the elderly school on QoL. Additionally, multiple linear regression was analyzed to assess the association between QoL and its associated factors. Results PSM were matched successfully, the standardized difference was less than 10 percent, and the baseline after matching indicated balances with 687 elderly people in each group. The mean QoL score of the non-attending group was 44.40 (SD = 7.11), and that of the attending group was 57.50 (SD = 7.53). The ATE for elderly people attending school was 10.67 scores (95% CI: 9.67 – 11.67 scores) higher than those unattended. Being female, having monthly income higher than 20,000, having employment, having a caregiver, and attendance at elderly school were positively associated with QoL, and the standardized beta coefficients were 0.078, 0.059, 0.094, 0.066, and 0.550, respectively. Additionally, higher education was positively associated with higher QoL. Conclusion The elderly school policy significantly enhanced the QoL of the attending senior citizens. Findings suggest continued collaboration among stakeholders to sustain and optimize this policy for improved seniors’ QoL, which has the potential to utilize lifelong learning to create an inclusive framework for healthy aging among senior citizens.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-537/v2?src=rss">The legal and institutional framework for the protection of religious rights in Nigeria and the right to wear Hijab in public institutions. [version 2; peer review: 4 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Religion and its exercise are among the most sensitive discourses in different parts of the world, especially in Nigeria. The constitution and other laws ensure citizens are afforded basic human rights of which religious rights are included and yet regulated. There are questions of interpretation as to the extent to which such rights can be enjoyed and the efficacy of both the legal and institutional frameworks protecting religious rights in Nigeria. Methods This article utilises a doctrinal legal research approach utilising existing literature, statutes, and laws enacted towards the protection of religious rights in Nigeria with the consideration of primary and secondary sources of statutes including the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), judicial precedents, International Conventions, law textbooks, and peer-reviewed journals. A comparative analysis of Nigeria, Tunisia, Algeria, Turkey and Kazakhstan was done to gain perspectives on balancing conflicting interests in light of Nigeria’s heterogeneous status. As part of the contribution to knowledge, a hybrid model for mitigating the socio-legal effect of the usage of hijab in Nigeria’s public institutions is presented to further enrich Nigeria’s jurisprudence. A hybrid model is an approach that combines different sources or methodologies by integrating two or more distinct frameworks to leverage their strengths and effectively address specific needs or challenges. It is utilized to achieve synergy and maximize outcomes by blending diverse legal approaches in law. Results Nigeria, being a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state, demonstrates that the government must protect the public interests as it relates to religious rights regardless of faith or religion. The study reveals that the current legal approach without further legislative intervention on religious issues will be inadequate to address the problem. Therefore, this study presents a hybrid model for mitigating the socio-legal effect of the usage of hijab in Nigeria’s public institutions to avoid harm and further enrich Nigeria’s jurisprudence. Conclusions This study concludes by emphasizing the inadequacy of Nigeria’s legal and institutional frameworks regarding the protection of religious rights and the right to wear hijab in public institutions. Consequently, reform is deemed necessary.
