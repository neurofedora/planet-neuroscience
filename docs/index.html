<p class="a-plus-plus">It has come to our notice that there was an inadvertent misupload of Fig. 2 (c, d) in the loading control (GAPDH) for ASIC1a and NLRP1 blots. We would like to replace the same with the correct image. This change anyhow does not affect the conclusion of the study. However, the use of GAPDH as a loading control for stroke studies sometimes is debatable (Zhai et al. 2014; Kang et al. 2018). Hence, we repeated our experiments to check the expression of ASIC1a and NLRP1 at different time points following stroke, using beta actin as a loading control. We found that at 24 h post stroke, maximal and significant expression of both ASIC1a and NLRP1 was observed (Fig. 2 e, f). The expression at 48 and 72 h post stroke were not significantly different as compared to that of sham. The expression results obtained using beta actin as a loading control were concurrent with the previous results published with GAPDH as a loading control.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">G9a is essential for dendritic plasticity and is associated with neurological disorders. The possible relationship between age-related hearing loss and G9a expression in the auditory cortex has not been fully explored. This study aimed to understand the expression patterns of G9a-mediated histone methylations in the auditory cortex during aging. Using immunofluorescence and western blotting, we demonstrated that a significant reduction in G9a expression observed in the auditory cortex of 24-month-old rats compared to 3-month-old rats, was associated with remarkable hearing threshold elevation and hair cell loss. Correspondingly, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) mono- and dimethylation (marked by H3K9me1 and H3K9me2, respectively), which were regulated by G9a activity, also evidently decreased during aging. These findings, which merit further investigation, suggest a possible association between G9a-mediated histone methylations and central age-related hearing disorders.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Genetic factors play a major role in the etiopathogenesis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the <em class="a-plus-plus">CDH13</em> (rs6565113, rs11150556) and <em class="a-plus-plus">LPHN3</em> (rs6551665, rs6858066, rs1947274, rs2345039) gene polymorphisms and ADHD. We also sought to examine possible relationships between these polymorphisms and the clinical course and treatment response in ADHD. A total of 120 patients (79% boys), aged 6 to 18 years, newly diagnosed (medication-naïve) with ADHD according to the DSM-5 and a group of 126 controls (74% girls) were enrolled in the study. We examined the association between the aforementioned polymorphisms and ADHD. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate factors influencing the treatment response of ADHD. A significant difference was found between ADHD and control groups in terms of genotype distribution of the <em class="a-plus-plus">LPHN3</em> rs6551665 and rs1947274 polymorphisms. The results also showed that having the GG genotype of rs6551665 and CC genotype of rs1947274 of the <em class="a-plus-plus">LPHN3</em> gene was associated with risk for ADHD, and this relationship was more prominent in male participants. In the multivariate logistic regression model established with variables shown to have a significant relationship with treatment response, the presence of the GG genotype of the <em class="a-plus-plus">LPHN3</em> rs6551665 polymorphism and high severity of ADHD assessed by CGI-S were associated with poor response to treatment. This study is the first study to investigate the relationship between ADHD and these polymorphisms among Turkish adolescents. Our results imply that the <em class="a-plus-plus">LPHN3</em> rs6551665 and rs1947274 polymorphisms have a significant effect on ADHD in a Turkish population, and support previous observations that the presence of the GG genotype of the <em class="a-plus-plus">LPHN3</em> rs6551665 polymorphism may be associated with poor response to treatment in ADHD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The pharmacological inhibition of glial activation is one of the new approaches for combating neuropathic pain in which the role of glia in the modulation of neuropathic pain has attracted significant interest and attention. Neuron-glial crosstalk is achieved with <em class="a-plus-plus">N</em>-methyl-D-aspartate-2B receptor (NMDAR-2B) activation. This study aims to determine the effect of ifenprodil, a potent noncompetitive NMDAR-2B antagonist, on activated microglia, brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) protein expression in the spinal cord of streptozotocin-induced painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) rats following formalin injection. In this experimentation, 48 Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly selected and divided into four groups: (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 12): control, PDN, and ifenprodil-treated PDN rats at 0.5 μg or 1.0 μg for 7 days. Type I diabetes mellitus was then induced by injecting streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, i.p.) into the rats which were then over a 2-week period allowed to progress into the early phase of PDN. Ifenprodil was administered in PDN rats while saline was administered intrathecally in the control group. A formalin test was conducted during the fourth week to induce inflammatory nerve injury, in which the rats were sacrificed at 72 h post-formalin injection. The lumbar enlargement region (L4–L5) of the spinal cord was dissected for immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. The results demonstrated a significant increase in formalin-induced flinching and licking behavior with an increased spinal expression of activated microglia, BDNF and DREAM proteins. It was also shown that the ifenprodil-treated rats following both doses reduced the extent of their flinching and duration of licking in PDN in a dose-dependent manner. As such, ifenprodil successfully demonstrated inhibition against microglia activation and suppressed the expression of BDNF and DREAM proteins in the spinal cord of PDN rats. In conclusion, ifenprodil may alleviate PDN by suppressing spinal microglia activation, BDNF and DREAM proteins.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a crucial role in multiple disorders, while the role of it in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is still unclear. Here, the increased lncRNA NEAT1 was discovered in MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-induced SH-SY5Y cells. Then, we proved that NEAT1 decreasing suppressed MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-induced neuronal apoptosis, upregulation of α-syn and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Rescue experiments shown that the inhibition of NEAT1 decreasing to MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent neuronal apoptosis can be reversed by overexpressed α-syn. Subsequently, we indicated the interaction between NEAT1 and miR-1301-3p, as well as between NEAT1 and miR-5047. Interesting, we found that NEAT1 decreasing repressed the expression of GJB1, a downstream target of miR-1301-3p and miR-5047, through promoting miR-1301-3p rather than miR-5047 expression. Finally, we transfected miR-1301-3p inhibitor to MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-induced SH-SY5Y cells following si-NEAT1, and found that downregulation of NEAT1 repressed α-syn-mediated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through regulating miR-1301-3p/GJB1 signaling pathway. Overall, our data demonstrated that NEAT1 decreasing effectively suppressed MPP<sup class="a-plus-plus">+</sup>-induced neuronal apoptosis. Mechanismly, downregulation of NEAT1 repressed α-syn-induced activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via inhibiting the expression of GJB1 by targeting miR-1301-3p. Our study supported a new and reliable evidence for lncRNA NEAT1 as a potential target for PD treatment.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder involving multiple genes that occurs in early childhood, and a number of risk genes have been reported in previous studies. However, the molecular mechanism of the polygenic regulation leading to pathological changes in ASD remains unclear. First, we identified 8 dysregulated gene coexpression modules by analyzing blood transcriptome data from 96 children with ASD and 42 controls. These modules are rich in ASD risk genes and function related to metabolism, immunity, neurodevelopment, and signaling. The regulatory factors of each module including microRNA (miRNA) and transcription factors (TFs) were subsequently predicted based on transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. We identified a set of miRNAs that regulate metabolic and immune modules, as well as transcription factors that cause dysregulation of the modules, and we constructed a coregulatory network between the regulatory factors and modules. Our work reveals dysfunctional modules in children with ASD, elucidates the role of miRNA and transcription factor dysregulation in the pathophysiology of ASD, and helps us to further understand the underlying molecular mechanism of ASD.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Musculoskeletal pain is a widespread complex regional pain syndrome associated with altered emotional and cognitive functioning along with heightened physical disability that has become a global health concern. Effective management of this disorder and associated disabilities includes accurate diagnosis of its biomarkers and instituting mechanism–based therapeutic interventions. Herein, we explored the role of heraclin, a plant-derived molecule, in musculoskeletal pain and its underlying mechanistic approaches in an experimental mouse model. Reserpine (0.5 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days evoked hyperalgesia, motor incoordination, lack of exploratory behavior, anxiety, and cognition lapse in mice. Reserpine-challenged mice displayed higher serum cytokine level, altered brain neurotransmitter content, elevated brain and muscle oxidative stress, and upregulated brain nerve growth factor receptor expression. Treatment with heraclin (10 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days) exerted analgesic effect and improved motor coordination and memory deficits in mice. Heraclin arrested serum cytokine rise, normalized brain neurotransmitter content, reduced tissue oxidative stress, and downregulated the nerve growth factor receptor expression. Therefore, it may be suggested that heraclin exerts beneficial effects against reserpine-induced musculoskeletal pain disorder possibly through the attenuation of NGFR-mediated pain and inflammatory signaling.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">To report the phenomenology of movement disorder (MD) in neurological Wilson disease (NWD), and correlate these with MRI, and biomarkers of oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Eighty-two patients were included, and their phenomenology of MD was categorized. The severity of dystonia was assessed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden score, and chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, and tremor on a 0–4 scale. The MRI changes were noted. Serum glutamate, cytokines, and oxidative stress markers were measured. Movement disorders were noted in 78/82 (95.1%) patients and included dystonia in 69 (84.1%), chorea in 31 (37.8%), tremor in 24 (29.3%), parkinsonism in 19 (23.2%), athetosis in 13 (15.9%), and myoclonus in 9 (11.0%) patients. Dystonia was more frequently observed in the patients with thalamic (76.8 vs 23.2%), globus pallidus (72.0 vs 28.0%), putamen (69.5 vs 30.5%), caudate (68.3 vs 31.7%) and brainstem (61.0 vs 39.0%) involvement, and tremor with cerebellar involvement (37.5 vs 5.2%). The median age of onset of neurological symptoms was 12 (5–50) years. WD patients had higher levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutamate, and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNFα) and lower levels of glutathione and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared with the controls. Serum glutamate, IL-6, IL-8, and plasma MDA levels were increased with increasing neurological severity, while glutathione and TAC levels decreased. The severity of dystonia related to the number of MRI lesions. MD is the commonest neurological symptoms in WD. Oxidative stress, glutamate, and cytokine levels are increased in WD and correlate with neurological severity.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Isolated dystonia is a common movement disorder often caused by genetic mutations, although it is predominantly sporadic in nature. Common variants of dystonia-related genes were reported to be risk factors for idiopathic isolated dystonia. In this study, we aimed to analyse the roles of previously reported GTP cyclohydrolase (<em class="a-plus-plus">GCH1</em>) and Torsin family 1 member A (<em class="a-plus-plus">TOR1A</em>) polymorphisms in an Indian isolated dystonia case-control group. A total of 292 sporadic isolated dystonia patients and 316 control individuals were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of <em class="a-plus-plus">GCH1</em> (rs3759664:G &gt; A, rs12147422:A &gt; G and rs10483639:C &gt; G) and <em class="a-plus-plus">TOR1A</em> (rs13300897:G &gt; A, rs1801968:G &gt; C, rs1182:G &gt; T and rs3842225:G &gt; Δ) using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. The statistical significance of allelic, genotypic and haplotypic associations of all of the SNPs were evaluated using the two-tailed Fisher exact test. The minor allele (A) of rs3759664 is significantly associated with isolated limb dystonia as a risk factor (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.005). The minor allele (C) of rs1801968 is strongly associated with isolated dystonia (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.0001) and most of its subtypes. The major allele of rs3842225 (G) may act as a significant risk factor for Writer’s cramp (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03). Four different haplogroups comprising of either rs1182 or rs3842225 or in combination with rs1801968 and rs13300897 were found to be significantly associated with isolated dystonia. No other allelic, genotypic or haplotypic association was found to be significant with isolated dystonia cohort or its endophenotype stratified groups. Our study suggests that <em class="a-plus-plus">TOR1A</em> common variants have a significant role in isolated dystonia pathogenesis in the Indian population, whereas SNPs in the <em class="a-plus-plus">GCH1</em> gene may have a limited role.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">By measuring the cerebral infarction rate and neurological behavioral score of rats in a sham operation group, an MCAO model control group and an <em class="a-plus-plus">Erigeron breviscapus</em> injection treatment group, we explored the therapeutic effects of <em class="a-plus-plus">Erigeron breviscapus</em> injection on brain tissue and neuroethological injury in rats. Plasma samples were collected at 18 time points after intravenous injection of <em class="a-plus-plus">Erigeron breviscapus</em>. The levels of scutellarin, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acid B in rat plasma at the various time points were determined by an HPLC method, and drug concentration versus time plots were constructed to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters. Finally, a PK-PD combined model was used to analyze the relationship between the blood concentration, time and therapeutic effects of the seven active components. The results of the pharmacodynamics studies showed that the cerebral infarction rate of rats in the <em class="a-plus-plus">Erigeron breviscapus</em> injection group decreased significantly at 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 6 h, 8 h, 18 h, 24 h, 32 h, 40 h and 48 h after cerebral ischemia. Abnormal neurological behavior scores were significantly reduced after 4 h of cerebral ischemia. The pharmacokinetics results showed that the seven chemical constituents in <em class="a-plus-plus">Erigeron breviscapus</em> injection reached their highest detection value after 5 min of cerebral ischemia. The lowest detection values of scutellarin and isochlorogenic acid B appeared after 6 h of cerebral ischemia but could not be detected after 8 h. The lowest detection values of 5-caffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid were found in the third hour of cerebral ischemia but not after 4 h. The lowest detection values of 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid were found during the second hour of cerebral ischemia but not at the third hour. However, at 18 h, 24 h, 32 h and 40 h of cerebral ischemia, the cerebral infarction rates of rats in the <em class="a-plus-plus">Erigeron breviscapus</em> injection group were significantly reduced, with decreased values of 6.22%, 11.71%, 6.92% and 4.96%, respectively, and the effects were stronger than those after 5–20 min of cerebral ischemia. The decreased values reached their highest value after 24 h of cerebral ischemia. Our results show that the effects of <em class="a-plus-plus">Erigeron breviscapus</em> injection on reducing the cerebral infarct rate in MCAO model rats are characterized by a fast onset and long maintenance time. The 5-min blood concentration in cerebral ischemia was the highest test value, and after this time, the cerebral infarction rate of MCAO rats began to decrease. However, the peak value of the effects lagged behind that of the plasma concentration. The maximum effective time for <em class="a-plus-plus">Erigeron breviscapus</em> injection appeared 24 h after cerebral ischemia, which provides a reference for the screening of specific drugs for ischemic stroke, optimal dosing regimens and rational clinical drug use.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">This study aimed to clarify the regulation role of miR-708 and miR-335-3p in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) autophagy and apoptosis in glaucoma. Chronic glaucoma mice were established by laser photocoagulation. RGCs were isolated and transfected with a series of plasmids and the cultured in 60 mmHg pressure. miR-335-3p, miR-708, and ATG3 mRNA expressions were detected by qRT-PCR. Protein levels of ATG3, autophagy-related protein LC3, and p62 were detected by Western blot. The apoptosis of RGCs was detected by flow cytometry. The regulation role of miR-335-3p/miR-708 in ATG3 was confirmed by the dual-luciferase reporter gene. The expressions of several miRNAs were measured in retinal tissues from chronic glaucoma mice and RGCs under pressure conditions, and results showed that both miR-335-3p and miR-708 were down-regulated. Besides, the inhibition of miR-708 and miR-335-3p induced the apoptosis of RGCs through promoting autophagy. Also, miR-708 and miR-335-3p could bind to ATG3 and targeted regulated ATG3. Furthermore, the interference with miR-708/miR-335-3p induced RGC apoptosis by up-regulating ATG3 to promote autophagy. In general, the down-regulation of miR-708 and miR-335-3p contributed to the apoptosis of RGCs through promoting autophagy in glaucoma.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">SNP rs2043211 in <em class="a-plus-plus">CARD8</em> was found to have significant association with ischemic stroke. This study aimed to explore the possible association between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke in Chinese and explain the possible mechanism. In total, 716 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and 1088 controls were included in the study. Co-dominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models were constructed to evaluate the relationship between rs2043211 and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke risk by odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Stratified and interaction analyses were also done. We selected another 111 large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients and measured the CARD8 levels in their plasma samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Participants who carry T/T genotype have a higher risk of large-artery atherosclerosis stroke compared with those carry A/T or A/A genotypes (odds ratio = 1.35, 95% confidence intervals 1.03–1.77, <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.029). The higher risk for the T/T genotype is still notable in female, people with hypertension, and people without diabetes. In the interaction analysis, compared to the non-hypertensive participants with the wild homozygote type A/A, the hypertensive participants with the A/T+T/T homozygote had 3.27-fold increased risk (odds ratio = 3.27, 95% confidence intervals 2.33–4.60). The A/A group had lower CARD8 levels in plasma than the A/T and T/T group (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.001). Further bioinformatics prediction indicated that the rs2043211 could significantly influence the mRNA secondary structure and protein expression of <em class="a-plus-plus">CARD8</em> (eQTL <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 9.8 × 10<sup class="a-plus-plus">−198</sup>).

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Outbred rats differentially consume alcohol when having free access to it. Among others, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is believed to control voluntary ethanol intake in rodents. Meanwhile, expression of BDNF exons in brain regions and epigenetic mechanisms underlying alcohol intake pattern remain obscure. The main goal was to study whether voluntary alcohol drinking pattern affects expression of BDNF exons in selected rat brain regions during early abstinence. Intermittent access to 20% ethanol in a two-bottle-choice procedure (IA2BC) was used as a model of voluntary ethanol intake. Male Wistar rats (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 24) had twenty 24-h sessions of free access to two-bottle choice (water or 20% ethanol) with 24-h withdrawal periods (water only). Control animals had access to water only (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 11). After finishing IA2BC, the animals were divided according to the compliance of ethanol intake pattern with gradual escalation, a key feature of the paradigm. To access potential behavioral disturbances during the early abstinence, rats were consequently tested in the open field test, the elevated plus-maze, and the sucrose preference test. On the third day after the last drinking session, expression of BDNF exons and polypeptide was measured in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and midbrain using quantitative PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed to analyze enrichment of positive Ph-CREB (Ser133) and negative EZH2 transcriptional regulators as well as markers of active H3K9ac and repressed H3K27me3 chromatin at exon-specific BDNF promoters in brain regions with affected BDNF expression. During the course of the IA2BC, one part of animals demonstrated gradual escalation from low to high alcohol intake and preference of alcohol over water (a typical pattern for IA2BC) while the other one consumed alcohol at a consistently high level (an unusual pattern for IA2BC). Drinking pattern in the IA2BC does not define differences of behavior in any of the tests during early abstinence. Finally, the IA2BC rats with growing alcohol intake showed elevation of BDNF mRNA containing exon VI in the hippocampus associated with an enhanced H3K9ac occupancy at the respective promoter. Thus, rats differentially consuming alcohol in the IA2BC paradigm differ in epigenetically determined expression of BDNF exon VI in the hippocampus during early abstinence.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">To feel other’s pain would elicit empathy. Some theorists hypothesized that observing other’s pain may activate the primary emotion of maternal care instinct, which may function as a precursor of empathy. The maternal care instinct and empathy share the same genetic background and neuroendocrine underpinnings. An extensive body of research has shown that maternal behaviors relate to the oxytocinergic system, which has a strong influence on empathy. These studies suggest that the maternal care instinct may mediate the effect of oxytocin receptor gene (<em class="a-plus-plus">OXTR</em>) on empathy. To provide evidence for this mediation, we used the subscale of CARE in Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) to measure the maternal care instinct and tested two <em class="a-plus-plus">OXTR</em> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs53576 and rs13316193, in 880 high school participants (588 females, 292 males; <em class="a-plus-plus">M</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">age</sub> = 16.51 years old, SD = 0.65). Results showed that the genotype of rs13316193 was indirectly associated with empathy via CARE, suggesting a mediating role of CARE in the pathway from <em class="a-plus-plus">OXTR</em> to empathy. These findings may contribute to an understanding of how empathy emerges when one witnesses another person in pain.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Metachromatic leukodystrophy(MLD) is an autosomal recessive hereditary neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder caused by the mutations in arylsulfatase A gene (ARSA), which results in the deficiency of ARSA enzyme. The common clinical characteristics of MLD are abnormal gait, and then gradually appears ataxia, spastic quadriplegia, optic atrophy, cortical blindness, and dementia. We describe two patients in China who were diagnosed with MLD and find that the four ARSA gene mutations (c.1115G&gt;A, c.302G&gt;T, c.893 G&gt; T, and c.302G&gt;T) are associated with MLD, in which c.893 G&gt;T and c.302G&gt;T are novel mutations by gene sequence and clinical manifestations, to further understand the relationship between MLD and ARSA gene.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">FGF2 is a neurotrophic factor that can act as a key regulatory molecule of neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis in various injuries. To explore the genetic background of the <em class="a-plus-plus">FGF2</em> gene on DPN development, this study analyzed the correlation between SNPs in the 3'UTR of the <em class="a-plus-plus">FGF2</em> gene and their interaction with environmental factors in DPN patients of Han Chinese nationality. Sanger sequencing was used to analyze the <em class="a-plus-plus">FGF2</em> genotypes at the rs1048201, rs3804158, rs41348645, rs6854081, rs3747676, rs7683093, rs1476215, and rs1476217 loci in 150 DPN patients, 150 NDPN patients, and 150 healthy control patients. Plasma FGF2 levels were measured in all subjects by using ELISAs. Subjects carrying the T allele at the rs1048201 locus in the <em class="a-plus-plus">FGF2</em> gene had a significantly lower risk of developing DPN compared with subjects carrying the C allele (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.33–0.56, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01). Subjects with the G genotype at the rs6854081 locus had an exceptionally higher risk of developing DPN than subjects with the T allele (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.39–1.89, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01). Individuals harboring the G allele at the rs7683093 locus had a markedly higher risk of DPN than patients with the C allele (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.36–1.87, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01). Finally, individuals having the A genotype at the rs1476215 locus had a significantly higher risk of DPN than individuals carrying the T allele (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.53–2.02, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01). There was an interaction between age and alcohol consumption and the SNP rs7683093. SNPs at rs1048201, rs6854081, rs7683093, and rs1476215 in the <em class="a-plus-plus">FGF2</em> 3’UTR were strongly associated with plasma levels of FGF2 (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05). SNPs at the rs1048201, rs6854081, rs7683093, and rs1476215 loci in the <em class="a-plus-plus">FGF2</em> gene were significantly associated with the risk of DPN. A possible mechanism is that these SNPs affect the expression level of FGF2 by interrupting the binding of microRNAs to target sites in the 3'UTR.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are involved in the pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation and rupture. Interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 (<em class="a-plus-plus">ILF2</em>) is known as the nuclear factor of activated T cells and regulates cell growth. This study was aimed to explore the effects of <em class="a-plus-plus">ILF2</em> on IA progression. Human brain VSMCs (hBVSMCs) were transfected with pCDNA3.1(+), pCDNA3.1(+)-ILF2, siRNA-negative control, and siRNA-ILF2. The transfection efficiency was then evaluated by determining <em class="a-plus-plus">ILF2</em> expression. The cell viability and apoptosis were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 and Annexin V-FITC cell apoptosis assay kit, respectively. Real-time quantification PCR (RT-qPCR) was applied to measure the expression levels of apoptosis-related and inflammation-related genes. Finally, western blot was used to detect the expression level of Fas cell surface death receptor 95 (CD95) and Caspase 8. Overexpression of <em class="a-plus-plus">ILF2</em> could significantly increase cell viability and decrease cell apoptosis (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.05), while knock-down of <em class="a-plus-plus">ILF2</em> showed opposite trends for hBVSMCs on cell viability and apoptosis (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.05). RT-qPCR results showed that <em class="a-plus-plus">ILF2</em> knock-down downregulated the expression levels of BCL2 apoptosis regulator (<em class="a-plus-plus">BCL2</em>), transcriptional regulator Myc-like (<em class="a-plus-plus">c-Myc</em>), and caspase 1 (<em class="a-plus-plus">ICE</em>) whereas upregulated the expression levels of <em class="a-plus-plus">CD95</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">p21</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">p53</em>, and interleukin-13 (<em class="a-plus-plus">IL-13</em>). Additionally, the protein expression levels of CD95 and Caspase 8 were significantly decreased after <em class="a-plus-plus">ILF2</em> overexpression while were significantly increased after <em class="a-plus-plus">ILF2</em> knock-down (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> &lt; 0.05). <em class="a-plus-plus">ILF2</em> knock-down may inhibit cell viability and promote cell apoptosis of hBVSMCs by regulating the expression levels of apoptosis-related genes and suppressing inflammatory response.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is known as a chronic neuroinflammatory disorder typified by an immune-mediated demyelination process with ensuing axonal damage and loss. Sinomenine is a natural alkaloid with different therapeutic benefits, including anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities. In this study, possible beneficial effects of sinomenine in an MOG-induced model of MS were determined. Sinomenine was given to MOG<sub class="a-plus-plus">35–55</sub>-immunized C57BL/6 mice at doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg/day after onset of MS clinical signs till day 30 post-immunization. Analyzed data showed that sinomenine reduces severity of the clinical signs and to some extent decreases tissue level of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNFα, IL-17A, and increases level of anti-inflammatory IL-10. In addition, sinomenine successfully attenuated tissue levels of inflammasome NLRP3, ASC, and caspase 1 besides its reduction of intensity of neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage and loss in lumbar spinal cord specimens. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for MBP decreased and increased for GFAP and Iba1 after MOG-immunization, which was in part reversed upon sinomenine administration. Overall, sinomenine decreases EAE severity, which is attributed to its alleviation of microglial and astrocytic mobilization, demyelination, and axonal damage along with its suppression of neuroinflammation, and its beneficial effect is also associated with its inhibitory effects on inflammasome and pyroptotic pathways; this may be of potential benefit for the primary progressive phenotype of MS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Studies from our lab demonstrated that 1 × 10<sup class="a-plus-plus">5</sup> intra-arterial mesenchymal stem cells (IA MSCs) at 6 h following ischemic stroke are efficacious owing to its maximum homing due to elevated stromal derived factor 1 (SDF1) in the tissue. Further, IA MSCs could abate the infarct progression, improve functional outcome, and decrease expression of calcineurin by modifying neuronal Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> channels following ischemic stroke. Since stroke pathology also encompasses acidosis that worsens the condition; hence, the role of acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) in this context could not be overlooked. ASIC1a being the major contributor towards acidosis triggers Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> ions overload which progressively contributes towards exacerbation of neuronal injury following ischemic insult. Inflammasome involvement in ischemic stroke is well reported as activated ASIC1a increases the expression of inflammasome in a pH-dependent manner to trigger inflammatory cascade. Hence, the current study aimed to identify if IA MSCs can decrease the production of inflammasome by attenuating ASIC1a expression to render neuroprotection. Ovariectomized Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 90 min were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 1 × 10<sup class="a-plus-plus">5</sup> MSCs IA at 6 h to check for the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasome in different groups. Inhibition studies were carried out to explore the underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrate that IA MSCs improves functional outcome and oxidative stress parameters, and decreases the expression of ASIC1a and inflammasomes in the cortical brain region after ischemic stroke. This study offers a preliminary evidence of the role of IA MSCs in regulating inflammasome by modulating ASIC1a.</p>

<p>by Shinsuke Koyama, Taiki Horie, Shigeru Shinomoto</p>

After slowing down the spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, many countries have started to relax their confinement measures in the face of critical damage to socioeconomic structures. At this stage, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease. Though it is difficult to trace back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable, estimating the average spreading rate is possible if a proper mathematical model can be devised to analyze daily event-occurrences. To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting a discrete-time variant of the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. The proposed method detects changes occurring in each country and assesses the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number, which corresponds to the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. Moreover, the proposed method can be used to predict the possible consequences of alternative political measures. This information can serve as a reference for behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l3J0qpBlzNo" width="1" />

<p>by Alessandro Toso, Arash Fassihi, Luciano Paz, Francesca Pulecchi, Mathew E. Diamond</p>

The connection between stimulus perception and time perception remains unknown. The present study combines human and rat psychophysics with sensory cortical neuronal firing to construct a computational model for the percept of elapsed time embedded within sense of touch. When subjects judged the duration of a vibration applied to the fingertip (human) or whiskers (rat), increasing stimulus intensity led to increasing perceived duration. Symmetrically, increasing vibration duration led to increasing perceived intensity. We modeled real spike trains recorded from vibrissal somatosensory cortex as input to dual leaky integrators–an intensity integrator with short time constant and a duration integrator with long time constant–generating neurometric functions that replicated the actual psychophysical functions of rats. Returning to human psychophysics, we then confirmed specific predictions of the dual leaky integrator model. This study offers a framework, based on sensory coding and subsequent accumulation of sensory drive, to account for how a feeling of the passage of time accompanies the tactile sensory experience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Qk53SeMoaUo" width="1" />

<p>by Martina Conte, Sergio Casas-Tintò, Juan Soler</p>

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, due to its great infiltration capacity. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the Glioblastoma invasion front is a major challenge with preeminent potential clinical relevances. In the infiltration front, the key features of tumor dynamics relate to biochemical and biomechanical aspects, which result in the extension of cellular protrusions known as tumor microtubes. The coordination of metalloproteases expression, extracellular matrix degradation, and integrin activity emerges as a leading mechanism that facilitates Glioblastoma expansion and infiltration in uncontaminated brain regions. We propose a novel multidisciplinary approach, based on in vivo experiments in <i>Drosophila</i> and mathematical models, that describes the dynamics of active and inactive integrins in relation to matrix metalloprotease concentration and tumor density at the Glioblastoma invasion front. The mathematical model is based on a non-linear system of evolution equations in which the mechanisms leading chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and front dynamics compete with the movement induced by the saturated flux in porous media. This approach is able to capture the relative influences of the involved agents and reproduce the formation of patterns, which drive tumor front evolution. These patterns have the value of providing biomarker information that is related to the direction of the dynamical evolution of the front and based on static measures of proteins in several tumor samples. Furthermore, we consider in our model biomechanical elements, like the tissue porosity, as indicators of the healthy tissue resistance to tumor progression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vza9Fm7jS7Q" width="1" />

<p>by Burcu Tepekule, Anthony Hauser, Viacheslav N. Kachalov, Sara Andresen, Thomas Scheier, Peter W. Schreiber, Huldrych F. Günthard, Roger D. Kouyos</p>

A key parameter in epidemiological modeling which characterizes the spread of an infectious disease is the generation time, or more generally the distribution of infectiousness as a function of time since infection. There is increasing evidence supporting a prolonged viral shedding window for COVID-19, but the transmissibility in this phase is unclear. Based on this, we develop a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model including an additional compartment of chronically infected individuals who can stay infectious for a longer duration than the reported generation time, but with infectivity reduced to varying degrees. Using the incidence and fatality data from different countries, we first show that such an assumption also yields a plausible model in explaining the data observed prior to the easing of the lockdown measures (relaxation). We then test the predictive power of this model for different durations and levels of prolonged infectiousness using the incidence data after the introduction of relaxation in Switzerland, and compare it with a model without the chronically infected population to represent the models conventionally used. We show that in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures, the predictions of the model including the chronically infected population vary considerably from those obtained under a model in which prolonged infectiousness is not taken into account. Although the existence of a chronically infected population still remains largely hypothetical, we believe that our results provide tentative evidence to consider a chronically infected population as an alternative modeling approach to better interpret the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0Vs3a-TSzn0" width="1" />

We consider the following general family of algorithmic problems that arises in transcriptomics, metabolomics and other fields: given a weighted graph G and a subset of its nodes S, find subsets of S that show significant connectedness within G. A specific solution to this problem may be defined by devising a scoring function, the Maximum Clique problem being a classic example, where S includes all nodes in G and where the score is defined by the size of the largest subset of S fully connected within G. Major practical obstacles for the plethora of algorithms addressing this type of problem include computational efficiency and, particularly for more complex scores which take edge weights into account, the computational cost of permutation testing, a statistical procedure required to obtain a bound on the p-value for a connectedness score. To address these problems, we developed CTD “Connect the Dots”, a fast algorithm based on data compression that detects highly connected subsets within S. CTD provides information-theoretic upper bounds on p-values when S contains a small fraction of nodes in G without requiring computationally costly permutation testing. We apply the CTD algorithm to interpret multi-metabolite perturbations due to inborn errors of metabolism and multi-transcript perturbations associated with breast cancer in the context of disease-specific Gaussian Markov Random Field networks learned directly from respective molecular profiling data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Wd4YcxPwLg" width="1" />

<i>Gambiense</i> human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is a virulent disease declining in burden but still endemic in West and Central Africa. Although it is targeted for elimination of transmission by 2030, there remain numerous questions about the drivers of infection and how these vary geographically.
In this study we focus on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which accounted for 84% of the global case burden in 2016, to explore changes in transmission across the country and elucidate factors which may have contributed to the persistence of disease or success of interventions in different regions. We present a Bayesian fitting methodology, applied to 168 endemic health zones (∼100,000 population size), which allows for calibration of a mechanistic gHAT model to case data (from the World Health Organization HAT Atlas) in an adaptive and automated framework.
It was found that the model needed to capture improvements in passive detection to match observed trends in the data within former Bandundu and Bas Congo provinces indicating these regions have substantially reduced time to detection. Health zones in these provinces generally had longer burn-in periods during fitting due to additional model parameters.
Posterior probability distributions were found for a range of fitted parameters in each health zone; these included the basic reproduction number estimates for pre-1998 (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) which was inferred to be between 1 and 1.14, in line with previous gHAT estimates, with higher median values typically in health zones with more case reporting in the 2000s.
Previously, it was not clear whether a fall in active case finding in the period contributed to the declining case numbers. The modelling here accounts for variable screening and suggests that underlying transmission has also reduced greatly—on average 96% in former Equateur, 93% in former Bas Congo and 89% in former Bandundu—Equateur and Bandundu having had the highest case burdens in 2000. This analysis also sets out a framework to enable future predictions for the country.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tPdTwUVzmjI" width="1" />

Beta-lactam- and in particular carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae represent a major public health threat. Despite strong variation of resistance across geographical settings, there is limited understanding of the underlying drivers. To assess these drivers, we developed a transmission model of cephalosporin- and carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. The model is parameterized using antibiotic consumption and demographic data from eleven European countries and fitted to the resistance rates for <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> for these settings. The impact of potential drivers of resistance is then assessed in counterfactual analyses. Based on reported consumption data, the model could simultaneously fit the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (ESBL and CRK) across eleven European countries over eleven years. The fit could explain the large between-country variability of resistance in terms of consumption patterns and fitted differences in hospital transmission rates. Based on this fit, a counterfactual analysis found that reducing nosocomial transmission and antibiotic consumption in the hospital had the strongest impact on ESBL and CRK prevalence. Antibiotic consumption in the community also affected ESBL prevalence but its relative impact was weaker than inpatient consumption. Finally, we used the model to estimate a moderate fitness cost of CRK and ESBL at the population level. This work highlights the disproportionate role of antibiotic consumption in the hospital and of nosocomial transmission for resistance in gram-negative bacteria at a European level. This indicates that infection control and antibiotic stewardship measures should play a major role in limiting resistance even at the national or regional level.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GGttMT652VA" width="1" />

Gene regulatory network inference is essential to uncover complex relationships among gene pathways and inform downstream experiments, ultimately enabling regulatory network re-engineering. Network inference from transcriptional time-series data requires accurate, interpretable, and efficient determination of causal relationships among thousands of genes. Here, we develop Bootstrap Elastic net regression from Time Series (BETS), a statistical framework based on Granger causality for the recovery of a directed gene network from transcriptional time-series data. BETS uses elastic net regression and stability selection from bootstrapped samples to infer causal relationships among genes. BETS is highly parallelized, enabling efficient analysis of large transcriptional data sets. We show competitive accuracy on a community benchmark, the DREAM4 100-gene network inference challenge, where BETS is one of the fastest among methods of similar performance and additionally infers whether causal effects are activating or inhibitory. We apply BETS to transcriptional time-series data of differentially-expressed genes from A549 cells exposed to glucocorticoids over a period of 12 hours. We identify a network of 2768 genes and 31, 945 directed edges (FDR ≤ 0.2). We validate inferred causal network edges using two external data sources: Overexpression experiments on the same glucocorticoid system, and genetic variants associated with inferred edges in primary lung tissue in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v6 project. BETS is available as an open source software package at https://github.com/lujonathanh/BETS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zCJP259WSfo" width="1" />

Anatomically and biophysically detailed data-driven neuronal models have become widely used tools for understanding and predicting the behavior and function of neurons. Due to the increasing availability of experimental data from anatomical and electrophysiological measurements as well as the growing number of computational and software tools that enable accurate neuronal modeling, there are now a large number of different models of many cell types available in the literature. These models were usually built to capture a few important or interesting properties of the given neuron type, and it is often unknown how they would behave outside their original context. In addition, there is currently no simple way of quantitatively comparing different models regarding how closely they match specific experimental observations. This limits the evaluation, re-use and further development of the existing models. Further, the development of new models could also be significantly facilitated by the ability to rapidly test the behavior of model candidates against the relevant collection of experimental data. We address these problems for the representative case of the CA1 pyramidal cell of the rat hippocampus by developing an open-source Python test suite, which makes it possible to automatically and systematically test multiple properties of models by making quantitative comparisons between the models and electrophysiological data. The tests cover various aspects of somatic behavior, and signal propagation and integration in apical dendrites. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we applied our tests to compare the behavior of several different rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell models from the ModelDB database against electrophysiological data available in the literature, and evaluated how well these models match experimental observations in different domains. We also show how we employed the test suite to aid the development of models within the European Human Brain Project (HBP), and describe the integration of the tests into the validation framework developed in the HBP, with the aim of facilitating more reproducible and transparent model building in the neuroscience community.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZEryzjWRiq4" width="1" />

Retrograde tracers were utilized to examine projections to the dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN), a critical component of the head direction cell circuitry, and the abducens nucleus, an oculomotor structure. We found that the medial vestibular nucleus contains individual neurons that project to both the DTN and abducens nucleus. In contrast, neurons in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi project to either the DTN or abducens nucleus, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. Additionally, we describe interhemispheric connections between the left and right DTN, and projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN.







Abstract
Specialized circuitry in the brain processes spatial information to provide a sense of direction used for navigation. The dorsal tegmental nucleus (DTN) is a core component of this circuitry and utilizes vestibular inputs to generate neural activity encoding the animal’s directional heading. Projections arising from the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH) and the medial vestibular nucleus (MVe) are thought to transmit critical vestibular signals to the DTN and other brain areas, including the abducens nucleus (ABN), a component of eye movement circuitry. Here, we utilized a dual retrograde tracer approach in rats to investigate whether overlapping or distinct populations of neurons project from the NPH or MVe to the DTN and ABN. We report that individual MVe neurons project to both the DTN and ABN. In contrast, we observed individual NPH neurons that project to either the DTN or ABN, but rarely to both structures simultaneously. We also examined labeling patterns in other structures located in the brainstem and posterior cortex and observed 1) complex patterns of interhemispheric connectivity between the left and right DTN, 2) projections from the supragenual nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and retrosplenial cortex to the DTN, 3) projections from the lateral superior olive to the ABN, and 4) a unique population of cerebrospinal fluid‐contacting neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus . Collectively, our experiments provide valuable new information that extends our understanding of the anatomical organization of the brain’s spatial processing circuitry.

Our study demonstrates that simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in rats is feasible with an MRI‐compatible electrode montage. We found that bilateral tDCS can locally modulate neural activity and functional connectivity in rat brain, while cortical functional connectivity is differentially affected under the tDCS cathode and anode.

Abstract
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique implicated as a promising adjunct therapy to improve motor function through the neuromodulation of brain networks. Particularly bilateral tDCS, which affects both hemispheres, may yield stronger effects on motor learning than unilateral stimulation. Therefore, the aim of this exploratory study was to develop an experimental model for simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bilateral tDCS in rats, to measure instant and resultant effects of tDCS on network activity and connectivity. Naïve, male Sprague‐Dawley rats were divided into a tDCS (n = 7) and sham stimulation group (n = 6). Functional MRI data were collected during concurrent bilateral tDCS over the sensorimotor cortex, while resting‐state functional MRI and perfusion MRI were acquired directly before and after stimulation. Bilateral tDCS induced a hemodynamic activation response, reflected by a bilateral increase in blood oxygenation level‐dependent signal in different cortical areas, including the sensorimotor regions. Resting‐state functional connectivity within the cortical sensorimotor network decreased after a first stimulation session but increased after a second session, suggesting an interaction between multiple tDCS sessions. Perfusion MRI revealed no significant changes in cerebral blood flow after tDCS. Our exploratory study demonstrates successful application of an MRI‐compatible bilateral tDCS setup in an animal model. Our results indicate that bilateral tDCS can locally modulate neuronal activity and connectivity, which may underlie its therapeutic potential.

<p>Reconstructing seeing images from fMRI recordings is an absorbing research
area in neuroscience and provides a potential brain-reading technology. The
challenge lies in that visual encoding in brain is highly complex and not fully
revealed. Inspired by the theory that visual features are hierarchically
represented in cortex, we propose to break the complex visual signals into
multi-level components and decode each component separately. Specifically, we
decode shape and semantic representations from the lower and higher visual
cortex respectively, and merge the shape and semantic information to images by
a generative adversarial network (Shape-Semantic GAN). This 'divide and
conquer' strategy captures visual information more accurately. Experiments
demonstrate that Shape-Semantic GAN improves the reconstruction similarity and
image quality, and achieves the state-of-the-art image reconstruction
performance.

<p>Recently a mechanism called stagnation detection was proposed that
automatically adjusts the mutation rate of evolutionary algorithms when they
encounter local optima. The so-called $SD-(1+1)EA$ introduced by Rajabi and
Witt (GECCO 2020) adds stagnation detection to the classical $(1+1)EA$ with
standard bit mutation, which flips each bit independently with some mutation
rate, and raises the mutation rate when the algorithm is likely to have
encountered local optima.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we investigate stagnation detection in the context of the
$k$-bit flip operator of randomized local search that flips $k$ bits chosen
uniformly at random and let stagnation detection adjust the parameter $k$. We
obtain improved runtime results compared to the $SD-(1+1)EA$ amounting to a
speed-up of up to $e=2.71\dots$ Moreover, we propose additional schemes that
prevent infinite optimization times even if the algorithm misses a working
choice of $k$ due to unlucky events. Finally, we present an example where
standard bit mutation still outperforms the local $k$-bit flip with stagnation
detection.

<p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) used for brain-computer-interface (BCI)
classification are commonly expected to learn general features when trained
across a variety of contexts, such that these features could be fine-tuned to
specific contexts. While some success is found in such an approach, we suggest
that this interpretation is limited and an alternative would better leverage
the newly (publicly) available massive EEG datasets. We consider how to adapt
techniques and architectures used for language modelling (LM), that appear
capable of ingesting awesome amounts of data, towards the development of
encephalography modelling (EM) with DNNs in the same vein. We specifically
adapt an approach effectively used for automatic speech recognition, which
similarly (to LMs) uses a self-supervised training objective to learn
compressed representations of raw data signals. After adaptation to EEG, we
find that a single pre-trained model is capable of modelling completely novel
raw EEG sequences recorded with differing hardware, and different subjects
performing different tasks. Furthermore, both the internal representations of
this model and the entire architecture can be fine-tuned to a variety of
downstream BCI and EEG classification tasks, outperforming prior work in more
task-specific (sleep stage classification) self-supervision.

<p>Particle Swam Optimization is a population-based and gradient-free
optimization method developed by mimicking social behaviour observed in nature.
Its ability to optimize is not specifically implemented but emerges in the
global level from local interactions. In its canonical version, there are three
factors that govern a particle's trajectory: 1) inertia from its previous
displacement; 2) attraction to its best experience; and 3) attraction to a
given neighbour's best experience. The importance given to each of these
factors is regulated by three coefficients: 1) the inertia; 2) the
individuality; and 3) the sociality weights. Their settings rule the trajectory
of the particle when pulled by these two attractors. Different speeds and forms
of convergence of a particle towards its attractor(s) take place for different
settings of the coefficients. A more general formulation is presented aiming
for a better control of the embedded randomness. Guidelines to select the
coefficients' settings to obtain the desired behaviour are offered. The
convergence speed of the algorithm also depends on the speed of spread of
information within the swarm. The latter is governed by the structure of the
neighbourhood, whose study is beyond the scope of this paper. The objective
here is to help understand the core of the PSO paradigm from the bottom up by
offering some insight into the form of the particles' trajectories, and to
provide some guidelines as to how to decide upon the settings of the
coefficients in the particles' velocity update equation in the proposed
formulation to obtain the type of behaviour desired for the problem at hand.
General-purpose settings are also suggested. The relationship between the
proposed formulation and both the classical and constricted PSO formulations
are also provided.

<p>There is a growing interest in automated neural architecture search (NAS)
methods. They are employed to routinely deliver high-quality neural network
architectures for various challenging data sets and reduce the designer's
effort. The NAS methods utilizing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are
especially useful when the objective is not only to minimize the network error
but also to minimize the number of parameters (weights) or power consumption of
the inference phase. We propose a multi-objective NAS method based on Cartesian
genetic programming for evolving convolutional neural networks (CNN). The
method allows approximate operations to be used in CNNs to reduce the power
consumption of a target hardware implementation. During the NAS process, a
suitable CNN architecture is evolved together with approximate multipliers to
deliver the best trade-offs between the accuracy, network size, and power
consumption. The most suitable approximate multipliers are automatically
selected from a library of approximate multipliers. Evolved CNNs are compared
with common human-created CNNs of a similar complexity on the CIFAR-10
benchmark problem.

<p>We describe a complete method that learns a neural network which is
guaranteed to overestimate a reference function on a given domain. The neural
network can then be used as a surrogate for the reference function. The method
involves two steps. In the first step, we construct an adaptive set of Majoring
Points. In the second step, we optimize a well-chosen neural network to
overestimate the Majoring Points. In order to extend the guarantee on the
Majoring Points to the whole domain, we necessarily have to make an assumption
on the reference function. In this study, we assume that the reference function
is monotonic. We provide experiments on synthetic and real problems. The
experiments show that the density of the Majoring Points concentrate where the
reference function varies. The learned over-estimations are both guaranteed to
overestimate the reference function and are proven empirically to provide good
approximations of it. Experiments on real data show that the method makes it
possible to use the surrogate function in embedded systems for which an
underestimation is critical; when computing the reference function requires too
many resources.

<p>Lorentzian distributions have been largely employed in statistical mechanics
to obtain exact results for heterogeneous systems. Analytic continuation of
these results is impossible even for slightly deformed Lorentzian
distributions, due to the divergence of all the moments (cumulants). We have
solved this problem by introducing a `pseudo-cumulants' expansion. This allows
us to develop a reduction methodology for heterogeneous spiking neural networks
subject to extrinsinc and endogenous noise sources, thus generalizing the
mean-field formulation introduced in [E. Montbri\'o et al., Phys. Rev. X 5,
021028 (2015)].

<p>Cytoarchitectonic maps provide microstructural reference parcellations of the
brain, describing its organization in terms of the spatial arrangement of
neuronal cell bodies as measured from histological tissue sections. Recent work
provided the first automatic segmentations of cytoarchitectonic areas in the
visual system using Convolutional Neural Networks. We aim to extend this
approach to become applicable to a wider range of brain areas, envisioning a
solution for mapping the complete human brain. Inspired by recent success in
image classification, we propose a contrastive learning objective for encoding
microscopic image patches into robust microstructural features, which are
efficient for cytoarchitectonic area classification. We show that a model
pre-trained using this learning task outperforms a model trained from scratch,
as well as a model pre-trained on a recently proposed auxiliary task. We
perform cluster analysis in the feature space to show that the learned
representations form anatomically meaningful groups.

<p>Brain network is remarkably cost-efficient while the fundamental physical and
dynamical mechanisms underlying its economical optimization in network
structure and activity are not clear. Here we study intricate cost-efficient
interplay between structure and dynamics in biologically plausible spatial
modular neuronal network models. We find that critical avalanche states from
excitation-inhibition balance, under modular network topology with less wiring
cost, can also achieve less costs in firing, but with strongly enhanced
response sensitivity to stimuli. We derived mean-field equations that govern
the macroscopic network dynamics through a novel approximate theory. The
mechanism of low firing cost and stronger response in the form of critical
avalanche is explained as a proximity to a Hopf bifurcation of the modules when
increasing their connection density. Our work reveals the generic mechanism
underlying the cost-efficient modular organization and critical dynamics widely
observed in neural systems, providing insights to brain-inspired efficient
computational designs.

<p>How do humans learn from raw sensory experience? Throughout life, but most
obviously in infancy, we learn without explicit instruction. We propose a
detailed biological mechanism for the widely-embraced idea that learning is
based on the differences between predictions and actual outcomes (i.e.,
predictive error-driven learning). Specifically, numerous weak projections into
the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus generate top-down predictions, and sparse,
focal driver inputs from lower areas supply the actual outcome, originating in
layer 5 intrinsic bursting (5IB) neurons. Thus, the outcome is only briefly
activated, roughly every 100 msec (i.e., 10 Hz, alpha), resulting in a temporal
difference error signal, which drives local synaptic changes throughout the
neocortex, resulting in a biologically-plausible form of error backpropagation
learning. We implemented these mechanisms in a large-scale model of the visual
system, and found that the simulated inferotemporal (IT) pathway learns to
systematically categorize 3D objects according to invariant shape properties,
based solely on predictive learning from raw visual inputs. These categories
match human judgments on the same stimuli, and are consistent with neural
representations in IT cortex in primates.

<p>We introduce the use of Fabry-Perot (FP) lasers as potential neuromorphic
computing machines with parallel processing capabilities. With the use of
optical injection between a master FP laser and a slave FP laser under feedback
we demonstrate the potential for scaling up the processing power at
longitudinal mode granularity and perform real-time processing for signal
equalization in 25 Gbaud intensity modulation direct detection optical
communication systems. We demonstrate the improvement of classification
performance as the number of nodes increases and the capability of simultaneous
processing of arbitrary data streams. Extensive numerical simulations show that
up to 8 longitudinal modes in typical Fabry-Perot lasers can be leveraged so as
to enhance classification performance.

<p>Machine learning applications such as finance and medicine demand accurate
and justifiable predictions, barring most deep learning methods from use. In
response, previous work combines decision trees with deep learning, yielding
models that (1) sacrifice interpretability for accuracy or (2) sacrifice
accuracy for interpretability. We forgo this dilemma by jointly improving
accuracy and interpretability using Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs). NBDTs
replace a neural network's final linear layer with a differentiable sequence of
decisions and a surrogate loss. This forces the model to learn high-level
concepts and lessens reliance on highly-uncertain decisions, yielding (1)
accuracy: NBDTs match or outperform modern neural networks on CIFAR, ImageNet
and better generalize to unseen classes by up to 16%. Furthermore, our
surrogate loss improves the original model's accuracy by up to 2%. NBDTs also
afford (2) interpretability: improving human trustby clearly identifying model
mistakes and assisting in dataset debugging. Code and pretrained NBDTs are at
https://github.com/alvinwan/neural-backed-decision-trees.

<p>The influence of deep learning is continuously expanding across different
domains, and its new applications are ubiquitous. The question of neural
network design thus increases in importance, as traditional empirical
approaches are reaching their limits. Manual design of network architectures
from scratch relies heavily on trial and error, while using existing pretrained
models can introduce redundancies or vulnerabilities. Automated neural
architecture design is able to overcome these problems, but the most successful
algorithms operate on significantly constrained design spaces, assuming the
target network to consist of identical repeating blocks. While such approach
allows for faster search, it does so at the cost of expressivity. We instead
propose an alternative probabilistic representation of a whole neural network
structure under the assumption of independence between layer types. Our matrix
of probabilities is equivalent to the population of models, but allows for
discovery of structural irregularities, while being simple to interpret and
analyze. We construct an architecture search algorithm, inspired by the
estimation of distribution algorithms, to take advantage of this
representation. The probability matrix is tuned towards generating
high-performance models by repeatedly sampling the architectures and evaluating
the corresponding networks, while gradually increasing the model depth. Our
algorithm is shown to discover non-regular models which cannot be expressed via
blocks, but are competitive both in accuracy and computational cost, while not
utilizing complex dataflows or advanced training techniques, as well as
remaining conceptually simple and highly extensible.

<p>Using a model heat engine we show that neural network-based reinforcement
learning can identify thermodynamic trajectories of maximal efficiency. We use
an evolutionary learning algorithm to evolve a population of neural networks,
subject to a directive to maximize the efficiency of a trajectory composed of a
set of elementary thermodynamic processes; the resulting networks learn to
carry out the maximally-efficient Carnot, Stirling, or Otto cycles. Given
additional irreversible processes this evolutionary scheme learns a previously
unknown thermodynamic cycle. We also show how an evolutionary approach compares
with gradient-based reinforcement learning. Gradient-based reinforcement
learning is able to learn the Stirling cycle, whereas an evolutionary approach
achieves the optimal Carnot cycle. Our results show how the reinforcement
learning strategies developed for game playing can be applied to solve physical
problems conditioned upon path-extensive order parameters.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Dementia with Lewy bodies can provide a diagnostic challenge due to the frequent overlap of clinical signs with other neurodegenerative conditions, namely Parkinson's disease dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Part of this clinical overlap is due to the neuropathological overlap. Dementia with Lewy bodies is characterized by the accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein protein in Lewy bodies, similar to Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia. However, it is also frequently accompanied by aggregation of amyloid-beta and tau, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Neuroimaging is central to the diagnostic process. This review is an overview of both established and evolving imaging methods that can improve diagnostic accuracy and improve management of this disorder.</p>

<p>Dravet syndrome (DS) is an epileptic syndrome caused by mutations in the Scn1a gene encoding the α1 subunit of the sodium channel Nav1.1, which is associated with febrile seizures that progress to severe tonic-clonic seizures and associated comorbidities. Treatment with cannabidiol has been approved to reduce seizures in DS, but it may also be active against these comorbidities. The aim of this study was to validate a new mouse model of DS having lower mortality than previous models, which may serve to further evaluate therapies for the long-term comorbidities. This new model consists of heterozygous conditional knock-in mice carrying a missense mutation (A1783V) in Scn1a gene expressed exclusively in neurons of the CNS (Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup>). These mice have been used here to determine the extent and persistence of the behavioral deterioration in different postnatal days (PND), as well as to investigate the alterations that the disease produces in the endocannabinoid system and the contribution of inflammatory events and impaired neurogenesis in the pathology. Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup> mice showed a strong reduction in hindlimb grasp reflex at PND10, whereas at PND25, they presented spontaneous convulsions and a greater susceptibility to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures, marked hyperactivity, deficient spatial working memory, lower levels of anxiety, and altered social interaction behavior. These differences disappeared at PND40 and PND60, except the changes in social interaction and anxiety. The analysis of CNS structures associated with these behavioral alterations revealed an elevated glial reactivity in the prefrontal cortex and the dentate gyrus. This was associated in the dentate gyrus with a greater cell proliferation detected with Ki67 immunostaining, whereas double-labeling analyses identified that proliferating cells were GFAP-positive suggesting failed neurogenesis but astrocyte proliferation. The analysis of the endocannabinoid system of Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup> mice confirmed reductions in CB<sub>1</sub> receptors and MAGL and FAAH enzymes, mainly in the cerebellum but also in other areas, whereas CB<sub>2</sub> receptors became upregulated in the hippocampus. In conclusion, Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup> mice showed seizuring susceptibility and several comorbidities (hyperactivity, memory impairment, less anxiety, and altered social behavior), which exhibited a pattern of age expression similar to DS patients. Syn-Cre/Scn1a<sup>WT/A1783V</sup> mice also exhibited greater glial reactivity and a reactive response in the neurogenic niche, and regional changes in the status of the endocannabinoid signaling, events that could contribute in behavioral impairment.</p>

<p>According to ancient texts on poetics, the concept of representation is deeply bound to that of “mimesis;” this last was intended in two main ways: as “imitation” and as “world construction.” In Aristotle's Poetics, mimesis is theorized as the main form of “world simulation,” giving rise to the complex universe of fiction. The concept of simulation plays a pivotal role in the neurocognitive theories on the embodied mind: within this frame, embodied simulation is intended as a functional prelinguistic activation of the human sensorimotor mechanism. This happens not only with regard to intercorporeality and intersubjectivity in the real world but also in relation to the process of imagination giving rise to literary imagery and to the reader's reception of the fictional world, since human beings share a common sensorimotor apparatus. Imagination is a central concept in the recent neurocognitive studies since it plays a core role in human life and in artistic production and reception. Imagination has been considered as a complex emergent cognitive faculty deeply intertwined with perception, memory, and consciousness, shaping human life and transforming the limited horizon of our perceptual affective understanding, being, and acting. Although there is an immense bulk of literature on this topic, imagination is still an elusive concept: its definition and understanding change according to different heuristic frames—mainly the philosophical, aesthetic, poetic, and cognitive ones—giving rise to debates about its modalities and effects, particularly in relation to the construction of aesthetic and symbolic constraints. In this paper, we claim that scientific research may take advantage from the literary representation of the imaginative faculties, which occurs in specific tests characterized by dynamic images and motion. In such meta-representation of the imagination, we witness the phenomenological emergence of endogenous dynamic processes involving a cluster of cognitive faculties, activated by triggering the reader's embodied simulation. One of the main German poets, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in the second part of his masterwork Faust II, intuitively represents the very process of the imagination and its responding to embodied simulation with regard both to the author's creative act and to its reception by the reader. At the crossway between literary and neurocognitive, this study aims to highlight the advantage offered to future transdisciplinary inquiries by the literary representation showing features and dynamics of the still mysterious phenomenon of the imagination.</p>

<p>The potential benefits of priming intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) with continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) have not been examined in regard to sensorimotor oscillatory activities recorded in electroencephalography (EEG). The objective of this study was to investigate the modulatory effect of priming iTBS (cTBS followed by iTBS) delivered to the motor cortex on movement-related and mirror visual feedback (MVF)-induced sensorimotor event-related desynchronization (ERD), compared with iTBS alone, on healthy adults. Twenty participants were randomly allocated into Group 1: priming iTBS—cTBS followed by iTBS, and Group 2: non-priming iTBS—sham cTBS followed by iTBS. The stimulation was delivered to the right primary motor cortex daily for 4 consecutive days. EEG was measured before and after 4 sessions of stimulation. Movement-related ERD was evaluated during left-index finger tapping and MVF-induced sensorimotor ERD was evaluated by comparing the difference between right-index finger tapping with and without MVF. After stimulation, both protocols increased movement-related ERD and MVF-induced sensorimotor ERD in high mu and low beta bands, indicated by significant time effects. A significant interaction effect favoring Group 1 in enhancing movement-related ERD was observed in the high mu band [F<sub>(1,18)</sub> = 4.47, p = 0.049], compared with Group 2. Our experiment suggests that among healthy adults priming iTBS with cTBS delivered to the motor cortex yields similar effects with iTBS alone on enhancing ERD induced by MVF-based observation, while movement-related ERD was more enhanced in the priming iTBS condition, specifically in the high mu band.</p>

<p>Visual attention evolved as an adaptive mechanism allowing us to cope with a rapidly changing environment. It enables the facilitated processing of relevant information, often automatically and governed by implicit motives. However, despite recent advances in understanding the relationship between consciousness and visual attention, the functional scope of unconscious attentional control is still under debate. Here, we present a novel masking paradigm in which volunteers were to distinguish between varying orientations of a briefly presented, masked grating stimulus. Combining signal detection theory and subjective measures of awareness, we show that performance on unaware trials was consistent with visual selection being weighted towards repeated orientations of Gabor patches and reallocated in response to a novel unconsciously processed orientation. This was particularly present in trials in which the prior feature was strongly weighted and only if the novel feature was invisible. Thus, our results provide evidence that invisible orientation stimuli can trigger the reallocation of history-guided visual selection weights.</p>

<p>Introduction: Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) often improves levodopa-responsive gait symptoms, robust therapies for gait dysfunction from Parkinson's disease (PD) remain a major unmet need. Walking speed could represent a simple, integrated tool to assess DBS efficacy but is often not examined systematically or quantitatively during DBS programming. Here we investigate the reliability and functional significance of changes in gait by directional DBS in the subthalamic nucleus.</p><p>Methods: Nineteen patients underwent unilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS surgery with an eight-contact directional lead (1-3-3-1 configuration) in the most severely affected hemisphere. They arrived off dopaminergic medications &gt;12 h preoperatively and for device activation 1 month after surgery. We measured a comfortable walking speed using an instrumented walkway with DBS off and at each of 10 stimulation configurations (six directional contacts, two virtual rings, and two circular rings) at the midpoint of the therapeutic window. Repeated measures of ANOVA contrasted preoperative vs. maximum and minimum walking speeds across DBS configurations during device activation. Intraclass correlation coefficients examined walking speed reliability across the four trials within each DBS configuration. We also investigated whether changes in walking speed related to modification of step length vs. cadence with a one-sample t-test.</p><p>Results: Mean comfortable walking speed improved significantly with DBS on vs. both DBS off and minimum speeds with DBS on (p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Pairwise comparisons showed no significant difference between DBS off and minimum comfortable walking speed with DBS on (p = 1.000). Intraclass correlations were ≥0.949 within each condition. Changes in comfortable walk speed were conferred primarily by changes in step length (p &lt; 0.004).</p><p>Conclusion: Acute assessment of walking speed is a reliable, clinically meaningful measure of gait function during DBS activation. Directional and circular unilateral subthalamic DBS in appropriate configurations elicit acute and clinically significant improvements in gait dysfunction related to PD. Next-generation directional DBS technologies have significant potential to enhance gait by individually tailoring stimulation parameters to optimize efficacy.</p>

<p>The middle longitudinal fascicle (MdLF) is a long, associative white matter tract connecting the superior temporal gyrus (STG) with the parietal and occipital lobe. Previous studies show different cortical terminations, and a possible segmentation pattern of the tract. In this study, we performed a post-mortem white matter dissection of 12 human hemispheres and an in vivo deterministic fiber tracking of 24 subjects acquired from the Human Connectome Project to establish whether a constant organization of fibers exists among the MdLF subcomponents and to acquire anatomical information on each subcomponent. Moreover, two clinical cases of brain tumors impinged on MdLF territories are reported to further discuss the anatomical results in light of previously published data on the functional involvement of this bundle. The main finding is that the MdLF is consistently organized into two layers: an antero-ventral segment (aMdLF) connecting the anterior STG (including temporal pole and planum polare) and the extrastriate lateral occipital cortex, and a posterior-dorsal segment (pMdLF) connecting the posterior STG, anterior transverse temporal gyrus and planum temporale with the superior parietal lobule and lateral occipital cortex. The anatomical connectivity pattern and quantitative differences between the MdLF subcomponents along with the clinical cases reported in this paper support the role of MdLF in high-order functions related to acoustic information. We suggest that pMdLF may contribute to the learning process associated with verbal-auditory stimuli, especially on left side, while aMdLF may play a role in processing/retrieving auditory information already consolidated within the temporal lobe.</p>

<p>Background/Aim: Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (RT), which can reflect the status of the retinal optic nerve cells, may be affected in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are few studies on the correlation of RT of patients with AD (AD-RT) with clinical symptoms of various cognitive domains, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and activities of daily living (ADL). This study is to investigate the relationships between RT and the abovementioned clinical symptoms of AD.</p><p>Methods: A total of 96 patients with AD were included in this study. RT was measured in these patients using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Demographic variables, RT, and clinical symptoms were compared between the normal and the abnormal AD-RT groups. Clinical symptoms, including cognitive symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and ADL, were evaluated using a series of rating scales.</p><p>Results: The relationships between RT and cognitive symptoms scores were analyzed in patients with AD. Reduced RT was found in 54.4% of patients with AD. The average RT, RT of the superior 1/2 quadrant, and RT of the inferior 1/2 quadrant of both eyes were all significantly decreased in the abnormal AD-RT group (p &lt; 0.001). Overall cognitive function and performance in multiple cognitive domains, including memory, language, attention, and executive function, were also significantly impaired in the abnormal AD-RT group (p &lt; 0.05). For lower RT value, the global cognitive function and the performance in multiple cognitive domains were worse. ADL was significantly compromised in patients with AD having lower RT values (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusions: Lower RT value appear to be correlated with cognitive impairment, and RT may be an indicator of cognitive decline in patients with AD. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.</p>

Mutations in the fukutin-related protein (FKRP) cause Walker-Warburg Syndrome (WWS), a severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy. Here we established a WWS human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myogenic model that recapitulates hallmarks of WWS pathology. We used this model to investigate the therapeutic effect of metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway in human WWS. We show that functional recovery of WWS myotubes is promoted not only by ribitol but also its precursor ribose. Moreover, we found that the combination of each of these metabolites with NAD+ results in a synergistic effect, as demonstrated by rescue of α-dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin binding capacity. Mechanistically, we find that FKRP residual enzymatic capacity, characteristic of many recessive FKRP mutations, is required for rescue as supported by functional and structural mutational analysis. These findings provide the rationale for testing ribose/ribitol in combination with NAD+ to treat WWS and other diseases associated with FKRP mutations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/65041">Pervasive duplication of tumor suppressors in Afrotherians during the evolution of large bodies and reduced cancer risk</a></h4>

The risk of developing cancer is correlated with body size and lifespan within species. Between species, however, there is no correlation between cancer and either body size or lifespan, indicating that large, long-lived species have evolved enhanced cancer protection mechanisms. Elephants and their relatives (Proboscideans) are a particularly interesting lineage for the exploration of mechanisms underlying the evolution of augmented cancer resistance because they evolved large bodies recently within a clade of smaller bodied species (Afrotherians). Here, we explore the contribution of gene duplication to body size and cancer risk in Afrotherians. Unexpectedly, we found that tumor suppressor duplication was pervasive in Afrotherian genomes, rather than restricted to Proboscideans. Proboscideans, however, have duplicates in unique pathways that may underlie some aspects of their remarkable anti-cancer cell biology. These data suggest that duplication of tumor suppressor genes facilitated the evolution of increased body size by compensating for decreasing intrinsic cancer risk.

Senescent cells, damaged cells that permanently exit the cell cycle, play important roles in development, tissue homeostasis, and tumorigenesis. Although many of these roles are beneficial in acute responses to stress and damage, the persistent accumulation of senescent cells is associated with many chronic diseases through their proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP expression is linked to DNA damage; however, the mechanisms that control the SASP are incompletely understood. More recently, it has been shown that senescent cells shed fragments of nuclear chromatin into the cytoplasm, so called cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF). Here, we provide an overview of the current evidence linking DNA damage to the SASP through the formation of CCF. We describe mechanisms of CCF generation and their functional role in senescent cells, with emphasis on therapeutic potential.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62852">DNA damage—how and why we age?</a></h4>

Aging is a complex process that results in loss of the ability to reattain homeostasis following stress, leading, thereby, to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Many factors contribute to aging, such as the time-dependent accumulation of macromolecular damage, including DNA damage. The integrity of the nuclear genome is essential for cellular, tissue, and organismal health. DNA damage is a constant threat because nucleic acids are chemically unstable under physiological conditions and vulnerable to attack by endogenous and environmental factors. To combat this, all organisms possess highly conserved mechanisms to detect and repair DNA damage. Persistent DNA damage (genotoxic stress) triggers signaling cascades that drive cells into apoptosis or senescence to avoid replicating a damaged genome. The drawback is that these cancer avoidance mechanisms promote aging. Here, we review evidence that DNA damage plays a causal role in aging. We also provide evidence that genotoxic stress is linked to other cellular processes implicated as drivers of aging, including mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction, altered proteostasis and inflammation. These links between damage to the genetic code and other pillars of aging support the notion that DNA damage could be the root of aging.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62501">Nanoscopic anatomy of dynamic multi-protein complexes at membranes resolved by graphene-induced energy transfer</a></h4>

Insights into the conformational organization and dynamics of proteins complexes at membranes is essential for our mechanistic understanding of numerous key biological processes. Here, we introduce graphene-induced energy transfer (GIET) to probe axial orientation of arrested macromolecules at lipid monolayers. Based on a calibrated distance-dependent efficiency within a dynamic range of 25 nm, we analyzed the conformational organization of proteins and complexes involved in tethering and fusion at the lysosome-like yeast vacuole. We observed that the membrane-anchored Rab7-like GTPase Ypt7 shows conformational reorganization upon interactions with effector proteins. Ensemble and time-resolved single-molecule GIET experiments revealed that the HOPS tethering complex, when recruited via Ypt7 to membranes, is dynamically alternating between a ‘closed’ and an ‘open’ conformation, with the latter possibly interacting with incoming vesicles. Our work highlights GIET as a unique spectroscopic ruler to reveal the axial orientation and dynamics of macromolecular complexes at biological membranes with sub-nanometer resolution.

Environmental contexts and associative learning can inform animals of potential threats, though it is currently unknown how contexts bias defensive transitions. Here we investigated context-dependent flight responses in the Pavlovian serial-compound stimulus (SCS) paradigm. We show here that SCS-evoked flight behavior in male and female rats is dependent on contextual fear. Flight was reduced in the conditioning context after context extinction and could be evoked in a different shock-associated context. Although flight was exclusive to white noise stimuli, it was nonetheless associative insofar as rats that received an equal number of unpaired USs did not show flight-like behavior. Finally, we found that inactivation of either the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) or bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) attenuated both contextual fear and flight responses. This work demonstrates that contextual fear summates with cued and innate fear to drive a high fear state and freeze-to-flight transitions.

Objective Post-stroke depression (PSD) is one of the most frequent psychiatric symptoms after a stroke event. The role of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) associated with PSD in older patients remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the volume and location of white matter microstructure abnormalities among older patients with early-onset PSD. Methods Older ([≥]55 years) patients with acute cerebral infarction and hospitalized in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospitals stroke unit from October 2019 to September 2020 were recruited. Participants were assessed with the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) within three months after the onset of stroke. All patients had MRI scans. The brain images were segmented into four regions via left/right, frontal/dorsal plains. Two WMHs volume detections (visual rating vs. semi-automated WMHs volumetric detection) were employed on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (FLAIR) for each segment. The study then investigated the association between WMHs volume and MADRS score with regression analysis. Results The study included twenty-nine patients with acute stroke. Total WMHs volume and segmented regions were not statistically associated with the MADRS score. However, there was a trend in different WHMs volume of the left anterior segment between depressed and non-depressed groups (t-test 2.058, p = 0.055). Further, demographic and clinical data showed no association with depressive symptoms. Conclusion The volume of WHMs might not contribute to the development of early-onset PSD in older patients. This study showed a potential of a quantitative MRI analysis in clinical practice. Further investigation with a larger group of patients is needed.

Video games have become a ubiquitous part of demographically diverse cultures. Numerous studies have focused on analyzing the cognitive aspects involved in game playing that could help provide an optimal gaming experience level by improving video game design. To this end, we present a framework for classifying the game players expertise level using wearable electroencephalography (EEG) headset. We hypothesize that expert/novice players brain activity is different, which can be classified using the frequency domain features extracted from EEG signals of the game player. A systematic channel reduction approach is presented using a correlation-based attribute evaluation method. This approach identifies two significant EEG channels, i.e., AF3 and P7, from the Emotiv EPOC headsets fourteen channels. The features extracted from these EEG channels contribute the most to the video game players expertise level classification. This finding is validated by performing statistical analysis (t-test) over the extracted features. Moreover, among multiple classifiers used, K-nearest neighbor is the best classifier in classifying the game players expertise level with up to 98.04% classification accuracy.

Flight in birds evolved through patterning of the wings from forelimbs and transition from alternating gait to synchronous flapping. In mammals, the spinal midline guidance molecule ephrin-B3 instructs the wiring that enables limb alternation, and its deletion leads to synchronous hopping gait. Here we show that the ephrin-B3 protein in birds lacks several motifs present in other vertebrates, diminishing its affinity for the EphA4 receptor. The avian ephrin-B3 gene lacks an enhancer that drives midline expression, and is missing in Galliformes. The morphology and wiring at brachial levels of the chick spinal cord resemble those of ephrin-B3 null mice. Importantly, dorsal midline decussation, evident in the mutant mouse, is apparent at the chick brachial level, and is prevented by expression of exogenous ephrin-B3 at the roof plate. Our findings support a role for loss of ephrin-B3 function in shaping the avian brachial spinal cord circuitry and facilitating synchronous wing flapping.

Inferring the structural connectivity from electrophysiological measurements is a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. Directed functional connectivity measures, such as the Generalized Partial Directed Correlation (GPDC), provide estimates of the causal influence between areas. However, such methods have a limitation because their estimates depend on the number of brain regions simultaneously recorded. We analyzed this problem by evaluating the effectiveness of GPDC to estimate the connectivity of a ground-truth, data-constrained computational model of a large-scale mouse cortical network. The model contains 19 cortical areas modeled using spiking neural populations, and directed weights for long-range projections were obtained from a tract-tracing cortical connectome. We show that the GPDC estimates correlate positively with structural connectivity. Moreover, the correlation between structural and directed functional connectivity is comparable even when using only a few cortical areas for GPDC estimation, a typical scenario for electrophysiological recordings. Finally, GPDC measures also provided a measure of the flow of information among cortical areas.

An essential role of the hippocampal region is to integrate information to compute and update representations. How this takes place is highly debated. Many theories hinge on the integration of self-motion signals and the existence of continuous attractor networks (CAN). CAN models hypothesise that neurons coding for navigational correlates - such as position and direction - receive inputs from cells conjunctively coding for position, direction and self-motion. As yet, such conjunctive coding had not been found in the hippocampal region. Here, we report neurons coding for angular and linear velocity, distributed across the medial entorhinal cortex, the presubiculum and the parasubiculum. These self-motion neurons often conjunctively encoded position and/or direction, yet lacked a structured organisation, calling for the revision of current CAN models. These results offer insights as to how linear/angular speed - derivative in time of position/direction - may allow the updating of spatial representations, possibly uncovering a general algorithm to update any representation.

V1 neurons as linear filters supposedly only respond to 1st-order luminance-modulated (LM) stimuli, but not 2nd-order contrast-modulated (CM) ones. To solve this difficulty, filter-rectify-filter models are proposed, in which first-stage filters respond to CM stimulus elements, and the nonlinear-rectified outputs are summed by a second-stage filter for CM stimulus representation. Correspondingly, neurophysiological evidence shows V1/A17 neurons less responsive to CM stimuli than V2/A18 neurons. Here we used two-photon calcium imaging to demonstrate substantial V1 responses to CM gratings with unimodally distributed LM/CM preferences. Moreover, LM responses are suppressed by LM and CM adaptations regardless of orientation, but CM responses are more suppressed by same-orientation LM and CM adaptations than by orthogonal ones. While LM adaptation results agree with the Hubel-Wiesel view of LGN contributions to V1 orientation responses, CM adaptation results, which include both orientation-unspecific and specific components, may suggest similar subcortical contributions plus additional refinement by recurrent intracortical interactions.

Signals of brain electric neuronal activity, either invasively measured or non-invasively estimated, are commonly used for connectivity inference. One popular methodology assumes that the neural dynamics follow a multivariate autoregression, where the autoregressive coefficients represent the couplings among regions. If observation noise is present and ignored, as is common in practice, the estimated couplings are biased, affecting all forms of Granger-causality inference, both in time and in frequency domains. Significant nonsense coupling, i.e., nonsense connectivity, can appear when in reality there is none, since there is always observation noise in two possible forms: measurement noise, and activity from other brain regions due to volume conduction and low spatial resolution. This problem is critical, and is currently not being addressed, calling into question the validity of many Granger-causality reports in the literature. An estimation method that accounts for noise is based on an overdetermined system of high-order multivariate Yule-Walker equations, which give reduced variance estimators for the coupling coefficients of the unobserved signals. Simulation-based comparisons to other published methods are presented, demonstrating its adequate performance. In addition, simulations result are presented for a zero connectivity case with noisy observations, where the new method correctly reports no connectivity while classical analyses (as found in most software packages) report nonsense connectivity. For the sake of reproducible research, the supplementary material includes, in human readable format, all the time series data used here.

Morphological analyses are key outcome assessments for nerve regeneration studies but are historically limited to tissue sections. Novel optical tissue clearing techniques enabling three-dimensional imaging of entire organs at a subcellular resolution have revolutionized morphological studies of the brain. To extend their applicability to experimental nerve repair studies we adapted these techniques to nerves and their motor and sensory targets in rats. The solvent-based protocols rendered harvested peripheral nerves and their target organs transparent within 24 h while preserving tissue architecture and fluorescence. Optical clearing is compatible with conventional laboratory techniques, including retrograde labelling studies, and computational image segmentation, providing fast and precise cell quantitation. Further, optically cleared organs enable three dimensional morphometry at an unprecedented scale including dermatome wide innervation studies, tracing of intramuscular nerve branches or mapping of neurovascular networks. Given their wide-ranging applicability, rapid processing times and low costs, tissue clearing techniques are likely to be a key technology for next-generation nerve repair studies.

Neural mechanisms that arbitrate between integrating and segregating multisensory information are essential for complex scene analysis and for the resolution of the multisensory correspondence problem. However, these mechanisms and their dynamics remain largely unknown, partly because classical models of multisensory integration are static. Here, we used the Multisensory Correlation Detector, a model that provides a good explanatory power for human behavior while incorporating dynamic computations. Participants judged whether sequences of auditory and visual signals originated from the same source (causal inference) or whether one modality was leading the other (temporal order), while being recorded with magnetoencephalography. To test the match between the Multisensory Correlation Detector dynamics and the magnetoencephalographic recordings, we developed a novel dynamic encoding-model approach of electrophysiological activity, which relied on temporal response functions. First, we confirm that the Multisensory Correlation Detector explains causal inference and temporal order patterns well. Second, we found strong fits of brain activity to the two outputs of the Multisensory Correlation Detector in temporo-parietal cortices, a region with known multisensory integrative properties. Finally, we report an asymmetry in the goodness of the fits, which were more reliable during the causal inference than during the temporal order judgment task. Overall, our results suggest the plausible existence of multisensory correlation detectors in the human brain, which explain why and how causal inference is strongly driven by the temporal correlation of multisensory signals.

Periods of sleep and wakefulness can be estimated from wrist-locomotor activity recordings via algorithms that identify periods of relative activity and inactivity. Here, we evaluated the performance of our Munich Actimetry Sleep Detection Algorithm (MASDA). MASDA uses a moving 24-hour-threshold and correlation procedure estimating relatively consolidated periods of sleep and wake. MASDA was validated against sleep logs and polysomnography. Sleep-log validation was performed on 2 field samples collected over 54 and 34 days (median) in 34 adolescents and 28 young adults. Polysomnographic validation was performed on a clinical sample of 23 individuals undergoing 1 night of polysomnography. Epoch-by-epoch analyses were conducted and comparisons of sleep measures via Bland-Altman plots and correlations. Compared with sleep logs, MASDA classified sleep with a median sensitivity of 80% (IQR = 75-86%) and specificity of 91% (87-92%). Mean onset and offset times were highly correlated (r = 0.86-0.91). Compared with polysomnography, MASDA reached a median sensitivity of 92% (85-100%), but low specificity of 33% (10-98%), owing to the low frequency of wake episodes in the nighttime polysomnographic recordings. MASDA overestimated sleep onset (~21 min) and underestimated wake after sleep onset (~26 min), while not performing systematically different from polysomnography in other sleep parameters. These results demonstrate the validity of MASDA to faithfully estimate sleep-wake patterns in field studies. With its good performance across day- and nighttime, it enables analyses of sleep-wake patterns in long recordings performed to assess circadian and sleep regularity and is therefore an excellent objective alternative to sleep logs in field settings.

Lorentzian distributions have been largely employed in statistical mechanics to obtain exact results for heterogeneous systems. Analytic continuation of these results is impossible even for slightly deformed Lorentzian distributions, due to the divergence of all the moments (cumulants). We have solved this problem by introducing a pseudo-cumulants' expansion. This allows us to develop a reduction methodology for heterogeneous spiking neural networks subject to extrinsinc and endogenous noise sources, thus generalizing the mean-field formulation introduced in [E.

The effective development of novel therapies in mouse models of neurological disorders relies on behavioural assessments that provide accurate read-outs of neuronal dysfunction and/or degeneration. We designed an automated behavioural testing system (PiPaw) which integrates an operant lever-pulling task directly into the mouse home-cage. This task is accessible to group-housed mice 24-hours per day, enabling high-throughput longitudinal analysis of forelimb motor learning. Moreover, this design eliminates the need for exposure to novel environments and minimizes experimenter interaction, significantly reducing two of the largest stressors associated with animal behaviour. Mice improved their performance of this task over one week of testing by reducing inter-trial variability of reward-related kinematic parameters (pull amplitude or peak velocity). In addition, mice displayed short-term improvements in reward rate, and a concomitant decrease in movement variability, over the course of brief (&lt;10 minutes) bouts of task engagement. We used this system to assess motor learning in mouse models of the inherited neurodegenerative disorder, Huntington disease (HD). Despite having no baseline differences in task performance, Q175-FDN HD mice were unable to modulate the variability of their movements in order to increase reward on either short or long timescales. Task training was associated with a decrease in the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory activity recorded from striatal medium spiny neurons in the hemisphere contralateral to the trained forelimb in wildtype mice; however, no such changes were observed in Q175-FDN mice. This behavioural screening platform should prove useful for preclinical drug trials towards improved treatments in HD and other neurological disorders.

Background: Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug that has shown lasting positive effects on clinical symptoms and self-reported well-being following a single dose. There has been little research into the long-term effects of psilocybin on brain connectivity in humans. Aims: Evaluate changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) at one-week and threemonths after one psilocybin dose in 10 healthy psychedelic-naive volunteers and explore associations between change in RSFC and related measures. Methods: Participants received 0.2-0.3 mg/kg psilocybin in a controlled setting. Participants completed resting-state fMRI scans at baseline, one-week and three-months post-administration and [11C]Cimbi-36 PET scans at baseline and one-week. We examined changes in within-network, between-network and region-to-region RSFC. We explored associations between changes in RSFC and psilocybin-induced phenomenology as well as changes in psychological measures and neocortex serotonin 2A receptor binding. Results: Psilocybin was well tolerated and produced positive changes in well-being. At one-week only, executive control network (ECN) RSFC was significantly decreased (Cohen's d=-1.73, pFWE=0.010). We observed no other significant changes in RSFC at one-week or three-months, nor changes in region-to-region RSFC. Exploratory analyses indicated that decreased ECN RSFC at one-week predicted increased mindfulness at three-months (r =-0.65 ). Conclusions: These findings in a small cohort indicate that psilocybin affects ECN function within the psychedelic afterglow period. Our findings implicate ECN modulation as mediating psilocybin-induced, long-lasting increases in mindfulness. Although our findings implicate a neural pathway mediating lasting psilocybin effects, it is notable that changes in neuroimaging measures at three-months, when personality changes are observed, remain to be identified. Key words: functional magnetic resonance imaging, resting-state connectivity, executive control network, psilocybin, psychedelic, mindfulness

Microstructural changes in the middle brain.

Abstract
A recent randomized controlled trial in young patients with long‐term post‐concussion symptoms showed that a novel behavioral intervention “Get going After concussIoN” is superior to enhanced usual care in terms of symptom reduction. It is unknown whether these interventional effects are associated with microstructural brain changes. The aim of this study was to examine whether diffusion‐weighted MRI indices, which are sensitive to the interactions between cellular structures and water molecules' Brownian motion, respond differently to the interventions of the above‐mentioned trial and whether such differences correlate with the improvement of post‐concussion symptoms. Twenty‐three patients from the intervention group (mean age 22.8, 18 females) and 19 patients from the control group (enhanced usual care) (mean age 23.9, 14 females) were enrolled. The primary outcome measure was the mean kurtosis tensor, which is sensitive to the microscopic complexity of brain tissue. The mean kurtosis tensor was significantly increased in the intervention group (p = 0.003) in the corpus callosum but not in the thalamus (p = 0.78) and the hippocampus (p = 0.34). An increase in mean kurtosis tensor in the corpus callosum tended to be associated with a reduction in symptoms, but this association did not reach significance (p = 0.059). Changes in diffusion tensor imaging metrics did not differ between intervention groups and were not associated with symptoms. The current study found different diffusion‐weighted MRI responses from the microscopic cellular structures of the corpus callosum between patients receiving a novel behavioral intervention and patients receiving enhanced usual care. Correlations with improvement of post‐concussion symptoms were not evident.

iTBS has a stronger decision promoting effect than 20 Hz, which can be used as an effective way to alter choice and presents an improvement on standard rTMS protocols.

Abstract
Traditional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can only produce a significant but weak effect on the cortex while theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned accelerated form of stimulation, can produce a stronger poststimulation effect, which may improve decision‐making abilities. We designed a comparative assessment of the effect of intermittent TBS (iTBS), 20 Hz, in two risk decision‐making tasks on healthy controls. Participants were randomized and assigned to the iTBS (n = 29), 20 Hz (n = 29), or sham (n = 29) groups. The effects of the different methods of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation on risk decision‐making functions were compared based on subjects’ performance in the Game of Dice Task (GDT) and Risky Gains Task (RGT). The main indicators were positive and negative feedback utilization rates of GDT and RGT. Both iTBS and 20 Hz stimulation resulted in significant improvements upon negative feedback in the GDT, with increases in safe options and reductions in risky options; iTBS stimulation increased subjects’ use of positive feedback in the GDT and RGT (all p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the iTBS group had a stronger feedback risk reduction effect than the 20 Hz or sham group following RGT negative feedback (p &lt; 0.05). Individuals would integrate positive and negative information more efficiently, leading to them making rational choices after excitatory transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, iTBS has a stronger risk reduction effect following negative feedback than the 20Hz stimulation did. In summary, iTBS might have clinical value in decision promotion.

Axonal mitochondrial size correlates with g‐ratio during homeostasis in multiple species and during advanced remyelination. But not during early remyelination. Oligodendrocyte mitochondria function influence myelin thickness which influence axonal mitochondria size.

Abstract
Demyelinating pathology is common in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease and results in axonal energy deficiency, dysfunctional axonal propagation, and neurodegeneration. During myelin repair and also during myelin homeostasis, mutual regulative processes between axons and myelin sheaths are known to be essential. However, proficient tools are lacking to characterize axon‐myelin interdependence during (re)myelination. Thus, we herein investigated adaptions in myelin sheath g‐ratio as a proxy for myelin thickness and axon metabolic status during homeostasis and myelin repair, by using axonal mitochondrial size as a proxy for axonal metabolic status. We found that axons with thinner myelin sheaths had larger axonal mitochondria; this was true for across different central nervous system tracts as well as across species, including humans. The link between myelin sheath thickness and mitochondrial size was temporarily absent during demyelination but reestablished during advanced remyelination, as shown in two commonly used animal models of toxic demyelination. By further exploring this association in mice with either genetically induced mitochondrial or myelin dysfunction, we show that axonal mitochondrial size adjusts in response to the thickness of the myelin sheath but not vice versa. This pinpoints the relevance of mitochondrial adaptation upon myelin repair and might open a new therapeutic window for remyelinating therapies.

Endocannabinoids (eCBs) elicit inhibitory modulation of synaptic transmission at various brain sites. We now show that neither a CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN55212 nor an eCB affect GABA release from axon terminals of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) making synaptic contacts with their target neurons, globular cells in the cerebellar cortex and principal neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei. The finding is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic modulation, suggesting that the synapse type‐selective action of eCBs in the cerebellar neural circuitry allows the precise control of motor coordination and learning associated with the cerebellum.

Abstract
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) act as ubiquitous modulators of synaptic transmission via the activation of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) make strong inhibitory synaptic contacts not only with neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) but also with Lugaro cells and globular cells, whose cell bodies are located underneath the PC layer. However, little is known about the modulatory actions of eCBs on GABA release from PC axon terminals. Here, we examined the effects of eCBs on the GABAergic transmission at PC‐globular cell synapses and PC‐large DCN neuron synapses electrophysiologically using mouse cerebellar slices. We showed that the types 1 and 2 CBR agonist WIN55212 did not affect either spontaneous or miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in globular cells under control conditions and in a state of enhanced synaptic activity. By contrast, another Gi/o protein‐coupled receptor agonist, baclofen, significantly reduced the miniature IPSC frequency in globular cells. WIN55212 had no effects on IPSCs in large DCN neurons. A type 2 CBR agonist, HU308, also had no effects on IPSCs in either globular cells or large DCN neurons. Moreover, the PCs' target neurons did not elicit depolarization‐induced suppression of inhibition. These results suggest the lack of a functional role of CBRs at PCs' axon terminals. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic inhibitory modulation. The actions of eCBs are selective to distinct synapses and possibly contribute to information processes and rigorous signal transmission in the cerebellum.

Following permanent right middle cerebral artery occlusion, we measured plasmin activity in mouse brain slices utilizing a novel direct method. Positive correlation between plasmin level and infarct volume was found and demonstrated by a representative tetrazolium chloride staining of slice no. 6. Scale bars: 1 mm.

Abstract
Many coagulation factor proteases are increased in the brain during ischemic stroke. One of these proteases is plasmin. In this study we established a novel method for direct quantitative measurement of plasmin activity in male mouse brain slices using a sensitive fluorescent substrate in the presence of specific protease inhibitors. In both the ischemic and contralateral hemispheres, plasmin activity increased 3, 6, and 24 hr following stroke in comparison to healthy mice (F(3, 72) = 39.5, p &lt; 0.0001, repeated measures ANOVA) after the induction of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAo). Plasmin activity was higher in the ischemic hemisphere (F(1,36) = 9.1, p = 0.005) and there was a significant interaction between time and ischemic hemisphere (F(3,36) = 4.4, p = 0.009). Plasmin activity was correlated with infarct volume (R2 = 0.5289, p = 0.0009 by Spearman). The specificity of the assay was verified utilizing tissue‐type plasminogen activator (tPA)‐deficient mice which, as expected, had significantly lower levels of plasmin 24 hr following ischemia compared to wild‐type mice (ischemic (0.6 ± 0.23 and 1.94 ± 0.5, respectively), p = 0.049 and contralateral hemispheres (0.13 ± 0.14 and 0.75 ± 0.10, respectively), p = 0.018 by t test). There is a time‐dependent increase in plasmin levels and an association of higher levels of plasmin with larger infarct volumes in an experimental stroke model. This suggests caution in the use of recombinant tPA (rtPA) and that plasmin inhibition in the brain may be a therapeutic target in acute ischemic stroke.

We find that the levels of the m6A methylase Mettl3 are upregulated following spinal cord injury (SCI) in both zebrafish and mice. Additionally, Mettl3 disruption leads to poor motor function recovery in zebrafish SCI.

Abstract
RNA methylation is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of RNA methylation in spinal cord regeneration has not been reported. In this study, we find an altered m6A (N6‐methyladenosine) RNA methylation profiling following zebrafish spinal cord injury (SCI), in line with an altered transcription level of the m6A methylase Mettl3. Interestingly, many of the differential m6A‐tagged genes associated with neural regeneration are hypomethylated, but their transcription levels are upregulated in SCI. Moreover, we find that METTL3 may be important for spinal cord regeneration. We also show a conserved feature of METTL3 changes in mouse SCI model, in which the expression of METTL3 is increased in both astrocytes and neural stem cells. Together, our results indicate that m6A RNA methylation is dynamic and conserved following SCI and may contribute to spinal cord regeneration.

Graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in brain networks that may be missed by regional comparisons. The present study found evidence that compensatory network reorganization likely occurs in a frontal dopamine D2 receptor network to preserve cognitive function in Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive impairment. 

Abstract
Cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common sequela of the disorder that has a large impact on patient well‐being. Its physiological etiology, however, remains elusive. Our study used graph theory analysis to investigate the large‐scale topological patterns of the extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptor network. We used positron emission tomography with [11C]FLB‐457 to measure the binding potential of cortical dopamine D2 receptors in two networks: the meso‐cortical dopamine network and the meso‐limbic dopamine network. We also investigated the application of partial volume effect correction (PVEC) in conjunction with graph theory analysis. Three groups were investigated in this study divided according to their cognitive status as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, with a score ≤25 considered cognitively impaired: (a) healthy controls (n = 13, 11 female), (b) cognitively unimpaired PD patients (PD‐CU, n = 13, 5 female), and (c) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD‐MCI, n = 17, 4 female). In the meso‐cortical network, we observed increased small‐worldness, normalized clustering, and local efficiency in the PD‐CU group compared to the PD‐MCI group, as well as a hub shift in the PD‐MCI group. Compensatory reorganization of the meso‐cortical dopamine D2 receptor network may be responsible for some of the cognitive preservation observed in PD‐CU. These results were found without PVEC applied and PVEC proved detrimental to the graph theory analysis. Overall, our findings demonstrate how graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in the brain that would otherwise be missed by regional comparisons of receptor density.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamine synthetase (GS), ALDH1L1, and SOX9 stained different percentages of cortical and spinal cord astrocytes in vitro. SOX9 in cortical and ALDH1L1 in spinal cord cultures consistently stained astrocytes in naïve and transforming growth factor‐β‐treated cultures.

Abstract
Astrocytes are responsible for a wide variety of essential functions throughout the central nervous system. The protein markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamate transporter‐1 (GLT‐1), glutamine synthetase (GS), 10‐formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (ALDH1L1), and the transcription factor SOX9 are routinely used to label astrocytes in primary rodent cultures. However, GLAST, GLT‐1, GS, and SOX9 are also produced by microglia and oligodendrocytes and GFAP, GLAST, GLT‐1, and GS production levels are affected by astrocyte phenotypic changes associated with reactive astrogliosis. No group has performed a comprehensive immunocytochemical evaluation to quantify the percentage of cells labeled by these markers in vitro, nor compared changes in staining between cortex‐ and spinal cord‐derived cells in naïve and stimulated cultures. Here, we quantified the percentage of cells positively stained for these six markers in astrocyte, microglia, and oligodendrocyte cultures isolated from neonatal rat cortices and spinal cords. Additionally, we incubated the astrocytes with transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β1 or TGF‐β3 to determine if the labeling of these markers is altered by these stimuli. We found that only SOX9 in cortical cultures and ALDH1L1 in spinal cord cultures labeled more than 75% of the cells in naïve and stimulated astrocyte cultures and stained less than 5% of the cells in microglia and oligodendrocyte cultures. Furthermore, significantly more cortical than spinal cord astrocytes stained for GFAP, GLAST, and ALDH1L1 in naïve cultures, whereas significantly more spinal cord than cortical astrocytes stained for GLAST and GS in TGF‐β1‐treated cultures. These findings are important as variability in marker staining may lead to misinterpretation of the astrocyte response in cocultures, migration assays, or engineered disease models.

Abstract
The cornea is the most innervated tissue in the human body. Myelinated axons upon inserting into the peripheral corneal stroma lose their myelin sheaths and continue into the central cornea wrapped by only nonmyelinating corneal Schwann cells (nm‐cSCs). This anatomical organization is believed to be important for central vision. Here we employed single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq), microscopy, and transgenics to characterize these nm‐cSCs of the central cornea. Using principal component analysis, uniform manifold approximation and projection, and unsupervised hierarchal cell clustering of scRNA‐seq data derived from central corneal cells of male rabbits, we successfully identified several clusters representing different corneal cell types, including a unique cell cluster representing nm‐cSCs. To confirm protein expression of cSC genes, we performed cross‐species validation, employing corneal whole‐mount immunostaining with confocal microscopy in mouse corneas. The expression of several representative proteins of nm‐cSCs were validated. As the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene was also expressed in nm‐cSCs, we explored the Plp1‐eGFP transgenic reporter mouse line to visualize cSCs. Specific and efficient eGFP expression was observed in cSCs in adult mice of different ages. Of several putative cornea‐specific SC genes identified, Dickkopf‐related protein 1 was shown to be present in nm‐cSCs. Taken together, our findings, for the first time, identify important insights and tools toward the study nm‐cSCs in isolated tissue and adult animals. We expect that our results will advance the future study of nm‐cSCs in applications of nerve repair, and provide a resource for the study of corneal sensory function.

All neurons possess a primary cilium that projects from the cell body into the extracellular space. This study investigates the behavioral responses of mice engineered to lack a primary cilium on either Gad2 expressing GABAergic neurons, or Dopaminergic neurons, to injections of amphetamine.

Abstract
The neural mechanisms that underlie responses to drugs of abuse are complex, and impacted by a number of neuromodulatory peptides. Within the past 10 years it has been discovered that several of the receptors for neuromodulators are enriched in the primary cilia of neurons. Primary cilia are microtubule‐based organelles that project from the surface of nearly all mammalian cells, including neurons. Despite what we know about cilia, our understanding of how cilia regulate neuronal function and behavior is still limited. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the contributions of primary cilia on specific neuronal populations to behavioral responses to amphetamine. To test the consequences of cilia loss on amphetamine‐induced locomotor activity we selectively ablated cilia from dopaminergic or GAD2‐GABAergic neurons in mice. Cilia loss had no effect on baseline locomotion in either mouse strain. In mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons, locomotor activity compared to wild‐ type mice was reduced in both sexes in response to acute administration of 3.0 mg/kg amphetamine. In contrast, changes in the locomotor response to amphetamine in mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons were primarily driven by reductions in locomotor activity in males. Following repeated amphetamine administration (1.0 mg kg−1 day−1 over 5 days), mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons exhibited enhanced sensitization of the locomotor stimulant response to the drug, whereas mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons did not differ from wild‐type controls. These results indicate that cilia play neuron‐specific roles in both acute and neuroplastic responses to psychostimulant drugs of abuse.

Abstract
Without protective and/or therapeutic agents the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 is quickly spreading worldwide. It has surprising transmissibility potential, since it could infect all ages, gender, and human sectors. It attacks respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, hepatic, and endovascular systems and can reach the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) through known and unknown mechanisms. The reports on the neurological manifestations and complications of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are increasing exponentially. Herein, we enumerate seven candidate routes, which the mature or immature SARS‐CoV‐2 components could use to reach the CNS and PNS, utilizing the within‐body cross talk between organs. The majority of SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients suffer from some neurological manifestations (e.g., confusion, anosmia, and ageusia). It seems that although the mature virus did not reach the CNS or PNS of the majority of patients, its unassembled components and/or the accompanying immune‐mediated responses may be responsible for the observed neurological symptoms. The viral particles and/or its components have been specifically documented in endothelial cells of lung, kidney, skin, and CNS. This means that the blood–endothelial barrier may be considered as the main route for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the nervous system, with the barrier disruption being more logical than barrier permeability, as evidenced by postmortem analyses.

Abstract
Preterm birth is a global public health problem. A large number of preterm infants survive with preterm white matter injury (PWMI), which leads to neurological deficits, and has multifaceted etiology, clinical course, monitoring, and outcomes. The principal upstream insults leading to PWMI initiation are hypoxia‐ischemia and infection and/or inflammation and the key target cells are late oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Current PWMI treatments are mainly supportive, and thus have little effect in terms of protecting the immature brain or repairing injury to improve long‐term outcomes. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells comprise abundant immunomodulatory and stem cells, which have the potential to reduce brain injury, mainly due to anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory mechanisms, and also through their release of neurotrophic or growth factors to promote endogenous neurogenesis. In this review, we briefly summarize PWMI pathogenesis and pathophysiology, and the specific properties of different cell types in UCB. We further explore the potential mechanism by which UCB can be used to treat PWMI, and discuss the advantages of and potential issues related to UCB cell therapy. Finally, we suggest potential future studies of UCB cell therapy in preterm infants.

By using targeted metabolomics methods, the differential metabolites of hippocampal tissues of triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and wild‐type mice at an early age and the pathogenesis associated with these metabolites were obtained.

Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a serious neurodegenerative disease in people of age 65 or above. The detailed etiology and pathogenesis of AD have not been elucidated yet. In this study, the hippocampi of 2‐ and 6‐month‐old triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease male mice and age–sex‐matched wild‐type (WT) mice were analyzed by using targeted metabolomics approach. Compared with WT mice, 24 and 60 metabolites were found with significant differences in 2‐ and 6‐month‐old AD mice. Among these, 14 metabolites were found common while 10 metabolites showed consistent variable trends in both groups. These differential metabolites are found associated with amino acid, lipid, vitamin, nucleotide‐related base, neurotransmitter and energy metabolisms, and oxidative stress. The results suggest that these differential metabolites might play a critical role in AD pathophysiology, and may serve as potential biomarkers for AD. Moreover, the results highlight the involvement of abnormal purine, pyrimidine, arginine, and proline metabolism, along with glycerophospholipid metabolism in early pathology of AD. For the first time, several differential metabolites are found to be associated with AD in this study. Targeted metabolomics can be used for rapid and accurate quantitative analysis of specific target metabolites associated with AD.

Activation of TRPV4 inhibited IK through activating CaMKII in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and decreased the expression of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 in hippocampi.

TRPV4‐induced decrease of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 expression and IK may be involved in the pathological changes following PISE.










Abstract
Activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) can increase hippocampal neuronal excitability. TRPV4 has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Voltage‐gated potassium channels (VGPCs) play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and abnormal VGPCs expression or function is related to epilepsy. Here, we examined the effect of TRPV4 activation on the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and on the Kv subunits expression in male mice. We also explored the role of TRPV4 in changes in Kv subunits expression in male mice following pilocarpine‐induced status epilepticus (PISE). Application of TRPV4 agonists, GSK1016790A and 5,6‐EET, markedly reduced IK in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and shifted the voltage‐dependent inactivation curve to the hyperpolarizing direction. GSK1016790A‐ and 5,6‐EET‐induced inhibition of IK was blocked by TRPV4 specific antagonists, HC‐067047 and RN1734. GSK1016790A‐induced inhibition of IK was markedly attenuated by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase II (CaMKII) antagonist. Application of GSK1016790A for up to 1 hr did not change the hippocampal protein levels of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or Kv2.1. Intracerebroventricular injection of GSK1016790A for 3 d reduced the hippocampal protein levels of Kv1.2 and Kv2.1, leaving that of Kv1.1 unchanged. Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 protein levels as well as IK reduced markedly in hippocampi on day 3 post PISE, which was significantly reversed by HC‐067047. We conclude that activation of TRPV4 inhibits IK in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, possibly by activating CaMKII. TRPV4‐induced decrease in Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 expression and IK may be involved in the pathological changes following PISE.

Standard phase lag index (standard‐PLI) and offset‐PLI (insensitive and sensitive to zero‐lag connectivity, respectively) for pairs of electrodes separated by more than 105 mm plotted against their homotopic distance. Significant connectivity (dots above the red‐dashed line) is found only between homotopic regions and mostly for zero‐lag connectivity (offset‐PLI).

Abstract
Whether neuronal populations exhibit zero‐lag (in‐phase or in‐antiphase) functional connectivity is a fundamental question when conceptualizing communication between cell assemblies. It also has profound implications on how we assess such interactions. Given that the brain is a delayed network due to the finite conduction velocity of the electrical impulses traveling across its fibers, the existence of long‐distance zero‐lag functional connectivity may be considered improbable. However, in this study, using human intracranial recordings we demonstrate that most interhemispheric connectivity between homotopic cerebral regions is zero‐lagged and that this type of connectivity is ubiquitous. Volume conduction can be safely discarded as a confounding factor since it is known to drop almost completely within short interelectrode distances (&lt;20 mm) in intracranial recordings. This finding should guide future electrophysiological connectivity studies and highlight the importance of considering the role of zero‐lag connectivity in our understanding of communication between cell assemblies.

The synaptic circuitry of primary sensory thalamic nuclei has been well characterized and shows striking similarities both in terminal morphology and chemical characteristics. The exception to this is the taste thalamus, the VPMP. A past study of synaptic circuitry in the rat taste thalamus (VPMpc) revealed marked differences from other nuclei like the LGN and MGN. Our data demonstrate that the tree shrew VPMP shares synaptic characteristics common to primary sensory thalamic nuclei including presynaptic interneuron dendrites, large VGluT2 positive terminals, and triadic arrangements in glomeruli.







Abstract
Ventroposterior medialis parvocellularis (VPMP) nucleus of the primate thalamus receives direct input from the nucleus of the solitary tract, whereas the homologous thalamic structure in the rodent does not. To reveal whether the synaptic circuitries in these nuclei lend evidence for conservation of design principles in the taste thalamus across species or across sensory thalamus in general, we characterized the ultrastructural and molecular properties of the VPMP in a close relative of primates, the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), and compared these to known properties of the taste thalamus in rodent, and the visual thalamus in mammals. Electron microscopy analysis to categorize the synaptic inputs in the VPMP revealed that the largest‐size terminals contained many vesicles and formed large synaptic zones with thick postsynaptic density on multiple, medium‐caliber dendrite segments. Some formed triads within glomerular arrangements. Smaller‐sized terminals contained dark mitochondria; most formed a single asymmetric or symmetric synapse on small‐diameter dendrites. Immuno‐EM experiments revealed that the large‐size terminals contained VGLUT2, whereas the small‐size terminal populations contained VGLUT1 or ChAT. These findings provide evidence that the morphological and molecular characteristics of synaptic circuitry in the tree shrew VPMP are similar to that in nonchemical sensory thalamic nuclei. Furthermore, the results indicate that all primary sensory nuclei of the thalamus in higher mammals share a structural template for processing thalamocortical sensory information. In contrast, substantial morphological and molecular differences in rodent versus tree shrew taste nuclei suggest a fundamental divergence in cellular processing mechanisms of taste input in these two species.

Abstract
Important interactions between memory and decision‐making processes are required to maintain high‐levels of spatial working memory task performance. Past research reveals that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC) are both vital structures involved in these processes. Recent evidence suggests that interactions between these two structures are dynamic and task dependent. However, there exists uncertainty surrounding the specific conditions that recruit mPFC contributions to these tasks, specifically regarding its role in retaining information online during delay periods. To address this issue, we tested rats on a spatial‐delayed alternation task in which we utilized a closed‐loop optogenetic system to transiently disrupt mPFC activity during different task epochs (delay, choice, return). By analyzing the effects of mPFC disruption on choice accuracy and a deliberative behavior known as vicarious‐trial‐and‐error (VTE), our study revealed several interesting findings regarding the role of the mPFC in spatial‐working memory tasks. The main findings include: (a) choice accuracy in the spatial‐delayed alternation (SDA) task was impaired when the mPFC was disrupted during the choice epoch and not delay or return epochs, (b) mPFC disruption resulted in a non‐epoch specific reduction in VTE occurrence which correlated with impairments in task performance. Taken together, findings from this study suggest that, during spatial decision‐making, contributions made by the mPFC are specific to points of deliberation and choice (not delay), and that VTEs are a deliberative behavior which relies on intact mPFC function.

Computational methods for protein structure modelling are routinely used to complement experimental structure determination, thus they help to address a broad spectrum of scientific questions in biomedical research. The most accurate methods today are based on homology modelling, i.e. detecting a homologue to the desired target sequence that can be used as a template for modelling. Here we present a versatile open source homology modelling toolbox as foundation for flexible and computationally efficient modelling workflows. ProMod3 is a fully scriptable software platform that can perform all steps required to generate a protein model by homology. Its modular design aims at fast prototyping of novel algorithms and implementing flexible modelling pipelines. Common modelling tasks, such as loop modelling, sidechain modelling or generating a full protein model by homology, are provided as production ready pipelines, forming the starting point for own developments and enhancements. ProMod3 is the central software component of the widely used SWISS-MODEL web-server.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/97Mrsj-avHY" width="1" />

Departures of normal blood flow and metabolite distribution from the cerebral microvasculature into neuronal tissue have been implicated with age-related neurodegeneration. Mathematical models informed by spatially and temporally distributed neuroimage data are becoming instrumental for reconstructing a coherent picture of normal and pathological oxygen delivery throughout the brain. Unfortunately, current mathematical models of cerebral blood flow and oxygen exchange become excessively large in size. They further suffer from boundary effects due to incomplete or physiologically inaccurate computational domains, numerical instabilities due to enormous length scale differences, and convergence problems associated with condition number deterioration at fine mesh resolutions. Our proposed simple finite volume discretization scheme for blood and oxygen microperfusion simulations does not require expensive mesh generation leading to the critical benefit that it drastically reduces matrix size and bandwidth of the coupled oxygen transfer problem. The compact problem formulation yields rapid and stable convergence. Moreover, boundary effects can effectively be suppressed by generating very large replica of the cortical microcirculation <i>in silico</i> using an image-based cerebrovascular network synthesis algorithm, so that boundaries of the perfusion simulations are far removed from the regions of interest. Massive simulations over sizeable portions of the cortex with feature resolution down to the micron scale become tractable with even modest computer resources. The feasibility and accuracy of the novel method is demonstrated and validated with <i>in vivo</i> oxygen perfusion data in cohorts of young and aged mice. Our oxygen exchange simulations quantify steep gradients near penetrating blood vessels and point towards pathological changes that might cause neurodegeneration in aged brains. This research aims to explain mechanistic interactions between anatomical structures and how they might change in diseases or with age. Rigorous quantification of age-related changes is of significant interest because it might aide in the search for imaging biomarkers for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/64hQmuiH4h0" width="1" />

<p>by Johannes Friedrich, Andrea Giovannucci, Eftychios A. Pnevmatikakis</p>

<i>In vivo</i> calcium imaging through microendoscopic lenses enables imaging of neuronal populations deep within the brains of freely moving animals. Previously, a constrained matrix factorization approach (CNMF-E) has been suggested to extract single-neuronal activity from microendoscopic data. However, this approach relies on offline batch processing of the entire video data and is demanding both in terms of computing and memory requirements. These drawbacks prevent its applicability to the analysis of large datasets and closed-loop experimental settings. Here we address both issues by introducing two different online algorithms for extracting neuronal activity from streaming microendoscopic data. Our first algorithm, OnACID-E, presents an online adaptation of the CNMF-E algorithm, which dramatically reduces its memory and computation requirements. Our second algorithm proposes a convolution-based background model for microendoscopic data that enables even faster (real time) processing. Our approach is modular and can be combined with existing online motion artifact correction and activity deconvolution methods to provide a highly scalable pipeline for microendoscopic data analysis. We apply our algorithms on four previously published typical experimental datasets and show that they yield similar high-quality results as the popular offline approach, but outperform it with regard to computing time and memory requirements. They can be used instead of CNMF-E to process pre-recorded data with boosted speeds and dramatically reduced memory requirements. Further, they newly enable online analysis of live-streaming data even on a laptop.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbzP7cZysSc" width="1" />

<p>by Oleksandr Sorochynskyi, Stéphane Deny, Olivier Marre, Ulisse Ferrari</p>

A major goal in neuroscience is to understand how populations of neurons code for stimuli or actions. While the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously is increasing at a fast pace, in most cases these recordings cannot access a complete population: some neurons that carry relevant information remain unrecorded. In particular, it is hard to simultaneously record all the neurons of the same type in a given area. Recent progress have made possible to profile each recorded neuron in a given area thanks to genetic and physiological tools, and to pool together recordings from neurons of the same type across different experimental sessions. However, it is unclear how to infer the activity of a full population of neurons of the same type from these sequential recordings. Neural networks exhibit collective behaviour, e.g. noise correlations and synchronous activity, that are not directly captured by a conditionally-independent model that would just put together the spike trains from sequential recordings. Here we show that we can infer the activity of a full population of retina ganglion cells from sequential recordings, using a novel method based on copula distributions and maximum entropy modeling. From just the spiking response of each ganglion cell to a repeated stimulus, and a few pairwise recordings, we could predict the noise correlations using copulas, and then the full activity of a large population of ganglion cells of the same type using maximum entropy modeling. Remarkably, we could generalize to predict the population responses to different stimuli with similar light conditions and even to different experiments. We could therefore use our method to construct a very large population merging cells’ responses from different experiments. We predicted that synchronous activity in ganglion cell populations saturates only for patches larger than 1.5mm in radius, beyond what is today experimentally accessible.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7wrZDCq4TQs" width="1" />

<p>by Marco Aqil, Selen Atasoy, Morten L. Kringelbach, Rikkert Hindriks</p>

Tools from the field of graph signal processing, in particular the graph Laplacian operator, have recently been successfully applied to the investigation of structure-function relationships in the human brain. The eigenvectors of the human connectome graph Laplacian, dubbed “connectome harmonics”, have been shown to relate to the functionally relevant resting-state networks. Whole-brain modelling of brain activity combines structural connectivity with local dynamical models to provide insight into the large-scale functional organization of the human brain. In this study, we employ the graph Laplacian and its properties to define and implement a large class of neural activity models directly on the human connectome. These models, consisting of systems of stochastic integrodifferential equations on graphs, are dubbed <i>graph neural fields</i>, in analogy with the well-established continuous neural fields. We obtain analytic predictions for harmonic and temporal power spectra, as well as functional connectivity and coherence matrices, of graph neural fields, with a technique dubbed CHAOSS (shorthand for <i>Connectome-Harmonic Analysis Of Spatiotemporal Spectra</i>). Combining graph neural fields with appropriate observation models allows for estimating model parameters from experimental data as obtained from electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As an example application, we study a stochastic Wilson-Cowan graph neural field model on a high-resolution connectome graph constructed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and structural MRI data. We show that the model equilibrium fluctuations can reproduce the empirically observed harmonic power spectrum of resting-state fMRI data, and predict its functional connectivity, with a high level of detail. Graph neural fields natively allow the inclusion of important features of cortical anatomy and fast computations of observable quantities for comparison with multimodal empirical data. They thus appear particularly suitable for modelling whole-brain activity at mesoscopic scales, and opening new potential avenues for connectome-graph-based investigations of structure-function relationships.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_L_aix2QVJg" width="1" />

<p>by Adil Alsiyabi, Ariadna Gonzalez Solis, Edgar B. Cahoon, Rajib Saha</p>

Sphingolipids are a vital component of plant cellular endomembranes and carry out multiple functional and regulatory roles. Different sphingolipid species confer rigidity to the membrane structure, facilitate trafficking of secretory proteins, and initiate programmed cell death. Although the regulation of the sphingolipid pathway is yet to be uncovered, increasing evidence has pointed to orosomucoid proteins (ORMs) playing a major regulatory role and potentially interacting with a number of components in the pathway, including both enzymes and sphingolipids. However, experimental exploration of new regulatory interactions is time consuming and often infeasible. In this work, a computational approach was taken to address this challenge. A metabolic network of the sphingolipid pathway in plants was reconstructed. The steady-state rates of reactions in the network were then determined through measurements of growth and cellular composition of the different sphingolipids in Arabidopsis seedlings. The Ensemble modeling framework was modified to accurately account for activation mechanisms and subsequently used to generate sets of kinetic parameters that converge to the measured steady-state fluxes in a thermodynamically consistent manner. In addition, the framework was appended with an additional module to automate screening the parameters and to output models consistent with previously reported network responses to different perturbations. By analyzing the network’s response in the presence of different combinations of regulatory mechanisms, the model captured the experimentally observed repressive effect of ORMs on serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). Furthermore, predictions point to a second regulatory role of ORM proteins, namely as an activator of class II (or LOH1 and LOH3) ceramide synthases. This activating role was found to be modulated by the concentration of free ceramides, where an accumulation of these sphingolipid species dampened the activating effect of ORMs on ceramide synthase. The predictions pave the way for future guided experiments and have implications in engineering crops with higher biotic stress tolerance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tZW9gJ9j7K8" width="1" />

Mathematical models of metabolic networks utilize simulation to study system-level mechanisms and functions. Various approaches have been used to model the steady state behavior of metabolic networks using genome-scale reconstructions, but formulating dynamic models from such reconstructions continues to be a key challenge. Here, we present the Mass Action Stoichiometric Simulation Python (MASSpy) package, an open-source computational framework for dynamic modeling of metabolism. MASSpy utilizes mass action kinetics and detailed chemical mechanisms to build dynamic models of complex biological processes. MASSpy adds dynamic modeling tools to the COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Python (COBRApy) package to provide an unified framework for constraint-based and kinetic modeling of metabolic networks. MASSpy supports high-performance dynamic simulation through its implementation of libRoadRunner: the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) simulation engine. Three examples are provided to demonstrate how to use MASSpy: (1) a validation of the MASSpy modeling tool through dynamic simulation of detailed mechanisms of enzyme regulation; (2) a feature demonstration using a workflow for generating ensemble of kinetic models using Monte Carlo sampling to approximate missing numerical values of parameters and to quantify biological uncertainty, and (3) a case study in which MASSpy is utilized to overcome issues that arise when integrating experimental data with the computation of functional states of detailed biological mechanisms. MASSpy represents a powerful tool to address challenges that arise in dynamic modeling of metabolic networks, both at small and large scales.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/32Dat5YWkCs" width="1" />

<p>by Samhita P. Banavar, Michael Trogdon, Brian Drawert, Tau-Mu Yi, Linda R. Petzold, Otger Campàs</p>

Many cellular processes require cell polarization to be maintained as the cell changes shape, grows or moves. Without feedback mechanisms relaying information about cell shape to the polarity molecular machinery, the coordination between cell polarization and morphogenesis, movement or growth would not be possible. Here we theoretically and computationally study the role of a genetically-encoded mechanical feedback (in the Cell Wall Integrity pathway) as a potential coordination mechanism between cell morphogenesis and polarity during budding yeast mating projection growth. We developed a coarse-grained continuum description of the coupled dynamics of cell polarization and morphogenesis as well as 3D stochastic simulations of the molecular polarization machinery in the evolving cell shape. Both theoretical approaches show that in the absence of mechanical feedback (or in the presence of weak feedback), cell polarity cannot be maintained at the projection tip during growth, with the polarization cap wandering off the projection tip, arresting morphogenesis. In contrast, for mechanical feedback strengths above a threshold, cells can robustly maintain cell polarization at the tip and simultaneously sustain mating projection growth. These results indicate that the mechanical feedback encoded in the Cell Wall Integrity pathway can provide important positional information to the molecular machinery in the cell, thereby enabling the coordination of cell polarization and morphogenesis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5mkWl042d4s" width="1" />

<p>by Jonas Béal, Lorenzo Pantolini, Vincent Noël, Emmanuel Barillot, Laurence Calzone</p>

The study of response to cancer treatments has benefited greatly from the contribution of different omics data but their interpretation is sometimes difficult. Some mathematical models based on prior biological knowledge of signaling pathways, facilitate this interpretation but often require fitting of their parameters using perturbation data. We propose a more qualitative mechanistic approach, based on logical formalism and on the sole mapping and interpretation of omics data, and able to recover differences in sensitivity to gene inhibition without model training. This approach is showcased by the study of BRAF inhibition in patients with melanomas and colorectal cancers who experience significant differences in sensitivity despite similar omics profiles.
We first gather information from literature and build a logical model summarizing the regulatory network of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway surrounding BRAF, with factors involved in the BRAF inhibition resistance mechanisms. The relevance of this model is verified by automatically assessing that it qualitatively reproduces response or resistance behaviors identified in the literature. Data from over 100 melanoma and colorectal cancer cell lines are then used to validate the model’s ability to explain differences in sensitivity. This generic model is transformed into personalized cell line-specific logical models by integrating the omics information of the cell lines as constraints of the model. The use of mutations alone allows personalized models to correlate significantly with experimental sensitivities to BRAF inhibition, both from drug and CRISPR targeting, and even better with the joint use of mutations and RNA, supporting multi-omics mechanistic models. A comparison of these untrained models with learning approaches highlights similarities in interpretation and complementarity depending on the size of the datasets.
This parsimonious pipeline, which can easily be extended to other biological questions, makes it possible to explore the mechanistic causes of the response to treatment, on an individualized basis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s9TOALdB3dg" width="1" />

The United States witnessed an unprecedented politicization of biomedical science starting in 2015 that has exploded into a complex, multimodal anti-science empire operating through mass media, political elections, legislation, and even health systems. Anti-science activities now pervade the daily lives of many Americans, and threaten to infect other parts of the world. We can attribute the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans from COVID-19, measles, and other vaccine-preventable diseases to anti-science. The acceleration of anti-science activities demands not only new responses and approaches but also international coordination. Vaccines and other biomedical advances will not be sufficient to halt COVID-19 or future potentially catastrophic illnesses, unless we simultaneously counter anti-science aggression.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Vk3iDm8mdcc" width="1" />

Lyme disease is common in the northeastern United States, but rare in the southeast, even though the tick vector is found in both regions. Infection prevalence of Lyme spirochetes in host-seeking ticks, an important component to the risk of Lyme disease, is also high in the northeast and northern midwest, but declines sharply in the south. As ticks must acquire Lyme spirochetes from infected vertebrate hosts, the role of wildlife species composition on Lyme disease risk has been a topic of lively academic discussion. We compared tick–vertebrate host interactions using standardized sampling methods among 8 sites scattered throughout the eastern US. Geographical trends in diversity of tick hosts are gradual and do not match the sharp decline in prevalence at southern sites, but tick–host associations show a clear shift from mammals in the north to reptiles in the south. Tick infection prevalence declines north to south largely because of high tick infestation of efficient spirochete reservoir hosts (rodents and shrews) in the north but not in the south. Minimal infestation of small mammals in the south results from strong selective attachment to lizards such as skinks (which are inefficient reservoirs for Lyme spirochetes) in the southern states. Selective host choice, along with latitudinal differences in tick host-seeking behavior and variations in tick densities, explains the geographic pattern of Lyme disease in the eastern US.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cQR89AeJ09s" width="1" />

Objective
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of unknown etiology. Although the prevalent view regards a CD4+‐lymphocyte autoimmune reaction against myelin at the root of the disease, recent studies propose autoimmunity as a secondary reaction to idiopathic brain damage. To gain knowledge about this possibility we investigated the presence of axonal and myelinic morphological alterations, which could implicate imbalance of axon‐myelin units as primary event in MS pathogenesis.


Methods
Using high resolution imaging histological brain specimens from patients with MS and non‐neurological/non‐MS controls, we explored molecular changes underpinning imbalanced interaction between axon and myelin in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), a region characterized by normal myelination and absent inflammatory activity.


Results
In MS brains, we detected blister‐like swellings formed by myelin detachment from axons, which were substantially less frequently retrieved in non‐neurological/non‐MS controls. Swellings in MS NAWM presented altered glutamate receptor expression, myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) distribution, and lipid biochemical composition of myelin sheaths. Changes in tethering protein expression, widening of nodes of Ranvier and altered distribution of sodium channels in nodal regions of otherwise normally myelinated axons were also present in MS NAWM. Finally, we demonstrate a significant increase, compared with controls, in citrullinated proteins in myelin of MS cases, pointing toward biochemical modifications that may amplify the immunogenicity of MS myelin.


Interpretation
Collectively, the impaired interaction of myelin and axons potentially leads to myelin disintegration. Conceptually, the ensuing release of (post‐translationally modified) myelin antigens may elicit a subsequent immune attack in MS. ANN NEUROL 2021

Histological methods were used to localize a neuropeptide related to gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone in the central nervous system and periphery of Biomphalaria glabrata, an intermediate host for intestinal schistosomiasis.







Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within Biomphalaria, S. mansoni larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as “parasitic castration.” As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate Biomphalaria reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in Biomphalaria alexandrina that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH2 (designated Biom‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against Biom‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of Biomphalaria glabrata. GnRH‐like immunoreactive fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of Biomphalaria could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.

<p>The penalization method is a popular technique to provide particle swarm
optimizers with the ability to handle constraints. The downside is the need of
penalization coefficients whose settings are problem-specific. While adaptive
coefficients can be found in the literature, a different adaptive scheme is
proposed in this paper, where coefficients are kept constant. A pseudo-adaptive
relaxation of the tolerances for constraint violations while penalizing only
violations beyond such tolerances results in a pseudo-adaptive penalization. A
particle swarm optimizer is tested on a suite of benchmark problems for three
types of tolerance relaxation: no relaxation; self-tuned initial relaxation
with deterministic decrease; and self-tuned initial relaxation with
pseudo-adaptive decrease. Other authors' results are offered as frames of
reference.

<p>Three basic factors govern the individual behaviour of a particle: the
inertia from its previous displacement; the attraction to its own best
experience; and the attraction to a given neighbour's best experience. The
importance awarded to each factor is controlled by three coefficients: the
inertia; the individuality; and the sociality weights. The social behaviour is
ruled by the structure of the social network, which defines the neighbours that
are to inform of their experiences to a given particle. This paper presents a
study of the influence of different settings of the coefficients as well as of
the combined effect of different settings and different neighbourhood
topologies on the speed and form of convergence.

<p>Some recent research reveals that a topological structure in meta-heuristic
algorithms can effectively enhance the interaction of population, and thus
improve their performance. Inspired by it, we creatively investigate the
effectiveness of using a scale-free network in differential evolution methods,
and propose a scale-free network-based differential evolution method. The
novelties of this paper include a scale-free network-based population structure
and a new mutation operator designed to fully utilize the neighborhood
information provided by a scale-free structure. The elite individuals and
population at the latest generation are both employed to guide a global
optimization process. In this manner, the proposed algorithm owns balanced
exploration and exploitation capabilities to alleviate the drawbacks of
premature convergence. Experimental and statistical analyses are performed on
the CEC'17 benchmark function suite and three real world problems. Results
demonstrate its superior effectiveness and efficiency in comparison with its
competitive peers.

<p>This paper proposes an efficient video summarization framework that will give
a gist of the entire video in a few key-frames or video skims. Existing video
summarization frameworks are based on algorithms that utilize computer vision
low-level feature extraction or high-level domain level extraction. However,
being the ultimate user of the summarized video, humans remain the most
neglected aspect. Therefore, the proposed paper considers human's role in
summarization and introduces human visual attention-based summarization
techniques. To understand human attention behavior, we have designed and
performed experiments with human participants using electroencephalogram (EEG)
and eye-tracking technology. The EEG and eye-tracking data obtained from the
experimentation are processed simultaneously and used to segment frames
containing useful information from a considerable video volume. Thus, the frame
segmentation primarily relies on the cognitive judgments of human beings. Using
our approach, a video is summarized by 96.5% while maintaining higher precision
and high recall factors. The comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques
demonstrates that the proposed approach yields ceiling-level performance with
reduced computational cost in summarising the videos.

<p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is an adversarial model, and it has
been demonstrated to be effective for various generative tasks. However, GAN
and its variants also suffer from many training problems, such as mode collapse
and gradient vanish. In this paper, we firstly propose a general crossover
operator, which can be widely applied to GANs using evolutionary strategies.
Then we design an evolutionary GAN framework C-GAN based on it. And we combine
the crossover operator with evolutionary generative adversarial networks (EGAN)
to implement the evolutionary generative adversarial networks with crossover
(CE-GAN). Under the premise that a variety of loss functions are used as
mutation operators to generate mutation individuals, we evaluate the generated
samples and allow the mutation individuals to learn experiences from the output
in a knowledge distillation manner, imitating the best output outcome,
resulting in better offspring. Then, we greedily selected the best offspring as
parents for subsequent training using discriminator as evaluator. Experiments
on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CE-GAN and show that our
method is competitive in terms of generated images quality and time efficiency.

<p>To make informed decisions in natural environments that change over time,
humans must update their beliefs as new observations are gathered. Studies
exploring human inference as a dynamical process that unfolds in time have
focused on situations in which the statistics of observations are
history-independent. Yet temporal structure is everywhere in nature, and yields
history-dependent observations. Do humans modify their inference processes
depending on the latent temporal statistics of their observations? We
investigate this question experimentally and theoretically using a change-point
inference task. We show that humans adapt their inference process to fine
aspects of the temporal structure in the statistics of stimuli. As such, humans
behave qualitatively in a Bayesian fashion, but, quantitatively, deviate away
from optimality. Perhaps more importantly, humans behave suboptimally in that
their responses are not deterministic, but variable. We show that this
variability itself is modulated by the temporal statistics of stimuli. To
elucidate the cognitive algorithm that yields this behavior, we investigate a
broad array of existing and new models that characterize different sources of
suboptimal deviations away from Bayesian inference. While models with 'output
noise' that corrupts the response-selection process are natural candidates,
human behavior is best described by sampling-based inference models, in which
the main ingredient is a compressed approximation of the posterior, represented
through a modest set of random samples and updated over time. This result comes
to complement a growing literature on sample-based representation and learning
in humans.

<p>The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to traditional methods
have been greatly discussed in the literature. While particle swarm optimizers
share such advantages, they outperform evolutionary algorithms in that they
require lower computational cost and easier implementation, involving no
operator design and few coefficients to be tuned. However, even marginal
variations in the settings of these coefficients greatly influence the dynamics
of the swarm. Since this paper does not intend to study their tuning,
general-purpose settings are taken from previous studies, and virtually the
same algorithm is used to optimize a variety of notably different problems.
Thus, following a review of the paradigm, the algorithm is tested on a set of
benchmark functions and engineering problems taken from the literature. Later,
complementary lines of code are incorporated to adapt the method to
combinatorial optimization as it occurs in scheduling problems, and a real case
is solved using the same optimizer with the same settings. The aim is to show
the flexibility and robustness of the approach, which can handle a wide variety
of problems.

<p>The sparse coding algorithm has served as a model for early processing in
mammalian vision. It has been assumed that the brain uses sparse coding to
exploit statistical properties of the sensory stream. We hypothesize that
sparse coding discovers patterns from the data set, which can be used to
estimate a set of stimulus parameters by simple readout. In this study, we
chose a model of stereo vision to test our hypothesis. We used the Locally
Competitive Algorithm (LCA), followed by a na\"ive Bayes classifier, to infer
stereo disparity. From the results we report three observations. First,
disparity inference was successful with this naturalistic processing pipeline.
Second, an expanded, highly redundant representation is required to robustly
identify the input patterns. Third, the inference error can be predicted from
the number of active coefficients in the LCA representation. We conclude that
sparse coding can generate a suitable general representation for subsequent
inference tasks. Keywords: Sparse coding; Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA);

<p>Most state of the art decision systems based on Reinforcement Learning (RL)
are data-driven black-box neural models, where it is often difficult to

the learned decision mechanisms. Knowledge-insertion and model review are

One way to bridge the gap between data- and knowledge-driven systems is program
synthesis: replacing a neural network that outputs decisions with one that
generates decision-making code in some programming language. We propose a new
programming language, BF++, designed specifically for neural program synthesis
in a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) setting and generate
programs for a number of standard OpenAI Gym benchmarks.

<p>The widespread deployment of surveillance cameras for facial recognition
gives rise to many privacy concerns. This study proposes a privacy-friendly
alternative to large scale facial recognition. While there are multiple
techniques to preserve privacy, our work is based on the minimization principle
which implies minimizing the amount of collected personal data. Instead of
running facial recognition software on all video data, we propose to
automatically extract a high quality snapshot of each detected person without
revealing his or her identity. This snapshot is then encrypted and access is
only granted after legal authorization. We introduce a novel unsupervised face
image quality assessment method which is used to select the high quality
snapshots. For this, we train a variational autoencoder on high quality face
images from a publicly available dataset and use the reconstruction probability
as a metric to estimate the quality of each face crop. We experimentally
confirm that the reconstruction probability can be used as biometric quality
predictor. Unlike most previous studies, we do not rely on a manually defined
face quality metric as everything is learned from data. Our face quality
assessment method outperforms supervised, unsupervised and general image
quality assessment methods on the task of improving face verification
performance by rejecting low quality images. The effectiveness of the whole
system is validated qualitatively on still images and videos.

<p>Understanding principles of neurolocomotion requires the synthesis of neural
activity, sensory feedback, and biomechanics. The nematode \textit{C. elegans}
is an ideal model organism for studying locomotion in an integrated
neuromechanical setting because its neural circuit has a well-characterized
modular structure and its undulatory forward swimming gait adapts to the
surrounding fluid with a shorter wavelength in higher viscosity environments.
This adaptive behavior emerges from the neural modules interacting through a
combination of mechanical forces, neuronal coupling, and sensory feedback
mechanisms. However, the relative contributions of these coupling modes to gait
adaptation are not understood. The model consists of repeated neuromechanical
modules that are coupled through the mechanics of the body, short-range
proprioception, and gap-junctions. The model captures the experimentally
observed gait adaptation over a wide range of mechanical parameters, provided
that the muscle response to input from the nervous system is faster than the
body response to changes in internal and external forces. The modularity of the
model allows the use of the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to identify
the relative roles of body mechanics, gap-junctional coupling, and
proprioceptive coupling in coordinating the undulatory gait. The analysis shows
that the wavelength of body undulations is set by the relative strengths of
these three coupling forms. In a low-viscosity fluid environment, the
competition between gap-junctions and proprioception produces a long wavelength
undulation, which is only achieved in the model with sufficiently strong
gap-junctional coupling.The experimentally observed decrease in wavelength in
response to increasing fluid viscosity is the result of an increase in the
relative strength of mechanical coupling, which promotes a short wavelength.

<p>We provide two characterizations, one axiomatic and the other
neuro-computational, of the dependence of choice probabilities on deadlines,
within the widely used softmax representation \[ p_{t}\left( a,A\right)
=\dfrac{e^{\frac{u\left( a\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right) }+\alpha \left(
a\right) }}{\sum_{b\in A}e^{\frac{u\left( b\right) }{\lambda \left( t\right)
}+\alpha \left( b\right) }}% \] where $p_{t}\left( a,A\right) $ is the
probability that alternative $a$ is selected from the set $A$ of feasible
alternatives if $t$ is the time available to decide, $\lambda$ is a time
dependent noise parameter measuring the unit cost of information, $u$ is a time
independent utility function, and $\alpha$ is an alternative-specific bias that
determines the initial choice probabilities reflecting prior information and
memory anchoring.
</p>
<p>Our axiomatic analysis provides a behavioral foundation of softmax (also
known as Multinomial Logit Model when $\alpha$ is constant). Our
neuro-computational derivation provides a biologically inspired algorithm that
may explain the emergence of softmax in choice behavior. Jointly, the two
approaches provide a thorough understanding of soft-maximization in terms of
internal causes (neurophysiological mechanisms) and external effects (testable
implications).

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03887">Assessing the Significance of Directed and Multivariate Measures of Linear Dependence Between Time Series. (arXiv:2003.03887v3 [stat.ME] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Inferring linear dependence between time series is central to our
understanding of natural and artificial systems. Unfortunately, the hypothesis
tests that are used to determine statistically significant directed or
multivariate relationships from time-series data often yield spurious
associations (Type I errors) or omit causal relationships (Type II errors).
This is due to the autocorrelation present in the analysed time series -- a
property that is ubiquitous across diverse applications, from brain dynamics to
climate change. Here we show that, for limited data, this issue cannot be
mediated by fitting a time-series model alone (e.g., in Granger causality or
prewhitening approaches), and instead that the degrees of freedom in
statistical tests should be altered to account for the effective sample size
induced by cross-correlations in the observations. This insight enabled us to
derive modified hypothesis tests for any multivariate correlation-based
measures of linear dependence between covariance-stationary time series,
including Granger causality and mutual information with Gaussian marginals. We
use both numerical simulations (generated by autoregressive models and digital
filtering) as well as recorded fMRI-neuroimaging data to show that our tests
are unbiased for a variety of stationary time series. Our experiments
demonstrate that the commonly used $F$- and $\chi^2$-tests can induce
significant false-positive rates of up to $100\%$ for both measures, with and
without prewhitening of the signals. These findings suggest that many
dependencies reported in the scientific literature may have been, and may
continue to be, spuriously reported or missed if modified hypothesis tests are
not used when analysing time series.

<p>This paper is concerned with robust instability analysis of linear feedback
systems subject to a dynamic uncertainty. The work is motivated by, and
provides a basic foundation for, a more challenging problem of analyzing
persistence of oscillations in nonlinear dynamical systems. We first formalize
the problem for SISO LTI systems by introducing a notion of the robust
instability radius (RIR). We provide a method for calculating the RIR exactly
for a certain class of systems and show that it works well for a class of
second order systems. This result is applied to the FitzHugh-Nagumo model for
neuronal dynamics, and the effectiveness is confirmed by numerical simulations,
where we properly care for the change of the equilibrium point.

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Little is known about the effects of exercise training (ET) on lexical characteristics during fluency task and its association with cerebellum functional connectivity. The purposes of this study were (1) to investigate whether ET alters response patterns during phonemic and semantic fluency tasks and (2) to assess the association between ET-related changes in cerebellum functional connectivity (FC) and lexical characteristics during fluency tasks. Thirty-five older adults (78.0 ± 7.1 years; 17 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 18 healthy cognition (HC)) underwent a 12-week treadmill ET. Before and after ET, cardiorespiratory fitness tests, phonemic and semantic fluency tests, and resting-state fMRI scans were administered. We utilized a seed-based correlation analysis to measure cerebellum FC and linear regression to assess the association of residualized ET-induced Δcerebellum FC with Δtask performance. Improved mean switches and frequency during the phonemic fluency task were observed following ET in all participants. There were significant associations between ET-induced increases in cerebellum FC and greater phonemic fluency task log frequency, increases in mean switches, and a reduction in the number of syllables in HC. Lastly, there was a significant interaction between group and cerebellar connectivity on phonemic fluency mean log frequency and number of syllables. A 12-week walking ET is related to enhanced phonemic fluency lexical characteristics in older adults with MCI and HC. The association between ET-induced increases in cerebellum FC and enhanced response patterns after ET suggests that the cerebellum may play an important role in ET-related improvement in phonemic fluency performance in cognitively healthy older adults.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Observations of finely-timed spike relationships in population recordings have been used to support partial reconstruction of neural microcircuit diagrams. In this approach, fine-timescale components of paired spike train interactions are isolated and subsequently attributed to synaptic parameters. Recent perturbation studies strengthen the case for such an inference, yet the complete set of measurements needed to calibrate statistical models is unavailable. To address this gap, we study features of pairwise spiking in a large-scale <em class="a-plus-plus">in vivo</em> dataset where presynaptic neurons were explicitly decoupled from network activity by juxtacellular stimulation. We then construct biophysical models of paired spike trains to reproduce the observed phenomenology of <em class="a-plus-plus">in vivo</em> monosynaptic interactions, including both fine-timescale spike-spike correlations and firing irregularity. A key characteristic of these models is that the paired neurons are coupled by rapidly-fluctuating background inputs. We quantify a monosynapse’s causal effect by comparing the postsynaptic train with its counterfactual, when the monosynapse is removed. Subsequently, we develop statistical techniques for estimating this causal effect from the pre- and post-synaptic spike trains. A particular focus is the justification and application of a nonparametric separation of timescale principle to implement synaptic inference. Using simulated data generated from the biophysical models, we characterize the regimes in which the estimators accurately identify the monosynaptic effect. A secondary goal is to initiate a critical exploration of neurostatistical assumptions in terms of biophysical mechanisms, particularly with regards to the challenging but arguably fundamental issue of fast, unobservable nonstationarities in background dynamics.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) may lead to muscle weakness due to hypothyroid dysfunction. However, clinical experience treating patients with HT suggests that neuromuscular symptoms may develop in these patients despite long-standing euthyroidism.</p>

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">In 24 euthyroid patients with HT and 25 healthy controls, physical fatigability was assessed using the arm movement test (AMT) and 6-min walk test (6MWT). Fatigability was based on calculation of linear trend (LT) reflecting dynamic performance within subsequent constant time intervals. Perception of physical fatigue and muscle pain was analyzed using fatigue (FSMC) and pain questionnaires. Obtained results were correlated with clinical, neurophysiological and lab findings.</p>

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">HT patients showed a negative LT in 6MWT significantly differing from stable performance in controls. LT in AMT did not differ between HT and controls. FSMC scores and pain perception revealed significantly higher levels in HT patients than in controls. Physical FSMC score was primarily influenced by pain perception (standardized regression coefficient, beta = 0.633, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.002). Neither pain score nor physical fatigue score showed a correlation with LT in 6MWT nor did mood, or anti-TPO antibody titer.</p>

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">A significant physical fatigability could be shown in euthyroid HT patients despite missing obvious neuromuscular deficits in routine testing. Further, elevated pain and fatigue perception in HT patients seem to contribute to nonspecific muscle complaints in these patients. A possible pathogenic role of thyroid autoimmunity in hidden neuromuscular involvement may be suggested.</p>

The diabetic patients with A-waves showed faster conduction velocity in all quartiles in the motor peroneal nerves compared to the patients without A-waves, and their CVD histograms were shifted to the right side, consisting of a significantly larger percentage of fast conducting fibers. There was no significant difference in the CVD values of the upper extremity nerves among the patients with and without A-waves and the healthy controls.</p><p>Conclusion: A-waves could occur in type II diabetes as early as when NCS showed normal, and represented as a sign of neuropathy as well as a sign of rescued motor nerve function.</p>

<p>Experts apply their experience to the proper development of their routine activities. Their acquired expertise or professionalization is expected to help in the development of those recurring tasks. Media professionals spend their daily work watching narrative contents on screens, so learning how they manage visual perception of those contents could be of interest in an increasingly audiovisual society. Media works require not only the understanding of the storytelling, but also the decoding of the formal rules and presentations. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 36 participants (18 media professionals and 18 non-media professionals) while they were watching audiovisual contents, and compared their eyeblink rate and their brain activity and connectivity. We found that media professionals decreased their blink rate after the cuts, suggesting that they can better manage the loss of visual information that blinks entail by sparing them when new visual information is being presented. Cuts triggered similar activation of basic brain processing in the visual cortex of the two groups, but different processing in medial and frontal cortical areas, where media professionals showed a lower activity. Effective brain connectivity occurred in a more organized way in media professionals–possibly due to a better communication between cortical areas that are coordinated for decoding new visual content after cuts.</p>

<p>Background: Regaining control of movement following a spinal cord injury (SCI) requires utilization and/or functional reorganization of residual descending, and likely ascending, supraspinal sensorimotor pathways, which may be facilitated via task-specific training through body weight supported treadmill (BWST) training. Recently, epidural electrical stimulation (ES) combined with task-specific training demonstrated independence of standing and stepping functions in individuals with clinically complete SCI. The restoration of these functions may be dependent upon variables such as manipulation of proprioceptive input, ES parameter adjustments, and participant intent during step training. However, the impact of each variable on the degree of independence achieved during BWST stepping remains unknown.</p><p>Objective: To describe the effects of descending intentional commands and proprioceptive inputs, specifically body weight support (BWS), on lower extremity motor activity and vertical ground reaction forces (vGRF) during ES-enabled BWST stepping in humans with chronic sensorimotor complete SCI. Furthermore, we describe perceived changes in the level of assistance provided by clinicians when intent and BWS are modified.</p><p>Methods: Two individuals with chronic, mid thoracic, clinically complete SCI, enrolled in an IRB and FDA (IDE G150167) approved clinical trial. A 16-contact electrode array was implanted in the epidural space between the T11-L1 vertebral regions. Lower extremity motor output and vertical ground reaction forces were obtained during clinician-assisted ES-enabled treadmill stepping with BWS. Consecutive steps were achieved during various experimentally-controlled conditions, including intentional participation and varied BWS (60% and 20%) while ES parameters remain unchanged.</p><p>Results: During ES-enabled BWST stepping, the knee extensors exhibited an increase in motor activation during trials in which stepping was passive compared to active or during trials in which 60% BWS was provided compared to 20% BWS. As a result of this increased motor activation, perceived clinician assistance increased during the transition from stance to swing. Intentional participation and 20% BWS resulted in timely and purposeful activation of the lower extremities muscles, which improved independence and decreased clinician assistance.</p><p>Conclusion: Maximizing participant intention and optimizing proprioceptive inputs through BWS during ES-enabled BWST stepping may facilitate greater independence during BWST stepping for individuals with clinically complete SCI.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02592668.</p>

<p>Findings regarding sex differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as far as core symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities (PC) are concerned, are inconsistent, inconclusive, or conflicting among studies. The lower prevalence of ASD in females than in males and the age and intelligence quotient (IQ) heterogeneity among samples made it difficult to investigate these differences. This case–control study tries to deepen the impact of sex differences on core symptoms of autism and PC in 214 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 45.26) without impairment in non-verbal IQ (nvIQ ≥70). A total of 107 ASD females (mean age, 44.51 ± 13.79 months) were matched one by one with 107 males (mean age, 46.01 ± 13.42 months) for chronological age (±6 months) and nvIQ (±6 points). We used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5–5 to explore autism severity and PC. The results highlight that ASD females did not significantly differ from ASD males regarding the severity of autism. Statistically significant lower levels of emotionally reactive (p = 0.005, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.04), anxious-depressed (p = 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.05), internalizing problems (p = 0.04, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.02), and DSM-Oriented Scales anxiety problems (p = 0.02, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.04) in ASD females than in ASD males were also detected. Our findings of no difference in the autism severity and lower internalizing problems in females than males with ASD extend the knowledge of autism in females during preschool years. Compared to other similar studies on this topic, we can state that these results are not supported by differences in nvIQ between sexes nor by the presence of cognitive impairment. It confirms the need for clinicians to consider sex differences when describing autism psychopathology.</p>

<p>The first families with LRRK2 related Parkinson’s disease (PD) were presented around 15 years ago and numerous papers have described the characteristics of the LRRK2 phenotype. The prevalence of autosomal dominant PD varies around the world mainly depending on local founder effects. The highest prevalence of LRRK2 G2019S PD in Norway is located to the central part of the country and most families could be traced back to common ancestors. The typical Norwegian LRRK2 phenotype is not different from classical PD and similar to that seen in most other LRRK2 families. The discovery of LRRK2 PD has allowed us to follow-up multi-incident families and to study their phenotype longitudinally. In the Norwegian LRRK2 families there has been a significantly higher incidence of inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis that seen in other PD populations. Recent studies in LRRK2 mechanisms have indicated that this protein may be crucial in initiating disease processes. In this short survey of 100 Norwegian mutation carriers followed through more than 15 years are presented. The prevalence of inflammatory diseases among these cases is highlighted. The role of LRRK2 in the conversion process from carrier status to PD phenotype is still unknown and disease generating mechanisms important for initiating LRRK2 PD are still to be identified.</p>

<p>The advent of mobile electroencephalography (mEEG) has created a means for large scale collection of neural data thus affording a deeper insight into cognitive phenomena such as cognitive fatigue. Cognitive fatigue – a neural state that is associated with an increased incidence of errorful performance – is responsible for accidents on a daily basis which at times can cost human lives. To gain better insight into the neural signature of cognitive fatigue in the present study we used mEEG to examine the relationship between perceived cognitive fatigue and human-event related brain potentials (ERPs) and electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in a sample of 1,000 people. As a secondary goal, we wanted to further demonstrate the capability of mEEG to accurately measure ERP and EEG data. To accomplish these goals, participants performed a standard visual oddball task on an Apple iPad while EEG data were recorded from a Muse EEG headband. Counter to traditional EEG studies, experimental setup and data collection was completed in less than seven minutes on average. An analysis of our EEG data revealed robust N200 and P300 ERP components and neural oscillations in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. In line with previous findings we observed correlations between ERP components and EEG power and perceived cognitive fatigue. Further, we demonstrate here that a linear combination of ERP and EEG features is a significantly better predictor of perceived cognitive fatigue than any ERP or EEG feature on its own. In sum, our results provide validation of mEEG as a viable tool for research and provide further insight into the impact of cognitive fatigue on the human brain.</p>

<p>Response inhibition (RI) and error monitoring (EM) are important processes of adaptive goal-directed behavior, and neural correlates of these processes are being increasingly used as transdiagnostic biomarkers of risk for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Potential utility of these purported biomarkers relies on the assumption that individual differences in brain activation are reproducible over time; however, available data on test-retest reliability (TRR) of task-fMRI are very mixed. This study examined TRR of RI and EM-related activations using a stop signal task in young adults (n = 56, including 27 pairs of monozygotic (MZ) twins) in order to identify brain regions with high TRR and familial influences (as indicated by MZ twin correlations) and to examine factors potentially affecting reliability. We identified brain regions with good TRR of activations related to RI (inferior/middle frontal, superior parietal, and precentral gyri) and EM (insula, medial superior frontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). No subcortical regions showed significant TRR. Regions with higher group-level activation showed higher TRR; increasing task duration improved TRR; within-session reliability was weakly related to the long-term TRR; motion negatively affected TRR, but this effect was abolished after the application of ICA-FIX, a data-driven noise removal method.</p>

<p>15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome causes a spectrum of cognitive disorders, including intellectual disability and autism. We assessed the ability of the EEG analysis algorithm Brain Network Analysis (BNA) to measure cognitive function in 15q13.3 deletion patients, and to differentiate between patient and control groups. EEG data was collected from 10 individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (14–18 years of age), as well as 30 age-matched healthy controls, as the subjects responded to Auditory Oddball (AOB) and Go/NoGo cognitive tasks. It was determined that BNA can be used to evaluate cognitive function in 15q13.3 microdeletion patients. This analysis also significantly differentiates between patient and control groups using 5 scores, all of which are produced from ERP peaks related to late cortical components that represent higher cognitive functions of attention allocation and response inhibition (P &lt; 0.05).</p>

<p>Nesfatin-1 is one of several brain-gut peptides that have a close relationship with the central dopaminergic system. Our previous studies have shown that nesfatin-1 is capable of protecting nigral dopaminergic neurons against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced neurotoxicity. A recent study also revealed a reduced blood level of nesfatin-1 in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The current study was designed to investigate whether reduced nesfatin-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) induces nigrostriatal system degeneration. An intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) injection technique was used to administer anti-nesfatin-1 antibody directly into the lateral ventricle of the brain. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that ICV injection of anti-nesfatin-1 antibody into the lateral ventricle of the brain once daily for 2 weeks caused a significant reduction in nesfatin-1 levels in the CSF (93.1%). Treatment with anti-nesfatin-1 antibody resulted in a substantial loss (23%) of TH-positive (TH+) dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), as shown by immunofluorescence staining, a depletion in dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and obvious nuclear shrinkage and mitochondrial lesions in dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the results from our Western blot and ELISA experiments demonstrated that anti-nesfatin-1 antibody injection induced an upregulation of caspase-3 activation, increased the expression of p-ERK, and elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the SNpc. Taken together, these observations suggest that reduced nesfatin-1 in the brain may induce nigrostriatal dopaminergic system degeneration; this effect may be mediated via mitochondrial dysfunction-related apoptosis. Our data support a role of nesfatin-1 in maintaining the normal physiological function of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.</p>

<p>Surgical decompression is the primary treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) patients with compressive spinal cord injury (CSCI). However, the prognosis of patients with CSCI varies, and the pathophysiological changes following decompression remain poor. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiological changes and the role of Notch-1 activation after decompression in a rat CSCI model. Surgical decompression was conducted at 1 week post-injury (wpi). DAPT was intraperitoneally injected to down-regulate Notch-1 expression. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores and an inclined plane test were used to evaluate the motor function recovery. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to assess pathophysiological changes, while hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), von Willebrand factor (vWF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-2, Notch-1, and Hes-1 expression in the spinal cord were examined by immunohistochemical analysis or quantitative PCR. The results show that early decompression can partially promote motor function recovery. Improvements in structural and cellular damage and hypoxic levels were also observed in the decompressed spinal cord. Moreover, decompression resulted in increased VEGF and vWF expression, but decreased MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression at 3 wpi. Expression levels of Notch-1 and its downstream gene Hes-1 were increased after decompression, and the inhibition of Notch-1 significantly reduced the decompression-induced motor function recovery. This exploratory study revealed preliminary pathophysiological changes in the compressed and decompressed rat spinal cord. Furthermore, we confirmed that early surgical decompression partially promotes motor function recovery may via activation of the Notch-1 signaling pathway after CSCI. These results could provide new insights for the development of drug therapy to enhance recovery following surgery.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a range of neurodevelopmental disorders with behavioral and cognitive impairment and brings huge burdens to the patients’ families and the society. To accurately identify patients with ASD from typical controls is important for early detection and early intervention. However, almost all the current existing classification methods for ASD based on structural MRI (sMRI) mainly utilize the independent local morphological features and do not consider the covariance patterns of these features between regions. In this study, by combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) and individual structural covariance network, we proposed a new framework to classify ASD patients with sMRI data from the ABIDE consortium. Moreover, gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to characterize the weight of features contributing to the classification. The experimental results showed that our proposed method outperforms the currently used methods for classifying ASD patients with the ABIDE data and achieves a high classification accuracy of 71.8% across different sites. Furthermore, the discriminative features were found to be mainly located in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, which may be the early biomarkers for the diagnosis of ASD. Our study demonstrated that CNN is an effective tool to build the framework for the diagnosis of ASD with individual structural covariance brain network.</p>

<p>The Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system is a typical neurophysiological application which helps paralyzed patients with human-machine communication. Stroke patients with motor disabilities are able to perform BCI tasks for clinical rehabilitation. This paper proposes an effective scheme of transfer calibration for BCI rehabilitation. The inter- and intra-subject transfer learning approaches can improve the low-precision classification performance for experimental feedback. The results imply that the systematical scheme is positive in increasing the confidence of voluntary training for stroke patients. In addition, it also reduces the time consumption of classifier calibration.</p>

<p>A critical issue in executive control is how the nervous system exerts flexibility to inhibit a prepotent response and adapt to sudden changes in the environment. In this study, force measurement was used to capture “partial” unsuccessful trials that are highly relevant in extending the current understanding of motor inhibition processing. Moreover, a modified version of the stop-signal task was used to control and eliminate potential attentional capture effects from the motor inhibition index. The results illustrate that the non-canceled force and force rate increased as a function of stop-signal delay (SSD), offering new objective indices for gauging the dynamic inhibitory process. Motor response (time and force) was a function of delay in the presentation of novel/infrequent stimuli. A larger lateralized readiness potential (LRP) amplitude in go and novel stimuli indicated an influence of the novel stimuli on central motor processing. Moreover, an early N1 component reflects an index of motor inhibition in addition to the N2 component reported in previous studies. Source analysis revealed that the activation of N2 originated from inhibitory control associated areas: the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), pre-motor cortex, and primary motor cortex. Regarding partial responses, LRP and error-related negativity (ERNs) were associated with error correction processes, whereas the N2 component may indicate the functional overlap between inhibition and error correction. In sum, the present study has developed reliable and objective indices of motor inhibition by introducing force, force-rate and electrophysiological measures, further elucidating our understandings of dynamic motor inhibition and error correction.</p>

<p>Short-term motor practice leads to plasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1). The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that determine the increase in corticospinal tract (CST) excitability after motor practice, with special focus on two factors; “the level of muscle activity” and “the presence/absence of a goal of keeping the activity level constant.” Fifteen healthy subjects performed four types of rapid thumb adduction in separate sessions. In the “comfortable task” (C) and “forceful task” (F), the subjects adducted their thumb using comfortable and strong forces. In the “comfortable with a goal task” (CG) and “forceful with a goal task” (FG), subjects controlled the muscle activity at the same level as in the C and F, respectively, by adjusting the peak electromyographic amplitude within the target ranges. Paired associative stimulation (PAS), which combines peripheral nerve (median nerve) stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms (PAS25) was also done. Before and after the motor tasks and PAS25, TMS was applied to the M1. None of the four tasks showed any temporary changes in behavior, meaning no learning occurred. Motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude increased only after the FG and it exhibited a positive correlation with the MEP increase after PAS25, suggesting that FG and PAS25 share at least similar plasticity mechanisms in the M1. Resting motor threshold (RMT) decreased only after FG, suggesting that FG would also be associated with the membrane depolarization of M1 neurons. These results suggest task-dependent plasticity from the synergistic effect of forceful muscle activity and of setting a goal of keeping the activity level constant.</p>

<p>Motivation: There is an ongoing search for definitive and reliable biomarkers to forecast or predict imminent seizure onset, but to date most research has been limited to EEG with sampling rates &lt;1,000 Hz. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have gained acceptance as an indicator of epileptic tissue, but few have investigated the temporal properties of HFOs or their potential role as a predictor in seizure prediction. Here we evaluate time-varying trends in preictal HFO rates as a potential biomarker of seizure prediction.</p><p>Methods: HFOs were identified for all interictal and preictal periods with a validated automated detector in 27 patients who underwent intracranial EEG monitoring. We used LASSO logistic regression with several features of the HFO rate to distinguish preictal from interictal periods in each individual. We then tested these models with held-out data and evaluated their performance with the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of their receiver-operating curve (ROC). Finally, we assessed the significance of these results using non-parametric statistical tests.</p><p>Results: There was variability in the ability of HFOs to discern preictal from interictal states across our cohort. We identified a subset of 10 patients in whom the presence of the preictal state could be successfully predicted better than chance. For some of these individuals, average AUC in the held-out data reached higher than 0.80, which suggests that HFO rates can significantly differentiate preictal and interictal periods for certain patients.</p><p>Significance: These findings show that temporal trends in HFO rate can predict the preictal state better than random chance in some individuals. Such promising results indicate that future prediction efforts would benefit from the inclusion of high-frequency information in their predictive models and technological architecture.</p>

<p>Evidence is accumulating that individual and environmental factors in childhood and adolescence should be considered when investigating adult health and aging-related processes. The data required for this is gathered by comprehensive long-term longitudinal studies. This article describes the protocol of the Zurich Longitudinal Studies (ZLS), a set of three comprehensive cohort studies on child growth, health, and development that are currently expanding into adulthood. Between 1954 and 1961, 445 healthy infants were enrolled in the first ZLS cohort. Their physical, motor, cognitive, and social development and their environment were assessed comprehensively across childhood, adolescence, and into young adulthood. In the 1970s, two further cohorts were added to the ZLS and assessed with largely matched study protocols: Between 1974 and 1979, the second ZLS cohort included 265 infants (103 term-born and 162 preterm infants), and between 1970 and 2002, the third ZLS cohort included 327 children of participants of the first ZLS cohort. Since 2019, the participants of the three ZLS cohorts have been traced and invited to participate in a first wave of assessments in adulthood to investigate their current health and development. This article describes the ZLS study protocol and discusses opportunities, methodological and conceptual challenges, and limitations arising from a long-term longitudinal cohort recruited from a study about development in early life. In the future, the ZLS will provide data to investigate childhood antecedents of adult health outcomes and, ultimately, will help respond to the frequent call of scientists to shift the focus of aging research into the first decades of life and, thus, to take a lifespan perspective on aging.</p>

<p>The future of awake bruxism assessment will incorporate physiological data, possibly electromyography (EMG) of the temporal muscles. But up to now, temporal muscle contraction patterns in awake bruxism have not been characterized to demonstrate clinical utility. The present study aimed to perform surface EMG evaluations of people assessed for awake bruxism to identify possible different subtypes. A 2-year active search for people with awake bruxism in three regions of the country resulted in a total of 303 participants (223 women, 38 ± 13 years, mean and SD). Their inclusion was confirmed through non-instrumental approaches for awake bruxism: self-reported questionnaire and clinical exam, performed by three experienced and calibrated dentists (Kappa = 0.75). Also, 77 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited (49 women, 36 ± 14 years). Temporalis surface EMG was performed with a portable device (Myobox; NeuroUp, Brazil). EMG signals were sent to a computer via Bluetooth 4.0 at a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz. Digital signal processing was performed using the commercial neuroUP software, transformed in RMS and then normalized for peak detection (EMG peaks/min), in a 10 min session. Cluster analysis revealed three distinct subtypes of awake bruxism: phasic, tonic, and intermediate. Individuals with a predominance of EMG peaks/min were classified as the “phasic” subtype (16.8%). Those with the highest EMG rest power were classified as the “tonic” subtype (32.3%). There was also an “intermediate” subtype (50.8%), when both variables remained low. Characterization of awake bruxism physiology is important for future establishment of instrumental assessment protocols and treatment strategies.</p>

<p>Leukodystrophies are a class of rare inherited central nervous system (CNS) disorders that affect the white matter of the brain, typically leading to progressive neurodegeneration and early death. Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies are characterized by the abnormal formation of the myelin sheath during development. POLR3-related or 4H (hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) leukodystrophy is one of the most common types of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy for which no curative treatment or disease-modifying therapy is available. This review aims to describe potential therapies that could be further studied for effectiveness in pre-clinical studies, for an eventual translation to the clinic to treat the neurological manifestations associated with POLR3-related leukodystrophy. Here, we discuss the therapeutic approaches that have shown promise in other leukodystrophies, as well as other genetic diseases, and consider their use in treating POLR3-related leukodystrophy. More specifically, we explore the approaches of using stem cell transplantation, gene replacement therapy, and gene editing as potential treatment options, and discuss their possible benefits and limitations as future therapeutic directions.</p>

<p>Cell therapies represent a promising approach to slow down the progression of currently untreatable neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as to support the reconstruction of functional neural circuits after spinal cord injuries. In such therapies, the grafted cells could either functionally integrate into the damaged tissue, partially replacing dead or damaged cells, modulate inflammatory reaction, reduce tissue damage, or support neuronal survival by secretion of cytokines, growth, and trophic factors. Comprehensive characterization of cells and their proliferative potential, differentiation status, and population purity before transplantation is crucial to preventing safety risks, e.g., a tumorous growth due to the proliferation of undifferentiated stem cells. We characterized changes in the proteome and secretome of human neural stem cells (NSCs) during their spontaneous (EGF/FGF2 withdrawal) differentiation and differentiation with trophic support by BDNF/GDNF supplementation. We used LC-MS/MS in SWATH-MS mode for global cellular proteome profiling and quantified almost three thousand cellular proteins. Our analysis identified substantial protein differences in the early stages of NSC differentiation with more than a third of all the proteins regulated (including known neuronal and NSC multipotency markers) and revealed that the BDNF/GDNF support affected more the later stages of the NSC differentiation. Among the pathways identified as activated during both spontaneous and BDNF/GDNF differentiation were the HIF-1 signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway. Our follow-up secretome analysis using Luminex multiplex immunoassay revealed significant changes in the secretion of VEGF and IL-6 during NSC differentiation. Our results further demonstrated an increased expression of neuropilin-1 as well as catenin β-1, both known to participate in the regulation of VEGF signaling, and showed that VEGF-A isoform 121 (VEGF121), in particular, induces proliferation and supports survival of differentiating cells.</p>

<p>Perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs) carry out several different functions, from metabolite clearing to control of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. All these functions are likely orchestrated by complex cellular machinery that resides within the PAPs and relies on a fine interplay between multiple subcellular components. However, traditional transmission electron microscopy (EM) studies have found that PAPs are remarkably poor of intracellular organelles, failing to explain how such a variety of PAP functions are achieved in the absence of a proportional complex network of intracellular structures. Here, we use serial block-face scanning EM to reconstruct and describe in three dimensions PAPs and their intracellular organelles in two different mouse cortical regions. We described five distinct organelles, which included empty and full endosomes, phagosomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae, distributed within three PAPs categories (branches, branchlets, and leaflets). The majority of PAPs belonged to the leaflets category (~60%), with branchlets representing a minority (~37%). Branches were rarely in contact with synapses (&lt;3%). Branches had a higher density of mitochondria and ER cisternae than branchlets and leaflets. Also, branches and branchlets displayed organelles more frequently than leaflets. Endosomes and phagosomes, which accounted for more than 60% of all the organelles detected, were often associated with the same PAP. Likewise, mitochondria and ER cisternae, representing ~40% of all organelles were usually associated. No differences were noted between the organelle distribution of the somatosensory and the anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, the organelle distribution in PAPs did not largely depend on the presence of a spine apparatus or a pre-synaptic mitochondrion in the synapse that PAPs were enwrapping, with some exceptions regarding the presence of phagosomes and ER cisternae, which were slightly more represented around synapses lacking a spine apparatus and a presynaptic mitochondrion, respectively. Thus, PAPs contain several subcellular organelles that could underlie the diverse astrocytic functions carried out at central synapses.</p>

<p>An essential step in researching human central nervous system (CNS) disorders is the search for appropriate mouse models that can be used to investigate both genetic and environmental factors underlying the etiology of such conditions. Identification of murine models relies upon detailed pre- and post-natal phenotyping since profound defects are not only the result of gross malformations but can be the result of small or subtle morphological abnormalities. The difficulties in identifying such defects are compounded by the finding that many mouse lines show quite a variable penetrance of phenotypes. As a result, without analysis of large numbers, such phenotypes are easily missed. Indeed for null mutations, around one-third have proved to be pre- or perinatally lethal, their analysis resting entirely upon phenotyping of accessible embryonic stages.To simplify the identification of potentially useful mouse mutants, we have conducted three-dimensional phenotype analysis of approximately 500 homozygous null mutant embryos, produced from targeting a variety of mouse genes and harvested at embryonic day 14.5 as part of the “Deciphering the Mechanisms of Developmental Disorders” www.dmdd.org.uk program. We have searched for anatomical features that have the potential to serve as biomarkers for CNS defects in such genetically modified lines. Our analysis identified two promising biomarker candidates. Hypoglossal nerve (HGN) abnormalities (absent, thin, and abnormal topology) and abnormal morphology or topology of head arteries are both frequently associated with the full spectrum of morphological CNS defects, ranging from exencephaly to more subtle defects such as abnormal nerve cell migration. Statistical analysis confirmed that HGN abnormalities (especially those scored absent or thin) indeed showed a significant correlation with CNS defect phenotypes. These results demonstrate that null mutant lines showing HGN abnormalities are also highly likely to produce CNS defects whose identification may be difficult as a result of morphological subtlety or low genetic penetrance.</p>

<p>The past decade has brought tremendous progress in diagnostic and therapeutic options for cerebrovascular diseases as exemplified by the advent of thrombectomy in ischemic stroke, benefitting a steeply increasing number of stroke patients and potentially paving the way for a renaissance of neuroprotectants. Progress in basic science has been equally impressive. Based on a deeper understanding of pathomechanisms underlying cerebrovascular diseases, new therapeutic targets have been identified and novel treatment strategies such as pre- and post-conditioning methods were developed. Moreover, translationally relevant aspects are increasingly recognized in basic science studies, which is believed to increase their predictive value and the relevance of obtained findings for clinical application.This review reports key results from some of the most remarkable and encouraging achievements in neurovascular research that have been reported at the 10th International Symposium on Neuroprotection and Neurorepair. Basic science topics discussed herein focus on aspects such as neuroinflammation, extracellular vesicles, and the role of sex and age on stroke recovery. Translational reports highlighted endovascular techniques and targeted delivery methods, neurorehabilitation, advanced functional testing approaches for experimental studies, pre-and post-conditioning approaches as well as novel imaging and treatment strategies. Beyond ischemic stroke, particular emphasis was given on activities in the fields of traumatic brain injury and cerebral hemorrhage in which promising preclinical and clinical results have been reported. Although the number of neutral outcomes in clinical trials is still remarkably high when targeting cerebrovascular diseases, we begin to evidence stepwise but continuous progress towards novel treatment options. Advances in preclinical and translational research as reported herein are believed to have formed a solid foundation for this progress.</p>

<p>Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) is an animal model of age-related central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Although SAMP8 shows deficits in learning, memory, and emotion, its motor coordination has not been clarified. We have recently reported that DGKγ-regulated PKCγ activity is important for cerebellar motor coordination. However, involvement of the functional correlation between the kinases in age-related motor dyscoordination still remains unknown. Therefore, we have investigated the motor coordination in SAMP8 and involvement of the functional correlation between DGKγ and PKCγ in the age-related motor dyscoordination. Although 6 weeks old SAMP8 showed equivalent motor coordination with control mice (SAMR1) in the rotarod test, 24 weeks old SAMP8 exhibited significantly less latency in the rotarod test and more frequent slips in the beam test compared to the age-matched SAMR1. Furthermore, 24 weeks old SAMP8 showed the higher locomotor activity in open field test and Y-maze test. Western blotting revealed that DGKγ expression decreased in the cerebellum of 24 weeks old SAMP8, while PKCγ was upregulated. These results suggest that SAMP8 is a useful model of age-related motor dysfunction and that the DGKγ-regulated PKCγ activity is involved in the age-related motor dyscoordination.</p>

<p>Brain aging is characterized by a time-dependent decline of tissue integrity and function, and it is a major risk for neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancer. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective form of autophagy specialized in protein degradation, which is based on the individual translocation of a cargo protein through the lysosomal membrane. Regulation of processes such as proteostasis, cellular energetics, or immune system activity has been associated with CMA, indicating its pivotal role in tissue homeostasis. Since first studies associating Parkinson’s disease (PD) to CMA dysfunction, increasing evidence points out that CMA is altered in both physiological and pathological brain aging. In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the impact of CMA during aging in brain physiopathology, highlighting the role of CMA in neurodegenerative diseases and glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive brain tumor in adults.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammation is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We sought to study the glial derangement in AD using diverse experimental models and human brain tissue. Besides classical pro-inflammatory cytokines, we analyzed chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL40) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) that are increasingly being associated with astrogliosis and microgliosis in AD, respectively. The SAMP8 mouse model of accelerated aging and AD traits showed elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated microglia phenotype. Furthermore, 6-month-old SAMP8 showed an exacerbated inflammatory response to peripheral lipopolysaccharide in the hippocampus and null responsiveness at the advanced age (for this strain) of 12 months. Gene expression of TREM2 was increased in the hippocampus of transgenic 5XFAD mice and in the cingulate cortex of autosomal dominant AD patients, and to a lesser extent in aged SAMP8 mice and sporadic early-onset AD patients. However, gene expression of CHI3L1 was increased in mice but not in human AD brain samples. The results support the relevance of microglia activation in the pathways leading to neurodegeneration and suggest diverse neuroinflammatory responses according to the AD process. Therefore, the SAMP8 mouse model with marked alterations in the dynamics of microglia activation and senescence may provide a complementary approach to transgenic mouse models for the study of the neuroinflammatory mechanisms underlying AD risk and progression.</p>

<p>Objective: We investigated the prevalence, evolution, associated factors, and risk factors of apathy in a cohort of patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), who underwent a 4-years prospective follow-up.</p><p>Methods: This study included 188 patients with PD (baseline disease duration &lt;3 years) who underwent an annual evaluation using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS). Based on the cut-off value of −21 observed on the LARS, patients were categorized as PD with and without apathy. The generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was utilized to determine the factors associated with apathy, and the Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to determine the predictors of apathy.</p><p>Results: Apathy increased from a baseline rate of 18.6–28.8% after 4 years; notably, this rate was not persistent across patients' visits. The LARS score was independently associated with the male sex (B 8.131, p = 0.009), low Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) scores (B 0.567, p = 0.011), low attention scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test (B 0.217, p = 0.026), high Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores (B 1.362, p &lt; 0.001), high Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III scores (B 1.147, p &lt; 0.001), and prolonged follow-up time (B 1.785, p = 0.048). A high HDRS score was the only predictor of apathy in PD [hazard ratio (HR) 1.043, p = 0.026].</p><p>Conclusions: The risk of apathy is higher in men with progressive PD accompanied by disease-specific motor and non-motor symptoms. Depression during early-stage PD is a primary risk factor for apathy in PD.</p>

<p>Background: Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) studies based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have revealed extensive abnormalities in white matter (WM) fibers of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the results were inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analytical approach was used in this study to find the most prominent and replicable WM abnormalities of PD.</p><p>Methods: Online databases were systematically searched for all TBSS studies comparing fractional anisotropy (FA) between patients with PD and controls. Subsequently, we performed the meta-analysis using a coordinate-based meta-analytic software called seed-based d mapping. Meanwhile, meta-regression was performed to explore the potential correlation between the alteration of FA and the clinical characteristics of PD.</p><p>Results: Out of a total of 1,701 studies that were identified, 23 studies were included. Thirty datasets, including 915 patients (543 men) with PD and 836 healthy controls (449 men), were included in the current study. FA reduction was identified in the body of the corpus callosum (CC; 245 voxels; z = −1.739; p &lt; 0.001) and the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) 118 voxels; z = −1.182; p &lt; 0.001). Both CC and IFOF maintained significance in the sensitivity analysis. No increase in FA was identified, but the percentage of male patients with PD was positively associated with the value of FA in the body of the CC.</p><p>Conclusions: Although some limitations exist, DTI is regarded as a valid way to identify the pathophysiology of PD. It could be more beneficial to integrate DTI parameters with other MRI techniques to explore brain degeneration in PD.</p>

<p>The reliable, valid and economic assessment of social cognition is more relevant than ever in the field of clinical psychology. Theory of Mind is one of the most important socio-cognitive abilities but standardized assessment instruments for adults are rare. The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is well-established and captures the ability to identify mental states from gaze. Here, we computed standard scores for the German version of the RMET derived from a large, community-dwelling sample of healthy adults (20–79 years). The standardization sample contains 966 healthy adult individuals of the population-based Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases (LIFE) study. Before standardization, weighting factors were applied to match the current sample with distribution characteristics of the German population regarding age, sex, and education. RMET scores were translated into percentage ranks for men and women of five age groups (20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60+ years). Age-specific percentage ranks are provided for men and women. Independent of age, men present a larger variance in test scores compared to women. Within the specific age groups, women score higher and their scoring range is less variable. With increasing age, the scoring variance increases in both men and women. This is the first study providing age- and sex-specific RMET standard scores. Data was weighted to match German population characteristics, enabling the application of standard scores across German-speaking areas. Our results contribute to the standardized assessment of socio-cognitive abilities in clinical diagnostics.</p>

<p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the functions and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA are largely unclear. Herein, we obtained 3,158 lncRNAs by microarray re-annotation. A global network of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) was developed for AD and normal samples were based on the gene expressions profiles. A total of 255 AD-deficient messenger RNA (mRNA)-lncRNAs were identified by the expression correlation analysis. Genes in the dysregulated ceRNAs were found to be mainly enriched in transcription factors and micro RNAs (miRNAs). Analysis of the disordered miRNA in the lncRNA-mRNA network revealed that 40 pairs of lncRNA shared more than one disordered miRNA. Among them, nine lncRNAs were closely associated with AD, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Of note, five lncRNAs were found to be potential biomarkers for AD. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assay revealed that PART1 was downregulated, while SNHG14 was upregulated in AD serum samples when compared to normal samples. This study elucidates the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD and presents new lncRNAs that can be exploited to design diagnostic and therapeutic agents for AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63677">Stem cell transplantation rescued a primary open-angle glaucoma mouse model</a></h4>

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. In this study, we investigated if exogenous stem cells are able to rescue a glaucoma mouse model with transgenic myocilin Y437H mutation and explored the possible mechanisms. Human trabecular meshwork stem cells (TMSCs) were intracamerally transplanted which reduced mouse intraocular pressure, increased outflow facility, protected the retinal ganglion cells and preserved their function. TMSC transplantation also significantly increased the TM cellularity, promoted myocilin secretion from TM cells into the aqueous humor to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress, repaired the TM tissue with extracellular matrix modulation and ultrastructural restoration. Co-culturing TMSCs with myocilin mutant TM cells in vitro promoted TMSCs differentiating into phagocytic functional TM cells. RNA sequencing revealed that TMSCs had upregulated genes related to TM regeneration and neuroprotection. Our results uncovered therapeutic potential of TMSCs for curing glaucoma and elucidated possible mechanisms by which TMSCs achieve the treatment effect.

Twins suffering a co-twin loss at birth have reported feelings of loneliness and grief while it remains unexplored if they suffer increased risk of psychiatric disorders. We contrasted rate of first-onset psychiatric disorders among all Swedish-born twins whose co-twin died within 60 days after birth between 1973 and 2011 (n = 787) to that of 3935 matched unexposed twins, 3935 matched singletons (both matched to the exposed twins by birth year, sex, and birth characteristics), and 880 full siblings of the exposed twins. During a median of 19-year follow-up, exposed twins were at increased risk of first-onset psychiatric disorders (hazard ratio = 1.56, 95%CI 1.30–1.87) compared with unexposed twins. We observed the strongest association for emotional disorders and for psychiatric disorders diagnosed before the age of 25. Comparisons with matched singletons and the twin’s full siblings rendered similar results, corroborating an association of loss of a co-twin at birth with subsequent risk of psychiatric disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62858">The rise and fall of the ancient northern pike master sex determining gene</a></h4>

The understanding of the evolution of variable sex determination mechanisms across taxa requires comparative studies among closely related species. Following the fate of a known master sex-determining gene, we traced the evolution of sex determination in an entire teleost order (Esociformes). We discovered that the northern pike (Esox lucius) master sex-determining gene originated from a 65 to 90 million-year-old gene duplication event and that it remained sex-linked on undifferentiated sex chromosomes for at least 56 million years in multiple species. We identified several independent species- or population-specific sex determination transitions, including a recent loss of a Y-chromosome. These findings highlight the diversity of evolutionary fates of master sex-determining genes and the importance of population demographic history in sex determination studies. We hypothesize that occasional sex reversals and genetic bottlenecks provide a non-adaptive explanation for sex determination transitions.

Derived from a common precursor cell, the balance between Th17 and Treg cells must be maintained within immune system to prevent autoimmune diseases. IL-1β-mediated IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling is essential for Th17-cell biology. Fine-tuning of IL-1R signaling is controlled by two receptors, IL-1RI and IL-RII, IL-1R accessory protein, and IL-1R antagonist. We demonstrate that the decoy receptor, IL-1RII, is important for regulating IL-17 responses in TCR-stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing functional IL-1RI via limiting IL-1β responsiveness. IL-1RII expression is regulated by NFAT via its interaction with Foxp3. The NFAT/FOXP3 complex binds to the <i>IL-1RII </i>promoter and is critical for its transcription. Additionally, IL-1RII expression is dysregulated in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, differential expression of IL-1Rs on activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells defines unique immunological features and a novel molecular mechanism underlies IL-1RII expression. These findings shed light on the modulatory effects of IL-1RII on Th17 responses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61710">An integrative model of cardiometabolic traits identifies two types of metabolic syndrome</a></h4>

Human diseases arise in a complex ecosystem composed of disease mechanisms and the whole-body state. However, the precise nature of the whole-body state and its relations with disease remain obscure. Here we map similarities among clinical parameters in normal physiological settings, including a large collection of metabolic, hemodynamic and immune parameters, and then use the mapping to dissect phenotypic states. We find that the whole-body state is faithfully represented by a quantitative two-dimensional model. One component of the whole-body state represents 'metabolic syndrome' (MetS) – a conventional way to determine the cardiometabolic state. The second component is decoupled from the classical MetS, suggesting a novel 'non-classical MetS' that is characterized by dozens of parameters, including dysregulated lipoprotein parameters (e.g. high LDL- cholesterol and low free cholesterol in small HDL particles) and attenuated cytokine responses of PBMCs to <i>ex vivo</i> stimulations. Both components are associated with disease, but differ in their particular associations, thus opening new avenues for improved personalized diagnosis and treatment. These results provide a practical paradigm to describe whole-body states and to dissect complex disease within the ecosystem of the human body.

Ligand binding stabilizes different G protein-coupled receptor states via a complex allosteric process that is not completely understood. Here, we have derived free energy landscapes describing activation of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor bound to ligands with different efficacy profiles using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These reveal shifts towards active-like states at the G protein binding site for receptors bound to partial and full agonists and that the ligands modulate the conformational ensemble of the receptor by tuning protein microswitches. We indeed find an excellent correlation between the conformation of the microswitches close to the ligand binding site and in the transmembrane region and experimentally reported cAMP signaling responses. Dimensionality reduction further reveals the similarity between the unique conformational states induced by different ligands and examining the output of classifiers highlights two distant hotspots governing agonism on transmembrane helices 5 and 7.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60710">Generation of stress fibers through myosin-driven re-organization of the actin cortex</a></h4>

Contractile actomyosin bundles, stress fibers, govern key cellular processes including migration, adhesion, and mechanosensing. Stress fibers are thus critical for developmental morphogenesis. The most prominent actomyosin bundles, ventral stress fibers, generated through coalescence of pre-existing stress fiber precursors. However, whether stress fibers can assemble through other mechanisms has remained elusive. We report that stress fibers can also form without requirement of pre-existing actomyosin bundles. These structures, which we named cortical stress fibers, are embedded in the cell cortex and assemble preferentially underneath the nucleus. In this process, non-muscle myosin II pulses orchestrate the reorganization of cortical actin meshwork into regular bundles, which promote reinforcement of nascent focal adhesions, and subsequent stabilization of the cortical stress fibers. These results identify a new mechanism by which stress fibers can be generated <i>de novo</i> from the actin cortex, and establish role for stochastic myosin pulses in the assembly of functional actomyosin bundles.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60095">Peripheral Natural Killer cells in chronic hepatitis B patients display multiple molecular features of T cell exhaustion</a></h4>

Antiviral effectors such as Natural Killer (NK) cells have impaired functions in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. The molecular mechanism responsible for this dysfunction remains poorly characterized. We show that decreased cytokine production capacity of peripheral NK cells from CHB patients was associated with reduced expression of NKp30 and CD16, and defective mTOR pathway activity. Transcriptome analysis of patients NK cells revealed an enrichment for transcripts expressed in exhausted T cells suggesting that NK cell dysfunction and T cell exhaustion employ common mechanisms. In particular, the transcription factor TOX and several of its targets were over-expressed in NK cells of CHB patients. This signature was predicted to be dependent on the calcium-associated transcription factor NFAT. Stimulation of the calcium-dependent pathway recapitulated features of NK cells from CHB patients. Thus, deregulated calcium signalling could be a central event in both T cell exhaustion and NK cell dysfunction occurring during chronic infections.

The availability of the cellular prion protein PrPC is limiting to prion replication, and its reduction greatly increases life expectancy in animal models of prion infection. Hence the proteins and the biochemical pathways controlling the biosynthesis and the degradation of PrPC may represent therapeutic targets. Here we performed an arrayed whole-transcriptome RNA interference screen to identify modulators of PrPC. We cultured human U251-MG glioblastoma cells in the presence of 64.752 unique siRNAs targeting 21.584 annotated human genes, and measured PrPC using a one-pot fluorescence resonance energy transfer immunoassay in 51.128 individual microplate wells. This screen yielded 743 candidate regulators of PrPC, which were then filtered through multiple secondary screens. Recursive candidate attrition yielded 54 novel regulators of PrPC, nine of which emerged as robust regulators of PrPC biosynthesis and degradation by transcriptional suppression in a CRISPR-interference validation screen. Six candidates were found to regulate PrPC in the opposite direction when transcriptionally activated using CRISPRa. The RNA-binding post-transcriptional repressor Pumilio-1 was identified as a potent modulator of PrPC through the degradation of PRNP mRNA. Because of its hypothesis-free design, the present listing paints an unbiased landscape of the genes regulating PrPC levels in cells, most of which were unanticipated, and some of which may be amenable to pharmacological targeting in the context of antiprion therapies.

Human brain organoids replicate much of the cellular diversity and developmental anatomy of the human brain. However, the physiological behavior of neuronal circuits within organoids remains relatively under-explored. With high-density CMOS microelectrode arrays and shank electrodes, we probed broadband and three-dimensional spontaneous activity of human brain organoids. These recordings simultaneously captured local field potentials (LFPs) and single unit activity. From spiking activity, we estimated a directed functional connectivity graph of synchronous neural network activity which showed a large number of weak functional connections enmeshed within a network skeleton of significantly fewer strong connections. Increasing the intrinsic inhibitory tone with a benzodiazepine altered the functional network graph of the organoid by suppressing the network skeleton. Simultaneously examining the spontaneous LFPs and their phase alignment to spiking showed that spike bursts were coherent with theta oscillations in the LFPs. An ensemble of spikes phase-locked to theta frequency oscillations were strongly interconnected as a sub-network within the larger network in which they were embedded. Our results demonstrate that human brain organoids have self-organized neuronal assemblies of sufficient size, cellular orientation, and functional connectivity to co-activate and generate field potentials from their collective transmembrane currents that phase-lock to spiking activity. These results point to the potential of brain organoids for the study of neuropsychiatric diseases, drug mechanisms, and the effects of external stimuli upon neuronal networks.

Purkinje cells (PCs) are central to cerebellar information coding and appreciation for the diversity of their firing patterns and molecular profiles is growing. Heterogeneous subpopulations of PCs have been identified that display differences in intrinsic firing properties without clear mechanistic insight into what underlies the divergence in firing parameters. Although long used as a general PC marker, we report that the calcium binding protein parvalbumin labels a subpopulation of PCs with a conserved distribution pattern across the animals examined. We trained a convolutional neural network to recognize the parvalbumin-positive subtype and create maps of whole cerebellar distribution and find that PCs within these areas have differences in spontaneous firing that can be modified by altering calcium buffer content. These subtypes also show differential responses to potassium and calcium channel blockade, suggesting a mechanistic role for variability in PC intrinsic firing through differences in ion channel composition. It is proposed that ion channels drive the diversity in PC intrinsic firing phenotype and parvalbumin calcium buffering provides capacity for the highest firing rates observed. These findings open new avenues for detailed classification of PC subtypes.

Neuronal dendritic spine dynamics provide a plasticity mechanism for altering brain circuit connectivity to integrate new information for learning and memory. Previous in vivo studies in the olfactory bulb (OB) showed that regional increases in activity caused localized spine stability, at a population level, yet how activity affects spine dynamics at an individual neuron level remains unknown. In this study, we tracked in vivo the correlation between an individual neuron's activity and its dendritic spine dynamics of OB granule cell (GC) interneurons. Odor experience caused a consistent correlation between individual GC activity and spine stability. Dissecting the components of the OB circuit showed that increased principal cell (MC) activity was sufficient to drive this correlation, whereas cell-autonomously driven GC activity had no effect. A mathematical model was able to replicate the GC activity-spine stability correlation and showed MC output having improved odor discriminability while retaining odor memory. These results reveal that GC spine plasticity provides a sufficient network mechanism to decorrelate odors and maintain a memory trace.

Autoantibodies targeting the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) hallmark an autoimmune encephalitis presenting with frequent seizures and psychomotor abnormalities. Their pathogenic role is still not well-defined, given the common overlap with further autoantibodies and the lack of patient derived monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We cloned and recombinantly produced five affinity-maturated GABAAR IgG1 mAbs from cerebrospinal fluid cells, which bound to various epitopes involving 1 and {gamma}2 receptor subunits, with variable binding strength and partial competition. mAbs selectively reduced GABAergic currents in neuronal cultures without causing receptor internalization. Cerebroventricular infusion of GABAAR mAbs and Fab fragments into rodents induced a severe phenotype with catatonia, seizures and increased mortality, reminiscent of encephalitis patients' symptoms. Our results prove direct functional effects of autoantibodies on GABAARs and provide an animal model for GABAAR encephalitis. They further provide the scientific rationale for clinical treatments using antibody depletion and pave the way for future antibody-selective immunotherapies.

Compromised endocytosis in neurons leads to synapse overgrowth and altered organization of synaptic proteins. However, the molecular players and the signaling pathways which regulate the process remains poorly understood.  Here we show that {sigma}2-adaptin, one of the subunits of the AP2-complex, genetically interacts with BMP type I receptor, Thickveins (Tkv), and Daughter against decapentaplegic (Dad), two of the components of BMP signaling. We found that mutations in {sigma}2-adaptin lead to an accumulation of Tkv receptors at the NMJ and results in a significant reduction in Tkv-positive early endosomes in the presynaptic terminals. Interestingly, the level of small GTPase Rab11 was significantly reduced in the {sigma}2-adaptin mutant synapses. Consistent with the role of {sigma}2-adaptin and Rab11 in the regulation of the same signaling pathway, a mutation in Rab11 or overexpression of a GDP-locked form of Rab11 (Rab11 S25N ) phenocopies the morphological and signaling defects of the {sigma}2-adaptin mutants. Finally, we demonstrate that {sigma}2-adaptin mutants show an accumulation of large vesicles and massive membranous structures, akin to endosomes at the synapse. Thus, we propose a model in which AP2 regulates Tkv internalization and recycling through a process that requires Rab11 activity to control the synaptic growth.

Statistical learning (SL) is the ability to extract regularities from the environment. In the domain of language, this ability is fundamental in the learning of words and structural rules. In lack of reliable online measures, statistical word and rule learning have been primarily investigated using offline (post-familiarization) tests, which gives limited insights into the dynamics of SL and its neural basis. Here, we capitalize on a novel task that tracks the online statistical learning of language rules combined with computational modelling to show that online SL responds to reinforcement learning principles rooted in striatal function. Specifically, we demonstrate - on two different cohorts - that a Temporal Difference model, which relies on prediction errors, accounts for participants online learning behavior. We then show that the trial-by-trial development of predictions through learning strongly correlates with activity in both ventral and dorsal striatum. Our results thus provide a detailed mechanistic account of language-related SL and an explanation for the oft-cited implication of the striatum in SL tasks. This work, therefore, bridges the longstanding gap between language learning and reinforcement learning phenomena.

We combined in situ sequencing gene expression data and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing cell type definitions to spatially map cells in sections of the human cortex via probabilistic cell typing. We mapped and classified a total of 59,816 cells into all 75 previously defined subtypes to create a first spatial atlas of human cortical cells in their native position, their abundances and genetic signatures.

Brain oscillations have been demonstrated to support information transfer between neurons in animal models of memory. However, direct evidence for a similar role of oscillations in humans has so far remained unclear. Here we show that theta and gamma oscillations in the medial-temporal-lobe synchronize neural firing during a memory task. We observe that faster oscillations at theta- and gamma frequencies correlate with co-firing of neurons at short latencies (~20-30 ms) and occur during successful memory formation. Slower oscillations in these same frequency bands, by contrast, correlate with longer co-firing latencies and occur during memory failure. A computational model supports the present effects and links these findings to synaptic plasticity. Together, the results support the long-standing assumption that correlated neural firing supports human episodic memory formation.

Background: Hippocampus can be divided along its longitudinal axis into dorsal and ventral parts. Both are usually committed to modulate different aspects of behavior and stress response. However, it is not clear whether the hippocampal subregions could differently modulate the effect of antidepressant drugs. Since fluoxetine (FLX) effect on extinction of aversive memory is well known to depend on hippocampal BDNF levels, we hypothesized that the hippocampal subregions might play different roles in fluoxetine efficacy in decreasing fear response. Method: Wistar rats were fear-cued conditioned and treated chronically with fluoxetine to enhance their subsequent extinction memory. First, FLX effect on BDNF levels was assessed considering the dorsal (dHC) and ventral (vHC) hippocampus apart. Then, K252a (a functional Trk blocker) was infused either into the dHC or vHC to assay its interaction with FLX treatment over the fear response. Next, BDNF was directly infused into either the dHC or vHC to compare its behavioral effects with FLX. Finally, FLX effect on c-Fos expression was evaluated also considering the dHC and vHC apart, along with subareas of amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex. Results: Chronic FLX treatment increased BDNF in the dHC, whereas BDNF was increased in the vHC after acute treatment only. K252a infused after the extinction protocol into either dHC or vHC was able to prevent FLX effect on fear response. BDNF directly infused into the dHC increased fear response, however its administration into the vHC induced an opposite effect. Besides, a negative correlation between the fear response and c-Fos expression was observed after chronic FLX treatment specifically in the dHC CA3/CA1 and vHC CA1/DG. Conclusion: Both dHC and vHC are important for the Trk-dependent FLX effect on extinction memory, although a discrepancy on the fear response was observed with the direct infusion of BDNF into the dHC or vHC.

Larval Drosophila are used as a genetically accessible study case in many areas of biological research. Here we report a fast, robust and user-friendly procedure for the whole-body multi-fluorescence imaging of Drosophila larvae; the protocol has been optimized specifically for larvae by systematically tackling the pitfalls associated with clearing this small but cuticularized organism. Tests on various fluorescent proteins reveal that the recently introduced monomeric infrared fluorescent protein (mIFP) is particularly suitable for our approach. This approach comprises an effective, low-cost clearing protocol with minimal handling time and reduced toxicity in the reagents employed. It combines a success rate high enough to allow for small-scale screening approaches and a resolution sufficient for cellular-resolution analyses with light sheet and confocal microscopy. Given that publications and database documentations typically specify expression patterns of transgenic driver lines only within a given organ system of interest, the present procedure should be versatile enough to extend such documentation systematically to the whole body. As examples, the expression patterns of transgenic driver lines covering the majority of neurons, or subsets of chemosensory, central brain or motor neurons, are documented in the context of whole larval body volumes (using nsyb-Gal4, IR76b-Gal4, APL-Gal4 and mushroom body Kenyon cells, or OK371-Gal4, respectively). Notably, the presented protocol allows for triple-color fluorescence imaging with near-infrared, red and yellow fluorescent proteins.

Intron retention (IR) is now recognized as a dominant splicing event during motor neuron (MN) development, however the role and regulation of intron-retaining transcripts (IRTs) localized to the cytoplasm remain particularly understudied. By resolving the spatiotemporal dynamics of IR underlying distinct stages of MN lineage restriction, we identify a cytoplasmic group of IRTs that is not associated with reduced expression of their own genes but instead with an upregulation of predicted target genes of specific miRNAs, the motifs of which are enriched within the intronic sequences of this group. Next, we show that ALS-causing VCP mutations lead to a selective increase in IR of this particular class of introns. This in turn temporally coincides with an increase in the expression level of predicted target genes of these miRNAs, providing a potential mechanistic insight into ALS pathogenesis. Altogether, we propose a novel role for the cytoplasmic intronic sequences in regulating miRNA activity through miRNA sequestration, which potentially contributes to ALS pathogenesis.

Dendritic spine dynamics of Layer 5 Pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) are thought to be physical substrates for motor learning and memory of motor skills and altered spine dynamics are frequently correlated with poor motor performance. Here we describe an exception to this rule by studying mice lacking Paired immunoglobulin receptor B (PirB-/-). Using chronic two-photon imaging of primary motor cortex (M1) of PirB-/-;Thy1-YFP-H mice, we found a significant increase in the survival of spines on apical dendritic tufts of L5PNs, as well as increased spine formation rates and spine density. Surprisingly and contrary to expectations, adult PirB-/- mice learn a skilled reaching task more rapidly compared to wild type (WT) littermate controls. Conditional excision of PirB from forebrain pyramidal neurons in adult mice replicated these results. Furthermore, chronic imaging of L5PN dendrites throughout the learning period revealed that the stabilization of learning-induced newly formed spines is significantly elevated in PirB-/- mice. The degree of survival of newly formed spines in M1 yielded the strongest correlation with task performance, suggesting that this increased spine stability is advantageous and can translate into enhanced acquisition and maintenance of motor skills. Notably, inhibiting PirB function acutely in M1 of adult WT mice throughout training increases the survival of spines formed during early training and enhances motor learning. These results suggest that increasing the stability of newly formed spines is sufficient to improve long-lasting learning and motor performance and demonstrate that there are limits on motor learning that can be lifted by manipulating PirB, even in adulthood.

Laser microsurgery has long been an important means of assessing the functions of specific cells and tissues. Most laser ablation systems use short, highly focused laser pulses to create plasma-mediated lesions with dimensions on the order of the wavelength of light. While the small size of the lesion enables ablation with high spatial resolution, it also makes it difficult to ablate larger structures. We developed an infrared laser ablation system capable of thermally lesioning tissues with spot sizes tunable by the duration and amplitude of laser pulses. We used our laser system in the roundworm C. elegans to kill single neurons and to sever the dorsal and ventral nerve cords, structures that are difficult to lesion using a plasma-based ablation system. We used these ablations to investigate the source of convulsions in a gain-of-function mutant for the acetylcholine receptor ACR-2. Severing the ventral nerve cord caused convulsions to occur independently anterior and posterior to the lesion, suggesting that convulsions can arise independently from distinct subsets of the motor circuit.

Despite the emergence of promising therapeutic approaches in preclinical studies, the failure of large-scale clinical trials leaves clinicians without effective treatments for acute spinal cord injury (SCI). These trials are hindered by their reliance on detailed neurological examinations to establish outcomes, which inflate the time and resources required for completion. Moreover, therapeutic development takes place in animal models whose relevance to human injury remains unclear. Here, we address these challenges through targeted proteomic analyses of CSF and serum samples from 111 acute SCI patients and, in parallel, a large animal (porcine) model of SCI. We develop protein biomarkers of injury severity and recovery, including a prognostic model of neurological improvement at six months with an AUC of 0.91, and validate these in an independent cohort. Through cross-species proteomic analyses, we dissect evolutionarily conserved and divergent aspects of the SCI response, and establish the CSF abundance of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as a biochemical outcome measure in both humans and pigs. Our work opens up new avenues to catalyze translation by facilitating the evaluation of novel SCI therapies, while also providing a resource from which to direct future preclinical efforts.

The enormous neuronal cellular diversity in the mammalian brain, which is highly prototypical and organized in a hierarchical manner, is dictated by cell type-specific gene regulatory programs at the molecular level. Although prevalent in the brain, contribution of alternative splicing (AS) to the molecular diversity across neuronal cell types is just starting to emerge. Here we systematically investigated AS regulation across over 100 transcriptomically defined neuronal types of the adult mouse cortex using deep single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We found distinct splicing programs between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons and between subclasses within each neuronal class, consisting of overlapping sets of alternative exons showing differential splicing at multiple hierarchical levels. Using an integrative approach, our analysis suggests that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) Celf1/2, Mbnl2 and Khdrbs3 are preferentially expressed and more active in glutamatergic neurons, while Elavl2 and Qk are preferentially expressed and more active in GABAergic neurons. Importantly, these and additional RBPs also contribute to differential splicing between neuronal subclasses at multiple hierarchical levels, and some RBPs drive splicing dynamics that do not conform to the hierarchical structure defined by the transcriptional profiles. Thus, our results suggest graded regulation of AS across neuronal cell types, which provides a molecular mechanism orthogonal to, rather than downstream of, transcriptional regulation in specifying neuronal identity and function.

Mapping of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads to a single arbitrary reference genome is a frequently used approach in microbial genomics. However, the choice of a reference may represent a source of errors that may affect subsequent analyses such as the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phylogenetic inference. In this work, we evaluated the effect of reference choice on short-read sequence data from five clinically and epidemiologically relevant bacteria (<i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Legionella pneumophila</i>, <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Serratia marcescens</i>). Publicly available whole-genome assemblies encompassing the genomic diversity of these species were selected as reference sequences, and read alignment statistics, SNP calling, recombination rates, d<i>N</i>/d<i>S</i> ratios, and phylogenetic trees were evaluated depending on the mapping reference. The choice of different reference genomes proved to have an impact on almost all the parameters considered in the five species. In addition, these biases had potential epidemiological implications such as including/excluding isolates of particular clades and the estimation of genetic distances. These findings suggest that the single reference approach might introduce systematic errors during mapping that affect subsequent analyses, particularly for data sets with isolates from genetically diverse backgrounds. In any case, exploring the effects of different references on the final conclusions is highly recommended.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PhvpX7yeFZg" width="1" />

<p>by Jun Li, Juliane Manitz, Enrico Bertuzzo, Eric D. Kolaczyk</p>

We investigate the source detection problem in epidemiology, which is one of the most important issues for control of epidemics. Mathematically, we reformulate the problem as one of identifying the relevant component in a multivariate Gaussian mixture model. Focusing on the study of cholera and diseases with similar modes of transmission, we calibrate the parameters of our mixture model using human mobility networks within a stochastic, spatially explicit epidemiological model for waterborne disease. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian perspective, so that prior information on source location can be incorporated (e.g., reflecting the impact of local conditions). Posterior-based inference is performed, which permits estimates in the form of either individual locations or regions. Importantly, our estimator only requires first-arrival times of the epidemic by putative observers, typically located only at a small proportion of nodes. The proposed method is demonstrated within the context of the 2000-2002 cholera outbreak in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dIhEt4T9o-0" width="1" />

Objective
Diagnosing autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is difficult in patients with less fulminant diseases such as epilepsy. However, recognition is important, as patients require immunotherapy. This study aims to identify antibodies in patients with focal epilepsy of unknown etiology, and to create a score to preselect patients requiring testing.


Methods
In this prospective, multicenter cohort study, adults with focal epilepsy of unknown etiology, without recognized AIE, were included, between December 2014 and December 2017, and followed for 1 year. Serum, and if available cerebrospinal fluid, were analyzed using different laboratory techniques. The ACES score was created using factors favoring an autoimmune etiology of seizures (AES), as determined by multivariate logistic regression. The model was externally validated and evaluated using the Concordance (C) statistic.


Results
We included 582 patients, with median epilepsy duration of 8 years (interquartile range = 2–18). Twenty patients (3.4%) had AES, of whom 3 had anti–leucine‐rich glioma inactivated 1, 3 had anti–contactin‐associated protein‐like 2, 1 had anti–N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor, and 13 had anti–glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay concentrations &gt;10,000IU/ml). Risk factors for AES were temporal magnetic resonance imaging hyperintensities (odds ratio [OR] = 255.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 19.6–3332.2, p &lt; 0.0001), autoimmune diseases (OR = 13.31, 95% CI = 3.1–56.6, p = 0.0005), behavioral changes (OR 12.3, 95% CI = 3.2–49.9, p = 0.0003), autonomic symptoms (OR = 13.3, 95% CI = 3.1–56.6, p = 0.0005), cognitive symptoms (OR = 30.6, 95% CI = 2.4–382.7, p = 0.009), and speech problems (OR = 9.6, 95% CI = 2.0–46.7, p = 0.005). The internally validated C statistic was 0.95, and 0.92 in the validation cohort (n = 128). Assigning each factor 1 point, an antibodies contributing to focal epilepsy signs and symptoms (ACES) score ≥ 2 had a sensitivity of 100% to detect AES, and a specificity of 84.9%.


Interpretation
Specific signs point toward AES in focal epilepsy of unknown etiology. The ACES score (cutoff ≥ 2) is useful to select patients requiring antibody testing. ANN NEUROL 2021

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26031?af=R">Impact of Global Health Electives on Neurology Trainees</a></h4>

We surveyed neurologists who completed a global health experience as residents or fellows to assess the impact of the experience. 100% (n=72) would recommend the experience to others. Most reported improved clinical (86%) and examination (82%) skills. All gained an understanding of different healthcare systems, and 83% reported deeper commitment to underserved populations. 41 participants (57%) reported more judicious use of resources upon return to the United States. Global health electives had a positive impact on neurology trainees. More attention to the host country perspective and predeparture training may help inform program structure and participant expectations in the future.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26032?af=R">Heritability enrichment implicates microglia in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis</a></h4>

Objective
Understanding how different parts of the immune system contribute to pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease is a burning challenge with important therapeutic implications. We studied enrichment of common variant heritability for Parkinson's disease stratified by immune and brain cell types.


Methods
We used summary statistics from the most recent meta‐analysis of genome‐wide association studies in Parkinson's disease and partitioned heritability using linkage disequilibrium score regression, stratified for specific cell types as defined by open chromatin regions. We also validated enrichment results using a polygenic risk score approach and intersected disease‐associated variants with epigenetic data and expression quantitative loci to nominate and explore a putative microglial locus.


Results
We found significant enrichment of Parkinson's disease risk heritability in open chromatin regions of microglia and monocytes. Genomic annotations overlapped substantially between these two cell types, and only the enrichment signal for microglia remained significant in a joint model. We present evidence suggesting P2RY12, a key microglial gene and target for the anti‐thrombotic agent clopidogrel, as the likely driver of a significant Parkinson's disease association signal on chromosome 3.


Interpretation
Our results provide further support for the importance of immune mechanisms in PD pathogenesis, highlight microglial dysregulation as a contributing etiological factor and nominate a targetable microglial gene candidate as a pathogenic player. Immune processes can be modulated by therapy, with potentially important clinical implications for future treatment in Parkinson's disease.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10953">Predicting the future with a scale-invariant temporal memory for the past. (arXiv:2101.10953v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>In recent years it has become clear that the brain maintains a temporal
memory of recent events stretching far into the past. This paper presents a
neurally-inspired algorithm to use a scale-invariant temporal representation of
the past to predict a scale-invariant future. The result is a scale-invariant
estimate of future events as a function of the time at which they are expected
to occur. The algorithm is time-local, with credit assigned to the present
event by observing how it affects the prediction of the future. To illustrate
the potential utility of this approach, we test the model on simultaneous
renewal processes with different time scales. The algorithm scales well on
these problems despite the fact that the number of states needed to describe
them as a Markov process grows exponentially.

<p>The combining of a General-Purpose Particle Swarm Optimizer (GP-PSO) with
Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm for constrained optimization
problems has been shown to be highly beneficial to the refinement, and in some
cases, the success of finding a global optimum solution. It is shown that the
likely difference between leading algorithms are in their local search ability.
A comparison with other leading optimizers on the tested benchmark suite,
indicate the hybrid GP-PSO with implemented local search to compete along side
other leading PSO algorithms.

<p>The study of neurons is fundamental for basic neuroscience research and treatment of neurological disorders. In recent years ultrasound has been increasingly recognized as a viable method to stimulate neurons. However, traditional ultrasound transducers are limited in the scope of their application by self-heating effects, limited frequency range and cavitation effects during neuromodulation. In contrast, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, which are producing wavemodes with increasing application in biomedical devices, generate less self-heating, are smaller and create less cavitation. SAW devices thus have the potential to address some of the drawbacks of traditional ultrasound transducers and could be implemented as miniaturized wearable or implantable devices. In this mini review, we discuss the potential mechanisms of SAW-based neuromodulation, including mechanical displacement, electromagnetic fields, thermal effects, and acoustic streaming. We also review the application of SAW actuation for neuronal stimulation, including growth and neuromodulation. Finally, we propose future directions for SAW-based neuromodulation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.627627">Evaluation of Cerebral Blood Flow Measured by 3D PCASL as Biomarker of Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) in a Cohort of Elderly Latinx Subjects at Risk of Small Vessel Disease</a></h4>

<p>Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) affects arterioles, capillaries, and venules and can lead to cognitive impairments and clinical symptomatology of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). VCID symptoms are similar to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but the neurophysiologic alterations are less well studied, resulting in no established biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured by 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) as a potential biomarker of VCID in a cohort of elderly Latinx subjects at risk of cSVD. Forty-five elderly Latinx subjects (12 males, 69 ± 7 years) underwent repeated MRI scans ∼6 weeks apart. CBF was measured using 3D pCASL in the whole brain, white matter and 4 main vascular territories (leptomeningeal anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery (leptoACA, leptoMCA, leptoPCA), as well as MCA perforator). The test-retest repeatability of CBF was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV). Absolute and relative CBF was correlated with gross cognitive measures and domain specific assessment of executive and memory function, vascular risks, and Fazekas scores and volumes of white matter hyperintensity (WMH). Neurocognitive evaluations were performed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and neuropsychological test battery in the Uniform Data Set v3 (UDS3). Good to excellent test-retest repeatability was achieved (ICC = 0.77–0.85, wsCV 3–9%) for CBF measurements in the whole brain, white matter, and 4 vascular territories. Relative CBF normalized by global mean CBF in the leptoMCA territory was positively correlated with the executive function composite score, while relative CBF in the leptoMCA and MCA perforator territory was positively correlated with MoCA scores, controlling for age, gender, years of education, and testing language. Relative CBF in WM was negatively correlated with WMH volume and MoCA scores, while relative leptoMCA CBF was positively correlated with WMH volume. Reliable 3D pCASL CBF measurements were achieved in the cohort of elderly Latinx subjects. Relative CBF in the leptomeningeal and perforator MCA territories were the most likely candidate biomarker of VCID. These findings need to be replicated in larger cohorts with greater variability of stages of cSVD.</p>

<p>Neuronal excitation and inhibition occur in the brain at the same time, and brain activation reflects changes in the sum of excitation and inhibition. This principle has been well-established in lower-level sensory systems, including vision and touch, based on animal studies. However, it is unclear how the somatosensory system processes the balance between excitation and inhibition. In the present ERP study, we modified the traditional spatial attention paradigm by adding double stimuli presentations at short intervals (i.e., 10, 30, and 100 ms). Seventeen subjects participated in the experiment. Five types of stimulation were used in the experiment: a single stimulus (one raised pin for 40 ms), standard stimulus (eight pins for 40 ms), and double stimuli presented at intervals of 10, 30, and 100 ms. The subjects were asked to attend to a particular finger and detect whether the standard stimulus was presented to that finger. The results showed a clear attention-related ERP component in the single stimulus condition, but the suppression components associated with the three interval conditions seemed to be dominant in somatosensory areas. In particular, we found the strongest suppression effect in the ISI-30 condition (interval of 30 ms) and that the suppression and enhancement effects seemed to be counterbalanced in both the ISI-10 and ISI-100 conditions (intervals of 10 and 100 ms, respectively). This type of processing may allow humans to easily discriminate between multiple stimuli on the same body part.</p>

<p>Several decades of behavioral research have established that variations in socioeconomic status (SES) are related to differences in cognitive performance. Neuroimaging and psychophysiological techniques have recently emerged as a method of choice to better understand the neurobiological processes underlying this phenomenon. Here we present a systematic review of a particular sub-domain of this field. Specifically, we used the PICOS approach to review studies investigating potential relationships between SES and scalp event-related brain potentials (ERP). This review found evidence that SES is related to amplitude variations in a diverse range of ERPs: P1, N1, N2, Error-Related Negativities (ERN), N400, auditory evoked potentials, negative difference waves (Nd), P3 and slow waves (SW). These ERPs include early, mid-latency and late potentials that reflect a broad range of cognitive processes (e.g., automatic attentional processes, overt attention, language, executive function, etc.). In this review, all SES effects on ERPs appeared to reflect an impairment or a less efficient form of task-related neural activity for low-SES compared to high-SES individuals. Overall, these results confirm that a wide variety of distinct neural processes with different functional meanings are sensitive to SES differences. The findings of this review also suggest that the relationship between SES and some ERP components may depend on the developmental stage of study participants. Results are further discussed in terms of the current limitations of this field and future avenues of research.</p>

<p>Adaptive behavior critically depends on performance monitoring (PM), the ability to monitor action outcomes and the need to adapt behavior. PM-related brain activity has been linked to guiding decisions about whether action adaptation is warranted. The present study examined whether PM-related brain activity in a flanker task, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), was associated with adaptive behavior in daily life. Specifically, we were interested in the employment of self-control, operationalized as self-control failures (SCFs), and measured using ecological momentary assessment. Analyses were conducted using an adaptive elastic net regression to predict SCFs from EEG in a sample of 131 participants. The model was fit using within-subject averaged response-locked EEG activity at each electrode and time point within an epoch surrounding the response. We found that higher amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) were related to fewer SCFs. This suggests that lower error-related activity may relate to lower recruitment of interventive self-control in daily life. Altered cognitive control processes, like PM, have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for various mental disorders. Understanding how alterations in PM relate to regulatory control might therefore aid in delineating how these alterations contribute to different psychopathologies.</p>

<p>For patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), deficits in gait significantly reduce the quality of life. Using the concept of muscle synergies, this study investigated the modular organization of motor control during level and inclined walking in MS patients (MSP) compared with healthy participants (HP) to identify the potential demand-specific adjustments in motor control in MSP. We hypothesized a widening of the time-dependent activation patterns (motor primitives) in MSP to increase the overlap of temporally-adjacent muscle synergies, especially during inclined walking, as a strategy to increase the robustness of motor control, thus compensating pathology-related deficits. We analyzed temporal gait parameters and muscle synergies from myoelectric signals of 13 ipsilateral leg muscles using non-negative matrix factorization. Compared with HP, MSP demonstrated a widening in the time-dependent coefficients (motor primitives), as well as altered relative muscle contribution (motor modules), in certain synergies during level and inclined walking. Moreover, inclined walking revealed a demand-specific adjustment in the modular organization in MSP, resulting in an extra synergy compared with HP. This further increased the overlap of temporally-adjacent muscle synergies to provide sufficient robustness in motor control to accomplish the more demanding motor task while coping with pathology-related motor deficits during walking.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.531893">Is This Within Reach? Left but Not Right Brain Damage Affects Affordance Judgment Tendencies</a></h4>

<p>The ability to judge accurately whether or not an action can be accomplished successfully is critical for selecting appropriate response options that enable adaptive behaviors. Such affordance judgments are thought to rely on the perceived fit between environmental properties and knowledge of one's current physical capabilities. Little, however, is currently known about the ability of individuals to judge their own affordances following a stroke, or about the underlying neural mechanisms involved. To address these issues, we employed a signal detection approach to investigate the impact of left or right hemisphere injuries on judgments of whether a visual object was located within reach while remaining still (i.e., reachability). Regarding perceptual sensitivity and accuracy in judging reachability, there were no significant group differences between healthy controls (N = 29), right brain damaged (RBD, N = 17) and left brain damaged stroke patients (LBD, N = 17). However, while healthy controls and RBD patients demonstrated a negative response criterion and thus overestimated their reach capability, LBD patients' average response criterion converged to zero, indicating no judgment tendency. Critically, the LBD group's judgment tendency pattern is consistent with previous findings in this same sample on an affordance judgment task that required estimating whether the hand can fit through apertures (Randerath et al., 2018). Lesion analysis suggests that this loss of judgment tendency may be associated with damage to the left insula, the left parietal and middle temporal lobe. Based on these results, we propose that damage to the left ventro-dorsal stream disrupts the retrieval and processing of a stable criterion, leading to stronger reliance on intact on-line body-perceptive processes computed within the preserved bilateral dorsal network.</p>

<p>Every year thousands of patients are diagnosed with a glioma, a type of malignant brain tumor. MRI plays an essential role in the diagnosis and treatment assessment of these patients. Neural networks show great potential to aid physicians in the medical image analysis. This study investigated the creation of synthetic brain T1-weighted (T1), post-contrast T1-weighted (T1CE), T2-weighted (T2), and T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (Flair) MR images. These synthetic MR (synMR) images were assessed quantitatively with four metrics. The synMR images were also assessed qualitatively by an authoring physician with notions that synMR possessed realism in its portrayal of structural boundaries but struggled to accurately depict tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, this study investigated the synMR images created by generative adversarial network (GAN) to overcome the lack of annotated medical image data in training U-Nets to segment enhancing tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core regions on gliomas. Multiple two-dimensional (2D) U-Nets were trained with original BraTS data and differing subsets of the synMR images. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as the loss function during training as well a quantitative metric. Additionally, Hausdorff Distance 95% CI (HD) was used to judge the quality of the contours created by these U-Nets. The model performance was improved in both DSC and HD when incorporating synMR in the training set. In summary, this study showed the ability to generate high quality Flair, T2, T1, and T1CE synMR images using GAN. Using synMR images showed encouraging results to improve the U-Net segmentation performance and shows potential to address the scarcity of annotated medical images.</p>

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a destructive form of stroke that often results in death or disability. However, the survivors usually experience sequelae of neurological impairments and psychiatric disorders, which affect their daily functionality and working capacity. The recent MISTIE III and STICH II trials have confirmed that early surgical clearance of hematomas does not improve the prognosis of survivors of ICH, so it is vital to find the intervention target of secondary brain injury (SBI) after ICH. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which may be induced by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and autophagy, among others, is considered to be a novel pathological mechanism of ICH. Moreover, mitochondria play an important role in promoting neuronal survival and improving neurological function after a hemorrhagic stroke. This review summarizes the mitochondrial mechanism involved in cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammatory activation, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and brain edema underlying ICH. We emphasize the potential of mitochondrial protection as a potential therapeutic target for SBI after stroke and provide valuable insight into clinical strategies.</p>

<p>The transcription factor foxo is a known regulator of lifespan extension and tissue homeostasis. It has been linked to the maintenance of neuronal processes across many species and has been shown to promote youthful characteristics by regulating cytoskeletal flexibility and synaptic plasticity at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). However, the role of foxo in aging neuromuscular junction function has yet to be determined. We profiled adult Drosophila foxo- null mutant abdominal ventral longitudinal muscles and found that young mutants exhibited morphological profiles similar to those of aged wild-type flies, such as larger bouton areas and shorter terminal branches. We also observed changes to the axonal cytoskeleton and an accumulation of late endosomes in foxo null mutants and motor neuron-specific foxo knockdown flies, similar to those of aged wild-types. Motor neuron-specific overexpression of foxo can delay age-dependent changes to NMJ morphology, suggesting foxo is responsible for maintaining NMJ integrity during aging. Through genetic screening, we identify several downstream factors mediated through foxo-regulated NMJ homeostasis, including genes involved in the MAPK pathway. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of p38 was increased in the motor neuron-specific foxo knockdown flies, suggesting foxo acts as a suppressor of p38/MAPK activation. Our work reveals that foxo is a key regulator for NMJ homeostasis, and it may maintain NMJ integrity by repressing MAPK signaling.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63595">Foxc1 establishes enhancer accessibility for craniofacial cartilage differentiation</a></h4>

The specification of cartilage requires Sox9, a transcription factor with broad roles for organogenesis outside the skeletal system. How Sox9 and other factors gain access to cartilage-specific cis-regulatory regions during skeletal development was unknown. By analyzing chromatin accessibility during the differentiation of neural crest cells into chondrocytes of the zebrafish head, we find that cartilage-associated chromatin accessibility is dynamically established. Cartilage-associated regions that become accessible after neural crest migration are co-enriched for Sox9 and Fox transcription factor binding motifs. In zebrafish lacking Foxc1 paralogs, we find a global decrease in chromatin accessibility in chondrocytes, consistent with a later loss of dorsal facial cartilages. Zebrafish transgenesis assays confirm that many of these Foxc1-dependent elements function as enhancers with region- and stage-specific activity in facial cartilages. These results show that Foxc1 promotes chondrogenesis in the face by establishing chromatin accessibility at a number of cartilage-associated gene enhancers.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63055">A new model of decision processing in instrumental learning tasks</a></h4>

Learning and decision making are interactive processes, yet cognitive modelling of error-driven learning and decision making have largely evolved separately. Recently, evidence accumulation models (EAMs) of decision making and reinforcement learning (RL) models of error-driven learning have been combined into joint RL-EAMs that can in principle address these interactions. However, we show that the most commonly used combination, based on the diffusion decision model (DDM) for binary choice, consistently fails to capture crucial aspects of response times observed during reinforcement learning. We propose a new RL-EAM based on an advantage racing diffusion (ARD) framework for choices among two or more options that not only addresses this problem but captures stimulus difficulty, speed-accuracy trade-off, and stimulus-response-mapping reversal effects. The RL-ARD avoids fundamental limitations imposed by the DDM on addressing effects of absolute values of choices, as well as extensions beyond binary choice, and provides a computationally tractable basis for wider applications.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62885">ATP activation of peritubular cells drives testicular sperm transport</a></h4>

Spermatogenesis, the complex process of male germ cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, is the basis of male fertility. In the seminiferous tubules of the testes, spermatozoa are constantly generated from spermatogonial stem cells through a stereotyped sequence of mitotic and meiotic divisions. The basic physiological principles, however, that control both maturation and luminal transport of the still immotile spermatozoa within the seminiferous tubules remain poorly, if at all, defined. Here, we show that coordinated contractions of smooth muscle-like testicular peritubular cells provide the propulsive force for luminal sperm transport toward the rete testis. Using a mouse model for in vivo imaging, we describe and quantify spontaneous tubular contractions and show a causal relationship between peritubular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and peristaltic transport. Moreover, we identify P2 receptor-dependent purinergic signaling pathways as physiological triggers of tubular contractions both in vitro and in vivo. When challenged with extracellular ATP, transport of luminal content inside the seminiferous tubules displays stage-dependent directionality. We thus suggest that paracrine purinergic signaling coordinates peristaltic recurrent contractions of the mouse seminiferous tubules to propel immotile spermatozoa to the rete testis.

Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) are generated by transforming primary B cells with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and are used extensively as model systems in viral oncology, immunology, and human genetics research. In this study, we characterized single-cell transcriptomic profiles of five LCLs and present a simple discrete-time simulation to explore the influence of stochasticity on LCL clonal evolution. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed substantial phenotypic heterogeneity within and across LCLs with respect to immunoglobulin isotype; virus-modulated host pathways involved in survival, activation, and differentiation; viral replication state; and oxidative stress. This heterogeneity is likely attributable to intrinsic variance in primary B cells and host-pathogen dynamics. Stochastic simulations demonstrate that initial primary cell heterogeneity, random sampling, time in culture, and even mild differences in phenotype-specific fitness can contribute substantially to dynamic diversity in populations of nominally clonal cells.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59954">Drift and termination of spiral waves in optogenetically modified cardiac tissue at sub-threshold illumination</a></h4>

The development of new approaches to control cardiac arrhythmias requires a deep understanding of spiral wave dynamics. Optogenetics offers new possibilities for this. Preliminary experiments show that sub-threshold illumination affects electrical wave propagation in the mouse heart. However, a systematic exploration of these effects is technically challenging. Here, we use state-of-the-art computer models to study the dynamic control of spiral waves in a two-dimensional model of the adult mouse ventricle, using stationary and non-stationary patterns of sub-threshold illumination. Our results indicate a light-intensity-dependent increase in cellular resting membrane potentials, which together with diffusive cell-cell coupling leads to the development of spatial voltage gradients over differently illuminated areas. A spiral wave drifts along the positive gradient. These gradients can be strategically applied to ensure drift-induced termination of a spiral wave, both in optogenetics and in conventional methods of electrical defibrillation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57838">Pleiotropic mutations can rapidly evolve to directly benefit self and cooperative partner despite unfavorable conditions</a></h4>

Cooperation, paying a cost to benefit others, is widespread. Cooperation can be promoted by pleiotropic 'win-win' mutations which directly benefit self ('self-serving') and partner ('partner-serving'). Previously, we showed that partner-serving should be defined as increased benefit supply rate per intake benefit (Hart &amp; Pineda et al., 2019). Here, we report that win-win mutations can rapidly evolve even under conditions unfavorable for cooperation. Specifically, in a well-mixed environment we evolved engineered yeast cooperative communities where two strains exchanged costly metabolites lysine and hypoxanthine. Among cells that consumed lysine and released hypoxanthine, <i>ecm21</i> mutations repeatedly arose. <i>ecm21 </i>is self-serving, improving self's growth rate in limiting lysine. <i>ecm21</i> is also partner-serving, increasing hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption and the steady state growth rate of partner. <i>ecm21</i> also arose in monocultures evolving in lysine-limited chemostats. Thus, even without any history of cooperation or pressure to maintain cooperation, pleiotropic win-win mutations may readily evolve.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57720">SUMO is a pervasive regulator of meiosis</a></h4>

Protein modification by SUMO helps orchestrate the elaborate events of meiosis to faithfully produce haploid gametes. To date, only a handful of meiotic SUMO targets have been identified. Here we delineate a multidimensional SUMO-modified meiotic proteome in budding yeast, identifying 2747 conjugation sites in 775 targets, and defining their relative levels and dynamics. Modified sites cluster in disordered regions and only a minority match consensus motifs. Target identities and modification dynamics imply that SUMOylation regulates all levels of chromosome organization and each step of meiotic prophase I. Execution-point analysis confirms these inferences, revealing functions for SUMO in S-phase, the initiation of recombination, chromosome synapsis and crossing over. K15-linked SUMO chains become prominent as chromosomes synapse and recombine, consistent with roles in these processes. SUMO also modifies ubiquitin, forming hybrid oligomers with potential to modulate ubiquitin signaling. We conclude that SUMO plays diverse and unanticipated roles in regulating meiotic chromosome metabolism.

Objective
Discovery of a novel antibody would enable diagnosis and early treatment of autoimmune encephalitis. The aim was to discover a novel antibody targeting a synaptic receptor and characterize the pathogenic mechanism.


Method
We screened for unknown antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from autoimmune encephalitis patients. Samples with reactivity to rat brain sections and no reactivity to conventional antibody tests underwent further processing for antibody discovery, using immunoprecipitation to primary neuronal cells, mass‐spectrometry analysis, an antigen‐binding assay on an antigen‐overexpressing cell line, and an electrophysiological assay with cultured hippocampal neurons.


Results
Two patients had a novel antibody against CaVα2δ (voltage‐gated calcium channel alpha‐2/delta subunit). The patient samples stained neuropils of the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cortex in rat brain sections and bound to a CaVα2δ‐overexpressing cell line. Knockdown of CaVα2δ expression in cultured neurons turned off the immunoreactivity of the antibody from the patients to the neurons. The patients were associated with preceding meningitis or neuroendocrine carcinoma and responded to immunotherapy. In cultured neurons, the antibody reduced neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals by interfering with tight coupling of calcium channels and exocytosis.


Interpretation
Here, we discovered a novel autoimmune encephalitis associated with anti‐CaVα2δ antibody. Further analysis of the antibody in autoimmune encephalitis might promote early diagnosis and treatment. ANN NEUROL 2021

Reproducibility and reusability of the results of data-based modeling studies are essential. Yet, there has been—so far—no broadly supported format for the specification of parameter estimation problems in systems biology. Here, we introduce PEtab, a format which facilitates the specification of parameter estimation problems using Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models and a set of tab-separated value files describing the observation model and experimental data as well as parameters to be estimated. We already implemented PEtab support into eight well-established model simulation and parameter estimation toolboxes with hundreds of users in total. We provide a Python library for validation and modification of a PEtab problem and currently 20 example parameter estimation problems based on recent studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WRScUWxI6B0" width="1" />

<p>by Steven Phillips</p>

Learning transfer (i.e. accelerated learning over a series of structurally related learning tasks) differentiates species and age-groups, but the evolutionary and developmental implications of such differences are unclear. To this end, the <i>relational schema induction</i> paradigm employing tasks that share algebraic (group-like) structures was introduced to contrast stimulus-independent (relational) versus stimulus-dependent (associative) learning processes. However, a theory explaining this kind of relational learning transfer has not been forthcoming beyond a general appeal to some form of structure-mapping, as typically assumed in models of analogy. In this paper, we provide a theory of relational schema induction as a “reconstruction” process: the algebraic structure underlying transfer is reconstructed by comparing stimulus relations, learned within each task, for structural consistency across tasks—formally, the theory derives from a category theory version of <i>Tannakian reconstruction</i>. The theory also applies to non-human studies of relational concepts, thereby placing human and non-human transfer on common ground for sharper comparison and contrast. As the theory and paradigm do not depend on linguistic ability, we also have a way for pinpointing where aspects of human learning diverge from other species without begging the question of language.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/quoBLkb-MjE" width="1" />

<p>by Dániel Vörös, Balázs Könnyű, Tamás Czárán</p>

The Metabolically Coupled Replicator System (MCRS) model of early chemical evolution offers a plausible and efficient mechanism for the self-assembly and the maintenance of prebiotic RNA replicator communities, the likely predecessors of all life forms on Earth. The MCRS can keep different replicator species together due to their mandatory metabolic cooperation and limited mobility on mineral surfaces, catalysing reaction steps of a coherent reaction network that produces their own monomers from externally supplied compounds. The complexity of the MCRS chemical engine can be increased by assuming that each replicator species may catalyse more than a single reaction of metabolism, with different catalytic activities of the same RNA sequence being in a trade-off relation: one catalytic activity of a promiscuous ribozyme can increase only at the expense of the others on the same RNA strand. Using extensive spatially explicit computer simulations we have studied the possibility and the conditions of evolving ribozyme promiscuity in an initial community of single-activity replicators attached to a 2D surface, assuming an additional trade-off between replicability and catalytic activity. We conclude that our promiscuous replicators evolve under weak catalytic trade-off, relatively strong activity/replicability trade-off and low surface mobility of the replicators and the metabolites they produce, whereas catalytic specialists benefit from very strong catalytic trade-off, weak activity/replicability trade-off and high mobility. We argue that the combination of conditions for evolving promiscuity are more probable to occur for surface-bound RNA replicators, suggesting that catalytic promiscuity may have been a significant factor in the diversification of prebiotic metabolic reaction networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cRhd0otMmbU" width="1" />

<p>by Victor Boutin, Angelo Franciosini, Frederic Chavane, Franck Ruffier, Laurent Perrinet</p>

Both neurophysiological and psychophysical experiments have pointed out the crucial role of recurrent and feedback connections to process context-dependent information in the early visual cortex. While numerous models have accounted for feedback effects at either neural or representational level, none of them were able to bind those two levels of analysis. Is it possible to describe feedback effects at both levels using the same model? We answer this question by combining Predictive Coding (PC) and Sparse Coding (SC) into a hierarchical and convolutional framework applied to realistic problems. In the Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) model, the SC component models the internal recurrent processing within each layer, and the PC component describes the interactions between layers using feedforward and feedback connections. Here, we train a 2-layered SDPC on two different databases of images, and we interpret it as a model of the early visual system (V1 &amp; V2). We first demonstrate that once the training has converged, SDPC exhibits oriented and localized receptive fields in V1 and more complex features in V2. Second, we analyze the effects of feedback on the neural organization beyond the classical receptive field of V1 neurons using interaction maps. These maps are similar to association fields and reflect the Gestalt principle of good continuation. We demonstrate that feedback signals reorganize interaction maps and modulate neural activity to promote contour integration. Third, we demonstrate at the representational level that the SDPC feedback connections are able to overcome noise in input images. Therefore, the SDPC captures the association field principle at the neural level which results in a better reconstruction of blurred images at the representational level.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0PM5Rx4-nSU" width="1" />

Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used high-throughput technology to measure genome-wide gene expression at the single-cell level. One of the most common analyses of scRNA-seq data detects distinct subpopulations of cells through the use of unsupervised clustering algorithms. However, recent advances in scRNA-seq technologies result in current datasets ranging from thousands to millions of cells. Popular clustering algorithms, such as <i>k</i>-means, typically require the data to be loaded entirely into memory and therefore can be slow or impossible to run with large datasets. To address this problem, we developed the <i>mbkmeans</i> R/Bioconductor package, an open-source implementation of the mini-batch <i>k</i>-means algorithm. Our package allows for on-disk data representations, such as the common HDF5 file format widely used for single-cell data, that do not require all the data to be loaded into memory at one time. We demonstrate the performance of the <i>mbkmeans</i> package using large datasets, including one with 1.3 million cells. We also highlight and compare the computing performance of <i>mbkmeans</i> against the standard implementation of <i>k</i>-means and other popular single-cell clustering methods. Our software package is available in Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/mbkmeans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kyJHJ-vbw-c" width="1" />

<p>by Seth Talyansky, Braden A. W. Brinkman</p>

The mammalian visual system has been the focus of countless experimental and theoretical studies designed to elucidate principles of neural computation and sensory coding. Most theoretical work has focused on networks intended to reflect developing or mature neural circuitry, in both health and disease. Few computational studies have attempted to model changes that occur in neural circuitry as an organism ages non-pathologically. In this work we contribute to closing this gap, studying how physiological changes correlated with advanced age impact the computational performance of a spiking network model of primary visual cortex (V1). Our results demonstrate that deterioration of homeostatic regulation of excitatory firing, coupled with long-term synaptic plasticity, is a sufficient mechanism to reproduce features of observed physiological and functional changes in neural activity data, specifically declines in inhibition and in selectivity to oriented stimuli. This suggests a potential causality between dysregulation of neuron firing and age-induced changes in brain physiology and functional performance. While this does not rule out deeper underlying causes or other mechanisms that could give rise to these changes, our approach opens new avenues for exploring these underlying mechanisms in greater depth and making predictions for future experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WAHfXnNgVUs" width="1" />

<p>by James Giammona, Otger Campàs</p>

At very early embryonic stages, when embryos are composed of just a few cells, establishing the correct packing arrangements (contacts) between cells is essential for the proper development of the organism. As early as the 4-cell stage, the observed cellular packings in different species are distinct and, in many cases, differ from the equilibrium packings expected for simple adherent and deformable particles. It is unclear what are the specific roles that different physical parameters, such as the forces between blastomeres, their division times, orientation of cell division and embryonic confinement, play in the control of these packing configurations. Here we simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics of cells in early embryos and systematically study how these different parameters affect embryonic packings at the 4-cell stage. In the absence of embryo confinement, we find that cellular packings are not robust, with multiple packing configurations simultaneously possible and very sensitive to parameter changes. Our results indicate that the geometry of the embryo confinement determines the packing configurations at the 4-cell stage, removing degeneracy in the possible packing configurations and overriding division rules in most cases. Overall, these results indicate that physical confinement of the embryo is essential to robustly specify proper cellular arrangements at very early developmental stages.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0nqXF1-vy50" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/Tm2ZR7VTFaI/article">Neural signatures of syntactic variation in speech planning</a></h4>

Planning to speak is a challenge for the brain, and the challenge varies between and within languages. Yet, little is known about how neural processes react to these variable challenges beyond the planning of individual words. Here, we examine how fundamental differences in syntax shape the time course of sentence planning. Most languages treat alike (i.e., align with each other) the 2 uses of a word like “gardener” in “the gardener crouched” and in “the gardener planted trees.” A minority keeps these formally distinct by adding special marking in 1 case, and some languages display both aligned and nonaligned expressions. Exploiting such a contrast in Hindi, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking to suggest that this difference is associated with distinct patterns of neural processing and gaze behavior during early planning stages, preceding phonological word form preparation. Planning sentences with aligned expressions induces larger synchronization in the theta frequency band, suggesting higher working memory engagement, and more visual attention to agents than planning nonaligned sentences, suggesting delayed commitment to the relational details of the event. Furthermore, plain, unmarked expressions are associated with larger desynchronization in the alpha band than expressions with special markers, suggesting more engagement in information processing to keep overlapping structures distinct during planning. Our findings contrast with the observation that the form of aligned expressions is simpler, and they suggest that the global preference for alignment is driven not by its neurophysiological effect on sentence planning but by other sources, possibly by aspects of production flexibility and fluency or by sentence comprehension. This challenges current theories on how production and comprehension may affect the evolution and distribution of syntactic variants in the world’s languages.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Tm2ZR7VTFaI" width="1" />

Tsetse transmit African trypanosomiasis, which is a disease fatal to both humans and animals. A vaccine to protect against this disease does not exist so transmission control relies on eliminating tsetse populations. Although neurotoxic insecticides are the gold standard for insect control, they negatively impact the environment and reduce populations of insect pollinator species. Here we present a promising, environment-friendly alternative to current insecticides that targets the insect tyrosine metabolism pathway. A bloodmeal contains high levels of tyrosine, which is toxic to haematophagous insects if it is not degraded and eliminated. RNA interference (RNAi) of either the first two enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway (tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)) was lethal to tsetse. Furthermore, nitisinone (NTBC), an FDA-approved tyrosine catabolism inhibitor, killed tsetse regardless if the drug was orally or topically applied. However, oral administration of NTBC to bumblebees did not affect their survival. Using a novel mathematical model, we show that NTBC could reduce the transmission of African trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa, thus accelerating current disease elimination programmes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hY4KuzQ60os" width="1" />

Abstract
Astrocytes are a population of central nervous system (CNS) cells with distinctive morphological and functional characteristics that differ within specific areas of the brain and are widely distributed throughout the CNS. There are mainly two types of astrocytes, protoplasmic and fibrous, which differ in morphologic appearance and location. Astrocytes are important cells of the CNS that not only provide structural support, but also modulate synaptic activity, regulate neuroinflammatory responses, maintain the blood‐brain barrier, and supply energy to neurons. As a result, astrocytic disruption can lead to widespread detrimental effects and can contribute to the pathophysiology of several neurological conditions. The characteristics of astrocytes in more common neuropathologies such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease have significantly been described and continue to be widely studied. However, there still exist numerous rare neurological conditions in which astrocytic involvement is unknown and needs to be explored. Accordingly, this review will summarize functional and morphological changes of astrocytes in various rare neurological conditions based on current knowledge thus far and highlight remaining neuropathologies where astrocytic involvement has yet to be investigated.

<p>Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein involved in the extracellular matrix and interactions between cells during neural development of the central nervous system (CNS). Oxidative glutamate toxicity is involved in CNS diseases, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and ischemic stroke. However, the molecular mechanism of nerve injury is not fully understood in CNS diseases. Herein, the glutamate-induced nerve damage model was used to explore the molecular mechanisms affecting nerve damage. The levels of SPARC and autophagy were increased in glutamate-induced HT22 hippocampal nerve injury. In summary, the current study confirmed that SPARC regulates autophagy in HT22 hippocampal nerve cells, and its knockdown reduces the glutamate-induced HT22 hippocampal nerve injury by inhibiting autophagy. These findings suggested that SPARC plays a crucial role in nerve injury of CNS diseases.</p>

<p>WISDoM (Wishart Distributed Matrices) is a framework for the quantification of deviation of symmetric positive-definite matrices associated with experimental samples, such as covariance or correlation matrices, from expected ones governed by the Wishart distribution. WISDoM can be applied to tasks of supervised learning, like classification, in particular when such matrices are generated by data of different dimensionality (e.g., time series with same number of variables but different time sampling). We show the application of the method in two different scenarios. The first is the ranking of features associated with electro encephalogram (EEG) data with a time series design, providing a theoretically sound approach for this type of studies. The second is the classification of autistic subjects of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange study using brain connectivity measurements.</p>

<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) nowadays can match human performance in challenging complex tasks, but it remains unknown whether DCNNs achieve human-like performance through human-like processes. Here we applied a reverse-correlation method to make explicit representations of DCNNs and humans when performing face gender classification. We found that humans and a typical DCNN, VGG-Face, used similar critical information for this task, which mainly resided at low spatial frequencies. Importantly, the prior task experience, which the VGG-Face was pre-trained to process faces at the subordinate level (i.e., identification) as humans do, seemed necessary for such representational similarity, because AlexNet, a DCNN pre-trained to process objects at the basic level (i.e., categorization), succeeded in gender classification but relied on a completely different representation. In sum, although DCNNs and humans rely on different sets of hardware to process faces, they can use a similar and implementation-independent representation to achieve the same computation goal.</p>

<p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) accurately charge tRNAs with their respective amino acids. As such, they are vital for the initiation of cytosolic and mitochondrial protein translation. These enzymes have become increasingly scrutinized in recent years for their role in neurodegenerative disorders caused by the mutations of ARS-encoding genes. This review focuses on two such genes—DARS1 and DARS2—which encode cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetases, and the clinical conditions associated with mutations of these genes. We also describe attempts made at modeling these conditions in mice, which have both yielded important mechanistic insights. Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a disease caused by a range of mutations in the DARS2 gene, initially identified in 2003. Ten years later, hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity (HBSL), caused by mutations of cytosolic DARS1, was discovered. Multiple parallels have been drawn between the two conditions. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) patterns are strikingly similar, but still set these two conditions apart from other leukodystrophies. Clinically, both conditions are characterized by lower limb spasticity, often associated with other pyramidal signs. However, perhaps due to earlier detection, a wider range of symptoms, including peripheral neuropathy, as well as visual and hearing changes have been described in LBSL patients. Both HBSL and LBSL are spectrum disorders lacking genotype to phenotype correlation. While the fatal phenotype of Dars1 or Dars2 single gene deletion mouse mutants revealed that the two enzymes lack functional redundancy, further pursuit of disease modeling are required to shed light onto the underlying disease mechanism, and enable examination of experimental treatments, including gene therapies.</p>

<p>Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition with diverse causes and clinical outcomes that can be categorized into subtypes. [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5351 has been known to detect reactive astrogliosis as well as tau which is accompanied by neurodegenerative changes. Here, we identified heterogeneous groups of MCI patients using THK retention patterns and a graph theory approach, allowing for the comparison of risk of progression to dementia in these MCI subgroups.</p><p>Methods: Ninety-seven participants including 60 MCI patients and individuals with normal cognition (NC, n = 37) were included and undertook 3T MRI, [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5351 PET, and detailed neuropsychological tests. [<sup>18</sup>F]Flutemetamol PET was also performed in 62 participants. We calculated similarities between MCI patients using their regional standardized uptake value ratio of THK retention in 75 ROIs, and clustered subjects with similar retention patterns using the Louvain method based on the modularity of the graph. The clusters of patients identified were compared with an age-matched control group using a general linear model. Dementia conversion was evaluated after a median follow-up duration of 34.6 months.</p><p>Results: MCI patients were categorized into four groups according to their THK retention patterns: (1) limbic type; (2) diffuse type; (3) sparse type; and (4) AD type (retention pattern as in AD). Subjects of the limbic type were characterized by older age, small hippocampal volumes, and reduced verbal memory and frontal/executive functions. Patients of the diffuse type had relatively large vascular burden, reduced memory capacity and some frontal/executive functions. Co-morbidity and mortality were more frequent in this subgroup. Subjects of the sparse type were younger and declined only in terms of visual memory and attention. No individuals in this subgroup converted to dementia. Patients in the AD type group exhibited the poorest cognitive function. They also had the smallest hippocampal volumes and the highest risk of progression to dementia (90.9%).</p><p>Conclusion: Using cluster analyses with [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5351 retention patterns, it is possible to identify clinically-distinct subgroups of MCI patients and those at greater risk of progression to dementia.</p>

<p>The mechanism of brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has not yet been clarified. The glymphatic system (GS), a glia-dependent waste clearance pathway, drains away soluble waste proteins and metabolic products, even some toxic factors from the brain. Aquaporin-4 (Aqp4) is highly expressed on the astrocyte foot processes and facilitates the interstitial fluid (ISF) transportation in the GS system. In this study, the role of Aqp4 in the GS injury after SAH was explored using Aqp4 gene knockout (Aqp4<sup>−/−</sup>) Sprague Dawley rats. The results of MRI, fluorescent imaging, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated that, after SAH, the inflow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the brain and the clearance of ISF from the brain were both significantly decreased. Meanwhile, the expression level of Aqp4 around the artery was markedly higher than that around the vein following SAH. Aqp4 knockout exacerbated the GS damage after SAH. In summary, after SAH, there was an apparent GS impairment, and Aqp4 played key roles in modulating the function of GS in the brain.</p>

Rett syndrome is a devastating childhood neurological disorder caused by mutations in <i>MECP2</i>. Of the many symptoms, motor deterioration is a significant problem for patients. In mice, deleting <i>Mecp2</i> from the cortex or basal ganglia causes motor dysfunction, hypoactivity, and tremor, which are abnormalities observed in patients. Little is known about the function of <i>Mecp2</i> in the cerebellum, a brain region critical for motor function. Here we show that deleting <i>Mecp2</i> from the cerebellum, but not from its neuronal subtypes, causes a delay in motor learning that is overcome by additional training. We observed irregular firing rates of Purkinje cells and altered heterochromatin architecture within the cerebellum of knockout mice. These findings demonstrate that the motor deficits present in Rett syndrome arise, in part, from cerebellar dysfunction. For Rett syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders, our results highlight the importance of understanding which brain regions contribute to disease phenotypes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64166">A live attenuated-vaccine model confers cross-protective immunity against different species of the Leptospira genus</a></h4>

Leptospirosis is the leading zoonotic disease in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Effective prevention is urgently needed as the drivers of disease transmission continue to intensify. The key challenge has been developing a widely applicable vaccine that protects against the &gt;300 serovars that can cause leptospirosis. Live attenuated mutants are enticing vaccine candidates and poorly explored in the field. We evaluated a recently characterized motility-deficient mutant lacking the expression of a flagellar protein, FcpA. Although the <i>fcpA<sup>-</sup></i> mutant has lost its ability to cause disease, transient bacteremia was observed. In two animal models, immunization with a single dose of the <i>fcpA<sup>-</sup></i> mutant was sufficient to induce a robust anti-protein antibodies response that promoted protection against infection with different pathogenic Leptospira species. Furthermore, characterization of the immune response identified a small repertoire of biologically relevant proteins that are highly conserved among pathogenic Leptospira species and potential correlates of cross-protective immunity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64004">Charge-driven condensation of RNA and proteins suggests broad role of phase separation in cytoplasmic environments</a></h4>

Phase separation processes are increasingly being recognized as important organizing mechanisms of biological macromolecules in cellular environments. Well established drivers of phase separation are multi-valency and intrinsic disorder. Here, we show that globular macromolecules may condense simply based on electrostatic complementarity. More specifically, phase separation of mixtures between RNA and positively charged proteins is described from a combination of multiscale computer simulations with microscopy and spectroscopy experiments. Phase diagrams were mapped out as a function of molecular concentrations in experiment and as a function of molecular size and temperature via simulations. The resulting condensates were found to retain at least some degree of internal dynamics varying as a function of the molecular composition. The results suggest a more general principle for phase separation that is based primarily on electrostatic complementarity without invoking polymer properties as in most previous studies. Simulation results furthermore suggest that such phase separation may occur widely in heterogenous cellular environment between nucleic acid and protein components.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63538">Curcumin promotes AApoAII amyloidosis and peroxisome proliferation in mice by activating the PPARα signaling pathway</a></h4>

Curcumin is a polyphenol compound that exhibits multiple physiological activities. To elucidate the mechanisms by which curcumin affects systemic amyloidosis, we investigated amyloid deposition and molecular changes in a mouse model of amyloid apolipoprotein A-II (AApoAII) amyloidosis, in which mice were fed a curcumin-supplemented diet. Curcumin supplementation for 12 weeks significantly increased AApoAII amyloid deposition relative to controls, especially in the liver and spleen. Liver weights and plasma ApoA-II and high-density lipoprotein concentrations were significantly elevated in curcumin-supplemented groups. RNA-sequence analysis revealed that curcumin intake affected hepatic lipid metabolism via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway, especially PPARα activation, resulting in increased <i>Apoa2</i> mRNA expression. The increase in liver weights was due to activation of PPARα and peroxisome proliferation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that curcumin is a PPARα activator and may affect expression levels of proteins involved in amyloid deposition to influence amyloidosis and metabolism in a complex manner.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62335">A dietary sterol trade-off determines lifespan responses to dietary restriction in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> females</a></h4>

Diet plays a significant role in maintaining lifelong health. In particular, lowering the dietary protein: carbohydrate ratio can improve lifespan. This has been interpreted as a direct effect of these macronutrients on physiology. Using <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we show that the role of protein and carbohydrate on lifespan is indirect, acting by altering the partitioning of limiting amounts of dietary sterols between reproduction and lifespan. Shorter lifespans in flies fed on high protein: carbohydrate diets can be rescued by supplementing their food with cholesterol. Not only does this fundamentally alter the way we interpret the mechanisms of lifespan extension by dietary restriction, these data highlight the important principle that life histories can be affected by nutrient-dependent trade-offs that are indirect and independent of the nutrients (often macronutrients) that are the focus of study. This brings us closer to understanding the mechanistic basis of dietary restriction.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61644">The diversity and function of sourdough starter microbiomes</a></h4>

Humans have relied on sourdough starter microbial communities to make leavened bread for thousands of years, but only a small fraction of global sourdough biodiversity has been characterized. Working with a community-scientist network of bread bakers, we determined the microbial diversity of 500 sourdough starters from four continents. In sharp contrast with widespread assumptions, we found little evidence for biogeographic patterns in starter communities. Strong co-occurrence patterns observed in situ and recreated in vitro demonstrate that microbial interactions shape sourdough community structure. Variation in dough rise rates and aromas were largely explained by acetic acid bacteria, a mostly overlooked group of sourdough microbes. Our study reveals the extent of microbial diversity in an ancient fermented food across diverse cultural and geographic backgrounds.

Abstract
The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a molecular sensor to help maintain cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimeric complex and its enzymatic catalytic subunit includes two isoforms: α1 and α2. Dysregulation of AMPK signaling is linked to neuronal diseases characterized with cognitive impairments. Emerging evidence also suggest isoform‐specific roles of AMPK in the brain. AMPK regulates protein synthesis, which is critical for memory formation and neuronal plasticity. However, the consequence of altering AMPK activity on the translation of specific proteins in the brain is unknown. Here, we use unbiased mass spectrometry‐based proteomics approach to analyze protein profile alterations in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of transgenic mice in which the genes for the two AMPKα isoforms are conditionally deleted. The study revealed identities of proteins whose expression is sensitive to suppression of AMPKα1 and/or α2 isoform. These data may serve as a basis for future in‐depth study. Elucidation of the functional relevance of the alteration of specific proteins could provide insights into identification of novel therapeutic targets for neuronal disorders characterized with AMPK signaling dysregulation and impaired cellular energy metabolism.

<p>by Vikas Pandey, Lai-Hua Xie, Zhilin Qu, Zhen Song</p>

Mitochondria are vital organelles inside the cell and contribute to intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) dynamics directly and indirectly via calcium exchange, ATP generation, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Arrhythmogenic Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans in cardiac myocytes has been observed in experiments under abnormal mitochondrial depolarization. However, complex signaling pathways and Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling between mitochondria and cytosol make it difficult in experiments to reveal the underlying mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans under abnormal mitochondrial depolarization. In this study, we use a newly developed spatiotemporal ventricular myocyte computer model that integrates mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling and complex signaling pathways to investigate the mechanisms of Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans during mitochondrial depolarization. We find that elevation of ROS in response to mitochondrial depolarization plays a critical role in promoting Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans. Further examination reveals that the redox effect of ROS on ryanodine receptors and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase synergistically promote alternans. Upregulation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Due to their relatively slow kinetics, oxidized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activation and ATP do not play significant roles acutely in the genesis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans after mitochondrial depolarization, but their roles can be significant in the long term, mainly through their effects on sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase activity. In conclusion, mitochondrial depolarization promotes Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans acutely via the redox effect of ROS and chronically by ATP reduction. It suppresses Ca<sup>2+</sup> alternans chronically through oxidized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_0Mtlp4mxNI" width="1" />

Motivation <p>A comprehensive characterization of the humoral response towards a specific antigen requires quantification of the B-cell receptor repertoire (BCR-Seq) by next generation sequencing, as well as the analysis of serum antibodies against this antigen, using proteomics. The proteomic analysis is challenging since it necessitates the mapping of antigen-specific peptides to individual B-cell clones.</p> Results <p>The PASA web server provides a robust computational platform for the analysis and integration of data obtained from proteomics of serum antibodies. PASA maps peptides derived from antibodies raised against a specific antigen to corresponding antibody sequences. It then analyzes and integrates proteomics and BCR-Seq data, thus providing a comprehensive characterization of the humoral response. The PASA web server is freely available at https://pasa.tau.ac.il and open to all users without a login requirement.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8lxTQ15ibhE" width="1" />

<p>by Vinícius Rezende Carvalho, Márcio Flávio Dutra Moraes, Sydney S. Cash, Eduardo Mazoni Andrade Marçal Mendes</p>

The extraction of electrophysiological features that reliably forecast the occurrence of seizures is one of the most challenging goals in epilepsy research. Among possible approaches to tackle this problem is the use of active probing paradigms in which responses to stimuli are used to detect underlying system changes leading up to seizures. This work evaluates the theoretical and mechanistic underpinnings of this strategy using two coupled populations of the well-studied Wendling neural mass model. Different model settings are evaluated, shifting parameters (excitability, slow inhibition, or inter-population coupling gains) from normal towards ictal states while probing stimuli are applied every 2 seconds to the input of either one or both populations. The correlation between the extracted features and the ictogenic parameter shifting indicates if the impending transition to the ictal state may be identified in advance. Results show that not only can the response to the probing stimuli forecast seizures but this is true regardless of the altered ictogenic parameter. That is, similar feature changes are highlighted by probing stimuli responses in advance of the seizure including: increased response variance and lag-1 autocorrelation, decreased skewness, and increased mutual information between the outputs of both model subsets. These changes were mostly restricted to the stimulated population, showing a local effect of this perturbational approach. The transition latencies from normal activity to sustained discharges of spikes were not affected, suggesting that stimuli had no pro-ictal effects. However, stimuli were found to elicit interictal-like spikes just before the transition to the ictal state. Furthermore, the observed feature changes highlighted by probing the neuronal populations may reflect the phenomenon of critical slowing down, where increased recovery times from perturbations may signal the loss of a systems’ resilience and are common hallmarks of an impending critical transition. These results provide more evidence that active probing approaches highlight information about underlying system changes involved in ictogenesis and may be able to play a role in assisting seizure forecasting methods which can be incorporated into early-warning systems that ultimately enable closing the loop for targeted seizure-controlling interventions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3UYEz0x6e1I" width="1" />

<p>by Arbel Harpak, Molly Przeworski</p>

The selection pressures that have shaped the evolution of complex traits in humans remain largely unknown, and in some contexts highly contentious, perhaps above all where they concern mean trait differences among groups. To date, the discussion has focused on whether such group differences have any genetic basis, and if so, whether they are without fitness consequences and arose via random genetic drift, or whether they were driven by selection for different trait optima in different environments. Here, we highlight a plausible alternative that many complex traits evolve under stabilizing selection in the face of shifting environmental effects. Under this scenario, there will be rapid evolution at the loci that contribute to trait variation, even when the trait optimum remains the same. These considerations underscore the strong assumptions about environmental effects that are required in ascribing trait differences among groups to genetic differences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rzF9EYLWEHA" width="1" />

d‐glucose uptake in astrocytes is an essential source for the noradrenaline‐induced increase in intracellular L‐lactate. We found that intracellular l‐lactate arises exclusively from the glycogen—a temporary energy store in the brain. The glycolytic pathway intermediates also support oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. At rest, a large proportion of d‐glucose is metabolized in the Krebs cycle, since the resting l‐lactate concentration is low. This is increased when the Krebs cycle is blocked or when cells are stimulated with noradrenaline.

Abstract
During cognitive efforts mediated by local neuronal networks, approximately 20% of additional energy is required; this is mediated by chemical messengers such as noradrenaline (NA). NA targets astroglial aerobic glycolysis, the hallmark of which is the end product l‐lactate, a fuel for neurons. Biochemical studies have revealed that astrocytes exhibit a prominent glycogen shunt, in which a portion of d‐glucose molecules entering the cytoplasm is transiently incorporated into glycogen, a buffer and source of d‐glucose during increased energy demand. Here, we studied single astrocytes by measuring cytosolic L‐lactate ([lac]i) with the FRET nanosensor Laconic. We examined whether NA‐induced increase in [lac]i is influenced by: (a) 2‐deoxy‐d‐glucose (2‐DG, 3 mM), a molecule that enters the cytosol and inhibits the glycolytic pathway; (b) 1,4‐dideoxy‐1,4‐imino‐d‐arabinitol (DAB, 300 µM), a potent inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen degradation; and (c) 3‐nitropropionic acid (3‐NPA, 1 mM), an inhibitor of the Krebs cycle. The results of these pharmacological experiments revealed that d‐glucose uptake is essential for the NA‐induced increase in [lac]i, and that this exclusively arises from glycogen degradation, indicating that most, if not all, d‐glucose molecules in NA‐stimulated cells transit the glycogen shunt during glycolysis. Moreover, under the defined transmembrane d‐glucose gradient, the glycolytic intermediates were not only used to produce l‐lactate, but also to significantly support oxidative phosphorylation, as demonstrated by an elevation in [lac]i when Krebs cycle was inhibited. We conclude that l‐lactate production via aerobic glycolysis is an essential energy pathway in NA‐stimulated astrocytes; however, oxidative metabolism is important at rest.

<p>Tau protein is subject to phosphorylation by multiple kinases at more than 80 different sites. Some of these sites are associated with tau pathology and neurodegeneration, but other sites are modified in normal tau as well as in pathological tau. Although phosphorylation of tau at residues in the microtubule-binding repeats is thought to reduce tau association with microtubules, the functional consequences of other sites are poorly understood. The AT8 antibody recognizes a complex phosphoepitope site on tau that is detectable in a healthy brain but significantly increased in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Previous studies showed that phosphorylation of tau at the AT8 site leads to exposure of an N-terminal sequence that promotes activation of a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)/glycogen synthase 3 (GSK3) signaling pathway, which inhibits kinesin-1-based anterograde fast axonal transport (FAT). This finding suggests that phosphorylation may control tau conformation and function. However, the AT8 includes three distinct phosphorylated amino acids that may be differentially phosphorylated in normal and disease conditions. To evaluate the effects of specific phosphorylation sites in the AT8 epitope, recombinant, pseudophosphorylated tau proteins were perfused into the isolated squid axoplasm preparation to determine their effects on axonal signaling pathways and FAT. Results from these studies suggest a mechanism where specific phosphorylation events differentially impact tau conformation, promoting activation of independent signaling pathways that differentially affect FAT. Implications of findings here to our understanding of tau function in health and disease conditions are discussed.</p>

<p>Peripheral nerve injuries arising from trauma or disease can lead to sensory and motor deficits and neuropathic pain. Despite the purported ability of the peripheral nerve to self-repair, lifelong disability is common. New molecular and cellular insights have begun to reveal why the peripheral nerve has limited repair capacity. The peripheral nerve is primarily comprised of axons and Schwann cells, the supporting glial cells that produce myelin to facilitate the rapid conduction of electrical impulses. Schwann cells are required for successful nerve regeneration; they partially “de-differentiate” in response to injury, re-initiating the expression of developmental genes that support nerve repair. However, Schwann cell dysfunction, which occurs in chronic nerve injury, disease, and aging, limits their capacity to support endogenous repair, worsening patient outcomes. Cell replacement-based therapeutic approaches using exogenous Schwann cells could be curative, but not all Schwann cells have a “repair” phenotype, defined as the ability to promote axonal growth, maintain a proliferative phenotype, and remyelinate axons. Two cell replacement strategies are being championed for peripheral nerve repair: prospective isolation of “repair” Schwann cells for autologous cell transplants, which is hampered by supply challenges, and directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells or lineage conversion of accessible somatic cells to induced Schwann cells, with the potential of “unlimited” supply. All approaches require a solid understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding Schwann cell development and the repair phenotype, which we review herein. Together these studies provide essential context for current efforts to design glial cell-based therapies for peripheral nerve regeneration.</p>

<p>This work presents and evaluates a 12-electrode intracranial electroencephalography system developed at the National Institute of Mental Health (Klecany, Czech Republic) in terms of an electrical source imaging (ESI) technique in rats. The electrode system was originally designed for translational research purposes. This study demonstrates that it is also possible to use this well-established system for ESI, and estimates its precision, accuracy, and limitations. Furthermore, this paper sets a methodological basis for future implants. Source localization quality is evaluated using three approaches based on surrogate data, physical phantom measurements, and in vivo experiments. The forward model for source localization is obtained from the FieldTrip-SimBio pipeline using the finite-element method. Rat brain tissue extracted from a magnetic resonance imaging template is approximated by a single-compartment homogeneous tetrahedral head model. Four inverse solvers were tested: standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, exact low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), linear constrained minimum variance (LCMV), and dynamic imaging of coherent sources. Based on surrogate data, this paper evaluates the accuracy and precision of all solvers within the brain volume using error distance and reliability maps. The mean error distance over the whole brain was found to be the lowest in the eLORETA solution through signal to noise ratios (SNRs) (0.2 mm for 25 dB SNR). The LCMV outperformed eLORETA under higher SNR conditions, and exhibiting higher spatial precision. Both of these inverse solvers provided accurate results in a phantom experiment (1.6 mm mean error distance across shallow and 2.6 mm across subcortical testing dipoles). Utilizing the developed technique in freely moving rats, an auditory steady-state response experiment provided results in line with previously reported findings. The obtained results support the idea of utilizing a 12-electrode system for ESI and using it as a solid basis for the development of future ESI dedicated implants.</p>

<p>Human gait is a complex activity that requires high coordination between the central nervous system, the limb, and the musculoskeletal system. More research is needed to understand the latter coordination's complexity in designing better and more effective rehabilitation strategies for gait disorders. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) are among the most used technologies for monitoring brain activities due to portability, non-invasiveness, and relatively low cost compared to others. Fusing EEG and fNIRS is a well-known and established methodology proven to enhance brain–computer interface (BCI) performance in terms of classification accuracy, number of control commands, and response time. Although there has been significant research exploring hybrid BCI (hBCI) involving both EEG and fNIRS for different types of tasks and human activities, human gait remains still underinvestigated. In this article, we aim to shed light on the recent development in the analysis of human gait using a hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI system. The current review has followed guidelines of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-Analyses (PRISMA) during the data collection and selection phase. In this review, we put a particular focus on the commonly used signal processing and machine learning algorithms, as well as survey the potential applications of gait analysis. We distill some of the critical findings of this survey as follows. First, hardware specifications and experimental paradigms should be carefully considered because of their direct impact on the quality of gait assessment. Second, since both modalities, EEG and fNIRS, are sensitive to motion artifacts, instrumental, and physiological noises, there is a quest for more robust and sophisticated signal processing algorithms. Third, hybrid temporal and spatial features, obtained by virtue of fusing EEG and fNIRS and associated with cortical activation, can help better identify the correlation between brain activation and gait. In conclusion, hBCI (EEG + fNIRS) system is not yet much explored for the lower limb due to its complexity compared to the higher limb. Existing BCI systems for gait monitoring tend to only focus on one modality. We foresee a vast potential in adopting hBCI in gait analysis. Imminent technical breakthroughs are expected using hybrid EEG-fNIRS-based BCI for gait to control assistive devices and Monitor neuro-plasticity in neuro-rehabilitation. However, although those hybrid systems perform well in a controlled experimental environment when it comes to adopting them as a certified medical device in real-life clinical applications, there is still a long way to go.</p>

<p>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an invasive device-based neuromodulation technique that allows the therapeutic direct stimulation of subcortical and deep cortical structures following the surgical placement of stimulating electrodes. DBS is approved by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration for the treatment of movement disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder, while new indications, including Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), are in experimental development. We report the case of a patient with MDD who received DBS to the ventral internal capsule and ventral striatum bilaterally and presented with 2 weeks of voltage-dependent Tourette-like symptoms including brief transient episodes of abrupt-onset and progressively louder coprolalia and stuttered speech; tic-like motor behavior in his right arm and leg; rushes of anxiety, angry prosody, angry affect; and moderate amnesia without confusion. We describe the results of the inpatient neuropsychiatric workup leading to the diagnosis of iatrogenic voltage-dependent activation of cortico-subcortical circuits and discuss insights into the pathophysiology of Tourette as well as safety considerations raised by the case.</p>

<p>Dysfunctional attentional control is observed in patients with mental disorders. However, there is no established neurophysiological method to assess attention in such patients. We showed a discrepancy in alpha-band power in the tasks that evoked internal and external attention event-related alpha-band power changes in healthy subjects during self-reflection (SR) and working memory (WM) tasks in a preliminary study. In this study, we aimed at elucidating event-related alpha-band power changes in healthy subjects during the tasks, addressing the shortcomings of the previous study. Sixteen healthy volunteers were examined for the event-related power (ERpow) change during the tasks. The results demonstrated the discrepancy of alpha-band ERpow at 8, 10, and 12 Hz in the parieto-occipital area between the WM and SR tasks for a period between a target stimulus and a command stimulus, where a participant switched to internal attention from external attention according to the SR task and remained at external attention according to the WM task. The results suggest that alpha-band ERpow in this area is associated with the direction of attention in response to cognitive stimuli, indicating that the findings of ERpow during the two tasks would potentially aid in the clarification of the pathophysiology of the dysfunctional change in attention in patients with psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.566841">Influence of Background Musical Emotions on Attention in Congenital Amusia</a></h4>

<p>Congenital amusia in its most common form is a disorder characterized by a musical pitch processing deficit. Although pitch is involved in conveying emotion in music, the implications for pitch deficits on musical emotion judgements is still under debate. Relatedly, both limited and spared musical emotion recognition was reported in amusia in conditions where emotion cues were not determined by musical mode or dissonance. Additionally, assumed links between musical abilities and visuo-spatial attention processes need further investigation in congenital amusics. Hence, we here test to what extent musical emotions can influence attentional performance. Fifteen congenital amusic adults and fifteen healthy controls matched for age and education were assessed in three attentional conditions: executive control (distractor inhibition), alerting, and orienting (spatial shift) while music expressing either joy, tenderness, sadness, or tension was presented. Visual target detection was in the normal range for both accuracy and response times in the amusic relative to the control participants. Moreover, in both groups, music exposure produced facilitating effects on selective attention that appeared to be driven by the arousal dimension of musical emotional content, with faster correct target detection during joyful compared to sad music. These findings corroborate the idea that pitch processing deficits related to congenital amusia do not impede other cognitive domains, particularly visual attention. Furthermore, our study uncovers an intact influence of music and its emotional content on the attentional abilities of amusic individuals. The results highlight the domain-selectivity of the pitch disorder in congenital amusia, which largely spares the development of visual attention and affective systems.</p>

<p>Orientation selectivity, as an emergent property of neurons in the visual cortex, is of critical importance in the processing of visual information. Characterizing the orientation selectivity based on neuronal firing activities or local field potentials (LFPs) is a hot topic of current research. In this paper, we used cross-frequency coupling and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to predict the grating orientations in V1 and V4 of two rhesus monkeys. The experimental data were recorded by utilizing two chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, which were placed, respectively, in V1 and V4 of two rhesus monkeys performing a selective visual attention task. The phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC) were employed to characterize the cross-frequency coupling of LFPs under sinusoidal grating stimuli with different orientations. Then, a LASSO logistic regression model was constructed to predict the grating orientation based on the strength of PAC and AAC. Moreover, the cross-validation method was used to evaluate the performance of the model. It was found that the average accuracy of the prediction based on the combination of PAC and AAC was 73.9%, which was higher than the predicting accuracy with PAC or AAC separately. In conclusion, a LASSO logistic regression model was introduced in this study, which can predict the grating orientations with relatively high accuracy by using PAC and AAC together. Our results suggest that the principle behind the LASSO model is probably an alternative direction to explore the mechanism for generating orientation selectivity.</p>

<p>Background: The substantial heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and lack of reliable progression markers in Parkinson's disease (PD) present a major challenge in predicting accurate progression and prognoses. Increasing evidence indicates that each component of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption may take part in many neurodegenerative diseases. Since some portions of CSF are eliminated along the neurovascular unit and across the BBB, disturbing the pathways may result in changes of these substances.</p><p>Methods: Four hundred seventy-four participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study (NCT01141023) were included in the study. Thirty-six initial features, including general information, brief clinical characteristics and the current year's classical scale scores, were used to build five regression models to predict PD motor progression represented by the coming year's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score after redundancy removal and recursive feature elimination (RFE)-based feature selection. Then, a threshold range was added to the predicted value for more convenient model application. Finally, we evaluated the CSF and blood biomarkers' influence on the disease progression model.</p><p>Results: Eight hundred forty-nine cases were included in the study. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values of three different categories of regression model, linear, Bayesian and ensemble, all reached 0.75. Models of the same category shared similar feature combinations. The common features selected among the categories were the MDS-UPDRS Part III score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire (RBDSQ) score. It can be seen more intuitively that the model can achieve certain prediction effect through threshold range. Biomarkers had no significant impact on the progression model within the data in the study.</p><p>Conclusions: By using machine learning and routinely gathered assessments from the current year, we developed multiple dynamic models to predict the following year's motor progression in the early stage of PD. These methods will allow clinicians to tailor medical management to the individual and identify at-risk patients for future clinical trials examining disease-modifying therapies.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammation and inner immune dysfunction are increasingly accepted as important components of the etiopathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). According to emerging evidence, a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), a ligand-gated ion channel, plays an important role in inflammatory reactions and is also expressed on the surface of T cells. In particular, regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for the maintenance of immunological tolerance. In the present study, we investigated the roles of α7nAChR in inhibiting inflammation and maintaining the immune balance in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced lesions and the possible mechanisms regulating the proportion of Tregs in vivo. Adult male Wistar rats (n = 90) were subjected to a unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the left medial forebrain bundle, and PNU-282987, an α7nAChR agonist, was intraperitoneally injected 2 h prior to the induction of lesions by 6-OHDA and again at days 1, 7, and 13 postlesion. Behavioral tests and immunohistochemical staining to detect the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the bilateral substantial nigra (SN) were performed. Subsequently, CD4+ T lymphocytes and the expression of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor p3 (Foxp3, which is a marker of Treg cells) in the SN were also assessed using immunofluorescence staining. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the SN was determined by performing immunohistochemical staining. Additionally, the protein levels of α7nAChR, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylated-Erk (p-Erk) and Foxp3 in the ventral midbrain were determined using Western blotting, and the relative expression of the TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10 mRNAs were detected using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We found that PNU-282987 significantly improved the motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA, reduced the loss of TH in the SN, suppressed the overactivation of GFAP+ cells and expression of related inflammatory cytokines, and increased the number of Foxp3+ cells. In addition, we also showed that PNU-282987 significantly increased the protein expression of the a7nAchR, p-Erk, and Foxp3 in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats (p &lt; 0.05). These results indicated that α7nAChR activation could exert an anti-inflammatory effect and participate in the process of modulating the immune balance during 6-OHDA-induced injury, potentially through the α7nAChR/p-Erk/Foxp3 signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are more likely to develop into Alzheimer disease (AD) in the future. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have shown alterations of intrinsic brain activity (IBA) in SCD individuals. However, rs-fMRI studies to date have mainly focused on static characteristics of IBA, with few studies reporting dynamics- and concordance-related changes in IBA indices in SCD individuals. To investigate these aberrant changes, a temporal dynamic analysis of rs-fMRI data was conducted on 94 SCD individuals (71.07 ± 6.18 years, 60 female), 75 (74.36 ± 8.42 years, 35 female) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 82 age-, gender-, and education-matched controls (NCs; 73.88 ± 7.40 years, 49 female) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The dynamics and concordance of the rs-fMRI indices were calculated. The results showed that SCD individuals had a lower amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations dynamics in bilateral hippocampus (HP)/parahippocampal gyrus (PHG)/fusiform gyrus (FG) and bilateral cerebellum, a lower fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation dynamics in bilateral precuneus (PreCu) and paracentral lobule, and a lower regional homogeneity dynamics in bilateral cerebellum, vermis, and left FG compared with the other two groups, whereas those in MCI patients were higher (Gaussian random field–corrected, voxel-level P &lt; 0.001, cluster-level P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, SCD individuals had higher concordance in bilateral HP/PHG/FG, temporal lobe, and left midcingulate cortex than NCs, but those in MCI were lower than those in NCs. No correlation between concordance values and neuropsychological scale scores was found. SCD individuals showed both dynamics and concordance-related alterations in IBA, which indicates a compensatory mechanism in SCD individuals. Temporal dynamics analysis offers a novel approach to capturing brain alterations in individuals with SCD.</p>

<p><span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐glucose uptake in astrocytes is an essential source for the noradrenaline‐induced increase in intracellular L‐lactate. We found that intracellular <span class="smallCaps">l</span>‐lactate arises exclusively from the glycogen—a temporary energy store in the brain. The glycolytic pathway intermediates also support oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. At rest, a large proportion of <span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐glucose is metabolized in the Krebs cycle, since the resting <span class="smallCaps">l</span>‐lactate concentration is low. This is increased when the Krebs cycle is blocked or when cells are stimulated with noradrenaline.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During cognitive efforts mediated by local neuronal networks, approximately 20% of additional energy is required; this is mediated by chemical messengers such as noradrenaline (NA). NA targets astroglial aerobic glycolysis, the hallmark of which is the end product <span class="smallCaps">l</span>‐lactate, a fuel for neurons. Biochemical studies have revealed that astrocytes exhibit a prominent glycogen shunt, in which a portion of <span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐glucose molecules entering the cytoplasm is transiently incorporated into glycogen, a buffer and source of <span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐glucose during increased energy demand. Here, we studied single astrocytes by measuring cytosolic L‐lactate ([lac]<sub>i</sub>) with the FRET nanosensor Laconic. We examined whether NA‐induced increase in [lac]<sub>i</sub> is influenced by: (a) 2‐deoxy‐<span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐glucose (2‐DG, 3 mM), a molecule that enters the cytosol and inhibits the glycolytic pathway; (b) 1,4‐dideoxy‐1,4‐imino‐d‐arabinitol (DAB, 300 µM), a potent inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen degradation; and (c) 3‐nitropropionic acid (3‐NPA, 1 mM), an inhibitor of the Krebs cycle. The results of these pharmacological experiments revealed that <span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐glucose uptake is essential for the NA‐induced increase in [lac]<sub>i</sub>, and that this exclusively arises from glycogen degradation, indicating that most, if not all, <span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐glucose molecules in NA‐stimulated cells transit the glycogen shunt during glycolysis. Moreover, under the defined transmembrane <span class="smallCaps">d</span>‐glucose gradient, the glycolytic intermediates were not only used to produce <span class="smallCaps">l</span>‐lactate, but also to significantly support oxidative phosphorylation, as demonstrated by an elevation in [lac]<sub>i</sub> when Krebs cycle was inhibited. We conclude that <span class="smallCaps">l</span>‐lactate production via aerobic glycolysis is an essential energy pathway in NA‐stimulated astrocytes; however, oxidative metabolism is important at rest.</p>

Wei et al. characterized morpho‐physiological properties and connectivity of VIP+ interneurons in the mouse dentate gyrus. VIP+ interneurons comprise four morphologically distinct subtypes with variable physiological properties and preferentially innervate GABAergic interneurons over glutamatergic principal cells.






ABSTRACT
The hippocampus is a key brain structure for cognitive and emotional functions. Among the hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) is the first station that receives multimodal sensory information from the cortex.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is a key brain structure for cognitive and emotional functions. Among the hippocampal subregions, the dentate gyrus (DG) is the first station that receives multimodal sensory information from the cortex. Local‐circuit inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (INs) regulate the excitation–inhibition balance in the DG principal neurons (PNs) and therefore are critical for information processing. Similar to PNs, GABAergic INs also receive distinct inhibitory inputs. Among various classes of INs, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide‐expressing (VIP<sup>+</sup>) INs preferentially target other INs in several brain regions and thereby directly modulate the GABAergic system. However, the morpho‐physiological characteristics and postsynaptic targets of VIP<sup>+</sup> INs in the DG are poorly understood. Here, we report that VIP<sup>+</sup> INs in the mouse DG are highly heterogeneous based on their morpho‐physiological characteristics. In approximately two‐thirds of morphologically reconstructed cells, their axons ramify in the hilus. The remaining cells project their axons exclusively to the molecular layer (15%), to both the molecular layer and hilus (10%), or throughout the entire DG layers (8%). Generally, VIP<sup>+</sup> INs display variable intrinsic properties and discharge patterns without clear correlation with their morphologies. Finally, VIP<sup>+</sup> INs are recruited with a long latency in response to theta‐band cortical inputs and preferentially innervate GABAergic INs over glutamatergic PNs.

Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple tissue (Tmt) opsins are putative blue‐light‐sensitive photoreceptor protein found in animals. The distributions of mRNA of opn3/tmt‐opsins in the retina and brain of medaka were investigated by in situ hybridization.

Abstract
The photoreceptor protein, opsin, is one of the major components for vision and photoreceptive function in animals. Although many opsins have been discovered from animal genomes, only a few nonimage‐forming functions mediated by opsins have been identified. Understanding the mRNA distribution of photoreceptor proteins is one crucial step in uncovering their photoreceptive function in animals. Here, we focus on the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) Opsin 3 (Opn3)/Teleost multiple opsin (Tmt) system, which constitutes a separate phylogenetic group, having putative blue light photoreceptors for nonimage‐forming functions. In medaka, there is one opn3 and five tmt‐opsin orthologs. The expression pattern of the opn3/tmt‐opsins in the retina and brain was investigated by in situ hybridization. mRNAs for opn3/tmt‐opsins were distributed in the retinal ganglion cells as well as interneurons and specific brain nuclei. Specifically, hybridization signals were observed in the glutamate decarboxylase 1 (gad1)‐expressing amacrine cells for opn3, tmt1a, tmt1b, and tmt2, in the caudal lobe of the cerebellum for tmt1b and tmt2, in the cranial nerve nuclei for opn3, tmt1a, tmt1b, tmt2, and in the rostral pars distalis (adenohypophysis) for opn3. These expression patterns suggest that blue light sensing in the fish retina and brain may be involved in the integration of visual inputs, vestibular function, somatosensation, motor outputs, and pituitary endocrine regulation.

Abstract
Past studies find that chronic stress alters inhibitory, GABAergic circuitry of neurons in distinct hippocampal subregions. Less clear is whether these effects persist weeks after chronic stress ends, and whether these effects involve changes in the total number of hippocampal GABAergic neurons or modulates the function of specific GABAergic subtypes. A transgenic mouse line (VGAT:Cre Ai9) containing an indelible marker for GABAergic neurons (tdTomato) throughout the brain was used to determine whether chronic stress alters total GABAergic neuronal number or the expression of two key GABAergic cell subtypes, calretinin expressing (CR+) and somatostatin expressing (SOM+) neurons, and whether these changes endure weeks later. Male and female mice were chronically stressed in wire mesh restrainers for 6h/d/21d (Str) or not (Con), and then allowed a 3 week rest period (Str‐Rest) and compared to those without a rest period (Str‐NoRest). Epifluorescent microscope images of immunohistochemistry‐processed brains were quantified to estimate the total number of fluorescently‐labeled hippocampal GABAergic neurons and the proportion that were CR+ or SOM+. Neither chronic stress nor sex altered the total number of GABAergic cells. In contrast, chronic stress reduced the expression of CR+ in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in both males and females, with robust reductions in the DG region of males, but not females, and these changes reversed following a rest period. Chronic stress also reduced the proportion of hippocampal SOM+ neurons and this reduction persisted even with a rest period. These results show chronic stress dynamically reduced CR expression without changing total inhibitory neuronal number and point to CR as a potential new lead to understand mechanisms by which chronic stress alters hippocampal function.

Abstract
Hippocampal theta oscillations have been implicated in spatial memory function in both rodents and humans. What is less clear is how hippocampal theta interacts with higher frequency oscillations to support long‐term memory. Here we asked 10 presurgical epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG recording to perform a long‐term spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality and found that increased theta power in two discrete bands (“low” 2‐5 Hz and “high” 6‐11 Hz) during cued retrieval was associated with improved task performance. Similarly, increased coupling between “low” theta phase and gamma amplitude during the same period was associated with improved task performance. Finally, low and high gamma amplitude appeared to peak at different phases of the theta cycle; providing a novel connection between human hippocampal function and rodent data. These results help to elucidate the role of theta oscillations and theta‐gamma phase‐amplitude coupling in human long‐term memory.

Abstract
Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioral correlates, with the magnitude and vigor of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. Theory and empirical experiments suggest theta‐movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi‐step regression, we find that the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using a generalized linear model, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and amplitude. Our findings suggest movement‐speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.

Abstract
Childhood obesity is associated with negative physiological and cognitive health outcomes. The hippocampus is a diverse subcortical structure involved in learned feeding behaviors and energy regulation, and research has shown that the hippocampus is vulnerable to the effects of excess adiposity. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced hippocampal volume in overweight and obese children; however, it is unclear if certain subregions are selectively affected. The purpose of this study was to determine how excess body weight influences regional hippocampal surface morphology and memory performance in a large cross‐sectional cohort of 588 children and adolescents between 8.33 and 19.92 years of age using body mass index expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile cutoff (%BMIp95). We demonstrate %BMIp95 is associated with reduced radial thickness in the superior anterior region of the left hippocampus, and this relationship is predominantly driven by children younger than 14 years. We also found %BMIp95 was associated with worse performance on a spatial episodic memory task and this relationship was partially mediated by the radial thickness of the significant shape cluster. These results demonstrate the differential influence of excess body weight on regional hippocampal structure and hippocampal‐dependent behavior in children and adolescents.

Abstract
Obesity is a chronic condition associated with adverse memory and emotional outcomes in humans and animal models. We have recently demonstrated that post‐weaning (i.e., periadolescent) high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced obesity has opposite effect on hippocampal and amygdala‐dependent memory in rodents: while HFD consumption impairs spatial and relational memory, it enhances cue‐dependent emotional memory. However, it is still not clear whether this bidirectional HFD effect on memory is related to bidirectional alterations of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity and if it is influenced by the duration of diet intake. In the current study, we compared in male rats the impact of 2–3 and 6–7 months of HFD intake starting at weaning, thus covering adolescence, on in vivo long‐term potentiation (LTP) recorded simultaneously in the hippocampal area CA1 and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). As expected, 6–7 months of HFD intake abolished LTP in the CA1 and enhanced LTP in the BLA. However, 2–3 months of of HFD exposure enhanced LTP in both CA1 and BLA suggesting a transient compensatory mechanism in hippocampus. These results indicate that post‐weaning HFD intake progressively leads to bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity, as we previously demonstrated for related memory processes, yet with a different temporal dynamic.

Abstract
The hippocampus carries out multiple functions: spatial cognition dorsally (DH) and regulation of emotionality‐driven behavior ventrally (VH). Previously, we showed that dendrites of DH and VH pyramidal neurons of female rats are still developing robustly during adolescence and are altered by the experience of food restriction and voluntary exercise on a wheel. We tested whether such anatomical changes during adolescence impact anxiety‐like behavior and spatial cognition. Four groups of female rats were evaluated for these behaviors: those with wheel access in its cage from postnatal day (P) 36–44 (EX); those with food access restricted to 1 hr per day, from P40 to 44 (FR); those with EX from P36 to 44, combined with FR from P40 to 44, which we will refer to as EX + FR; and controls, CON (no EX, no FR). Open field test for anxiety‐like behavior and active place avoidance test for spatial cognition were conducted at P47–49, the age when food restricted animals have restored body weight, or at P54–56, to identify more enduring effects. Anxiety‐like behavior was elevated for the EX and FR groups at P47–49 but not for the EX + FR group. By P54–56, the EX + FR and EX groups exhibited less anxiety‐like behavior, indicating a beneficial delayed main effect of exercise. There was a beneficial main effect of food restriction upon cognition, as the FR group showed cognition superior to CONs' at P44–46 and P54–56, while the EX + FR animals also showed enhanced spatial learning at P54–56. EX + FR animals with best adaptation to the feeding schedule showed the best spatial learning performance but with a delay. The EX group exhibited only a transient improvement. These findings indicate that FR, EX, and EX + FR in mid‐adolescence are all beneficial in reducing anxiety‐like behavior and improving spatial cognition but with subtle differences in the timing of their manifestation, possibly reflecting the protracted maturation of the hippocampus.

Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with epileptiform activity in the hippocampus; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully determined. The goal was to understand what changes take place in intrinsic neuronal physiology in the hippocampus after blunt force trauma to the cortex. In this context, hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (Ih) currents may have a critical role in modulating the neuronal intrinsic membrane excitability; therefore, its contribution to the TBI‐induced hyperexcitability was assessed. In a model of TBI caused by controlled cortical impact (CCI), the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons were examined 1 week after TBI induction in rats. Whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings were performed under current‐ and voltage‐clamp conditions following ionotropic receptors blockade. Induction of TBI caused changes in the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, as shown by a significant increase and decrease in firing frequency and in the rheobase current, respectively (p &lt; .05). The evoked firing rate and the action potential time to peak were also significantly increased and decreased, respectively (p &lt; .05). In the TBI group, the amplitude of instantaneous and steady‐state Ih currents was both significantly smaller than those in the control group (p &lt; .05). The Ih current density was also significantly decreased (p &lt; .001). Findings indicated that TBI led to an increase in the intrinsic excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons and changes in Ih current could be, in part, one of the underlying mechanisms involved in this hyperexcitability.

Abstract
Differentiating between similar memories is a crucial cognitive function that enables correct episodic memory formation. The ability to separate the components of memories into distinct representations is thought to rely on a computational process known as pattern separation, by which differences are amplified to disambiguate similar events. Although pattern separation has been localized to the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and shown to occur in a spatial domain, this cognitive function takes place also during processing of other types of information. In particular, there is some debate on whether the DG participates in pattern separation of nonspatial representations. Considering the classic role of the Prh in the acquisition and storage of object memories in general and tasks with similar features in particular, this cognitive function could rely more heavily on perirhinal regions when object‐related information is processed. Here we show that two plasticity‐related proteins, BDNF, and Arc, are required in the DG for nonspatial mnemonic differentiation. Moreover, we found that the crucial role of the DG is transient since activity of AMPAR is only required in the Prh but not the DG during differentiated object memory retrieval. Additionally, this memory is not modifiable by postacquisition rhBDNF infusions in the DG that are known to improve memory when given in the Prh. This highlights a differential role of Prh and DG during differentiated object memory consolidation. Additionally, we found that these molecular mechanisms actively interact in the DG and Prh for the formation of distinguishable memories, with infusions of rhBDNF in the Prh being able to rescue mnemonic deficits caused by reduced Arc expression in the DG. These results reveal a complex interaction between plasticity mechanisms in the Prh and DG for nonspatial pattern separation and posit the Prh as the key structure where unique object representations are stored.

Abstract
Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures, and histopathological abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobe structures, mainly hippocampal sclerosis (HS). We used a multi‐omics approach to determine the profile of transcript and protein expression in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis 3 (CA3) in an animal model of MTLE induced by pilocarpine. We performed label‐free proteomics and RNAseq from laser‐microdissected tissue isolated from pilocarpine‐induced Wistar rats. We divided the DG and CA3 into dorsal and ventral areas and analyzed them separately. We performed a data integration analysis and evaluated enriched signaling pathways, as well as the integrated networks generated based on the gene ontology processes. Our results indicate differences in the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles among the DG and the CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. Moreover, our data suggest that epileptogenesis is enhanced in the CA3 region when compared to the DG, with most abnormalities in transcript and protein levels occurring in the CA3. Furthermore, our results show that the epileptogenesis in the pilocarpine model involves predominantly abnormal regulation of excitatory neuronal mechanisms mediated by N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, changes in the serotonin signaling, and neuronal activity controlled by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase (CaMK) regulation and leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/WNT signaling pathways.

US females compared to US males had: 1) more PENK‐expressing granule cells; 2) fewer OPRD1 expressing granule cells; and 3) more OPRM1‐expressing interneurons in CA3b. CIS females compared to CIS males had less: 1) PDYN expression in granule cells; 2) OPRD1 expression in interneurons in CA3b; 3) OPRM1 probe expression in CA2/3a and granule cell expression; 4) OPRK1 expression in interneurons in CA2/3a and the hilus of the dentate gyrus.






ABSTRACT
Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope in situ hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (~ 14 wk) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed PENK and PDYN; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed PENK. OPRD1 and OPRM1 were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. OPRK1‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. There were few baseline sex differences: US females compared to US males had more PENK‐expressing and fewer OPRD1‐expressing granule cells and more OPRM1‐expressing CA3b interneurons. Several expression differences emerged after CIS. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: 1) PENK‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; 2) OPRD1 probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and 3) OPRK1‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: 1) PDYN expression in granule cells; 2) OPRD1 probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; 3) OPRM1 in granule cells; and 4) OPRK1 interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.

<p>Punishment feels bad, but relief from it feels good. Correspondingly, negative memories are formed for cues when these are associated with the occurrence of punishment. In contrast, positive memories result from their association with relief. Such timing‐dependent valence reversal is observed in humans and in animals alike. Using <i>Drosophila</i> larvae, Weiglein et al. present an odor cue either before or after optogenetically activating single, identified dopaminergic neurons known to mediate punishment. This reveals that these dopaminergic neurons are heterogeneous: DAN‐f1 establishes timing‐dependent valence reversal, whereas DAN‐d1 does not. Together with recent findings in the reward domain and from adult <i>Drosophila</i>, this suggests that such heterogeneity might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Dopamine serves many functions, and dopamine neurons are correspondingly diverse. We use a combination of optogenetics, behavioral experiments, and high‐resolution video‐tracking to probe for the functional capacities of two single, identified dopamine neurons in larval <i>Drosophila</i>. The DAN‐f1 and the DAN‐d1 neuron were recently found to carry aversive teaching signals during Pavlovian olfactory learning. We enquire into a fundamental feature of these teaching signals, namely their temporal “fingerprint”. That is, receiving punishment feels bad, whereas being relieved from it feels good, and animals and humans alike learn with opposite valence about the occurrence and the termination of punishment (the same principle applies in the appetitive domain, with opposite sign). We find that DAN‐f1 but not DAN‐d1 can mediate such timing‐dependent valence reversal: presenting an odor before DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned avoidance of the odor (punishment memory), whereas presenting the odor upon termination of DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned approach (relief memory). In contrast, DAN‐d1 confers punishment memory only. These effects are further characterized in terms of the impact of the duration of optogenetic activation, the temporal stability of the memories thus established, and the specific microbehavioral patterns of locomotion through which they are expressed. Together with recent findings in the appetitive domain and from adult <i>Drosophila</i>, our results suggest that heterogeneity in the temporal fingerprint of teaching signals might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Past studies find that chronic stress alters inhibitory, GABAergic circuitry of neurons in distinct hippocampal subregions. Less clear is whether these effects persist weeks after chronic stress ends, and whether these effects involve changes in the total number of hippocampal GABAergic neurons or modulates the function of specific GABAergic subtypes. A transgenic mouse line (<i>VGAT:Cre Ai9</i>) containing an indelible marker for GABAergic neurons (tdTomato) throughout the brain was used to determine whether chronic stress alters total GABAergic neuronal number or the expression of two key GABAergic cell subtypes, calretinin expressing (CR+) and somatostatin expressing (SOM+) neurons, and whether these changes endure weeks later. Male and female mice were chronically stressed in wire mesh restrainers for 6h/d/21d (Str) or not (Con), and then allowed a 3 week rest period (Str‐Rest) and compared to those without a rest period (Str‐NoRest). Epifluorescent microscope images of immunohistochemistry‐processed brains were quantified to estimate the total number of fluorescently‐labeled hippocampal GABAergic neurons and the proportion that were CR+ or SOM+. Neither chronic stress nor sex altered the total number of GABAergic cells. In contrast, chronic stress reduced the expression of CR+ in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in both males and females, with robust reductions in the DG region of males, but not females, and these changes reversed following a rest period. Chronic stress also reduced the proportion of hippocampal SOM+ neurons and this reduction persisted even with a rest period. These results show chronic stress dynamically reduced CR expression without changing total inhibitory neuronal number and point to CR as a potential new lead to understand mechanisms by which chronic stress alters hippocampal function.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal theta oscillations have been implicated in spatial memory function in both rodents and humans. What is less clear is how hippocampal theta interacts with higher frequency oscillations to support long‐term memory. Here we asked 10 presurgical epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG recording to perform a long‐term spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality and found that increased theta power in two discrete bands (“low” 2‐5 Hz and “high” 6‐11 Hz) during cued retrieval was associated with improved task performance. Similarly, increased coupling between “low” theta phase and gamma amplitude during the same period was associated with improved task performance. Finally, low and high gamma amplitude appeared to peak at different phases of the theta cycle; providing a novel connection between human hippocampal function and rodent data. These results help to elucidate the role of theta oscillations and theta‐gamma phase‐amplitude coupling in human long‐term memory.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioral correlates, with the magnitude and vigor of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. Theory and empirical experiments suggest theta‐movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi‐step regression, we find that the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using a generalized linear model, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and amplitude. Our findings suggest movement‐speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Childhood obesity is associated with negative physiological and cognitive health outcomes. The hippocampus is a diverse subcortical structure involved in learned feeding behaviors and energy regulation, and research has shown that the hippocampus is vulnerable to the effects of excess adiposity. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced hippocampal volume in overweight and obese children; however, it is unclear if certain subregions are selectively affected. The purpose of this study was to determine how excess body weight influences regional hippocampal surface morphology and memory performance in a large cross‐sectional cohort of 588 children and adolescents between 8.33 and 19.92 years of age using body mass index expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile cutoff (%BMIp95). We demonstrate %BMIp95 is associated with reduced radial thickness in the superior anterior region of the left hippocampus, and this relationship is predominantly driven by children younger than 14 years. We also found %BMIp95 was associated with worse performance on a spatial episodic memory task and this relationship was partially mediated by the radial thickness of the significant shape cluster. These results demonstrate the differential influence of excess body weight on regional hippocampal structure and hippocampal‐dependent behavior in children and adolescents.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obesity is a chronic condition associated with adverse memory and emotional outcomes in humans and animal models. We have recently demonstrated that post‐weaning (i.e., periadolescent) high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced obesity has opposite effect on hippocampal and amygdala‐dependent memory in rodents: while HFD consumption impairs spatial and relational memory, it enhances cue‐dependent emotional memory. However, it is still not clear whether this bidirectional HFD effect on memory is related to bidirectional alterations of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity and if it is influenced by the duration of diet intake. In the current study, we compared in male rats the impact of 2–3 and 6–7 months of HFD intake starting at weaning, thus covering adolescence, on in vivo long‐term potentiation (LTP) recorded simultaneously in the hippocampal area CA1 and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). As expected, 6–7 months of HFD intake abolished LTP in the CA1 and enhanced LTP in the BLA. However, 2–3 months of of HFD exposure enhanced LTP in both CA1 and BLA suggesting a transient compensatory mechanism in hippocampus. These results indicate that post‐weaning HFD intake progressively leads to bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity, as we previously demonstrated for related memory processes, yet with a different temporal dynamic.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus carries out multiple functions: spatial cognition dorsally (DH) and regulation of emotionality‐driven behavior ventrally (VH). Previously, we showed that dendrites of DH and VH pyramidal neurons of female rats are still developing robustly during adolescence and are altered by the experience of food restriction and voluntary exercise on a wheel. We tested whether such anatomical changes during adolescence impact anxiety‐like behavior and spatial cognition. Four groups of female rats were evaluated for these behaviors: those with wheel access in its cage from postnatal day (P) 36–44 (EX); those with food access restricted to 1 hr per day, from P40 to 44 (FR); those with EX from P36 to 44, combined with FR from P40 to 44, which we will refer to as EX + FR; and controls, CON (no EX, no FR). Open field test for anxiety‐like behavior and active place avoidance test for spatial cognition were conducted at P47–49, the age when food restricted animals have restored body weight, or at P54–56, to identify more enduring effects. Anxiety‐like behavior was elevated for the EX and FR groups at P47–49 but not for the EX + FR group. By P54–56, the EX + FR and EX groups exhibited less anxiety‐like behavior, indicating a beneficial delayed main effect of exercise. There was a beneficial main effect of food restriction upon cognition, as the FR group showed cognition superior to CONs' at P44–46 and P54–56, while the EX + FR animals also showed enhanced spatial learning at P54–56. EX + FR animals with best adaptation to the feeding schedule showed the best spatial learning performance but with a delay. The EX group exhibited only a transient improvement. These findings indicate that FR, EX, and EX + FR in mid‐adolescence are all beneficial in reducing anxiety‐like behavior and improving spatial cognition but with subtle differences in the timing of their manifestation, possibly reflecting the protracted maturation of the hippocampus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with epileptiform activity in the hippocampus; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully determined. The goal was to understand what changes take place in intrinsic neuronal physiology in the hippocampus after blunt force trauma to the cortex. In this context, hyperpolarization‐activated cation current (I<sub>h</sub>) currents may have a critical role in modulating the neuronal intrinsic membrane excitability; therefore, its contribution to the TBI‐induced hyperexcitability was assessed. In a model of TBI caused by controlled cortical impact (CCI), the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons were examined 1 week after TBI induction in rats. Whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings were performed under current‐ and voltage‐clamp conditions following ionotropic receptors blockade. Induction of TBI caused changes in the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons, as shown by a significant increase and decrease in firing frequency and in the rheobase current, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). The evoked firing rate and the action potential time to peak were also significantly increased and decreased, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). In the TBI group, the amplitude of instantaneous and steady‐state I<sub>h</sub> currents was both significantly smaller than those in the control group (<i>p</i> &lt; .05). The I<sub>h</sub> current density was also significantly decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Findings indicated that TBI led to an increase in the intrinsic excitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons and changes in I<sub>h</sub> current could be, in part, one of the underlying mechanisms involved in this hyperexcitability.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Differentiating between similar memories is a crucial cognitive function that enables correct episodic memory formation. The ability to separate the components of memories into distinct representations is thought to rely on a computational process known as pattern separation, by which differences are amplified to disambiguate similar events. Although pattern separation has been localized to the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and shown to occur in a spatial domain, this cognitive function takes place also during processing of other types of information. In particular, there is some debate on whether the DG participates in pattern separation of nonspatial representations. Considering the classic role of the Prh in the acquisition and storage of object memories in general and tasks with similar features in particular, this cognitive function could rely more heavily on perirhinal regions when object‐related information is processed. Here we show that two plasticity‐related proteins, BDNF, and Arc, are required in the DG for nonspatial mnemonic differentiation. Moreover, we found that the crucial role of the DG is transient since activity of AMPAR is only required in the Prh but not the DG during differentiated object memory retrieval. Additionally, this memory is not modifiable by postacquisition rhBDNF infusions in the DG that are known to improve memory when given in the Prh. This highlights a differential role of Prh and DG during differentiated object memory consolidation. Additionally, we found that these molecular mechanisms actively interact in the DG and Prh for the formation of distinguishable memories, with infusions of rhBDNF in the Prh being able to rescue mnemonic deficits caused by reduced Arc expression in the DG. These results reveal a complex interaction between plasticity mechanisms in the Prh and DG for nonspatial pattern separation and posit the Prh as the key structure where unique object representations are stored.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures, and histopathological abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobe structures, mainly hippocampal sclerosis (HS). We used a multi‐omics approach to determine the profile of transcript and protein expression in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and <i>Cornu Ammonis</i> 3 (CA3) in an animal model of MTLE induced by pilocarpine. We performed label‐free proteomics and RNAseq from laser‐microdissected tissue isolated from pilocarpine‐induced Wistar rats. We divided the DG and CA3 into dorsal and ventral areas and analyzed them separately. We performed a data integration analysis and evaluated enriched signaling pathways, as well as the integrated networks generated based on the gene ontology processes. Our results indicate differences in the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles among the DG and the CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. Moreover, our data suggest that epileptogenesis is enhanced in the CA3 region when compared to the DG, with most abnormalities in transcript and protein levels occurring in the CA3. Furthermore, our results show that the epileptogenesis in the pilocarpine model involves predominantly abnormal regulation of excitatory neuronal mechanisms mediated by N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, changes in the serotonin signaling, and neuronal activity controlled by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase (CaMK) regulation and leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/WNT signaling pathways.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic immobilization stress (CIS) results in sex‐dependent changes in opioid peptide levels and receptor subcellular distributions within the rat dorsal hippocampus which are paralleled with an inability for males to acquire conditioned place preference (CPP) to oxycodone. Here, RNAScope <i>in situ</i> hybridization was used to determine the expression of hippocampal opioid peptides and receptors in unstressed (US) and CIS estrus female and male adult (~ 14 wk) Sprague Dawley rats. In all groups, dentate granule cells expressed <i>PENK</i> and <i>PDYN</i>; additionally, numerous interneurons expressed <i>PENK</i>. <i>OPRD1</i> and <i>OPRM1</i> were primarily expressed in interneurons, and to a lesser extent, in pyramidal and granule cells. <i>OPRK1</i>‐was expressed in sparsely distributed interneurons. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There were few baseline sex differences</span>: US females compared to US males had more <i>PENK‐</i>expressing and fewer <i>OPRD1</i>‐expressing granule cells and more <i>OPRM1‐</i>expressing CA3b interneurons. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Several expression differences emerged after CIS</span>. Both CIS females and males compared to their US counterparts had elevated: 1) <i>PENK</i>‐expressing dentate granule cells and interneurons in CA1 and CA2/3a; 2) <i>OPRD1</i> probe number and cell expression in CA1, CA2/3a and CA3b and the dentate gyrus; and 3) <i>OPRK1</i>‐expressing interneurons in the dentate hilus. Also, CIS males compared to US males had elevated: 1) <i>PDYN</i> expression in granule cells; 2) <i>OPRD1</i> probe and interneuron expression in CA2/3a; 3) <i>OPRM1</i> in granule cells; and 4) <i>OPRK1</i> interneuron expression in CA2/3a. The sex‐specific changes in hippocampal opioid gene expression may impact network properties and synaptic plasticity processes that may contribute to the attenuation of oxycodone CPP in CIS males.</p>

The present study reveals that low doses of BrdU (from 25 to 75 μg/g) have no deleterious effects on the development of the rat cerebellar neuroepithelium. Our results also denote that the BrdU injection at doses ranging from 100 to 300 μg/g alters neuroblasts proliferation and induces the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum.







Abstract
The current study was conducted to assess whether a single administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (BrdU) interferes with cell proliferation and leads to the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (25–300 μg/g b.w.) were analyzed using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural procedures. The pregnant rats were injected with BrdU at embryonic day 13, and their fetuses were sacrificed from 5 to 35 hr after exposure. The quantification of several parameters such as the density of mitotic figures, and BrdU and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)‐reactive cells showed that, in comparison with the saline injected rats, the administration of BrdU impairs the proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial cells. The above‐mentioned parameters were significantly reduced in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The reduction was more evident using 200 μg/g b.w. The most severe effects were found with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The present findings also revealed that high doses of BrdU lead to the activation of apoptotic cellular events as evidenced by both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for active caspase‐3. In comparison with saline rats, many apoptotic cells were found in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The number of dying cells increased with 200 μg/g b.w. The most important number of apoptotic cells were observed in animals injected with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of neuroblasts at different stages of apoptosis.

Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here, we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.







Abstract
BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific Bmal1 knockout cones (cone‐Bmal1−/−) and wild‐type (WT) cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, Complexin3 (Cplx3), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐Bmal1−/− cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in WT cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of Cplx4—the other complexin expressed in cones—were similar in WT and mutant cones; in WT cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. In silico analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of Cplx3 and none upstream of exon one of Cplx4. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.

The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of muscle cells. In Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.







Abstract
The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm2). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm2). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm2). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen—probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some Campylomormyrus species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.

Acetylcholinesterase and Nissl‐staining in the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin Hippocampal Formation.







Abstract
The cetacean hippocampal formation has been noted to be one of the smallest relative to brain size of all mammals studied. This region, comprised of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and the entorhinal cortex, is important in learning, memory, and navigation. There have been a number of studies detailing the distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the hippocampal formation of terrestrial mammals with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of some aspects of the cholinergic innervation to this region, as well as its parcellation. The present study was undertaken to describe the organization, cytoarchitecture, and distribution of AChE in the hippocampal formation of the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin (AWSD) with the view to understand similarities and differences between this aquatic mammal and terrestrial mammals. Nissl‐staining demonstrated cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation in the AWSD comparable to that reported in other cetaceans. In addition, the AWSD had a rich pattern of AChE staining that distinctly varied between regions and laminae. A number of differences in the distribution of AChE staining in areas comparable to those of terrestrial species reported suggested possible alterations in connectivity of this region. Overall, however, AChE‐staining suggested that cholinergic innervation, neural pathways and function of the hippocampal formation of the AWSD is conserved, similar to other mammals.

The evolution of syllable structure in speech depended upon a coupling between vocalization and oscillatory movement of the jaw. Using functional MRI, we identify the neural basis of this coupling by demonstrating overlapping representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human motor cortex.







Abstract
A prominent model of the origins of speech, known as the “frame/content” theory, posits that oscillatory lowering and raising of the jaw provided an evolutionary scaffold for the development of syllable structure in speech. Because such oscillations are nonvocal in most nonhuman primates, the evolution of speech required the addition of vocalization onto this scaffold in order to turn such jaw oscillations into vocalized syllables. In the present functional MRI study, we demonstrate overlapping somatotopic representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human primary motor cortex. This proximity between the larynx and jaw in the brain might support the coupling between vocalization and jaw oscillations to generate syllable structure. This model suggests that humans inherited voluntary control of jaw oscillations from ancestral species, but added voluntary control of vocalization onto this via the evolution of a new brain area that came to be situated near the jaw region in the human motor cortex.

Validation of [3H] CP‐55,940 for autoradiography of endocannabinoid receptors in prairie vole brains. Three adjacent sections of brain tissue were incubated with [3H] CP‐55,940 with or without an unlabeled receptor competitor. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB2 blocker (HU308) had no discernible impact on binding in the hippocampus but increased binding in the prefrontal cortex relative to control. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB1 blocker (AM251) significantly decreased signal in both regions.







Abstract
Across many species, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating social play, reward, and anxiety. These processes are mediated through at least two distinct cannabinoid receptors (CB), CB1 and CB2. CB1 expression is found in appreciable densities across regions of the brain that integrate memory with socio‐spatial information; many of these regions have been directly linked to the neurobiology of pair bonding in monogamous species. Using receptor autoradiography, we provide the first distributional map of CB1 within the brains of closely related monogamous prairie voles and promiscuous meadow voles, and compare receptor densities across sexes and species in limbic regions. We observe CB1‐specific signal using [3H] CP‐55,940 and [3H] SR141716A, though the latter exhibited a lower signal to noise ratio. We confirmed the presence of CB2 in prairie vole spleen tissue using [3H] CP‐55,940. However, we found no evidence of CB2 in the brain using either [3H] CP‐55,940 or [3H] A‐836,339. The overall distribution of putative CB1 in the brain was similar across vole species and followed the pattern of CB1 expression observed in other species—high intensity binding within the telencephalon, moderate binding within the diencephalon, and mild binding within the mesencephalon and metencephalon (aside from the cerebellar cortex). However, we found profound differences in CB1 densities across species, with prairie voles having higher CB1 binding in regions implicated in social attachment and spatial memory (e.g., periaqueductal gray, hippocampus). These findings suggest that CB1 densities, but not distribution, correlate with the social systems of vole species.

We used multiple methods for examining the arginine vasotocin (AVT) system in female African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni. AVT‐ir cell size varied with female reproductive state in a cell type‐dependent manner. Ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocelluar cells than brooding females, and gigantocellular AVT‐ir cell size correlated with the number of days brooding. Overall, our data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males.







Abstract
Nonapeptides play a crucial role in mediating reproduction, aggression, and parental care across taxa. In fishes, arginine vasotocin (AVT) expression is related to social and/or reproductive status in most male fishes studied to date, and is linked to territorial defense, paternal care, and courtship. Despite a plethora of studies examining AVT in male fishes, relatively little is known about how AVT expression varies with female reproductive state or its role in female social behaviors. We used multiple methods for examining the AVT system in female African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, including immunohistochemistry for AVT, in situ hybridization for avt‐mRNA, and quantitative PCR. Ovulated and mouthbrooding females had similar numbers of parvocellular, magnocellular, and gigantocellular AVT cells in the preoptic area. However, ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocellular cells compared to mouthbrooding females, and gigantocellular AVT cell size correlated with the number of days brooding, such that late‐stage brooding females had larger AVT cells than mid‐stage brooding females. In addition, we found that ventral hypothalamic cells were more prominent in females compared to males, and were larger in mouthbrooding compared to ovulated females, suggesting a role in maternal care. Together, these data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males. These data on females complement studies in male A. burtoni, providing a comprehensive picture of the regulation and potential function of different AVT cell types in reproduction and social behaviors in both sexes.

In opossums, spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regeneration diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. Analysis of the postinjury transcriptomes suggests that there is a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a stronger influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury, and suggesting that a prolonged immune response may be inhibitory to spinal cord regeneration.







Abstract
This study investigates the response to spinal cord injury in the gray short‐tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica). In opossums spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regenerative potential diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration remain unknown. RNA sequencing was used to identify differential gene expression in regenerating (SCI at postnatal Day 7, P7SCI) and nonregenerating (SCI at Day 28, P28SCI) cords +1d, +3d, and +7d after complete spinal transection, compared to age‐matched controls. Genes showing significant differential expression (log2FC ≥ 1, Padj ≤ 0.05) were used for downstream analysis. Across all time‐points 233 genes altered expression after P7SCI, and 472 genes altered expression after P28SCI. One hundred and forty‐seven genes altered expression in both injury ages (63% of P7SCI data set). The majority of changes were gene upregulations. Gene ontology overrepresentation analysis in P7SCI gene‐sets showed significant overrepresentations only in immune‐associated categories, while P28SCI gene‐sets showed overrepresentations in these same immune categories, along with other categories such as “cell proliferation,” “cell adhesion,” and “apoptosis.” Cell‐type–association analysis suggested that, regardless of injury age, injury‐associated gene transcripts were most strongly associated with microglia and endothelial cells, with strikingly fewer astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and neuron‐related genes, the notable exception being a cluster of mostly downregulated oligodendrocyte‐associated genes in the P7SCI + 7d gene‐set. Our findings demonstrate a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a strong influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury and providing the largest survey yet of the transcriptomic changes occurring after SCI in this model.

Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Auditory evoked potentials are abnormal in this disease. Human mutation D249N impairs central function. A302T‐mutant taiep rats presents longer latencies in central waves. Both mutations severely impair the central hearing pathway by progressive central white matter degeneration.







Abstract
Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H‐ABC) is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Patients suffer from extrapyramidal movements, spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging features are hypomyelination and atrophy of the striatum and cerebellum. A correlation between the mutations and their cellular, tissue and organic effects is largely missing. The effects of these mutations on sensory functions have not been described so far. We have previously reported a rat carrying a TUBB4A (A302T) mutation and sharing most of the clinical and radiological signs with H‐ABC patients. Here, for the first time, we did a comparative study of the hearing function in an H‐ABC patient and in this mutant model. By analyzing hearing function, we found that there are no significant differences in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds between mutant rats and WT controls. Nevertheless, ABRs show longer latencies in central waves (II–IV) that in some cases disappear when compared to WT. The patient also shows abnormal AEPs presenting only Waves I and II. Distortion product of otoacoustic emissions and immunohistochemistry in the rat show that the peripheral hearing function and morphology of the organ of Corti are normal. We conclude that the tubulin mutation severely impairs the central hearing pathway most probably by progressive central white matter degeneration. Hearing function might be affected in a significant fraction of patients with H‐ABC; therefore, screening for auditory function should be done on patients with tubulinopathies to evaluate hearing support therapies.

Neurons of the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdm) project onto hypothalamic nuclei including the paraventricular (PVH), dorsomedial (DMH), arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). In particular, BNSTdm neurons innervate proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) expressing neurons of the ARH and the LHA, respectively.







Abstract
As stressful environment is a potent modulator of feeding, we seek in the present work to decipher the neuroanatomical basis for an interplay between stress and feeding behaviors. For this, we combined anterograde and retrograde tracing with immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the patterns of projections between the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), well connected to the amygdala, and hypothalamic structures such as the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH), the arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic areas (LHA) known to control feeding and motivated behaviors. We particularly focused our study on afferences to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating‐hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) neurons characteristics of the ARH and the LHA, respectively. We found light to intense innervation of all these hypothalamic nuclei. We particularly showed an innervation of POMC, AgRP, MCH and ORX neurons by the dorsomedial and dorsolateral divisions of the BNST. Therefore, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of the stress‐related feeding behaviors.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The current study was conducted to assess whether a single administration of 5‐bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (BrdU) interferes with cell proliferation and leads to the activation of apoptotic cellular events in the prenatal cerebellum. BrdU effects across a wide range of doses (25–300 μg/g b.w.) were analyzed using immunohistochemical and ultrastructural procedures. The pregnant rats were injected with BrdU at embryonic day 13, and their fetuses were sacrificed from 5 to 35 hr after exposure. The quantification of several parameters such as the density of mitotic figures, and BrdU and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)‐reactive cells showed that, in comparison with the saline injected rats, the administration of BrdU impairs the proliferative behavior of neuroepithelial cells. The above‐mentioned parameters were significantly reduced in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The reduction was more evident using 200 μg/g b.w. The most severe effects were found with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The present findings also revealed that high doses of BrdU lead to the activation of apoptotic cellular events as evidenced by both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemistry for active caspase‐3. In comparison with saline rats, many apoptotic cells were found in rats injected with 100 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. The number of dying cells increased with 200 μg/g b.w. The most important number of apoptotic cells were observed in animals injected with 300 μg/g b.w. of BrdU. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of neuroblasts at different stages of apoptosis.</p>

<p>Complexin3 (CPLX3) is a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses. Here, we show that the expression of CPLX3 is rhythmic at the synaptic terminal of cone photoreceptors with high values during the day and lower values at night. Silencing the circadian clock specifically in cones eliminates rhythmic expression of the protein in cone pedicles. Rhythmic expression of CPLX3 may modulate the synaptic transmission of cone signals to downstream retinal circuits between day and night.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>BMAL1 is a core component of the mammalian circadian clockwork. Removal of BMAL1 from the retina significantly affects visual information processing in both rod and cone pathways. To identify potential pathways and/or molecules through which BMAL1 alters signal transmission at the cone pedicle, we performed an RNA‐seq differential expression analysis between cone‐specific <i>Bmal1</i> knockout cones (cone‐<i>Bmal1</i>
<sup>−/−</sup>) and wild‐type (WT) cones. We found 88 genes differentially expressed. Among these, <i>Complexin3</i> (<i>Cplx3</i>), a SNARE regulator at ribbon synapses, was downregulated fivefold in the mutant cones. The purpose of this work was to determine whether BMAL1 and/or the cone clock controls CPLX3 protein expression at cone pedicles. We found that CPLX3 expression level was decreased twofold in cone‐<i>Bmal1</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> cones. Furthermore, CPLX3 expression was downregulated at night compared to the day in WT cones but remained constitutively low in mutant cones both day and night. The transcript and protein expression levels of <i>Cplx4—</i>the other complexin expressed in cones—were similar in WT and mutant cones; in WT cones, CPLX4 protein level did not change with the time of day. In silico analysis revealed four potential BMAL1:CLOCK binding sites upstream from exon one of <i>Cplx3</i> and none upstream of exon one of <i>Cplx4</i>. Our results suggest that CPLX3 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by the cone clock. The modulation of CPLX3 may be a mechanism by which the clock controls the cone synaptic transfer function to second‐order cells and thereby impacts retinal signal processing during the day/night cycle.</p>

<p>The electric organ (EO) of mormyrid weakly electric fish is located in the tail on either side of the spinal cord. It consists of dorsal and ventral columns of serially arranged electrocytes which are derivatives of muscle cells. In <i>Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus</i> it produces a long triphasic discharge. We investigated the development of the EOD and the morphology of the electrocytes in order to correlate ontogenetic changes in length and shape of the EOD with dynamic morphological characteristics of the electrocyte, in particular the formation of surface evaginations (papillae) of the anterior face of electrocytes.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The electric organ of the mormyrid weakly electric fish, <i>Campylomormyrus rhynchophorus</i> (Boulenger, 1898), undergoes changes in both the electric organ discharge (EOD) and the light and electron microscopic morphology as the fish mature from the juvenile to the adult form. Of particular interest was the appearance of papillae, surface specializations of the uninnervated anterior face of the electrocyte, which have been hypothesized to increase the duration of the EOD. In a 24.5 mm long juvenile the adult electric organ (EO) was not yet functional, and the electrocytes lacked papillae. A 40 mm long juvenile, which produced a short biphasic EOD of 1.3 ms duration, shows small papillae (average area 136 μm<sup>2</sup>). In contrast, the EOD of a 79 mm long juvenile was triphasic. The large increase in duration of the EOD to 23.2 ms was accompanied by a small change in size of the papillae (average area 159 μm<sup>2</sup>). Similarly, a 150 mm long adult produced a triphasic EOD of comparable duration to the younger stage (24.7 ms) but featured a prominent increase in size of the papillae (average area 402 μm<sup>2</sup>). Thus, there was no linear correlation between EOD duration and papillary size. The most prominent ultrastructural change was at the level of the myofilaments, which regularly extended into the papillae, only in the oldest specimen—probably serving a supporting function. Physiological mechanisms, like gene expression levels, as demonstrated in some <i>Campylomormyrus</i> species, might be more important concerning the duration of the EOD.</p>

<p>Acetylcholinesterase and Nissl‐staining in the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin Hippocampal Formation.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cetacean hippocampal formation has been noted to be one of the smallest relative to brain size of all mammals studied. This region, comprised of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and the entorhinal cortex, is important in learning, memory, and navigation. There have been a number of studies detailing the distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the hippocampal formation of terrestrial mammals with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of some aspects of the cholinergic innervation to this region, as well as its parcellation. The present study was undertaken to describe the organization, cytoarchitecture, and distribution of AChE in the hippocampal formation of the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin (AWSD) with the view to understand similarities and differences between this aquatic mammal and terrestrial mammals. Nissl‐staining demonstrated cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation in the AWSD comparable to that reported in other cetaceans. In addition, the AWSD had a rich pattern of AChE staining that distinctly varied between regions and laminae. A number of differences in the distribution of AChE staining in areas comparable to those of terrestrial species reported suggested possible alterations in connectivity of this region. Overall, however, AChE‐staining suggested that cholinergic innervation, neural pathways and function of the hippocampal formation of the AWSD is conserved, similar to other mammals.</p>

<p>The evolution of syllable structure in speech depended upon a coupling between vocalization and oscillatory movement of the jaw. Using functional MRI, we identify the neural basis of this coupling by demonstrating overlapping representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human motor cortex.

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A prominent model of the origins of speech, known as the “frame/content” theory, posits that oscillatory lowering and raising of the jaw provided an evolutionary scaffold for the development of syllable structure in speech. Because such oscillations are nonvocal in most nonhuman primates, the evolution of speech required the addition of vocalization onto this scaffold in order to turn such jaw oscillations into vocalized syllables. In the present functional MRI study, we demonstrate overlapping somatotopic representations between the larynx and the jaw muscles in the human primary motor cortex. This proximity between the larynx and jaw in the brain might support the coupling between vocalization and jaw oscillations to generate syllable structure. This model suggests that humans inherited voluntary control of jaw oscillations from ancestral species, but added voluntary control of vocalization onto this via the evolution of a new brain area that came to be situated near the jaw region in the human motor cortex.</p>

<p>Validation of [3H] CP‐55,940 for autoradiography of endocannabinoid receptors in prairie vole brains. Three adjacent sections of brain tissue were incubated with [3H] CP‐55,940 with or without an unlabeled receptor competitor. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB2 blocker (HU308) had no discernible impact on binding in the hippocampus but increased binding in the prefrontal cortex relative to control. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB1 blocker (AM251) significantly decreased signal in both regions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Across many species, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating social play, reward, and anxiety. These processes are mediated through at least two distinct cannabinoid receptors (CB), CB1 and CB2. CB1 expression is found in appreciable densities across regions of the brain that integrate memory with socio‐spatial information; many of these regions have been directly linked to the neurobiology of pair bonding in monogamous species. Using receptor autoradiography, we provide the first distributional map of CB1 within the brains of closely related monogamous prairie voles and promiscuous meadow voles, and compare receptor densities across sexes and species in limbic regions. We observe CB1‐specific signal using [3H] CP‐55,940 and [3H] SR141716A, though the latter exhibited a lower signal to noise ratio. We confirmed the presence of CB2 in prairie vole spleen tissue using [3H] CP‐55,940. However, we found no evidence of CB2 in the brain using either [3H] CP‐55,940 or [3H] A‐836,339. The overall distribution of putative CB1 in the brain was similar across vole species and followed the pattern of CB1 expression observed in other species—high intensity binding within the telencephalon, moderate binding within the diencephalon, and mild binding within the mesencephalon and metencephalon (aside from the cerebellar cortex). However, we found profound differences in CB1 densities across species, with prairie voles having higher CB1 binding in regions implicated in social attachment and spatial memory (e.g., periaqueductal gray, hippocampus). These findings suggest that CB1 densities, but not distribution, correlate with the social systems of vole species.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nonapeptides play a crucial role in mediating reproduction, aggression, and parental care across taxa. In fishes, <i>arginine vasotocin</i> (AVT) expression is related to social and/or reproductive status in most male fishes studied to date, and is linked to territorial defense, paternal care, and courtship. Despite a plethora of studies examining AVT in male fishes, relatively little is known about how AVT expression varies with female reproductive state or its role in female social behaviors. We used multiple methods for examining the AVT system in female African cichlid fish <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, including immunohistochemistry for AVT, in situ hybridization for <i>avt</i>‐mRNA, and quantitative PCR. Ovulated and mouthbrooding females had similar numbers of parvocellular, magnocellular, and gigantocellular AVT cells in the preoptic area. However, ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocellular cells compared to mouthbrooding females, and gigantocellular AVT cell size correlated with the number of days brooding, such that late‐stage brooding females had larger AVT cells than mid‐stage brooding females. In addition, we found that ventral hypothalamic cells were more prominent in females compared to males, and were larger in mouthbrooding compared to ovulated females, suggesting a role in maternal care. Together, these data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males. These data on females complement studies in male <i>A</i>. <i>burtoni</i>, providing a comprehensive picture of the regulation and potential function of different AVT cell types in reproduction and social behaviors in both sexes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study investigates the response to spinal cord injury in the gray short‐tailed opossum (<i>Monodelphis domestica</i>). In opossums spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regenerative potential diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration remain unknown. RNA sequencing was used to identify differential gene expression in regenerating (SCI at postnatal Day 7, P7SCI) and nonregenerating (SCI at Day 28, P28SCI) cords +1d, +3d, and +7d after complete spinal transection, compared to age‐matched controls. Genes showing significant differential expression (log2FC ≥ 1, <i>Padj</i> ≤ 0.05) were used for downstream analysis. Across all time‐points 233 genes altered expression after P7SCI, and 472 genes altered expression after P28SCI. One hundred and forty‐seven genes altered expression in both injury ages (63% of P7SCI data set). The majority of changes were gene upregulations. Gene ontology overrepresentation analysis in P7SCI gene‐sets showed significant overrepresentations only in immune‐associated categories, while P28SCI gene‐sets showed overrepresentations in these same immune categories, along with other categories such as “cell proliferation,” “cell adhesion,” and “apoptosis.” Cell‐type–association analysis suggested that, regardless of injury age, injury‐associated gene transcripts were most strongly associated with microglia and endothelial cells, with strikingly fewer astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and neuron‐related genes, the notable exception being a cluster of mostly downregulated oligodendrocyte‐associated genes in the P7SCI + 7d gene‐set. Our findings demonstrate a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a strong influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury and providing the largest survey yet of the transcriptomic changes occurring after SCI in this model.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H‐ABC) is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Patients suffer from extrapyramidal movements, spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging features are hypomyelination and atrophy of the striatum and cerebellum. A correlation between the mutations and their cellular, tissue and organic effects is largely missing. The effects of these mutations on sensory functions have not been described so far. We have previously reported a rat carrying a TUBB4A (A302T) mutation and sharing most of the clinical and radiological signs with H‐ABC patients. Here, for the first time, we did a comparative study of the hearing function in an H‐ABC patient and in this mutant model. By analyzing hearing function, we found that there are no significant differences in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds between mutant rats and WT controls. Nevertheless, ABRs show longer latencies in central waves (II–IV) that in some cases disappear when compared to WT. The patient also shows abnormal AEPs presenting only Waves I and II. Distortion product of otoacoustic emissions and immunohistochemistry in the rat show that the peripheral hearing function and morphology of the organ of Corti are normal. We conclude that the tubulin mutation severely impairs the central hearing pathway most probably by progressive central white matter degeneration. Hearing function might be affected in a significant fraction of patients with H‐ABC; therefore, screening for auditory function should be done on patients with tubulinopathies to evaluate hearing support therapies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>As stressful environment is a potent modulator of feeding, we seek in the present work to decipher the neuroanatomical basis for an interplay between stress and feeding behaviors. For this, we combined anterograde and retrograde tracing with immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the patterns of projections between the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), well connected to the amygdala, and hypothalamic structures such as the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH), the arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic areas (LHA) known to control feeding and motivated behaviors. We particularly focused our study on afferences to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating‐hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) neurons characteristics of the ARH and the LHA, respectively. We found light to intense innervation of all these hypothalamic nuclei. We particularly showed an innervation of POMC, AgRP, MCH and ORX neurons by the dorsomedial and dorsolateral divisions of the BNST. Therefore, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of the stress‐related feeding behaviors.</p>

We describe a novel method to culture the intact spinal cord of the chicken embryo for live imaging of axon guidance at the midline. The stability of this ex vivo method allowed us to characterize key aspects of midline crossing, such as axonal growth, timing of crossing, dynamic morphological changes of the growth cones, and growth cone‐floor plate cell interactions.







Abstract
During neural circuit formation, axons navigate several choice points to reach their final target. At each one of these intermediate targets, growth cones need to switch responsiveness from attraction to repulsion in order to move on. Molecular mechanisms that allow for the precise timing of surface expression of a new set of receptors that support the switch in responsiveness are difficult to study in vivo. Mostly, mechanisms are inferred from the observation of snapshots of many different growth cones analyzed in different preparations of tissue harvested at distinct time points. However, to really understand the behavior of growth cones at choice points, a single growth cone should be followed arriving at and leaving the intermediate target. Existing ex vivo preparations, like cultures of an “open‐book” preparation of the spinal cord have been successfully used to study floor plate entry and exit, but artifacts prevent the analysis of growth cone behavior at the floor plate exit site. Here, we describe a novel spinal cord preparation that allows for live imaging of individual axons during navigation in their intact environment. When comparing growth cone behavior in our ex vivo system with snapshots from in vivo navigation, we do not see any differences. The possibility to observe the dynamics of single growth cones navigating their intermediate target allows for measuring growth speed, changes in morphology, or aberrant behavior, like stalling and wrong turning. Moreover, observation of the intermediate target—the floor plate—revealed its active participation and interaction with commissural axons during midline crossing.

Microbial conversion of dietary or drug substrates into small bioactive molecules represents a regulatory mechanism by which the gut microbiota alters intestinal physiology. Here, we show that a wide variety of gut bacteria can metabolize the dietary supplement and antidepressant 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) to 5-hydroxyindole (5-HI) via the tryptophanase (TnaA) enzyme. Oral administration of 5-HTP results in detection of 5-HI in fecal samples of healthy volunteers with interindividual variation. The production of 5-HI is inhibited upon pH reduction in in vitro studies. When administered orally in rats, 5-HI significantly accelerates the total gut transit time (TGTT). Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of action reveals that 5-HI accelerates gut contractility via activation of L-type calcium channels located on the colonic smooth muscle cells. Moreover, 5-HI stimulation of a cell line model of intestinal enterochromaffin cells results in significant increase in serotonin production. Together, our findings support a role for bacterial metabolism in altering gut motility and lay the foundation for microbiota-targeted interventions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/-M6xa0R8kNU" width="1" />

<p>by Hannah Greenfeld, Jerome Lin, Mary C. Mullins</p>

Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) patterns the dorsal–ventral (DV) embryonic axis in all vertebrates, but it is unknown how cells along the DV axis interpret and translate the gradient of BMP signaling into differential gene activation that will give rise to distinct cell fates. To determine the mechanism of BMP morphogen interpretation in the zebrafish gastrula, we identified 57 genes that are directly activated by BMP signaling. By using Seurat analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we found that these genes are expressed in at least 3 distinct DV domains of the embryo. We distinguished between 3 models of BMP signal interpretation in which cells activate distinct gene expression through interpretation of thresholds of (1) the BMP signaling gradient slope; (2) the BMP signal duration; or (3) the level of BMP signal activation. We tested these 3 models using quantitative measurements of phosphorylated Smad5 (pSmad5) and by examining the spatial relationship between BMP signaling and activation of different target genes at single-cell resolution across the embryo. We found that BMP signaling gradient slope or BMP exposure duration did not account for the differential target gene expression domains. Instead, we show that cells respond to 3 distinct levels of BMP signaling activity to activate and position target gene expression. Together, we demonstrate that distinct pSmad5 threshold levels activate spatially distinct target genes to pattern the DV axis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S2FGF5XjcJs" width="1" />

<p>by Xavier Prasanna, Veijo T. Salo, Shiqian Li, Katharina Ven, Helena Vihinen, Eija Jokitalo, Ilpo Vattulainen, Elina Ikonen</p>

Seipin is a disk-like oligomeric endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein important for lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and triacylglycerol (TAG) delivery to growing LDs. Here we show through biomolecular simulations bridged to experiments that seipin can trap TAGs in the ER bilayer via the luminal hydrophobic helices of the protomers delineating the inner opening of the seipin disk. This promotes the nanoscale sequestration of TAGs at a concentration that by itself is insufficient to induce TAG clustering in a lipid membrane. We identify Ser166 in the α3 helix as a favored TAG occupancy site and show that mutating it compromises the ability of seipin complexes to sequester TAG in silico and to promote TAG transfer to LDs in cells. While the S166D-seipin mutant colocalizes poorly with promethin, the association of nascent wild-type seipin complexes with promethin is promoted by TAGs. Together, these results suggest that seipin traps TAGs via its luminal hydrophobic helices, serving as a catalyst for seeding the TAG cluster from dissolved monomers inside the seipin ring, thereby generating a favorable promethin binding interface.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Qbl1rGxhj9I" width="1" />

The protein α‐synuclein is central to Parkinson's disease. For the first time, we report that α‐synuclein from Parkinson's patients brain samples caused signaling deficits in brain cells, and novel drug candidates known to block the sigma‐2 receptor complex reversed these deficits.

Abstract
α‐Synuclein oligomers are thought to have a pivotal role in sporadic and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and related α‐synucleinopathies, causing dysregulation of protein trafficking, autophagy/lysosomal function, and protein clearance, as well as synaptic function impairment underlying motor and cognitive symptoms of PD. Moreover, trans‐synaptic spread of α‐synuclein oligomers is hypothesized to mediate disease progression. Therapeutic approaches that effectively block α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced pathogenesis are urgently needed. Here, we show for the first time that α‐synuclein species isolated from human PD patient brain and recombinant α‐synuclein oligomers caused similar deficits in lipid vesicle trafficking rates in cultured rat neurons and glia, while α‐synuclein species isolated from non‐PD human control brain samples did not. Recombinant α‐synuclein oligomers also increased neuronal expression of lysosomal‐associated membrane protein‐2A (LAMP‐2A), the lysosomal receptor that has a critical role in chaperone‐mediated autophagy. Unbiased screening of several small molecule libraries (including the NIH Clinical Collection) identified sigma‐2 receptor antagonists as the most effective at blocking α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced trafficking deficits and LAMP‐2A upregulation in a dose‐dependent manner. These results indicate that antagonists of the sigma‐2 receptor complex may alleviate α‐synuclein oligomer‐induced neurotoxicity and are a novel therapeutic approach for disease modification in PD and related α‐synucleinopathies.

Objective
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the utility of evoked potentials as a biomarker of cortical function in Rett syndrome (RTT). As a number of disease‐modifying therapeutics are currently under development, there is a pressing need for biomarkers to objectively and precisely assess the effectiveness of these treatments.


Method
Yearly visual (VEP) and auditory (AEP) evoked potentials were acquired from individuals with RTT, aged 2 to 37 years, and control participants across five sites as part of the Rett Syndrome and Related Disorders Natural History Study. Baseline and Year 1 data, when available, were analyzed and the repeatability of the results was tested. Two syndrome‐specific measures from the Natural History Study were used for evaluating the clinical relevance of the VEP and AEP parameters.


Results
At the baseline study, group level comparisons revealed reduced VEP and AEP amplitude in RTT compared to control participants. Further analyses within the RTT group indicated that this reduction was associated with RTT‐related symptoms, with greater severity associated with lower VEP and AEP amplitude. In participants with RTT, VEP and AEP amplitude was also negatively associated with age. Year 1 follow‐up data analyses yielded similar findings and evidence of repeatability of EPs at the individual level.


Interpretation
The present findings indicate the promise of EPs as an objective measure of disease severity in individuals with RTT. Our multisite approach demonstrates potential research and clinical applications to provide unbiased assessment of disease staging, prognosis, and response to therapy.

Punishment feels bad, but relief from it feels good. Correspondingly, negative memories are formed for cues when these are associated with the occurrence of punishment. In contrast, positive memories result from their association with relief. Such timing‐dependent valence reversal is observed in humans and in animals alike. Using Drosophila larvae, Weiglein et al. present an odor cue either before or after optogenetically activating single, identified dopaminergic neurons known to mediate punishment. This reveals that these dopaminergic neurons are heterogeneous: DAN‐f1 establishes timing‐dependent valence reversal, whereas DAN‐d1 does not. Together with recent findings in the reward domain and from adult Drosophila, this suggests that such heterogeneity might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.







Abstract
Dopamine serves many functions, and dopamine neurons are correspondingly diverse. We use a combination of optogenetics, behavioral experiments, and high‐resolution video‐tracking to probe for the functional capacities of two single, identified dopamine neurons in larval Drosophila. The DAN‐f1 and the DAN‐d1 neuron were recently found to carry aversive teaching signals during Pavlovian olfactory learning. We enquire into a fundamental feature of these teaching signals, namely their temporal “fingerprint”. That is, receiving punishment feels bad, whereas being relieved from it feels good, and animals and humans alike learn with opposite valence about the occurrence and the termination of punishment (the same principle applies in the appetitive domain, with opposite sign). We find that DAN‐f1 but not DAN‐d1 can mediate such timing‐dependent valence reversal: presenting an odor before DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned avoidance of the odor (punishment memory), whereas presenting the odor upon termination of DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned approach (relief memory). In contrast, DAN‐d1 confers punishment memory only. These effects are further characterized in terms of the impact of the duration of optogenetic activation, the temporal stability of the memories thus established, and the specific microbehavioral patterns of locomotion through which they are expressed. Together with recent findings in the appetitive domain and from adult Drosophila, our results suggest that heterogeneity in the temporal fingerprint of teaching signals might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.

<p>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a neuropeptide abundantly expressed in the mammalian central and peripheral nervous system. NPY is a pleiotropic molecule, which influences cell proliferation, cardiovascular and metabolic function, pain and neuronal excitability. In the central nervous system, NPY acts as a neuromodulator, affecting pathways that range from cellular (excitability, neurogenesis) to circuit level (food intake, stress response, pain perception). NPY has a broad repertoire of receptor subtypes, each activating specific signaling pathways in different tissues and cellular sub-regions. In the context of epilepsy, NPY is thought to act as an endogenous anticonvulsant that performs its action through Y2 and Y5 receptors. In fact, its overexpression in the brain with the aid of viral vectors can suppress seizures in animal models of epilepsy. Therefore, NPY-based gene therapy may represent a novel approach for the treatment of epilepsy patients, particularly for pharmaco-resistant and genetic forms of the disease. Nonetheless, considering all the aforementioned aspects of NPY signaling, the study of possible NPY applications as a therapeutic molecule is not devoid of critical aspects. The present review will summarize data related to NPY biology, focusing on its anti-epileptic effects, with a critical appraisal of key elements that could be exploited to improve the already existing NPY-based gene therapy approaches for epilepsy.</p>

<p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a physiological mechanism contributing to hippocampal memory formation. Several studies associated altered hippocampal neurogenesis with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether amyloid-β protein (Aβ)/tau accumulation impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis and, consequently, the hippocampal circuitry, involved in memory formation, or altered neurogenesis is an epiphenomenon of AD neuropathology contributing negligibly to the AD phenotype, is, especially in humans, still debated. The detrimental effects of Aβ/tau on synaptic function and neuronal viability have been clearly addressed both in in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Until some years ago, studies carried out on in vitro models investigating the action of Aβ/tau on proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal neural stem cells led to contrasting results, mainly due to discrepancies arising from different experimental conditions (e.g., different cellular/animal models, different Aβ and/or tau isoforms, concentrations, and/or aggregation profiles). To date, studies investigating in situ adult hippocampal neurogenesis indicate severe impairment in most of transgenic AD mice; this impairment precedes by several months cognitive dysfunction. Using experimental tools, which only became available in the last few years, research in humans indicated that hippocampal neurogenesis is altered in cognitive declined individuals affected by either mild cognitive impairment or AD as well as in normal cognitive elderly with a significant inverse relationship between the number of newly formed neurons and cognitive impairment. However, despite that such information is available, the question whether impaired neurogenesis contributes to AD pathogenesis or is a mere consequence of Aβ/pTau accumulation is not definitively answered. Herein, we attempted to shed light on this complex and very intriguing topic by reviewing relevant literature on impairment of adult neurogenesis in mouse models of AD and in AD patients analyzing the temporal relationship between the occurrence of altered neurogenesis and the appearance of AD hallmarks and cognitive dysfunctions.</p>

<p>Protecting white matter is one of the key treatment strategies for spinal cord injury (SCI), including alleviation of myelin loss and promotion of remyelination. Rapamycin has been shown neuroprotective effects against SCI and cardiotoxic effects while enhancing autophagy. However, specific neuroprotection of rapamycin for the white matter after cervical SCI has not been reported. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the role of rapamycin in neuroprotection after hemi-contusion SCI in mice. Forty-six 8-week-old mice were randomly assigned into the rapamycin group (n = 16), vehicle group (n = 16), and sham group (n = 10). All mice of the rapamycin and vehicle groups received a unilateral contusion with 1.2-mm displacement at C5 followed by daily intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin or dimethyl sulfoxide solution (1.5 mg⋅kg<sup>–1</sup>⋅day<sup>–1</sup>). The behavioral assessment was conducted before the injury, 3 days and every 2 weeks post-injury (WPI). The autophagy-related proteins, the area of spared white matter, the number of oligodendrocytes (OLs) and axons were evaluated at 12 WPI, as well as the glial scar and the myelin sheaths formed by Schwann cells at the epicenter. The 1.2 mm contusion led to a consistent moderate–severe SCI in terms of motor function and tissue damage. Rapamycin administration promoted autophagy in spinal cord tissue after injury and reduced the glial scar at the epicenter. Additionally, rapamycin increased the number of OLs and improved motor function significantly than in the vehicle group. Furthermore, the rapamycin injection resulted in an increase of Schwann cell-mediated remyelination and weight loss. Our results suggest that rapamycin can enhance autophagy, promote Schwann cell myelination and motor function recovery by preserved neural tissue, and reduce glial scar after hemi-contusive cervical SCI, indicating a potential strategy for SCI treatment.</p>

<p>Objective: To investigate the clinical features, skeletal muscle imaging, muscle pathology, blood smear and so on of neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM) caused by PNPLA2 gene mutation.</p><p>Methods: The clinical data, skeletal muscle imaging, pathological data, and genetic test results of a patient with NLSDM treated in our hospital were collected in detail, and the previous literature was reviewed and compared.</p><p>Results: The main symptoms were muscle weakness and muscular atrophy. Pathological findings of muscle biopsy showed fat deposition in muscle fibers with border cavitation. Fatty droplets were seen in the cytoplasm of neutrophils in peripheral blood. Magnetic resonance imaging of the muscles of both lower extremities showed that muscle in the thigh vastus intermedius, lateral muscles, biceps, and the muscle abdominal area of the middle leg were filled or replaced by fat. Genetic test results suggested mutations in the PNPLA2 gene.</p><p>Conclusion: NLSDM is a rare clinical myopathy with abnormal lipid metabolism. Characteristic changes can be seen in skeletal muscle imaging and pathology. The detection of PNPLA2 gene mutation is an important basis for diagnosing NLSDM. Asymmetry and progressive limb weakness are the clinical features. Muscle MRI is mainly involved in the posterior group of the lower limbs. Jordans bodies in the peripheral blood smear and a large number of coarse-grained lipid deposits with rimmed vacuoles in muscle fibers are the characteristic pathological changes.</p>

<p>Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) are two major alcohol-metabolizing enzymes. Moderate alcohol intake is a protective modified factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) while heavy alcohol intake and abstinence increased dementia risk. The associations between Alzheimer’s disease and alcohol-metabolizing genes are uncertain. This study examined the association of AD with seven ADH/ALDH single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ADH1C rs2241894, ADH1B rs1229984, ALDH1B1 rs2073478, ALDH2 rs886205, rs4767944, rs4648328, and rs671. We enrolled 157 AD and 168 age- and sex-matched control subjects in pilot study to examine the association of AD with ADH/ALDH SNPs. Reconstructed ALDH2 haplotypes were performed. We measured plasma level of ADH1C and checked the interaction effect of AD–rs2241894 genotype on plasma ADH1C level. In extension study, we further examined 339 AD and 2,504 healthy control from the Taiwan Biobank. In pilot study, we observed that ADH1C rs2241894 TT genotype was negatively associated with AD in a recessive genetic model (OR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.09–0.75, p &lt; 0.0001) in women. A strong linkage disequilibrium was observed among the four examined SNPs of ALDH2. No haplotype was related to AD. The plasma ADH1C level in AD was higher than that in control. After adjusted by age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol, we found a significant interaction effect of AD–rs2241894 genotype on plasma ADH1C level (p = 0.04). This interaction effect was attributable to the association between AD and plasma ADH1C level (β estimate = 366, 95% CI 92.7∼639.4, p = 0.009). The genetic distribution of ADH1C rs2241894 showed strong ethnic heterogeneity, in which the T allele was the minor allele accounting for 28.5% in our study and 23.6% in East Asians, while it was a major allele in Americans, Europeans, and the global populations. No association was discovered between AD and the five SNPs: rs2241894, rs1229984, rs2073478, rs886205, and rs671 in the extension study. In summary, this study revealed a suggestive association between ADH1C rs2241894 and female AD in the pilot study, but failed to confirm this finding in a population database. Further age-matched and large sample size case-control studies are needed before rs2241894 can be interpreted as a protective genetic factor of AD.</p>

<p>Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture (EA) has been widely applied in clinic to exhibit curative effects on spinal cord injury (SCI). However, its underlying mechanisms leading to improvement of motor function after SCI remain unclear. Allen’s method was made by NYU Impactor M-III equipment to create the SCI rats model. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham (only laminectomy), Model (SCI group), EA (SCI + Jia-Ji EA treatment), EA + CQ (SCI + Jia-Ji EA treatment + inhibitor chloroquine). Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan assessment showed improvement of hind limb motor function after Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture treatment. Histological change of injured spinal cord tissue was alleviated after treatment, observed by hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining. The mRNA and protein expression levels of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL were decreased in EA group. Besides, the increased expression of LC3 and reduced expression of P62 after treatment compared with Model group, confirmed that Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture could enhance the autophagy flux. Electron microscopy imaging showed increasing the number of lysosomes, autophagosomes, and autolysosomes after Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of lysosome function with CQ led to partly eliminate the effect of EA on reducing necroptosis. These data make the case that Jia-Ji electro-acupuncture treatment may improve locomotor function by promoting autophagy flux and inhibiting necroptosis.</p>

<p>Optic neuritis is a frequent first symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS) for which corticosteroids are a widely employed treatment option. The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT) reported that corticosteroid treatment does not improve long-term visual acuity, although the evolution of underlying pathologies is unclear. In this study, we employed non-invasive diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI)-derived fiber volume to quantify 11% axonal loss 2 months after corticosteroid treatment (vs. baseline) in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse optic nerves affected by optic neuritis. Longitudinal DBSI was performed at baseline (before immunization), after a 2-week corticosteroid treatment period, and 1 and 2 months after treatment, followed by histological validation of neuropathology. Pathological metrics employed to assess the optic nerve revealed axonal protection and anti-inflammatory effects of dexamethasone treatment that were transient. Two months after treatment, axonal injury and loss were indistinguishable between PBS- and dexamethasone-treated optic nerves, similar to results of the human ONTT. Our findings in mice further support that corticosteroid treatment alone is not sufficient to prevent eventual axonal loss in ON, and strongly support the potential of DBSI as an in vivo imaging outcome measure to assess optic nerve pathology.</p>

<p>Presenilin 1 (PS1) and Presenilin 2 (PS2) are predominantly known as the catalytic subunits of the γ-secretase complex that generates the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, the major constituent of the senile plaques found in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Apart from their role in γ-secretase activity, a growing number of cellular functions have been recently attributed to PSs. Notably, PSs were found to be enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) where mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interact. PS2 was more specifically reported to regulate calcium shuttling between these two organelles by controlling the formation of functional MAMs. We have previously demonstrated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) an altered mitochondrial morphology along with reduced mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis in PS2-deficient cells (PS2KO). This phenotype was restored by the stable re-expression of human PS2. Still, all these results were obtained in immortalized cells, and one bottom-line question is to know whether these observations hold true in central nervous system (CNS) cells. To that end, we carried out primary cultures of PS1 knockdown (KD), PS2KO, and PS1KD/PS2KO (PSdKO) neurons and astrocytes. They were obtained from the same litter by crossing PS2 heterozygous; PS1 floxed (PS2<sup>+/−</sup>; PS1<sup>flox/flox</sup>) animals. Genetic downregulation of PS1 was achieved by lentiviral expression of the Cre recombinase in primary cultures. Strikingly, we did not observe any mitochondrial phenotype in PS1KD, PS2KO, or PSdKO primary cultures in basal conditions. Mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential were similar in all models, as were the glycolytic flux and NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio. Likewise, mitochondrial morphology and content was unaltered by PS expression. We further investigated the differences between results we obtained here in primary nerve cells and those previously reported in MEF cell lines by analyzing PS2KO primary fibroblasts. We found no mitochondrial dysfunction in this model, in line with observations in PS2KO primary neurons and astrocytes. Together, our results indicate that the mitochondrial phenotype observed in immortalized PS2-deficient cell lines cannot be extrapolated to primary neurons, astrocytes, and even to primary fibroblasts. The PS-dependent mitochondrial phenotype reported so far might therefore be the consequence of a cell immortalization process and should be critically reconsidered regarding its relevance to AD.</p>

<p>Although the neural bases of the brain associated with movement disorders in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are becoming clearer, the information is not sufficient because of the lack of extensive brain function research. Therefore, it is controversial about effective intervention methods focusing on brain function. One of the rehabilitation techniques for movement disorders involves intervention using motor imagery (MI). MI is often used for movement disorders, but most studies involve adults and healthy children, and the MI method for children with DCD has not been studied in detail. Therefore, a review was conducted to clarify the neuroscientific basis of the methodology of intervention using MI for children with DCD. The neuroimaging review included 20 magnetic resonance imaging studies, and the neurorehabilitation review included four MI intervention studies. In addition to previously reported neural bases, our results indicate decreased activity of the bilateral thalamus, decreased connectivity of the sensory-motor cortex and the left posterior middle temporal gyrus, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, loss of connectivity superiority in the abovementioned areas. Furthermore, reduction of gray matter volume in the right superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, lower fractional anisotropy, and axial diffusivity in regions of white matter pathways were found in DCD. As a result of the review, children with DCD had less activation of the left brain, especially those with mirror neurons system (MNS) and sensory integration functions. On the contrary, the area important for the visual space processing of the right brain was activated. Regarding of characteristic of the MI methods was that children observed a video related to motor skills before the intervention. Also, they performed visual-motor tasks before MI training sessions. Adding action observation during MI activates the MNS, and performing visual-motor tasks activates the basal ganglia. These methods may improve the deactivated brain regions of children with DCD and may be useful as conditioning before starting training. Furthermore, we propose a process for sharing the contents of MI with the therapist in language and determining exercise strategies.</p>

<p>Objective: Electrical stimulation (ES) potentially delineates epileptogenic cortex through induction of typical seizures. Although frequently employed, its value for epilepsy surgery remains controversial. Similarly, ES is used to identify symptomatogenic zones, but with greater success and a long-standing evidence base. Recent work points to new seizure symptoms such as ictal central apnea (ICA) that may enhance presurgical hypotheses. The aims of this review are 2-fold: to determine the value of ES-induced seizures (ESIS) in epilepsy surgery and to analyze current evidence on ICA as a new surrogate of symptomatogenic cortex.</p><p>Methods: Three databases were searched for ESIS. Investigators independently selected studies according to pre-specified criteria. Studies reporting postoperative outcome in patients with ESIS were included in a meta-analysis. For ES-induced apnea, a thorough search was performed and reference list searching was employed.</p><p>Results: Of 6,314 articles identified for ESIS, 25 were considered eligible to be reviewed in full text. Fourteen studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (1,069 patients); six studies were included in the meta-analysis (530 patients). The meta-analysis showed that favorable outcome is associated with ESIS prior to surgery (OR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.332–3.08). In addition, the overall estimation of the occurrence of favorable outcome among cases with ESIS is 68.13% (95% CI: 56.62–78.7). On the other hand, recent studies have shown that stimulation of exclusively mesial temporal lobe structures elicits central apnea and represents symptomatogenic anatomic substrates of ICA. This is in variance with traditional teaching that mesial temporal ES is non-symptomatogenic.</p><p>Conclusions: ES is a tool highly likely to aid in the delineation of the epileptogenic zone, since ESIS is associated with favorable postoperative outcomes (Engel I). There is an urgent need for prospective evaluation of this technique, including effective stimulation parameters and surgical outcomes, that will provide knowledge base for practice. In addition, ES-induced apnea studies suggest that ICA, especially when it is the first or only clinical sign, is an important semiological feature in localizing the symptomatogenic zone to mesial temporal lobe structures, which must be considered in SEEG explorations where this is planned, and in surgical resection strategies.</p>

<p>Cortical stimulation has been used for brain mapping for over a century, and a standard assumption is that stimulation interferes with task execution due to local effects at the stimulation site. Stimulation can however produce afterdischarges which interfere with functional localization and can lead to unwanted seizures. We previously showed that (a) cognitive effort can terminate these afterdischarges, (b) when termination thus occurs, there are electrocorticography changes throughout the cortex, not just at sites with afterdischarges or sites thought functionally important for the cognitive task used, and (c) thresholds for afterdischarges and functional responses can change among stimulation trials. We here show that afterdischarge termination can occur prior to overt performance of the cognitive tasks used to terminate them. These findings, taken together, demonstrate that task-related brain changes are not limited to one or a group of functional regions or a specific network, and not limited to the time directly surrounding overt task execution. Discrete locations, networks and times importantly underpin clinical behaviors. However, brain activity that is diffuse in location and extended in time also affect task execution and can affect brain mapping. This may in part reflect fluctuating levels of attention, engagement, or motivation during testing.</p>

<p>Recent whole-brain calcium imaging recordings of the nematode C. elegans have demonstrated that the neural activity associated with behavior is dominated by dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold that can be clustered according to behavioral states. Previous models of C. elegans dynamics have either been linear models, which cannot support the existence of multiple fixed points in the system, or Markov-switching models, which do not describe how control signals in C. elegans neural dynamics can produce switches between stable states. It remains unclear how a network of neurons can produce fast and slow timescale dynamics that control transitions between stable states in a single model. We propose a global, nonlinear control model which is minimally parameterized and captures the state transitions described by Markov-switching models with a single dynamical system. The model is fit by reproducing the timeseries of the dominant PCA mode in the calcium imaging data. Long and short time-scale changes in transition statistics can be characterized via changes in a single parameter in the control model. Some of these macro-scale transitions have experimental correlates to single neuro-modulators that seem to act as biological controls, allowing this model to generate testable hypotheses about the effect of these neuro-modulators on the global dynamics. The theory provides an elegant characterization of control in the neuron population dynamics in C. elegans. Moreover, the mathematical structure of the nonlinear control framework provides a paradigm that can be generalized to more complex systems with an arbitrary number of behavioral states.</p>

<p>Neuronal avalanches are scale-invariant neuronal population activity patterns in the cortex that emerge in vivo in the awake state and in vitro during balanced excitation and inhibition. Theory and experiments suggest that avalanches indicate a state of cortex that improves numerous aspects of information processing by allowing for the transient and selective formation of local as well as system-wide spanning neuronal groups. If avalanches are indeed involved with information processing, one might expect that single neurons would participate in avalanche patterns selectively. Alternatively, all neurons could participate proportionally to their own activity in each avalanche as would be expected for a population rate code. Distinguishing these hypotheses, however, has been difficult as robust avalanche analysis requires technically challenging measures of their intricate organization in space and time at the population level, while also recording sub- or suprathreshold activity from individual neurons with high temporal resolution. Here, we identify repeated avalanches in the ongoing local field potential (LFP) measured with high-density microelectrode arrays in the cortex of awake nonhuman primates and in acute cortex slices from young and adult rats. We studied extracellular unit firing in vivo and intracellular responses of pyramidal neurons in vitro. We found that single neurons participate selectively in specific LFP-based avalanche patterns. Furthermore, we show in vitro that manipulating the balance of excitation and inhibition abolishes this selectivity. Our results support the view that avalanches represent the selective, scale-invariant formation of neuronal groups in line with the idea of Hebbian cell assemblies underlying cortical information processing.</p>

<p>It has become widely accepted that humans use contextual information to infer the meaning of ambiguous acoustic signals. In speech, for example, high-level semantic, syntactic, or lexical information shape our understanding of a phoneme buried in noise. Most current theories to explain this phenomenon rely on hierarchical predictive coding models involving a set of Bayesian priors emanating from high-level brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) that are used to influence processing at lower-levels of the cortical sensory hierarchy (e.g., auditory cortex). As such, virtually all proposed models to explain top-down facilitation are focused on intracortical connections, and consequently, subcortical nuclei have scarcely been discussed in this context. However, subcortical auditory nuclei receive massive, heterogeneous, and cascading descending projections at every level of the sensory hierarchy, and activation of these systems has been shown to improve speech recognition. It is not yet clear whether or how top-down modulation to resolve ambiguous sounds calls upon these corticofugal projections. Here, we review the literature on top-down modulation in the auditory system, primarily focused on humans and cortical imaging/recording methods, and attempt to relate these findings to a growing animal literature, which has primarily been focused on corticofugal projections. We argue that corticofugal pathways contain the requisite circuitry to implement predictive coding mechanisms to facilitate perception of complex sounds and that top-down modulation at early (i.e., subcortical) stages of processing complement modulation at later (i.e., cortical) stages of processing. Finally, we suggest experimental approaches for future studies on this topic.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder marked by accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques leads to progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) studies have provided links between these two observations in terms of disruption of default mode and task-positive resting-state networks (RSNs). Important insights underlying these disruptions were recently obtained by investigating dynamic fluctuations in RS-fMRI signals in old TG2576 mice (a mouse model of amyloidosis) using a set of quasi-periodic patterns (QPP). QPPs represent repeating spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity of predefined temporal length. In this article, we used an alternative methodology of co-activation patterns (CAPs) that represent instantaneous and transient brain configurations that are likely contributors to the emergence of commonly observed RSNs and QPPs. We followed a recently published approach for obtaining CAPs that divided all time frames, instead of those corresponding to supra-threshold activations of a seed region as done traditionally, to extract CAPs from RS-fMRI recordings in 10 TG2576 female mice and eight wild type littermates at 18 months of age. Subsequently, we matched the CAPs from the two groups using the Hungarian method and compared the temporal (duration, occurrence rate) and the spatial (lateralization of significantly co-activated and co-deactivated voxels) properties of matched CAPs. We found robust differences in the spatial components of matched CAPs. Finally, we used supervised learning to train a classifier using either the temporal or the spatial component of CAPs to distinguish the transgenic mice from the WT. We found that while duration and occurrence rates of all CAPs performed the classification with significantly higher accuracy than the chance-level, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals of significantly activated voxels from individual CAPs turned out to be a significantly better predictive feature demonstrating a near-perfect classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate resting-state co-activation patterns are a promising candidate in the development of a diagnostic, and potentially, prognostic RS-fMRI biomarker of AD.</p>

<p>Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC) is a rare genetic disorder belonging to the group of vacuolating leukodystrophies. It is characterized by megalencephaly, loss of motor functions, epilepsy, and mild mental decline. In brain biopsies of MLC patients, vacuoles were observed in myelin and in astrocytes surrounding blood vessels. It is mainly caused by recessive mutations in MLC1 and HEPACAM (also called GLIALCAM) genes. These disease variants are called MLC1 and MLC2A with both types of patients sharing the same clinical phenotype. Besides, dominant mutations in HEPACAM were also identified in a subtype of MLC patients (MLC2B) with a remitting phenotype. MLC1 and GlialCAM proteins form a complex mainly expressed in brain astrocytes at the gliovascular interface and in Bergmann glia at the cerebellum. Both proteins regulate several ion channels and transporters involved in the control of ion and water fluxes in glial cells, either directly influencing their location and function, or indirectly regulating associated signal transduction pathways. However, the MLC1/GLIALCAM complex function and the related pathological mechanisms leading to MLC are still unknown. It has been hypothesized that, in MLC, the role of glial cells in brain ion homeostasis is altered in both physiological and inflammatory conditions. There is no therapy for MLC patients, only supportive treatment. As MLC2B patients show an MLC reversible phenotype, we speculated that the phenotype of MLC1 and MLC2A patients could also be mitigated by the re-introduction of the correct gene even at later stages. To prove this hypothesis, we injected in the cerebellar subarachnoid space of Mlc1 knockout mice an adeno-associated virus (AAV) coding for human MLC1 under the control of the glial-fibrillary acidic protein promoter. MLC1 expression in the cerebellum extremely reduced myelin vacuolation at all ages in a dose-dependent manner. This study could be considered as the first preclinical approach for MLC. We also suggest other potential therapeutic strategies in this review.</p>

<p>Histopathological analysis of cellular changes in the stroked brain provides critical information pertaining to inflammation, cell death, glial scarring, and other dynamic injury and recovery responses. However, commonly used manual approaches are hindered by limitations in speed, accuracy, bias, and the breadth of morphological information that can be obtained. Here, a semi-automated high-content imaging (HCI) and CellProfiler histological analysis method was developed and used in a Yucatan miniature pig permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model of ischemic stroke to overcome these limitations. Evaluation of 19 morphological parameters in IBA1<sup>+</sup> microglia/macrophages, GFAP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, NeuN<sup>+</sup> neuronal, FactorVIII<sup>+</sup> vascular endothelial, and DCX<sup>+</sup> neuroblast cell areas was conducted on porcine brain tissue 4 weeks post pMCAO. Out of 19 morphological parameters assessed in the stroke perilesional and ipsilateral hemisphere regions (38 parameters), a significant change in 3838 measured IBA1<sup>+</sup> parameters, 3438 GFAP<sup>+</sup> parameters, 3238 NeuN<sup>+</sup> parameters, 3138 FactorVIII<sup>+</sup> parameters, and 2838 DCX<sup>+</sup> parameters were observed in stroked vs. non-stroked animals. Principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analyses demonstrated that stroke-induced significant and predictable morphological changes that demonstrated strong relationships between IBA1<sup>+</sup>, GFAP<sup>+</sup>, and NeuN<sup>+</sup> areas. Ultimately, this unbiased, semi-automated HCI and CellProfiler histopathological analysis approach revealed regional and cell specific morphological signatures of immune and neural cells after stroke in a highly translational porcine model. These identified features can provide information of disease pathogenesis and evolution with high resolution, as well as be used in therapeutic screening applications.</p>

<p>Lipopolysacharide (LPS) pre-conditioning (PC), has been shown to exert protective effects against cytotoxic effects. Therefore, we hypothesized, the tolerance produced by LPS PC will be resulted by the alterations and modifications in gene and protein expression. With reference to the results of MTT assays, AO/PI staining, and Annexin V-FITC analyses of LPS concentration (0.7815–50 μg/mL) and time-dependent (12–72 h) experiments, the pre-exposure to 3 μg/mL LPS for 12 h protected the differentiated PC12 cells against 0.75 mg/mL LPS apoptotic concentration. LPS-treated cells secreted more inflammatory cytokines like IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF-α than LPS-PC cells. The production of inflammatory mediators ROS and NO was also higher in the LPS-induced cells compared to LPS-PC cells. Conversely, anti-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-10, IL-13, CNTF, and IL-1Ra) were upregulated in the LPS-PC cells but not in the LPS-induced cells. Meanwhile, the LPS initiated caspase-8 which in turn activates effector caspase 3/7. When the activities of caspases in the LPS-induced cells were inhibited using z-VADfmk and z-DEVDfmk, the expressions of c-MYC and Hsp70 were increased, but p53 was reduced. The potential molecules associated with protective and destructive effect was measured by RT<sup>2</sup> Profiler PCR array to elucidate the signaling pathways and suggested inhibition NF-κB/caspase-3 signaling pathway regulates the cytoprotective genes and proto-oncogenes. In conclusion, this study provides a basis for future research to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying LPS pre-conditioning /TLR4 pre-activation and its functional role in offering cytoprotective response in neuronal environment.</p>

<p>Objectives: The role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has attracted much attention recently. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play an important role in modulating inflammation. We aimed to explore the Treg-related immunosuppression status at different stages of AD.</p><p>Methods: Thirty healthy control (HC) subjects, 26 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 30 patients with mild probable AD-related dementia, and 28 patients with moderate-to-severe probable AD-related dementia underwent detailed clinical history taking, structural MRI scanning, and neuropsychological assessment. Peripheral blood samples were taken to measure the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low/−</sup> Tregs by flow cytometry and the levels of interleukin (IL-10), interleukin (IL-35), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) by ELISA.</p><p>Results: The percentage of Tregs in the blood of MCI patients was the highest (9.24%); there was a significant difference between patients with MCI and patients with probable AD-related dementia. The level of TGF-β in patients with MCI (47.02 ng/ml) was significantly increased compared with patients with AD-related dementia. There were positive correlations between Treg percentage, IL-35, and Mini-mental state evaluation scores in patients with MCI and probable AD-related dementia.</p><p>Conclusions: Patients with MCI have stronger Treg-related immunosuppression status compared with patients with probable AD-related dementia.</p>

<p>Background and Objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been shown to affect vision in human patients and animal models. This study was conducted to explore ocular abnormalities in the primary visual pathway and their relationship with hippocampal atrophy in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential value of ocular examinations as a biomarker during the AD progression.</p><p>Methods: Patients with MCI (n = 23) or AD (n = 17) and age-matched cognitively normal controls (NC; n = 19) were enrolled. Pattern visual-evoked potentials (PVEP), flash electroretinogram (FERG) recordings and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed for all participants. Hippocampal volumes were measured by 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive function was assessed by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Pearson correlation was employed to analyze the potential associations between ocular abnormalities and hippocampal volumes. Hierarchical regression models were conducted to determine associations between cognitive performances and ocular abnormalities as well as hippocampal volumes after adjusting for confounding factors including age, sex, cognitive reserve, and APOE4 status.</p><p>Results: PVEP amplitude of P100 waveform was significantly decreased in AD patients compared to MCI and normal individuals. In FERG test, delayed latencies of rod response, rod cone response and 3.0 flicker time were found in cognitively impaired groups, indicating dysfunctions of both the rod and cone systems in the disease progression. OCT test revealed reduced macular retinal nerve fiber layer (m-RNFL) thickness in MCI and AD patients, which significantly correlated with brain structure of hippocampus particularly vulnerable during the progression of AD. Interestingly, P100 amplitude showed a significant association with hippocampal volumes even after adjusting confounding factors including age, sex, and cognitive reserve. Hierarchical regression analysis further demonstrated that m-RNFL thickness, as well as hippocampal volumes, significantly associated with ADAS-cog scores.</p><p>Conclusion: P100 amplitude and m-RNFL thickness showed significant correlations with brain structure involved in AD-related neurodegeneration, and therefore proved to be potential indicators of brain imaging pathologies.</p>

<p>Accruing evidence supports the hypothesis that memory deficits in early Alzheimer Disease (AD) might be due to synaptic failure caused by accumulation of intracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers, then secreted to the extracellular media. Transgenic mouse AD models provide valuable information on AD pathology. However, the failure to translate these findings to humans calls for models that better recapitulate the human pathology. McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic (Tg) rat expresses the human amyloid precursor protein (APP751) with the Swedish and Indiana mutations (of familial AD), leading to an AD-like slow-progressing brain amyloid pathology. Therefore, it offers a unique opportunity to investigate learning and memory abilities at early stages of AD, when Aβ accumulation is restricted to the intracellular compartment, prior to plaque deposition. Our goal was to further investigate early deficits in memory, particularly long-term memory in McGill-R-Thy1-APP heterozygous (Tg+/–) rats. Short-term- and long-term habituation to an open field were preserved in 3-, 4-, and 6-month-old (Tg+/–). However, long-term memory of inhibitory avoidance to a foot-shock, novel object-recognition and social approaching behavior were seriously impaired in 4-month-old (Tg+/–) male rats, suggesting that they are unable to either consolidate and/or evoke such associative and discriminative memories with aversive, emotional and spatial components. The long-term memory deficits were accompanied by increased transcript levels of genes relevant to synaptic plasticity, learning and memory processing in the hippocampus, such as Grin2b, Dlg4, Camk2b, and Syn1. Our findings indicate that in addition to the previously well-documented deficits in learning and memory, McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats display particular long-term-memory deficits and deep social behavior alterations at pre-plaque early stages of the pathology. This highlights the importance of Aβ oligomers and emphasizes the validity of the model to study AD-like early processes, with potentially predictive value.</p>

Abstract
The nucleus reuniens (RE) and rhomboid (RH) nuclei of the ventral midline thalamus are reciprocally connected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HF) and serve as key intermediaries between these structures, regulating cognitive and emotional behaviors. Regarding affective behavior, several recent reports have described the involvement of RE/RH in the acquisition and retention of conditioned fear, but little is known regarding their role (RE/RH) in anxiety‐like behaviors. We examined the role of RH/RE on avoidance and defensive behaviors in male Long Evans rats using the elevated plus maze (EPM). We found that the reversible suppression of RE/RH with muscimol increased avoidance behavior to the open arms of the plus maze as shown by: (a) significant reductions in open arm entries; (b) reductions in the mean duration of time spent in the open arms; and (c) significant increases in retreats during open arm exploration. This was coupled with decreases in the number of head dips in the maze. Consistent with these behavioral effects, a single exposure of naïve rats to the plus maze produced significant increases in c‐fos expression selectively in RE and RH of midline thalamic nuclei. We posit that RE/RH normally acts to optimize adaptive responses to anxiety‐eliciting situations, and disruptions of RE/RH produce severe deficits in coping behaviors—or as shown here increases in avoidance/defensive behaviors. In sum, the present results establish a novel role for RE/RH in anxiety‐like avoidance behavior. In addition to its role in attention, working memory, and executive control, RE/RH also regulates adaptative responses to not only fear but also to anxiogenic stimuli. As such, dysfunction of RE/RH may contribute to the amalgamation of symptoms common to many mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD.

Objective
To assess the impact of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies on the severity of Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19) in people with MS (PwMS).


Methods
We retrospectively collected data of PwMS with suspected or confirmed Covid‐19. All the patients had complete follow up to death or recovery. Severe Covid‐19 was defined by a 3‐level variable: mild disease not requiring hospitalization vs pneumonia or hospitalization vs Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or death. We evaluated baseline characteristics and MS therapies associated to a severe Covid‐19 by multivariable and Propensity‐Score (PS)‐weighted ordinal logistic models. Sensitivity analyses were run to confirm the results.


Results
Of 844 PwMS with suspected (n = 565) or confirmed (n = 279) Covid‐19, 13 (1.54%) died: 11 of them were in a progressive MS phase, and 8 were without any therapy. Thirty‐eight (4.5%) were admitted to an ICU; 99 (11.7%) had a radiologically documented pneumonia; 96 (11.4%) were hospitalized.
After adjusting for region, age, sex, progressive MS course, EDSS, disease duration, BMI, comorbidities and recent methylprednisolone use, the therapy with an anti‐CD20 agent (Ocrelizumab or Rituximab) was significantly associated (OR = 2.37,95%CI = 1.18–4.74,p = 0.015) with an increased risk of severe Covid‐19. Recent use (&lt;1 month) of methylprednisolone was also associated with a worse outcome (OR = 5.24,95%CI = 2.20–12.53, p = 0.001). Results were confirmed by the PS‐weighted and by all the sensitivity analyses.


Interpretation
This study showed an acceptable level of safety of therapies with a broad array of mechanisms of action. However, some specific elements of risk emerged. These will need to be considered while the Covid‐19 pandemic is persisting.
