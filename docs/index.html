<p>This paper presents the computational methods of information cohomology
applied to genetic expression in and in the companion paper and proposes its
interpretations in terms of statistical physics and machine learning. In order
to further underline the Hochschild cohomological nature af information
functions and chain rules, following, the computation of the cohomology in low
degrees is detailed to show more directly that the $k$ multivariate
mutual-informations (I_k) are k-coboundaries. The k-cocycles condition
corresponds to I_k=0, generalizing statistical independence. Hence the
cohomology quantifies the statistical dependences and the obstruction to
factorization. The topological approach allows to investigate information in
the multivariate case without the assumptions of independent identically
distributed variables and without mean field approximations. We develop the
computationally tractable subcase of simplicial information cohomology
represented by entropy H_k and information I_k landscapes and their respective
paths. The I_1 component defines a self-internal energy U_k, and I_k,k&gt;1
components define the contribution to a free energy G_k (the total correlation)
of the k-body interactions. The set of information paths in simplicial
structures is in bijection with the symmetric group and random processes,
provides a trivial topological expression of the 2nd law of thermodynamic. The
local minima of free-energy, related to conditional information negativity, and
conditional independence, characterize a minimum free energy complex. This
complex formalizes the minimum free-energy principle in topology, provides a
definition of a complex system, and characterizes a multiplicity of local
minima that quantifies the diversity observed in biology. I give an
interpretation of this complex in terms of frustration in glass and of Van Der
Walls k-body interactions for data points.

<p>We can define a neural network that can learn to recognize objects in less
than 100 lines of code. However, after training, it is characterized by
millions of weights that contain the knowledge about many object types across
visual scenes. Such networks are thus dramatically easier to understand in
terms of the code that makes them than the resulting properties, such as tuning
or connections. In analogy, we conjecture that rules for development and
learning in brains may be far easier to understand than their resulting
properties. The analogy suggests that neuroscience would benefit from a focus
on learning and development.

<p>We provide here a general mathematical framework to model attitudes towards
ambiguity which uses the formalism of quantum theory as a "purely mathematical
formalism, detached from any physical interpretation". We show that the
quantum-theoretic framework enables modelling of the "Ellsberg paradox", but it
also successfully applies to more concrete human decision-making (DM) tests
involving financial, managerial and medical decisions. In particular, we
provide a faithful mathematical representation of various empirical studies
which reveal that attitudes of managers towards uncertainty shift from
"ambiguity seeking" to "ambiguity aversion", and viceversa, thus exhibiting
"hope effects" and "fear effects" in management decisions. The present
framework provides a new bold and promising direction towards the development
of a unified theory of decisions in the presence of uncertainty.

<p>Tens of millions of people live blind, and their number is ever increasing.
Visual-to-auditory sensory substitution (SS) encompasses a family of cheap,
generic solutions to assist the visually impaired by conveying visual
information through sound. The required SS training is lengthy: months of
effort is necessary to reach a practical level of adaptation. There are two
reasons for the tedious training process: the elongated substituting audio
signal, and the disregard for the compressive characteristics of the human
hearing system. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a novel class of SS
methods, by training deep recurrent autoencoders for image-to-sound conversion.
We successfully trained deep learning models on different datasets to execute
visual-to-auditory stimulus conversion. By constraining the visual space, we
demonstrated the viability of shortened substituting audio signals, while
proposing mechanisms, such as the integration of computational hearing models,
to optimally convey visual features in the substituting stimulus as
perceptually discernible auditory components. We tested our approach in two
separate cases. In the first experiment, the author went blindfolded for 5
days, while performing SS training on hand posture discrimination. The second
experiment assessed the accuracy of reaching movements towards objects on a
table. In both test cases, above-chance-level accuracy was attained after a few
hours of training. Our novel SS architecture broadens the horizon of
rehabilitation methods engineered for the visually impaired. Further
improvements on the proposed model shall yield hastened rehabilitation of the
blind and a wider adaptation of SS devices as a consequence.

<p>There is extensive evidence that biological neural networks encode
information in the precise timing of the spikes generated and transmitted by
neurons, which offers several advantages over rate-based codes. Here we adopt a
vector space formulation of spike train sequences and introduce a new liquid
state machine (LSM) network architecture and a new forward orthogonal
regression algorithm to learn an input-output signal mapping or to decode the
brain activity. The proposed algorithm uses precise spike timing to select the
presynaptic neurons relevant to each learning task. We show that using precise
spike timing to train the LSM and selecting the readout neurons leads to a
significant increase in performance on binary classification tasks as well as
in decoding neural activity from multielectrode array recordings, compared with
what is achieved using the standard architecture and training method.

The promises of nanomedicine are extensive. Graphene, the first true two-dimensional material to exist in isolation, is the type of new nanomaterial that results in interest for novel biomedical applications. From Michael Chrichton’s tragic protagonist in The Terminal Man to the recent growth in start-up companies seeking to transfer consciousness, the fictive present and future call to mind visions of devices that enable neural interfacing and control. Although these ideas may create questions as to ethics for neuroscience in the future, the current state-of-the-art for implanted devices is far more limited in scope. Progress in brain-computer interfaces holds great promise for patients following stroke (Ramos-Murguialday, Broetz et al. 2013), to control prosthetic limbs (Hochberg, Serruya et al. 2006, Donoghue, Nurmikko et al. 2007) , with the motor degeneration characteristic of Parkinson’s disease (Little, Pogosyan et al. 2013), and for a variety of other disorders and diseases (Chaudhary, Birbaumer et al. 2016). Graphene may be poised for incorporation into such devices. As the presence of graphene becomes more widespread and commonplace across the biomedical sciences, the relatively larger body of work detailing the biological effects of carbon nanotubes may serve as a template guiding the utility of graphene for biological applications (Kostarelos, Bianco et al. 2009). 
Graphene-based materials for interfacing with the peripheral nervous system have been reviewed elsewhere (Domínguez-Bajo, González-Mayorga et al. 2017). We instead focus on new directions for application to the central nervous system. This review is limited to preclinical applications, although graphene and graphene-based devices may someday advance to clinical implementation.  We begin with an overview of graphene manufacturing advances, applications to hybrid materials systems as well as drug delivery strategies. This is followed by an overview of work performed with non-murine models.  Finally, the interaction of graphene with murine neural systems, both in vivo and in-vitro is examined.  Despite a sizable body of work, to date there remain many unresolved questions as to cytotoxicity and the mechanisms underlying the graphene-cellular interaction that must be addressed moving forward.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00025">Indicators and Criteria of Consciousness in Animals and Intelligent Machines: An Inside-Out Approach</a></h4>

In today’s society it becomes increasingly important to assess which non-human and non-verbal beings possess consciousness. This review aims to delineate criteria for consciousness especially in animals, while also taking into account intelligent artifacts. First, we circumscribe what we mean with “consciousness” and describe key features of subjective experience: qualitative richness, situatedness, intentionality and interpretation, integration and the combination of dynamic and stabilizing properties. We argue that consciousness has a biological function, which is to present the subject with a multimodal, situational survey of the surrounding world and body, subserving complex decision-making and goal-directed behavior. This survey reflects the brain’s capacity for internal modelling of external events underlying changes in sensory state. Next, we follow an inside-out approach: how can the features of conscious experience, correlating to mechanisms inside the brain, be logically coupled to externally observable (‘outside’) properties? Instead of proposing criteria that would each define a “hard” threshold for consciousness, we outline six indicators: (i) goal-directed behavior and model-based learning, (ii) anatomic and physiological substrates for generating integrative multimodal representations, (iii) psychometrics and meta-cognition, (iv) episodic memory, (v) susceptibility to illusions and multistable perception, and (vi) specific visuospatial behaviors. Rather than emphasizing a particular indicator as being decisive, we propose that the consistency amongst these indicators can serve to assess consciousness in particular species. The integration of scores on the various indicators yields an overall, graded criterion for consciousness, somewhat comparable to the Glasgow Coma Scale for unresponsive patients. When considering theoretically derived measures of consciousness, it is argued that their validity should not be assessed on the basis of a single quantifiable measure, but requires cross-examination across multiple pieces of evidence, including the indicators proposed here. Current intelligent machines, including deep learning neural networks and agile robots, are not indicated to be conscious yet. Instead of assessing machine consciousness by a brief Turing-type of test, evidence for it may gradually accumulate when we study machines ethologically and across time, considering multiple behaviors that require flexibility, improvisation, spontaneous problem-solving and the situational conspectus typically associated with conscious experience.

Maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in lymphatic fluids is necessary for proper hearing. Despite its significance, the mechanisms that maintain the cochlear lymphatic Ca2+ concentrations within a certain range are not fully clarified. We investigated the functional expression of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which plays a pivotal role in sensing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Western blotting for CaSR revealed an approximately 130-kDa protein expression in cochlear tissue extracts and immunohistochemical analysis revealed its expression specifically in type I fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, fibrocytes in the supralimbal and limbal regions, the epithelium of the osseous spiral lamina, and the smooth muscle cells of the spiral modiolar arteries. Ca2+ imaging demonstrated that extracellular Ca2+ increased the levels of intracellular Ca2+ in CaSR-expressing fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, and that this was suppressed by the CaSR inhibitor, NPS2143. Furthermore, hearing thresholds were moderately elevated by intracochlear application of the CaSR inhibitors NPS2143 and calhex231, across a range of frequencies (8-32 kHz). These results demonstrate the functional expression of CaSR in the cochlear perilymphatic compartment. In addition, the elevated hearing thresholds that are achieved by inhibiting CaSR suggest this is a required mechanism for normal hearing, presumably by sensing perilymphatic Ca2+ to stabilize Ca2+ concentrations within a certain range. These results provide novel insight into the mechanisms regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in the cochlea and provide a new perspective on cochlear physiology.

The remarkable physiology of the electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) made it one of the first model species in science.  It was pivotal for understanding animal electricity in the 1700’s, was investigated by Humboldt and Faraday in the 1800’s, was leveraged to isolate the acetylcholine receptor in the 20th century, and has inspired the design of new power sources and provided insights to electric organ evolution in the 21st century.  And yet few studies have investigated the electric eel’s behavior.  This review focuses on a series of recently discovered behaviors that evolved alongside the eel’s extreme physiology.  Eels use their high-voltage electric discharge to remotely control prey by transcutaneously activating motor neurons.  Hunting eels use this behavior in two different ways. When prey have been detected, eels use high-voltage to cause immobility by inducing sustained, involuntary muscle contractions.  On the other hand, when prey are hidden, eels often use brief pulses to induce prey twitch, which causes a water movement detected by the eel’s mechanoreceptors.  Once grasped in the eel’s jaws, difficult prey are often subdued by sandwiching them between the two poles (head and tail) of the eel’s powerful electric organ.  The resulting concentration of the high-voltage discharge, delivered at high-rates, causes involuntary fatigue in prey muscles. This novel strategy for inactivating muscles is functionally analogous to poisoning the neuromuscular junction with venom.  For self-defense, electric eels leap from the water to directly electrify threats, efficiently activating nociceptors to deter their target.  The latter behavior supports a legendary account by Alexander von Humboldt who described a battle between electric eels and horses in 1800.  Finally, electric eels use high-voltage not only as a weapon, but also to efficiently track fast moving prey with active electroreception.  In conclusion, remarkable behaviors go hand in hand with remarkable physiology.

Neurodegenerative diseases have mainly been associated with neuronal death. Recent investigations have shown that astroglia may modulate neuroinflammation in the early and late stages of the disease. [11C]Deuterodeprenyl ([11C]DED) is a tracer that has been used for reactive astrocyte detection in Alzheimer’s disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, among others, with some limitations. To develop a new radiotracer for detecting astrocytosis and overcoming associated difficulties, we recently reported the synthesis of a sulfonamide derivative of Sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), labelled with 18F, namely SR101 N-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl) sulfonamide ([18F]2B-SRF101). The red fluorescent dye SR101 has been used as a specific marker of astroglia in the neocortex of rodents using in vivo models. In the present work we performed a biological characterisation of the new tracer including biodistribution and micro-PET/computed tomography (CT) images. PET/CT studies with [11C]DED were also done to compare with [18F]2B-SRF101 in order to assess its potential as an astrocyte marker.
Biodistribution studies with [18F]2B-SRF101 were carried out in C57BL6J black and transgenic (3xTg) mice. A hepatointestinal metabolization as well as the pharmacokinetic profile were determined, showing appropriate characteristics to become a PET diagnostic agent.  Dynamic PET/CT studies were carried out with [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED to evaluate the distribution of both tracers in the brain. 

A significant difference in [18F]2B-SRF101 uptake was especially observed in the cortex and hippocampus, and it was higher in 3xTg mice than it was in the control group. These results suggested that [18F]2B-SRF101 is a promising candidate for more extensive evaluation as an astrocyte tracer. 

The difference observed for [18F]2B-SRF101 was not found in the case of [11C]DED. The comparative studies between [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED suggest that both tracers have different roles as astrocytosis markers in this animal model, and could provide different and complementary information at the same time. In this way, by means of a multitracer approach, useful information could be obtained for the staging of the disease.

Background and purpose: Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated T2D-related brain structural and functional changes that are partly associated with cognitive decline. However, less is known about the underlying mechanisms. Chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular complications are the two of most important risk factors related to cognitive decline in diabetes. Cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), such as those defined by lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and microhemorrhages, are also associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we examined brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in patients in the early stages of T2D without CSVDs to focus on glucose metabolism factors and avoid the interference of vascular risk factors on T2D-related brain damage.
Methods: T2D patients with disease durations of less than five years and without any signs of CSVDs (n＝34) were compared with healthy control subjects (n＝24). Whole-brain region-based functional connectivity was analyzed with network-based statistics (NBS), and brain surface morphology was examined. In addition, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was conducted for all subjects.
Results: At the whole-brain region-based functional connectivity level, thirty-three functional connectivities were changed in T2D patients relative to those in controls, mostly manifested as hyperconnectivities and mainly located between the sensory-motor network and auditory network. Some of the connectivities were positively correlated with blood glucose level, insulin resistance, and MoCA scores in the T2D group. The network-level analysis also showed between-network hyperconnectivity in T2D patients but no significant changes in within-network connectivity. In addition, there were no significant differences in MoCA scores or brain morphology measures, including cortical thickness, surface area, mean curvature, and gray/white matter volume, between the two groups.
Conclusion: The findings indicate that brain hyperconnectivity occurs in the early stages of T2D without CSVDs before the presence of significant brain morphology change and cognitive decline, which may be a neuroimaging basis for predicting cognitive decline in early T2D patients.

As the third cause of death and cognitive decline in industrialized countries, stroke is a major burden for society. Vascular risks factors such as hypertension and diabetes are involved in most stroke patients, aggravate stroke severity, but are still poorly taken into account in preclinical studies. Microangiopathy and sustained inflammation are exacerbated, likely explaining the severity of stroke in those patients. We sought to demonstrate that intravenous administration of human adipose derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSC) that have immunomodulatory properties, could accelerate sensorimotor recovery, prevent long-term spatial memory and promote neurogenesis, in diabetic or hypertensive mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). Diabetic (streptozotocin IP) or hypertensive (L-NAME per os) male C57Bl6 mice subjected to pMCAo, were treated by hADMSC (500,000 cells IV) 2 days post stroke. Infarct volume, neurogenesis microglial/macrophage density, T-lymphocytes density, astrocytes density and vessel density were monitored 7 days after cells injection and at 6 weeks. Neurological sensorimotor deficit and spatial memory were assessed until six weeks post stroke. Whatever the vascular risk factor, hADMSC showed no effect on functional recovery/cognitive decline prevention at short or long-term assessment, nor significantly modified neurogenesis microglial/macrophage, T-lymphocytes, astrocytes and vessel density. This work is part of a European program (H2020, RESSTORE). We discuss the discrepancy of our results with those obtained in rats and the importance of timing, source and type of cells according to the species that is considered. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms preventing recovery should help for successful clinical translation but first could allow identifying good and bad responders to cell therapy in stroke.

Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Increasing evidence suggest that inflammatory cytokines are important mediators for the onset and progression of GBS. A number of clinical studies have demonstrated elevated levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17 related cytokines in the patients with GBS, but results were inconsistent across studies.  Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood inflammatory cytokine levels between the patients with GBS and healthy individuals. The database search identified 30 studies encompassing 1302 GBS patients and 1073 controls to be included. The random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that blood tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (Hedges g,1.544; 95% CI, 0.923-2.165; p &lt; 0.001), interleukin-1β (IL-1β; Hedges g, 0.678; 95% CI, 0.183-1.172; p = 0.007), IL-6 (Hedges g, 0.630; 95% CI, 0.100 -1.160; p = 0.02), IL-4 (Hedges g, 0.822; 95% CI, 0.220-1.423; p = 0.007 ), IL-17 (Hedges g, 1.452; 95% CI, 0.331-2.573; p = 0.011), interferon-γ (Hedges g,1.104; 95% CI, 0.490-1.719; p &lt; 0.001) and C-reactive protein (Hedges g, 0.909; 95% CI, 0.453-1.365; p &lt; 0.001) levels were significantly increased in the patients with GBS when compared with controls. In contrast, the blood IL-10 and TGF-β levels were not significantly associated with GBS. Furthermore, the meta-analysis found that cerebrospinal fluid IL-17 levels were significantly associated with GBS (Hedges g, 1.882; 95% CI, 0.104-3.661; p = 0.038). Taken together, our results clarified the circulating inflammatory cytokine profile in the patients with GBS, and revealed that Th1, Th2 and Th17 related cytokines were highly elevated in the GBS patients, and suggesting the potential of these cytokines to be used as biomarkers for GBS.

Adolescence is a unique period in which higher cognition develops to adult-level, while plasticity of neuron and behavior is at one of its peak. Yet, cognitive training studies for adolescents has been sparse and neural correlates of the training effects yet to be established. This study investigated the effects of multicomponent training of cognitive control (MTCC) in order to examine whether the training enhanced adolescents' cognitive control ability and if the effects were generalizable to other cognitive domains. Cognitive control refers to the ability to adjust a series of thoughts and behaviors in correspondence to an internal goal, and involves inhibition, working memory, shifting, and dual tasking as subcomponents. The participants were middle school students (aged 11–14) and randomly assigned to either a training group or an active control group. The training group performed 30 minutes of MTCC per day for six weeks. To identify the training effects, we examined the cognitive performance, regional gray matter, and their relationship. The training group showed modest improvement in a visuospatial fluid intelligence test (Block Design) after MTCC, which was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In addition, the training effect on the gray matter volume (time × group interaction) was observed in the right inferior cortex (rIFC). While the control group showed a typical reduction in the rIFC volume, the training group showed a relative increase in the homologous region. The relative change in rIFC volume was associated with the change in Stroop performance. These results imply that MTCC may affect brain structure relevant to inhibitory control process.

In EEG measurements, processing of periodic sounds in the ascending auditory pathway generates the frequency-following response (FFR) phase-locked to the fundamental frequency (F0) and its harmonics of a sound. We measured FFRs to the steady-state (vowel) part of syllables /ba/ and /aw/ occurring in binaural rapid streams of speech sounds as frequently repeating standard syllables or as infrequent (p = .2) deviant syllables among standard /wa/ syllables. Our aim was to study whether concurrent active phonological processing affects early processing of irrelevant speech sounds reflected by FFRs to these sounds. To this end, during syllable delivery, our healthy adult participants performed tasks involving written letters delivered on a computer screen in a rapid stream. The stream consisted of vowel letters written in red, infrequently occurring consonant letters written in the same color, and infrequently occurring vowel letters written in blue. In the phonological task, the participants were instructed to press a response key to the consonant letters differing phonologically but not in color from the frequently occurring red vowels, whereas in the non-phonological task, they were instructed to respond to the vowel letters written in blue differing only in color from the frequently occurring red vowels. We observed that the phonological task enhanced responses to deviant /ba/ syllables but not responses to deviant /aw/ syllables. This suggests that active phonological task performance may enhance processing of such small changes in irrelevant speech sounds as the 30-ms difference in the initial formant-transition time between the otherwise identical syllables /ba/ and /wa/ used in the present study.

Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) is a prospective tool to enhance the emotion regulation capability of participants and to alleviate their emotional disorders. The hippocampus is a key brain region in the emotional brain network and plays a significant role in social cognition and emotion processing in the brain. However, few studies have focused on the emotion NF of the hippocampus. This study investigated the feasibility of NF training of healthy participants to self-regulate the activation of the hippocampus and assessed the effect of rtfMRI-NF on the hippocampus before and after training. Twenty-six right-handed healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to the experimental group receiving hippocampal rtfMRI-NF (n = 13) and the control group (CG) receiving rtfMRI-NF from the intraparietal sulcus rtfMRI-NF (n = 13) and completed a total of 4 NF runs. The hippocampus and the intraparietal sulcus were defined based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard template, and NF signal was measured as a percent signal change relative to the baseline obtained by averaging the fMRI signal for the preceding 20 s long rest block. NF signal (percent signal change) was updated every 2 s and was displayed on the screen. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and regional homogeneity values were calculated to evaluate the effects of NF on spontaneous neural activity in resting state fMRI. A standard general linear model (GLM) analysis was separately conducted for each fMRI NF run. Results showed that the activation of hippocampus increased after 4 NF training runs. The hippocampal activity of the experiment group participants was higher than that of the CG. They also showed elevated hippocampal activity and the greater amygdala-hippocampus connectivity. The anterior temporal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and amygdala of brain regions associated with emotional processing were activated during training. We presented a proof-of-concept study using rtfMRI-NF for hippocampus up-regulation in the recall of positive autobiographical memories. The current study may provide a new method to regulate our emotions and can potentially be applied to the clinical treatment of emotional disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00228">Building Memory Representations for Exemplar-Based Judgment: A Role for Ventral Precuneus</a></h4>

The brain networks underlying human multiple-cue judgment, the judgment of a continuous criterion based on multiple cues, have been examined in a few recent studies, and the ventral precuneus has been found to be a key region. Specifically, activation differences in ventral precuneus (as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) has been linked to an exemplar-based judgment process, where judgments are based on memory for previous similar cases. What aspects of exemplar-based judgment ventral precuneus supports is however poorly understood. Ventral precuneus is a brain region important for various episodic memory processes, where increased engagement of this region together with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the medial temporal lobes (MTL) during learning have been linked to retrieval success. Several alternatives are plausible, for example that reduced brain activity in ventral precuneus during learning to make exemplar-based judgments could reflect reduced needs for visuo-spatial attention as a function of learning to master the task. The present study used fMRI during a multiple-cue judgment task to gain novel neurocognitive evidence informative for the link between learning-related activity changes in ventral precuneus and exemplar-based judgment. Participants (N = 27) spontaneously learned to make judgments during fMRI, in a multiple-cue judgment task specifically designed to induce exemplar-based processing. Contrasting brain activity during late learning to early learning indeed revealed higher activity in ventral precuneus, the bilateral MTL and the vmPFC. Activity in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC was found to parametrically increase between each judgment event, and activity levels in the ventral precuneus predicted performance after learning. These results are interpreted such that the ventral precuneus supports the aspects of exemplar-based processes that are related to episodic memory, tentatively by building and retrieving memory representations for judgment.

The reduction of neuronal responses to repeated stimulus presentation occurs in many sensory neurons, also in the inferior colliculus of birds. Response adaptation plays a role in perceptual auditory phenomena like the precedence effect. The cellular mechanisms that cause response adaptation are not well described. Adaptation must be explicable by changes in the activity of input neurons, short-term synaptic plasticity of the incoming connections, excitability changes of the neuron under consideration or influences of inhibitory or modulatory network connections. Using whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices of the embryonic chicken brain we wanted to understand the intrinsic and synaptic contributions to adaptation in the core of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. We described two neuron types in the chicken ICCc based on their action potential firing patterns: Phasic/onset neurons showed strong intrinsic adaptation but recovered more rapidly. Tonic/sustained firing neurons had weaker adaptation but often had additional slow components of recovery from adaptation. Chicken ICCc neurons received mostly mixed AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamatergic synaptic inputs. In the majority of ICCc neurons the input synapses underwent short-term depression. With a simulation of the putative population output activity of the chicken ICCc we showed that the different adaptation profiles of the neuron classes could shift the emphasize of stimulus encoding from transients at long intervals to ongoing parts at short intervals. Thus we report here that description of biophysical and synaptic properties can help to explain adaptive phenomena in central auditory neurons.

Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment in humans and currently disables 466 million people across the world. Congenital deafness affects at least one in 500 newborns, and over 50% are hereditary in nature. To date, existing pharmacologic therapies for genetic and acquired etiologies of deafness are severely limited. With the advent of modern sequencing technologies, there is a vast compendium of growing genetic alterations that underlie human hearing loss, which can be targeted by therapeutics such as gene therapy. Recently, there has been tremendous progress in the development of gene therapy vectors to treat sensorineural hearing loss in animal models in vivo. Nevertheless, significant hurdles remain before such technologies can be translated towards clinical use. These include addressing the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB), engineering more specific and effective delivery vehicles, improving surgical access, and validating novel targets. In this review, we both highlight recent progress and outline challenges associated with in vivo gene therapy for human sensorineural hearing loss.

ANNINE-6 and ANNINE-6plus are voltage-sensitive dyes that when combined with two-photon microscopy are ideal for recording of neuronal voltages in vivo, in both bulk loaded tissue and the dendrites of single neurons. Here, we describe in detail but for a broad audience the voltage sensing mechanism of fast voltage-sensitive dyes, with a focus on ANNINE dyes, and how voltage imaging can be optimized with one-photon and two-photon excitation. Under optimized imaging conditions the key strengths of ANNINE dyes are their high sensitivity (0.5%/mV), neglectable bleaching and phototoxicity, a linear response to membrane potential, and a temporal resolution which is only limited by the imaging speed. ANNINE dyes in combination with two-photon microscopy allow depth-resolved voltage imaging in bulk loaded tissue to study average membrane voltage oscillations and sensory responses. Alternatively, if ANNINE-6plus is applied internally, supra and sub threshold voltage changes can be recorded from dendrites of single neurons in awake animals. Interestingly, in our experience ANNINE-6plus labelling is impressively stable in vivo, such that voltage imaging from single Purkinje neuron dendrites can be performed for two weeks after a single electroporation of the neuron. Finally, to maximize their potential for neuroscience studies, voltage imaging with ANNINE dyes and two-photon microscopy can be combined with electrophysiological recording, calcium imaging, and/or pharmacology, even in awake animals.

Etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders is complex, involving multiple factors that can affect the type and severity of symptoms. Although precise causes are far from being identified, allergy or other forms of hypersensitivity to dietary ingredients have been implicated in triggering or worsening of behavioral and emotional symptoms, especially in patients suffering from depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity, and/or autism. Among such ingredients, cow’s milk, along with wheat gluten, is commonly suspected. However, the contributory role of cow’s milk in these disorders has not been elucidated due to insufficient pathophysiological evidence. In the present study, we therefore investigated neuroinflammatory changes that are associated with behavioral abnormality using a non-anaphylactic mouse model of cow’s milk allergy. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a 5-week oral sensitization procedure without or with a major milk allergen, beta-lactoglobulin (BLG). All mice were challenged with BLG and their anxiety- and depression-associated behaviors were subsequently assessed during the 6th and 7th weeks. We found that BLG-sensitized male mice exhibited significantly increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior although they did not display anaphylactic reactions when challenged with BLG. Female behavior was not noticeably affected by BLG sensitization. Upon examination of the small intestines, reduced immunoreactivity to occludin was detected in the ileal mucosa of BLG-sensitized mice although the transcriptional expression of this tight-junction protein was not significantly altered when measured by quantitative RT-PCR. On the other hand, the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in the ileal mucosa was significantly elevated in BLG-sensitized mice, suggesting the sensitization had resulted in intestinal inflammation. Inflammatory responses were also detected in the brain of BLG-sensitized mice, determined by the hypertrophic morphology of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes. These reactive astrocytes were particularly evident near the blood vessels in the midbrain region, resembling the perivascular barrier previously reported by others in experimental autoimmune encephalitis mouse models. Interestingly, increased levels of TNFα was also found in this region. Taken together, our results demonstrated that BLG sensitization elicits inflammatory responses in the intestine and brain without overt anaphylactic signs of milk allergy, signifying food allergy as a potential pathogenic factor of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is a major component in the root and rhizomes of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), which have been used as an herbal medicine, because of its anti-inflammatory activity. GA is known as an inhibitor of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which in involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases including inner retinal neuropathy. In this study, we examined the effect of GA in a mouse model of retinal degeneration (RD), the leading cause of blindness. RD was induced by exposure to a blue light-emitting diode (LED). In functional assessment, scotopic electroretinography showed that the amplitudes of both a- and b-waves were significantly reduced in RD mice (P &lt; 0.05), whereas they were significantly increased in GA-treated RD mice (P &lt; 0.05), compared to those in non-treated RD animals. In histological assessment, GA treatment preserved the outer nuclear layer where photoreceptors reside and reduced photoreceptor cell death. GA-treated retinas showed significantly reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, CCL2 and 6, iNOS, and COX-2 (P &lt; 0.05), compared to that in non-treated retinas. Immunohistochemistry showed that Iba-1 and GFAP expression was markedly reduced in GA-treated retinas, indicating decreased glial response, retinal stress and inflammation. Interestingly, HMGB1 expression was reduced in non-treated RD retinas whereas GA increased its expression. These results demonstrate that GA reduces retinal inflammation by inhibiting HMGB1 release from photoreceptors in blue LED-induced RD and preserves retinal structure and function, suggesting that GA may have potential as a medication for the treatment of RD.

Environmental enrichment for rodents is known to enhance motor performance. Structural and molecular changes have been reported to be coupled with enriched environment, but functional alterations of single neurons remain elusive. Here, we compared mice grown up under control conditions and enriched environment. We tested the motor performance on a rotarod and subsequently preformed whole cell patch clamp recordings in cerebellar slice focusing on granule cells of lobule IX, which is known to receive vestibular input. Mice grown up in an enriched environment stayed longer on an accelerating rotarod. Electrophysiological analyses revealed normal passive properties of granule cells and a functional adaptation to the enriched environment, manifested in faster action potentials with more depolarized voltage threshold and larger action potential overshoot. Furthermore, the maximal firing frequency of action potentials was higher in mice grown up in an enriched environment. These data show that enriched environment causes specific alterations in the biophysical properties of neurons. Furthermore, we speculate that the ability of cerebellar granule cells to generate higher firing frequencies improves motor performance.

At the beginning of the XX century, in view of the growing international recognition of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the Spanish authorities took some important steps to support Cajal´s scientific work. This recognition peaked in 1906, when Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Spanish government provided Cajal a state-of-the-art laboratory in Madrid to allow him to continue with his research and they funded salaries to pay his first tenured collaborators, the number of which increased further after the creation of the Junta para Ampliación de Estudios -JAE. The JAE was an organism set up to help promising researchers develop their careers in different ways, thereby contributing to the development of science in Spain. Although largely forgotten or relatively unknown, there has been a recent revival in the recognition of the school that developed around Cajal, collectively referred to as the Spanish Neurological School (or colloquially, as the Cajal School or School of Madrid). Almost all Cajal’s collaborators were men, although a limited number of female scientists spent part of their careers at the heart of the Cajal School. Here we discuss these women and their work in the laboratory in Madrid. We have tracked the careers of Laura Forster (from Australia/United Kingdom), Manuela Serra, María Soledad Ruiz-Capillas and María Luisa Herreros (all Spanish), through their scientific publications, both in the journal founded by Cajal and elsewhere, and from other documentary sources. To complete the picture, we also outline the careers of other secondary figures that contributed to the production and running of Cajal’s laboratory in Madrid. We show here that the dawn of Spanish neuroscience included a number of contributions from female researchers who to date, have received little recognition.

Reversible formation of PHF-like phosphorylated tau an early feature of Alzheimer´s disease (AD) was previously shown to occur in torpor during hibernation of Syrian hamsters. Here, we tackled the question to what extend hibernating Syrian hamsters can serve as a model for for the early stage of AD. During early AD  , anosmia, the loss of olfactory function, is a common and typical feature. We, thus, investigated tau phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity and behavioral physiology of the olfactory system during hibernation. Tau was phosphorylated on several AD -relevant epitopes, and distribution of PHF-like phosphorylated tau in the olfactory bulb was quite similar to what is seen in AD. Tau phosphorylation was not associated with a destabilization of microtubules or actin filaments and did not lead to fibril formation. Previously we observed a transient spine reduction in pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, which is correlated to the distribution of phosphorylated tau. Consistently, in the olfactory bulb the granule cells, which are devoid of phosphorylated tau, do not show a reduction in their spines. Contrary to previous reports no reduction in synaptic proteins was observed. However, when the effect of hibernation on olfactory memory was tested using a two odor discrimination task, non-hibernating animals showed a significant preference for the odor presented with a food reward, whereas hibernating animals did not. We conclude that hibernation is associated with a specific olfactory memory deficit, which might not be attributed to the formation of PHF-like phosphorylated tau within the olfactory bulb. We discuss a possible involvement of modulatory input provided by cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, which are affected by hibernation.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00167">Radiomic Features of the Nigrosome-1 Region of the Substantia Nigra: Using Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping to Assist the Diagnosis of Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

Introduction: The loss of nigrosome-1 which is also referred to as the swallow tail sign (STS) in T2* weighted iron-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently emerged as a new biomarker for idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD). However, consistent recognition of the STS is difficult due to individual variations and different imaging parameters. Radiomics might have the potential to overcome these shortcomings. Therefore, we chose to explore whether radiomic features of nigrosome-1 of substantia nigra (SN) based on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) could help to differentiate IPD patients from healthy controls (HCs).
Methods: Three-dimensional multi-echo gradient-recalled echo images (0.86×0.86×1.00 mm3) were obtained at 3.0 T MRI for QSM in 87 IPD patients and 77 HCs. Regions of interest (ROIs) of the SN below the red nucleus were manually drawn on both sides, and subsequently, volumes of interest (VOIs) were segmented (these ROIs included 4 1mm slices). Then, 105 radiomic features (including 18 histogram features, 13 shape features, 74 texture features) of bilateral VOIs in the two groups were extracted. Forty features were selected according to the ensemble feature selection method which combined analysis of variance, random forest and recursive feature elimination. The selected features were further utilized to distinguish IPD patients from HC using SVM classifier with 10 rounds of 3-fold cross-validation. Finally, the representative features were analyzed using an unpaired t-test with Bonferroni correction and correlated with the UPDRS-III scores.
Results: The classification results from SVM were: area under curve (AUC): 0.96±0.02; accuracy: 0.88±0.03; sensitivity: 0.89±0.06; and specificity: 0.87±0.07. Five representative features were selected to show their detailed difference between IPD patients and HCs: 10 Percentile and Median in IPD patients were higher than those in HCs (all p&lt;0.00125), while, GLRLM-Long Run Low Gray Level Emphasis, GLSZM-Gray Level Non-Uniformity and volume (all p&lt;0.00125) in IPD patients were lower than those in HCs. The 10 percentile was positively correlated with UPDRS-III score (r=0.35, p=0.001).
Conclusion: Radiomic features of nigrosome-1 region of SN based on QSM could be useful in the diagnosis of IPD and could serve as a surrogate marker for the STS.

Identifying older adults at risk for memory impairment is an important goal for initiating early treatment and prevention strategies. We examined the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of older and younger adults before and after cognitive effort as a marker for subsequent memory decline, focusing on the connectivity between the left anterior hippocampus (laHC) and the posterior hippocampi (pHC). Results showed that for younger adults, post-effort increases in laHC-pHC connectivity were related to increases in connectivity between the laHC and the hubs of the default mode network. However, for older adults, post-effort increases in the RSFC of laHC-pHC were related to decreases in the connectivity of the laHC and right precentral gyrus. Thus, the correlation between intra-HC and inter-HC RSFC was altered with cognitive effort and aging. Importantly, older adults who had lower post-effort RSFC between the laHC and the pHC demonstrated a decline in an episodic memory 2 years later. Hence, the change in intra-HC RSFC following cognitive effort was able to predict subsequent memory function with aging in our sample.

Background: Performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously interferes with gait performance and may lead to falls in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in elderly individuals with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training.
Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function (Stroop color and word test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B), gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task cost (DTC). Gait performance was evaluated during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task).
Results: Both groups showed significant improvements on the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed better performance than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence. Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in elderly individuals with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function.

While walking was once thought to be a highly automated process, it requires higher-level cognition with older age. Like other cognitive tasks, it also becomes further challenged with increased cognitive load (e.g., the addition of an unrelated dual task) and often results in poorer performance (e.g., slower speed). It is not well known, however, how intrinsic neural network communication relates to walking speed, nor to this “cost” to gait performance; i.e., “dual-task cost”. The current study investigates the relationship between network connectivity, using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), and individual differences in older adult walking speed. Fifty participants (35 female; 84±4.5 years) from the MOBILIZE Boston Study cohort underwent an MRI protocol and completed a gait assessment during two conditions: walking quietly at a preferred pace and while concurrently performing a serial subtraction task. Within and between neural network connectivity measures were calculated from resting-state fMRI and were correlated with walking speeds and the dual-task cost (i.e., the percent change in speed between conditions). Among the fMRI correlates, faster walking was associated with increased connectivity between motor and cognitive networks and decreased connectivity between limbic and cognitive networks. Smaller dual-task cost was associated with increased connectivity within the motor network and increased connectivity between the ventral attention and executive networks. These findings support the importance of both motor network integrity as well as inter-network connectivity amongst higher-level cognitive networks in older adults’ ability to maintain mobility, particularly under dual-task conditions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48287">Electroporated recombinant proteins as tools for in vivo functional complementation, imaging, and chemical biology</a></h4>

Delivery of native or chemically modified recombinant proteins into mammalian cells shows promise for functional investigations and various technological applications, but concerns that sub-cellular localization and functional integrity of delivered proteins may be affected remain high. Here, we surveyed batch electroporation as a delivery tool for single polypeptides and multi-subunit protein assemblies of the kinetochore, a spatially confined and well-studied subcellular structure. After electroporation into human cells, recombinant fluorescent Ndc80 and Mis12 multi-subunit complexes exhibited native localization, physically interacted with endogenous binding partners, and functionally complemented depleted endogenous counterparts to promote mitotic checkpoint signaling and chromosome segregation. Farnesylation is required for kinetochore localization of the Dynein adaptor Spindly. In cells with chronically inhibited farnesyl transferase activity, <i><i>in vitro</i></i> farnesylation and electroporation of recombinant Spindly faithfully resulted in robust kinetochore localization. Our data show that electroporation is well-suited to deliver synthetic and chemically modified versions of functional proteins, and, therefore, constitutes a promising tool for applications in chemical and syntetic biology.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47815">Algal-fungal symbiosis leads to photosynthetic mycelium</a></h4>

Mutualistic interactions between free-living algae and fungi are widespread in nature and are hypothesized to have facilitated the evolution of land plants and lichens. In all known algal-fungal mutualisms, including lichens, algal cells remain external to fungal cells. Here, we report on an algal–fungal interaction in which <i>Nannochloropsis oceanica</i> algal cells become internalized within the hyphae of the fungus <i>Mortierella elongata</i>. This apparent symbiosis begins with close physical contact and nutrient exchange, including carbon and nitrogen transfer between fungal and algal cells as demonstrated by isotope tracer experiments. This mutualism appears to be stable, as both partners remain physiologically active over months of co-cultivation, leading to the eventual internalization of photosynthetic algal cells, which persist to function, grow and divide within fungal hyphae. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> and <i>Mortierella</i> are biotechnologically important species for lipids and biofuel production, with available genomes and molecular tool kits. Based on the current observations, they provide unique opportunities for studying fungal-algal mutualisms including mechanisms leading to endosymbiosis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47117">The microbiota protects from viral-induced neurologic damage through microglia-intrinsic TLR signaling</a></h4>

Symbiotic microbes impact the function and development of the central nervous system (CNS); however, little is known about the contribution of the microbiota during viral-induced neurologic damage. We identify that commensals aid in host defense following infection with a neurotropic virus through enhancing microglia function. Germfree mice or animals that receive antibiotics are unable to control viral replication within the brain leading to increased paralysis. Microglia derived from germfree or antibiotic-treated animals cannot stimulate viral-specific immunity and microglia depletion leads to worsened demyelination. Oral administration of toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands to virally infected germfree mice limits neurologic damage. Homeostatic activation of microglia is dependent on intrinsic signaling through TLR4, as disruption of TLR4 within microglia, but not the entire CNS (excluding microglia), leads to increased viral-induced clinical disease. This work demonstrates that gut immune-stimulatory products can influence microglia function to prevent CNS damage following viral infection.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46050">Distinct roles of striatal direct and indirect pathways in value-based decision making</a></h4>

The striatum is critically involved in value-based decision making. However, it is unclear how striatal direct and indirect pathways work together to make optimal choices in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Here, we examined the effects of selectively inactivating D1 receptor (D1R)- or D2 receptor (D2R)-expressing dorsal striatal neurons (corresponding to direct- and indirect-pathway neurons, respectively) on mouse choice behavior in a reversal task with progressively increasing reversal frequency and a dynamic two-armed bandit task. Inactivation of either D1R- or D2R-expressing striatal neurons impaired performance in both tasks, but the pattern of altered choice behavior differed between the two animal groups. A reinforcement learning model-based analysis indicated that inactivation of D1R- and D2R-expressing striatal neurons selectively impairs value-dependent action selection and value learning, respectively. Our results suggest differential contributions of striatal direct and indirect pathways to two distinct steps in value-based decision making.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44907">Swimming eukaryotic microorganisms exhibit a universal speed distribution</a></h4>

One approach to quantifying biological diversity consists of characterizing the statistical distribution of specific properties of a taxonomic group or habitat. Microorganisms living in fluid environments, and for whom motility is key, exploit propulsion resulting from a rich variety of shapes, forms, and swimming strategies. Here, we explore the variability of swimming speed for unicellular eukaryotes based on published data. The data naturally partitions into that from flagellates (with a small number of flagella) and from ciliates (with tens or more). Despite the morphological and size differences between these groups, each of the two probability distributions of swimming speed are accurately represented by log-normal distributions, with good agreement holding even to fourth moments. Scaling of the distributions by a characteristic speed for each data set leads to a collapse onto an apparently universal distribution. These results suggest a universal way for ecological niches to be populated by abundant microorganisms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44745">The transcription factor Hey and nuclear lamins specify and maintain cell identity</a></h4>

The inability of differentiated cells to maintain their identity is a hallmark of age-related diseases. We found that the transcription factor Hey supervises the identity of differentiated enterocytes (ECs) in the adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut. Lineage tracing established that Hey-deficient ECs are unable to maintain their unique nuclear organization and identity. To supervise cell identity, Hey determines the expression of nuclear lamins, switching from a stem-cell lamin configuration to a differentiated lamin configuration. Moreover, continued Hey expression is required to conserve large-scale nuclear organization. During aging, Hey levels decline, and EC identity and gut homeostasis are impaired, including pathological reprograming and compromised gut integrity. These phenotypes are highly similar to those observed upon acute targeting of Hey or perturbation of lamin expression in ECs in young adults. Indeed, aging phenotypes were suppressed by continued expression of Hey in ECs, suggesting that a Hey-lamin network safeguards nuclear organization and differentiated cell identity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44219">Expression of WIPI2B counteracts age-related decline in autophagosome biogenesis in neurons</a></h4>

Autophagy defects are implicated in multiple late-onset neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, and Parkinson’s diseases. Since aging is the most common shared risk factor in neurodegeneration, we assessed rates of autophagy in mammalian neurons during aging. We identified a significant decrease in the rate of constitutive autophagosome biogenesis during aging and observed pronounced morphological defects in autophagosomes in neurons from aged mice. While early stages of autophagosome formation were unaffected, we detected the frequent production of stalled LC3B-negative isolation membranes in neurons from aged mice. These stalled structures recruited the majority of the autophagy machinery, but failed to develop into LC3B-positive autophagosomes. Importantly, ectopically expressing WIPI2B effectively restored autophagosome biogenesis in aged neurons. This rescue is dependent on the phosphorylation state of WIPI2B at the isolation membrane, suggesting a novel therapeutic target in age-associated neurodegeneration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41853">Vocal and locomotor coordination develops in association with arousal state</a></h4>

In adult animals, movement and vocalizations are coordinated, sometimes facilitating, and at other times inhibiting, each other. What is missing is how these different domains of motor control become coordinated over the course of development. We investigated how postural-locomotor behaviors may influence vocal development, and the role played by physiological arousal during their interactions. Using infant marmoset monkeys, we densely sampled vocal, postural and locomotor behaviors and estimated arousal fluctuations from electrocardiographic measures of heart rate. We found that vocalizations matured sooner than postural and locomotor skills, and that vocal-locomotor coordination improved with age and during elevated arousal levels. These results suggest that postural-locomotor maturity is not required for vocal development to occur, and that infants gradually improve coordination between vocalizations and body movement through a process that may be facilitated by arousal level changes.

The neural mechanisms that support naturalistic learning via effective pedagogical approaches remain elusive. Here we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure brain activity from instructor-learner dyads simultaneously during naturalistic conceptual learning. Results show enhanced brain-to-brain coupling within learner-instructor dyads when the instructor use a scaffolding instruction. Such coupling enhancement is correlated with learning outcomes, and appears to be driven by specific scaffolding behaviors on the part of the instructors (e.g., asking guiding questions or providing hints). Those effects are absent when the instructors produce explanatory behaviors. Crucially, instructional approaches (scaffolding vs. explanation) can be successfully decoded based on brain-to-brain coupling, but not when using the same machine-learning techniques in a single-brain approach. These findings suggest that brain-to-brain coupling as a pedagogically informative measure tracks the naturalistic instructional process during instructor-learner interaction throughout constructive engagement, but not information clarification.

Sound localization plays a critical role in animal survival. To compute the incident sound direction, the animal can use three cues: interaural timing differences (ITDs), interaural level differences (ILDs) and the direction-dependent spectral filtering of the sound by the head and pinnae (spectral cues). Compared to ITDs and ILDs, little is known about how spectral cues contribute to the neural encoding of auditory space. Here we report on auditory space encoding in the mouse superior colliculus (SC). We show that the mouse SC contains neurons with spatially-restricted receptive fields (RFs) that form a topographic map of azimuthal auditory space. By eliminating each sound localization cue from the stimuli, we found that nasal RFs require spectral cues and temporal RFs require ILDs. Therefore, the lack of either cue results in the disruption of the azimuthal topographic map. These results demonstrate an unexpected role of spectral cues in azimuthal sound localization.

Elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy is essential for cell survival and neuronal functions. But, how impaired mitophagy participates in tissue-specific vulnerability in the brain remains unclear. Here we discovered that Rhes, a striatal-enriched protein, is a major regulator of mitophagy in the striatum. Rhes predominantly interact with dysfunctional mitochondria and degrades them via mitophagy, and this function is exacerbated by the striatal toxin, 3- nitropropionic acid (3-NP). 3-NP induces mitochondrial swelling, loss of cristae and neuronal cell death only in WT but not Rhes KO striatum. Mechanistically, Rhes disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential ({delta}{Psi}m) and interacts with mitophagy receptor, Nix. In Nix KO cells, Rhes fails to disrupt {delta}{Psi}m or eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria. Moreover, Rhes travels to the neighboring cell and associates with dysfunctional mitochondria via Nix. Collectively, Rhes is a major regulator of mitophagy via Nix which may determine striatal vulnerability in the brain.

The ability to reconstruct neuronal networks, local microcircuits, or the entire connectome is a central goal of modern neuroscience. Recently, advancements in sample preparation (e.g., sample expansion and Brainbow labeling) and optical (e.g., confocal and light sheet) techniques have enabled the imaging of increasingly large neural systems with high contrast. Tracing neuronal structures from these images proves challenging, however, necessitating tools that integrate multiple neuronal traces, potentially derived by various methods, into one combined (montaged) result. Here, we present TraceMontage, an ImageJ/Fiji plugin for the combination of multiple neuron traces of a single image, either redundantly or non-redundantly. Internally, it uses graph theory to connect topological patterns in the 3-D spatial coordinates of neuronal trees. The software generates a single output tracing file containing the montage traces of the input tracing files and provides several measures of consistency analysis among multiple tracers. To our knowledge, our software is the first dedicated method for the combination of tracing results. Combining multiple tracers increases the accuracy and speed of tracing of densely-labeled samples by harnessing collaborative effort. This utility is demonstrated using fluorescence microscope images from the hippocampus and primary visual cortex (V1) in Brainbow-labeled mice. TraceMontage provides researchers the ability to combine neuronal tracing data generated by either the same or different method(s). As datasets become larger, the ability to trace images in this parallel manner will help connectomics scale to increasingly larger neural systems.

The Common Model of Cognition (CMC) is a consensus architecture for human and human-like artificial cognition. We hypothesized that, because of its generality, the CMC could be a candidate model of the large-scale functional architecture of the human brain. To this end, we analyzed neuroimaging from N=200 participants across seven tasks that cover the broad range of cognitive domains. The CMC framework was translated into a model of neural connectivity between brain regions homologous to CMC components. After the model was implemented and fitted using Dynamic Causal Modeling, its performance was compared against four alternative large-scale brain architectures that had been previously proposed in the field of neuroscience. The results show that the CMC outperforms the other four architectures within and across all domains. These findings suggest that a common, functional computational blueprint for human-like intelligence also captures the neural architecture that underpins human cognition.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/703710v1?rss=1">Striatal activity reflects cortical activity patterns</a></h4>

The dorsal striatum is organized into domains that drive characteristic behaviors, and receive inputs from different parts of the cortex which modulate similar behaviors. Striatal responses to cortical inputs, however, can be affected by changes in connection strength, local striatal circuitry, and thalamic inputs. Therefore, it is unclear whether the pattern of activity across striatal domains mirrors that across the cortex or differs from it. Here we use simultaneous large-scale recordings in the cortex and the striatum to show that striatal activity can be accurately predicted by spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cortex. The relationship between activity in the cortex and the striatum was spatially consistent with corticostriatal anatomy, and temporally consistent with a feedforward drive. Each striatal domain exhibited specific sensorimotor responses that predictably followed activity in the associated cortical regions, and the corticostriatal relationship remained unvaried during passive states or performance of a task probing visually guided behavior. However, the task's visual stimuli and corresponding behavioral responses evoked relatively more activity in the striatum than in associated cortical regions. This increased striatal activity involved an additive offset in firing rate, which was independent of task engagement but only present in animals that had learned the task. Thus, striatal activity largely reflects patterns of cortical activity, deviating from them in a simple additive fashion for learned stimuli or actions.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/703660v1?rss=1">Decreased Directed Functional Connectivity in the Psychedelic State</a></h4>

Neuroimaging studies of the psychedelic state offer a unique window onto the neural basis of conscious perception and selfhood. Despite well understood pharmacological mechanisms of action, the large-scale changes in neural dynamics induced by psychedelic compounds remain poorly understood. Using source-localised, steady-state MEG recordings, we describe changes in functional connectivity following the controlled administration of LSD, psilocybin and low-dose ketamine, as well as, for comparison, the (non-psychedelic) anticonvulsant drug tiagabine. We compare both undirected and directed measures of functional connectivity between placebo and drug conditions. We observe a general decrease in directed functional connectivity for all three psychedelics, as measured by Granger causality, throughout the brain. These data support the view that the psychedelic state involves a breakdown in patterns of functional organisation or information flow in the brain. In the case of LSD, the decrease in directed functional connectivity is coupled with an increase in undirected functional connectivity, which we measure using correlation and coherence. This surprising opposite movement of directed and undirected measures is of more general interest for functional connectivity analyses, which we interpret using analytical modelling. Overall, our results uncover the neural dynamics of information flow in the psychedelic state, and highlight the importance of comparing multiple measures of functional connectivity when analysing time-resolved neuroimaging data.

How the brain's white-matter anatomy constrains brain activity is an open question that might give insights into the mechanisms that underlie mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with an extremely high risk for psychosis providing a test case to study developmental aspects of schizophrenia. In this study, we used principles from network control theory to probe the implications of aberrant structural connectivity for the brain's functional dynamics in 22q11DS. We retrieved brain states from resting-state functional magnetic resonance images of 78 patients with 22q11DS and 85 healthy controls, and we compared them in terms of persistence control energy based on individual structural connectivity. Control energy was altered in a broad pattern of brain states including both energetically more demanding and less demanding brain states in 22q11DS. Further, we discovered that the brain minimizes energy by spending less time in energetically demanding brain states. In patients with 22q11DS, this behavior was less pronounced, suggesting a dynamic inefficiency of brain function in the disease. In summary, our results provide initial insights into the dynamic implications of altered structural connectivity in 22q11DS, which might improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease.

In humans, each hemisphere comprises an overlay of two visuotopic maps of the contralateral visual field, one from each eye. Is the capacity of the visual cortex limited to these two maps or are plastic mechanisms available to host more maps? Using an integrative approach of submillimeter fMRI, diffusion-weighted imaging and population receptive field mapping, we found three hemiretinal inputs to converge onto the left hemisphere in a rare individual with chiasma hypoplasia. This generates extremely atypical responses in striate and extrastriate cortices, specifically an overlay of three hemifield representations. Unexpectedly, the effects of this large abnormality on visual function in daily life are not easily detected. We conclude that developmental plasticity including the re-wiring of local intra- and cortico-cortical connections is pivotal to support the coexistence and functioning of three hemifield maps within one hemisphere.

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) tend to focus their thoughts on their personal problems and negative self-reflection. This negative self-focus has a major impact on patient quality of life and is associated with a range of cognitive deficits. Self-related thoughts, such as those seen in rumination, have been associated with intrinsic activity within cortical midline structures. In normal conditions this intrinsic activity is responsive to behavioural state, changing as an individual switches from an internally to externally oriented context. It was hypothesised that this responsiveness would be blunted in patients with MDD (n = 26; control n = 37) and that the degree to which an individual was fixed in a particular intrinsic state would be correlated with reported ruminative behaviours. This was tested by measuring intrinsic EEG activity temporal structure, quantified with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), in eyes-closed and eyes-open task-free states and contrasting between the conditions. The difference between the internally oriented eyes-closed and externally oriented eyes-open states was then correlated with ruminative behaviour, measured with the Rumination Response Scale. Healthy controls showed a robust beta band DFA change between states, moving from a critical to sub-critical activity state with the opening of the eyes. This change was not seen in MDD patients, with the eyes-closed DFA remaining similar to that in eyes-open. A negative correlation was seen between the DFA difference and rumination scores over the midline electrodes. These results identify a reduced reactivity of intrinsic activity properties in MDD that is related to greater ruminative symptoms.

How closely human organoids recapitulate cell-type diversity and cell-type maturation of their target organs is not well understood. We developed human retinal organoids with multiple nuclear and synaptic layers. We sequenced the RNA of 158,844 single cells from these organoids at six developmental time points and from the periphery, fovea, pigment epithelium and choroid of light-responsive adult human retinas, and performed histochemistry. Cell types in organoids matured in vitro to a stable 'developed' state at a rate similar to human retina development in vivo and the transcriptomes of organoid cell types converged towards the transcriptomes of adult peripheral retinal cell types. The expression of disease-associated genes was significantly cell-type specific in adult retina and cell-type specificity was retained in organoids. We implicate unexpected cell types in diseases such as macular degeneration. This resource identifies cellular targets for studying disease mechanisms in organoids and for targeted repair in adult human retinas.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/703132v1?rss=1">Consolidation of reward memory during sleep does not require dopaminergic activation</a></h4>

Sleep enhances memories, especially, if they are related to future rewards. Although dopamine has been shown to be a key determinant during reward learning, the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission for amplifying reward-related memories during sleep remains unclear. In the present study, we scrutinize the idea that dopamine is needed for the preferential consolidation of rewarded information. We blocked dopaminergic neurotransmission, thereby aiming to wipe out preferential sleep-dependent consolidation of high over low rewarded memories during sleep. Following a double-blind, balanced, crossover design 20 young healthy men received the dopamine d2-like receptor blocker Sulpiride (800 mg) or placebo, after learning a Motivated Learning Task. The task required participants to memorize 80 highly and 80 lowly rewarded pictures. Half of them were presented for a short (750 ms) and a long duration (1500 ms), respectively, which enabled to dissociate effects of reward on sleep-associated consolidation from those of mere encoding depth. Retrieval was tested after a retention interval of 20 h that included 8 h of nocturnal sleep. As expected, at retrieval, highly rewarded memories were remembered better than lowly rewarded memories, under placebo. However, there was no evidence for an effect of blocking dopaminergic neurotransmission with Sulpiride during sleep on this differential retention of rewarded information. This result indicates that dopaminergic activation is not required for the preferential consolidation of reward-associated memory. Rather it appears that dopaminergic activation only tags such memories at encoding for intensified reprocessing during sleep.

In the dual-stream model of language processing, the exact connectivity of the ventral stream to the anterior temporal lobe remains elusive. To investigate the connectivity among the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the lateral part of the temporal and parietal lobes, we integrated spatiotemporal profiles of cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) recorded intraoperatively from 14 patients who had had resective surgeries for brain tumor or epileptic focus. The 4D visualization of the combined CCEP data showed that the pars opercularis (Broca's area) connected to the posterior temporal cortices and the supramarginal gyrus, while the pars orbitalis connected to the anterior lateral temporal cortices and the angular gyrus. Quantitative topographical analysis of CCEP connectivity confirmed an anterior-posterior gradient of connectivity from IFG stimulus sites to the temporal response sites. Reciprocality analysis indicated that the anterior part of the IFG is bi-directionally connected to the temporal or parietal area. The present study revealed that each IFG subdivision has a different connectivity to the temporal lobe with an anterior-posterior gradient and supports the classical connectivity concept of Dejerine that the frontal lobe is connected to the temporal lobe through the arcuate fasciculus and also a double-fan-shaped structure, anchored at the limen insulae.

MRI providesanopportunity tolinkneuroanatomic phenotypes to genetic expression. Genome-wide associative studies in theENIGMA consortium and the UK Biobankhave demonstratedsignificant linksbetween brain structureandspecific genes. Similar studies in rodents are challenging because of the scale. We report whole brain diffusion connectomes of four strains of mice (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, CAST/EiJ, and BTBR)at spatial resolution 20,000 times higher than the human connectome. We derived volumes and scalardiffusionmetricsfor 322 regions of the brain.Volume was the most heritable traitfollowed by FA,RD, and AD. These traits wereheritable in &gt; 60% of the regions when comparing all four strains. Manywere also highly heritable when the BTBR was not included. Using auniquestatisticalapproach to limit false discoveryallowed us to identify a number of specific brain nodesin which connectivity was highly heritable.

We developed a whole-circulation computational model by integrating a transmission line (TL) model describing vascular wave transmission into the established CircAdapt platform of whole-heart mechanics. In the present paper, we verify the numerical framework of our TL model by benchmark comparison to a previously validated pulse wave propagation (PWP) model. Additionally, we showcase the integrated CircAdapt–TL model, which now includes the heart as well as extensive arterial and venous trees with terminal impedances. We present CircAdapt–TL haemodynamics simulations of: 1) a systemic normotensive situation and 2) a systemic hypertensive situation. In the TL–PWP benchmark comparison we found good agreement regarding pressure and flow waveforms (relative errors ≤ 2.9% for pressure, and ≤ 5.6% for flow). CircAdapt–TL simulations reproduced the typically observed haemodynamic changes with hypertension, expressed by increases in mean and pulsatile blood pressures, and increased arterial pulse wave velocity. We observed a change in the timing of pressure augmentation (defined as a late-systolic boost in aortic pressure) from occurring after time of peak systolic pressure in the normotensive situation, to occurring prior to time of peak pressure in the hypertensive situation. The pressure augmentation could not be observed when the systemic circulation was lumped into a (non-linear) three-element windkessel model, instead of using our TL model. Wave intensity analysis at the carotid artery indicated earlier arrival of reflected waves with hypertension as compared to normotension, in good qualitative agreement with findings in patients. In conclusion, we successfully embedded a TL model as a vascular module into the CircAdapt platform. The integrated CircAdapt–TL model allows detailed studies on mechanistic studies on heart-vessel interaction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UNJWOrlegmc" width="1" />

Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the response of low-grade (WHO grade II) oligodendrogliomas (LGO) to temozolomide (TMZ). The model describes the longitudinal volumetric dynamics of tumor response to TMZ of a cohort of 11 LGO patients treated with TMZ. After finding patient-specific parameters, different therapeutic strategies were tried computationally on the ‘in-silico twins’ of those patients. Chemotherapy schedules with larger-than-standard rest periods between consecutive cycles had either the same or better long-term efficacy than the standard 28-day cycles. The results were confirmed in a large trial of 2000 virtual patients. These long-cycle schemes would also have reduced toxicity and defer the appearance of resistances. On the basis of those results, a combination scheme consisting of five induction TMZ cycles given monthly plus 12 maintenance cycles given every three months was found to provide substantial survival benefits for the in-silico twins of the 11 LGO patients (median 5.69 years, range: 0.67 to 68.45 years) and in a large virtual trial including 2000 patients. We used 220 sets of experiments in-silico to show that a clinical trial incorporating 100 patients per arm (standard intensive treatment versus 5 + 12 scheme) could demonstrate the superiority of the novel scheme after a follow-up period of 10 years. Thus, the proposed treatment plan could be the basis for a standardized TMZ treatment for LGO patients with survival benefits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ffiqDJUGTq4" width="1" />

As rats learn to search for multiple sources of food or water in a complex environment, they generate increasingly efficient trajectories between reward sites. Such spatial navigation capacity involves the replay of hippocampal place-cells during awake states, generating small sequences of spatially related place-cell activity that we call “snippets”. These snippets occur primarily during sharp-wave-ripples (SWRs). Here we focus on the role of such replay events, as the animal is learning a traveling salesperson task (TSP) across multiple trials. We hypothesize that snippet replay generates synthetic data that can substantially expand and restructure the experience available and make learning more optimal. We developed a model of snippet generation that is modulated by reward, propagated in the forward and reverse directions. This implements a form of spatial credit assignment for reinforcement learning. We use a biologically motivated computational framework known as ‘reservoir computing’ to model prefrontal cortex (PFC) in sequence learning, in which large pools of prewired neural elements process information dynamically through reverberations. This PFC model consolidates snippets into larger spatial sequences that may be later recalled by subsets of the original sequences. Our simulation experiments provide neurophysiological explanations for two pertinent observations related to navigation. Reward modulation allows the system to reject non-optimal segments of experienced trajectories, and reverse replay allows the system to “learn” trajectories that is has not physically experienced, both of which significantly contribute to the TSP behavior.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oY9n6BOHg48" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Although TWIK-related spinal cord K<sup>+</sup> (TRESK) channel is expressed in all primary afferent neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), whether TRESK activity regulates trigeminal pain processing is still not established. Dominant-negative TRESK mutations are associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans, suggesting that genetic TRESK dysfunction preferentially affects the generation of trigeminal pain, especially headache. Using TRESK global knockout mice as a model system, we found that loss of TRESK in all TG neurons selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter nociceptors, especially those that do not bind to isolectin B4 (IB4<sup>–</sup>). Similarly, loss of TRESK resulted in hyper-excitation of the small IB4<sup>–</sup> dural afferent neurons but not those that bind to IB4 (IB4<sup>+</sup>). Compared with wild-type littermates, both male and female TRESK knockout mice exhibited more robust trigeminal nociceptive behaviors, including headache-related behaviors; whereas their body and visceral pain responses were normal. Interestingly, neither the total persistent outward current nor the intrinsic excitability was altered in adult TRESK knockout DRG neurons, which may explain why genetic TRESK dysfunction is not associated with body and/or visceral pain in humans. We reveal for the first time that, among all primary afferent neurons, TG nociceptors are the most vulnerable to the genetic loss of TRESK. Our findings indicate that endogenous TRESK activity regulates trigeminal nociception, likely through controlling the intrinsic excitability of TG nociceptors. Importantly, we provide evidence that genetic loss of TRESK significantly increases the likelihood of developing headache.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> TRESK K<sup>+</sup> channel is expressed in all primary afferent neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but dominant-negative TRESK mutations are only associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans.

<p>The mammalian olfactory system learns rapidly from very few examples,
presented in unpredictable online sequences, and then recognizes these learned
odors under conditions of substantial interference without exhibiting
catastrophic forgetting. We have developed a brain-mimetic algorithm that
replicates these properties, provided that sensory inputs adhere to a common
statistical structure. However, in natural, unregulated environments, this
constraint cannot be assured. We here present a series of signal conditioning
steps, inspired by the mammalian olfactory system, that transform diverse
sensory inputs into a regularized statistical structure to which the learning
network can be tuned. This pre-processing enables a single instantiated network
to be applied to widely diverse classification tasks and datasets - here
including gas sensor data, remote sensing from spectral characteristics, and
multi-label hierarchical identification of wild species - without adjusting
network hyperparameters.

<p>The principles underlying the animacy organization of the ventral temporal
cortex (VTC) remain hotly debated, with recent evidence pointing to an animacy
continuum rather than a dichotomy. What drives this continuum? According to the
visual categorization hypothesis, the continuum reflects the degree to which
animals contain animal-diagnostic features. By contrast, the agency hypothesis
posits that the continuum reflects the degree to which animals are perceived as
(social) agents. Here, we tested both hypotheses with a stimulus set in which
visual categorizability and agency were dissociated based on representations in
convolutional neural networks and behavioral experiments. Using fMRI, we found
that visual categorizability and agency explained independent components of the
animacy continuum in VTC. Modeled together, they fully explained the animacy
continuum. Finally, clusters explained by visual categorizability were
localized posterior to clusters explained by agency. These results show that
multiple organizing principles, including agency, underlie the animacy
continuum in VTC.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00729">Bias Introduced by Multiple Head Coils in MRI Research: An 8 Channel and 32 Channel Coil Comparison</a></h4>

Neuroimaging MRI data in scientific research is increasingly pooled, but the reliability of such studies may be hampered by the use of different hardware elements. This might introduce bias, for example when cross-sectional studies pool data acquired with different head coils, or when longitudinal clinical studies change head coils halfway. In the present study, we aimed to estimate this possible bias introduced by using different head coils to create awareness and to avoid misinterpretation of results. We acquired, with both an 8 channel and 32 channel head coil, T1-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging and resting state fMRI images at 3T MRI (Philips Achieva) with stable acquisition parameters in a large group of cognitively healthy participants (n=77). Standard analysis methods, i.e. voxel-based morphometry, tract-based spatial statistics and resting state functional network analyses, were used in a within-subject design to compare 8 and 32 channel head coil data. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for both head coils showed similar ranges, although the 32 channel SNR profile was more homogeneous. Our data demonstrates specific patterns of grey and white matter volume differences between head coils, related to altered image contrast and therefore, altered tissue segmentation. White matter connectivity (fractional anisotropy and diffusivity measures) showed hemispherical dependent differences between head coils, and functional connectivity in resting state networks was higher using the 32 channel head coil in posterior cortical areas. This study shows that, even when acquisition protocols are harmonized, the results of standardized analysis models can be severely affected by the use of different head coils. Researchers should be aware of this when combining multiple neuroimaging MRI datasets, to prevent coil-related bias and avoid misinterpretation of their findings.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47391">Distinct subdivisions of human medial parietal cortex support recollection of people and places</a></h4>

Human medial parietal cortex (MPC) is implicated in multiple cognitive processes including memory recall, visual scene processing and navigation, and is a core component of the default mode network. Here, we demonstrate distinct subdivisions of MPC that are selectively recruited during memory recall of either specific people or places. First, distinct regions of MPC exhibited differential functional connectivity with medial and lateral regions of ventral temporal cortex (VTC). Second, these same medial regions showed selective, but negative, responses to the visual presentation of different stimulus categories, with clear preferences for scenes and faces. Finally, and most critically, these regions were differentially recruited during memory recall of either people or places with a strong familiarity advantage. Taken together, these data suggest that the organizing principle defining the medial-lateral axis of VTC is reflected in MPC, but in the context of memory recall.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46683">Critical roles of ARHGAP36 as a signal transduction mediator of Shh pathway in lateral motor columnar specification</a></h4>

During spinal cord development, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), secreted from the floor plate, plays an important role in the production of motor neurons by patterning the ventral neural tube, which establishes MN progenitor identity. It remains unknown, however, if Shh signaling plays a role in generating columnar diversity of MNs that connect distinct target muscles. Here, we report that Shh, expressed in MNs, is essential for the formation of lateral motor column (LMC) neurons in vertebrate spinal cord. This novel activity of Shh is mediated by its downstream effector ARHGAP36, whose expression is directly induced by the MN-specific transcription factor complex Isl1-Lhx3. Furthermore, we found that AKT stimulates the Shh activity to induce LMC MNs through the stabilization of ARHGAP36 proteins. Taken together, our data reveal that Shh, secreted from MNs, plays a crucial role in generating MN diversity via a regulatory axis of Shh-AKT-ARHGAP36 in the developing mouse spinal cord.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45873">Impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial pyruvate uptake rewires glucose metabolism to drive whole-body leanness</a></h4>

Metabolic cycles are a fundamental element of cellular and organismal function. Among the most critical in higher organisms is the Cori Cycle, the systemic cycling between lactate and glucose. Here, skeletal muscle-specific Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC) deletion in mice diverted pyruvate into circulating lactate. This switch disinhibited muscle fatty acid oxidation and drove Cori Cycling that contributed to increased energy expenditure. Loss of muscle MPC activity led to strikingly decreased adiposity with complete muscle mass and strength retention. Notably, despite decreasing muscle glucose oxidation, muscle MPC disruption increased muscle glucose uptake and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, chronic and acute muscle MPC deletion accelerated fat mass loss on a normal diet after high fat diet-induced obesity. Our results illuminate the role of the skeletal muscle MPC as a whole-body carbon flux control point. They highlight the potential utility of decreasing muscle pyruvate utilization to ameliorate obesity and type 2 diabetes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45374">Gender variations in citation distributions in medicine are very small and due to self-citation and journal prestige</a></h4>

A number of studies suggest that scientific papers with women in leading-author positions attract fewer citations than those with men in leading-author positions. We report the results of a matched case-control study of 1,269,542 papers in selected areas of medicine published between 2008 and 2014. We find that papers with female authors are, on average, cited between 6.5% and 12.6% less than papers with male authors. However, the standardized mean differences are very small, and the percentage overlaps between the distributions for male and female authors are extensive. Adjusting for self-citations, number of authors, international collaboration and journal prestige, we find near-identical per-paper citation impact for women and men in first and last author positions, with self-citations and journal prestige accounting for most of the small average differences. Our study demonstrates the importance of focusing greater attention to within-group variability and between-group overlap of distributions when interpreting and reporting results of gender-based comparisons of citation impact.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42299">More homogeneous capillary flow and oxygenation in deeper cortical layers correlate with increased oxygen extraction</a></h4>

Our understanding of how capillary blood flow and oxygen distribute across cortical layers to meet the local metabolic demand is incomplete. We addressed this question by using two-photon imaging of resting-state microvascular oxygen partial pressure (PO<sub>2</sub>) and flow in the whisker barrel cortex in awake mice. Our measurements in layers I-V show that the capillary red-blood-cell flux and oxygenation heterogeneity, and the intracapillary resistance to oxygen delivery, all decrease with depth, reaching a minimum around layer IV, while the depth-dependent oxygen extraction fraction is increased in layer IV, where oxygen demand is presumably the highest. Our findings suggest that more homogeneous distribution of the physiological observables relevant to oxygen transport to tissue is an important part of the microvascular network adaptation to local brain metabolism. These results will inform the biophysical models of layer-specific cerebral oxygen delivery and consumption and improve our understanding of the diseases that affect cerebral microcirculation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/703256v1?rss=1">Trace amine-associated receptor gene polymorphism increases drug craving</a></h4>

BACKGROUNDMethamphetamine (MA) is a potent agonist at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). This study evaluated a common variant (CV) in the human TAAR1 gene, synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) V288V, to determine the involvement of TAAR1 in MA dependence.nnMETHODSParticipants (n = 106) with active MA dependence (MA-ACT), in remission from MA dependence (MA-REM), with active polysubstance dependence, in remission from polysubstance dependence, and with no history of substance dependence completed neuropsychiatric symptom questionnaires and provided blood samples. In vitro expression and function of CV and wild type TAAR1 receptors were also measured.nnRESULTSThe V288V polymorphism demonstrated a 40% increase in TAAR1 protein expression in cell culture, but message sequence and protein function were unchanged, suggesting an increase in translation efficiency. Principal components analysis resolved neuropsychiatric symptoms into four components, PC1 (depression, anxiety, memory, and fatigue), PC2 (pain), PC3 (drug and alcohol craving), and PC4 (sleep disturbances). Analyses of study group and TAAR1 genotype revealed a significant interaction for PC3 (craving response) (p = 0.003). The control group showed no difference in PC3 associated with TAAR1, while adjusted mean craving for the MA-ACT and MA-REM groups, among those with at least one copy of V288V, was estimated to be, respectively, 1.55 (p = 0.036) and 1.77 (p = 0.071) times the adjusted mean craving for those without the TAAR1 SNP.nnCONCLUSIONSNeuroadaptation to chronic MA use may be altered by TAAR1 genotype and result in increased dopamine signaling and craving in individuals with the V288V genotype.

BackgroundDepression is a commonest mental disorder among prisoners characterized by an intense mood involving a feeling of sadness, lack of interest or hopelessness that lasts for weeks, months, or even longer. In addition to imprisonment, depression is the primary factor leading to suicidal attempt. Therefore, this study revealed the magnitude of depressive disorder and its associated factors among prisoners of Debre Berhan Town.nnMethodsWe conducted an institution based cross-sectional quantitative study. We collected the data from 336 randomly selected prisoners by using interviewer-administered Patient Health Questioner-9 (PHQ-9). Multiple logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors.nnResultOut of the total of 336 prisoners 330 (98%) were males. Using PHQ-9 at the cut of point &gt;5 for caseness, the prevalence of depression found to be 44% (n=148). Widowed (AOR=6.30 CI: 1.09-36.67), those who are educated at college or university level (AOR=5.34 CI:1.59-17.94), a history of suicidal attempt (AOR=2.76 CI: 1.04-7.31), Previously facing severe stressful life event (AOR=2.57 CI: 1.41-4.67), 5-10 years of sentence (AOR=2.51 CI:1.32-4.79) and having chronic medical illness (AOR= 3.32 CI: 1.26-8.75) are found to be independently associated with depression.nnConclusionIn general, there is a high prevalence of depression among prisoners in of Debre Berhan town. Therefore, designing strategies for early screening and treatment of depression at prisons is very crucial.

Modern electrophysiological recordings and optical imaging techniques have revealed a diverse spectrum of spatiotemporal neural activities underlying fundamental cognitive processing. Oscillations, traveling waves and other complex population dynamical patterns are often concomitant with sensory processing, information transfer, decision making and memory consolidation. While neural population models such as neural mass, population density and kinetic theoretical models have been used to capture a wide range of the experimentally observed dynamics, a full account of how the multi-scale dynamics emerges from the detailed biophysical properties of individual neurons and the network architecture remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed coarse-graining framework for reduced-dimensional descriptions of neuronal networks to model visual cortical dynamics. We show that, without introducing any new parameters, how a sequence of models culminating in an augmented system of spatially-coupled ODEs can effectively model a wide range of the observed cortical dynamics, ranging from visual stimulus orientation dynamics to traveling waves induced by visual illusory stimuli. In addition to an efficient simulation method, this framework also offers an analytic approach to studying large-scale network dynamics. As such, the dimensional reduction naturally leads to mesoscopic variables that capture the interplay between neuronal population stochasticity and network architecture that we believe to underlie many emergent cortical phenomena.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/703082v1?rss=1">Priors and Payoffs in Confidence Judgments</a></h4>

1Priors and payoffs are known to change perceptual decision-making, but little is understood about how they influence confidence judgments. Human observers performed an orientation-discrimination task with varied priors and payoffs. We investigated the subsequent placement of discrimination and confidence criteria by comparing behavior to several plausible Signal Detection Theory models. A normative account of behavior uses optimal discrimination criteria. Optimal confidence criteria are yoked to the accuracy-maximizing criterion (i.e., are not affected by payoffs). Additionally, in a normative account, the criterion shifts predicted for asymmetric payoffs and priors should sum when both are varied. We found that observers were conservative in discrimination-criterion placement and that criterion shifts due to priors and payoffs did not sum. For confidence judgments, observers exhibited one of two sub-optimal behaviors. One subset of observers used fixed confidence criteria independent of priors and payoffs. The other group of observers always shifted their confidence criteria with the gains-maximizing discrimination criterion. Such metacognitive mistakes about ones perceptual choices could have negative consequences outside the laboratory setting.

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy affecting brain activity. It is unclear to what extent JME leads to abnormal network dynamics across functional networks. Here, we proposed a method to characterise network dynamics in MEG resting-state data, combining a pairwise maximum entropy model (pMEM) and the associated energy landscape analysis. Fifty-two JME patients and healthy controls underwent a resting-state MEG recording session. We fitted the pMEM to the oscillatory power envelopes in theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (15-25 Hz) and gamma (30-60 Hz) bands in three source-localised resting-state networks: the frontoparietal network (FPN), the default mode network (DMN), and the sensorimotor network (SMN). The pMEM provided an accurate fit to the MEG oscillatory activity in both patient and control groups, and allowed estimation of the occurrence probability of each network state, with its regional activity and pairwise regional co-activation constrained by empirical data. We used energy values derived from the pMEM to depict an energy landscape of each network, with a higher energy state corresponding to a lower occurrence probability. When comparing the energy landscapes between groups, JME patients showed fewer local energy minima than controls and had elevated energy values for the FPN within the theta, beta and gamma-bands. Furthermore, numerical simulation of the fitted pMEM showed that the proportion of time the FPN was occupied within the basins of characteristic energy minima was shortened in JME patients. These network alterations were confirmed by a significant leave-one-out classification of individual participants based on a support vector machine employing the energy values of pMEM as features. Our findings suggested that JME patients had altered multi-stability in selective functional networks and frequency bands in the frontoparietal cortices.

Human anterior and posterior hippocampus (aHC, pHC) differ in connectivity and behavioral correlates. Here we report physiological differences. During NREM sleep, the human hippocampus generates sharpwave-ripples (SWR) similar to those which in rodents mark memory replay. We show that while pHC generates SWR, it also generates about as many spindle-ripples (SSR: ripples phase-locked to local spindles). In contrast, SSR are rare in aHC. Like SWR, SSR often co-occur with neocortical theta bursts (TB), downstates (DS), spindles (SS) and upstates (US), which coordinate cortico-hippocampal interactions and facilitate consolidation in rodents. SWR co-occur with these waves in widespread cortical areas, especially fronto-central. These waves typically occur in the sequence TB-DS-SS-US, with SWR usually occurring prior to SS-US. In contrast, SSR occur ~350 ms later, with a strong preference for co-occurrence with posterior-parietal SS. pHC-SS were strongly phase-locked with parietal-SS, and pHC-SSR were phase-coupled with pHC-SS and parietal-SS. Human SWR (and associated replay events, if any) are separated by ~5 s on average, whereas ripples on successive SSR peaks are separated by only ~80 ms. These distinctive physiological properties of pHC-SSR enable an alternative mechanism for hippocampal engagement with neocortex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 0 is the most severe form of SMA associated with the <i>SMN1</i> gene and manifesting at birth. Most patients die in the first weeks of life. In this work, we present three patients with SMA type 0 who survived longer than 1 year and presented diffuse and progressive brain abnormalities on MRI, which are not usually seen in patients with SMA. Thus, severe brain involvement may likely be the full end manifestation of an already extreme SMA phenotype caused by substantial reduction of the SMN protein in the brain.</p>

Mathematical methods of information theory appear to provide a useful language to describe how stimuli are encoded in activities of signaling effectors. Exploring the information-theoretic perspective, however, remains conceptually, experimentally and computationally challenging. Specifically, existing computational tools enable efficient analysis of relatively simple systems, usually with one input and output only. Moreover, their robust and readily applicable implementations are missing. Here, we propose a novel algorithm, SLEMI—statistical learning based estimation of mutual information, to analyze signaling systems with high-dimensional outputs and a large number of input values. Our approach is efficient in terms of computational time as well as sample size needed for accurate estimation. Analysis of the NF-<i>κ</i>B single—cell signaling responses to TNF-<i>α</i> reveals that NF-<i>κ</i>B signaling dynamics improves discrimination of high concentrations of TNF-<i>α</i> with a relatively modest impact on discrimination of low concentrations. Provided R-package allows the approach to be used by computational biologists with only elementary knowledge of information theory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7n6pSYnsSRQ" width="1" />

<p>by Stefano Recanatesi, Gabriel Koch Ocker, Michael A. Buice, Eric Shea-Brown</p>

The dimensionality of a network’s collective activity is of increasing interest in neuroscience. This is because dimensionality provides a compact measure of how coordinated network-wide activity is, in terms of the number of modes (or degrees of freedom) that it can independently explore. A low number of modes suggests a compressed low dimensional neural code and reveals interpretable dynamics [1], while findings of high dimension may suggest flexible computations [2, 3]. Here, we address the fundamental question of how dimensionality is related to connectivity, in both autonomous and stimulus-driven networks. Working with a simple spiking network model, we derive three main findings. First, the dimensionality of global activity patterns can be strongly, and systematically, regulated by local connectivity structures. Second, the dimensionality is a better indicator than average correlations in determining how constrained neural activity is. Third, stimulus evoked neural activity interacts systematically with neural connectivity patterns, leading to network responses of either greater or lesser dimensionality than the stimulus.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cuguBkjsdok" width="1" />

Abstract<p>HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain prevalent and are aggravated by µ-opioid use. We have previously shown that morphine and other µ-opioids may contribute to HAND by inhibiting the homeostatic and neuroprotective chemokine receptor CXCR4 in cortical neurons, and this novel mechanism depends on upregulation of the protein ferritin heavy chain (FHC). Here, we examined the cellular events and potential mechanisms involved in morphine-mediated FHC upregulation using rat cortical neurons of either sex in vitro and in vivo. Morphine dose-dependently increased FHC protein levels in primary neurons through µ-opioid receptor (µOR) and Gαi-protein signaling. Cytoplasmic FHC levels were significantly elevated, but nuclear FHC levels and FHC gene expression were unchanged. Morphine-treated rats also displayed increased FHC levels in layer 2/3 neurons of the prefrontal cortex. Importantly, both in vitro and in vivo FHC upregulation was accompanied by loss of mature dendritic spines, which was also dependent on µOR and Gαi-protein signaling. Moreover, morphine upregulated ferritin light chain (FLC), a component of the ferritin iron storage complex, suggesting that morphine altered neuronal iron metabolism. Indeed, prior to FHC upregulation, morphine increased cytoplasmic labile iron levels as a function of decreased endolysosomal iron. In line with this, chelation of endolysosomal iron (but not extracellular iron) blocked morphine-induced FHC upregulation and dendritic spine reduction, whereas iron overloading mimicked the effect of morphine on FHC and dendritic spines. Overall, these data demonstrate that iron mediates morphine-induced FHC upregulation and consequent dendritic spine deficits and implicate endolysosomal iron efflux to the cytoplasm in these effects.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Clinical studies suggest that opioid use exacerbates HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but the mechanisms by which opioids contribute to HAND are not completely understood. This work demonstrates that morphine reduces the density of mature dendritic spines of cortical neurons through a novel mechanism involving neuronal iron metabolism. We showed that morphine induces efflux of endolysosomal iron to the cytoplasm, resulting in a post-transcriptional upregulation of ferritin heavy chain (FHC). FHC upregulation inhibits the homeostatic and neuroprotective CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis, producing dendritic spine deficits. Importantly, morphine’s actions on FHC and dendritic spines are blocked by chelation of endolysosomal iron, suggesting that endolysosomal iron stores are key components of dendritic injury in opioid using HAND patients.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Magnocellular neuroendocrine cells of the hypothalamus play a critical role in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. They undergo a dramatic structural and functional plasticity under sustained hyperosmotic conditions, including an increase in afferent glutamatergic synaptic innervation. We tested for a postulated increase in glutamate AMPA receptor expression and signaling in magnocellular neurons of the male rat hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) induced by chronic salt loading. While without effect on GluA1-4 subunit mRNA, salt loading with 2% saline for 5-7 days resulted in a selective increase in AMPA receptor GluA1 protein expression in the SON, with no change in GluA2-4 protein expression, suggesting an increase in the ratio of GluA1 to GluA2 subunits. Salt loading induced a corresponding increase in excitatory postsynaptic currents in both oxytocin and vasopressin neurons, with properties characteristic of calcium-permeable AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Unexpectedly, the emergent AMPA synaptic currents were silenced by blocking protein synthesis and mTOR activity in the slices, suggesting that the new glutamate synapses induced by salt loading require continuous dendritic protein synthesis for maintenance. These findings indicate that chronic salt loading leads to the induction of highly labile glutamate synapses in oxytocin and vasopressin neurons that are comprised of calcium-permeable homomeric GluA1 AMPA receptors. The glutamate-induced calcium influx via calcium-permeable AMPA receptors would be expected to play a key role in the induction and/or maintenance of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that occurs in the magnocellular neurons during chronic osmotic stimulation.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Oxytocin- and vasopressin-secreting neurons of the hypothalamus undergo robust synaptic plasticity during chronic osmotic stimulation, including an increase in excitatory synapses. Here, we show that chronic salt loading results in the emergence of calcium-permeable AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in oxytocin and vasopressin neurons by inducing an increase in GluA1 AMPA receptor subunits without a coordinate increase in GluA2 subunits. The salt loading-induced calcium-permeable AMPA currents were rapidly silenced by inhibiting protein synthesis and mTOR activity, suggesting that continuous dendritic protein synthesis is required to functionally maintain the new AMPA synapses. Calcium influx through calcium-permeable AMPA receptors should play a key role in the induction and/or maintenance of synaptic plasticity in oxytocin and vasopressin neurons by chronic osmotic stimulation.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The neural mechanisms responsible for the initiation and expression of migraines remain unknown. Though there is growing evidence of changes in brainstem anatomy and function between attacks, very little is known about brainstem function and structure in the period immediately prior to a migraine. The aim of this investigation is to use brainstem-specific analyses of diffusion weighted images to determine if the brainstem pain processing regions display altered structure in individuals with migraine across the migraine cycle, and in particular immediately prior to a migraine. Diffusion tensor images (29 controls, 36 migraineurs) were used to assess brainstem anatomy in migraineurs compared with controls. We found that during the interictal phase, migraineurs displayed greater mean diffusivity in the region of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsomedial/dorsolateral pons and midbrain periaqueductal gray matter/cuneiform nucleus. Remarkably, the mean diffusivity returned to controls levels during the 24-hour period immediately prior to a migraine, only to increase again within the three following days. Additionally, fractional anisotropy was significantly elevated in the region of the medial lemniscus/ventral trigeminal thalamic tract in migraineurs compared with controls over the entire migraine cycle. These data show that regional brainstem anatomy changes over the migraine cycle, with specific anatomical changes occurring in the 24 hours prior to onset. These changes may contribute to the activation of the ascending trigeminal pathway by either an increase in basal traffic or by sensitising the trigeminal nuclei to external triggers, with activation ultimately resulting in perception of head pain during a migraine attack.</p><p><b>SIGNIFIANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been hypothesised that modulation of brainstem pain pathways may be critical for the initiation of migraine attacks. There is some evidence that altered brainstem function, possibly involving increased astrocyte activation, occurs immediately prior to a migraine attack. We sought to obtain evidence to support this theory. Using diffusion tensor imaging, we found that immediately prior to a migraine, mean diffusivity decreased in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsomedial/dorsolateral pons and midbrain periaqueductal gray matter/nucleus cuneiform. Mean diffusivity then increased again immediately following the migraine attack. Decreased mean diffusivity before a migraine is consistent with increased astrocyte activation, since astrocyte processes enlarge during activation. These changes may underlie changes in brainstem function that are essential for the generation of a migraine.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as focal neurological deficit caused by ischemia resolving within 24 hrs. In a secondary analysis of a large monocentric cohort of 446 TIA patients, we explored the frequency and determinants of DWI lesions on high‐resolution MRI. Overall, 240 (54%) of all TIA patients presented with DWI lesions. These patients had higher NIHSS and ABCD2 scores and presented more frequently with vessel occlusion and perfusion deficits, but had similar functional outcome at 3 months. Taken together high‐resolution DWI provides evidence of ischemic brain injury in the majority of TIA patients.</p>

<p>Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) starts in early childhood with loss of visual acuity and color vision deficits. <i>OPA1</i> mutations are responsible for the majority of cases, but in a proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of ADOA, the cause remains unknown. This study aimed to identify novel ADOA‐associated genes and explore their causality.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Linkage analysis and sequencing were performed in multi‐generation families and unrelated patients to identify disease‐causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated <i>in silico</i> and confirmed experimentally using the zebrafish model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We defined a new ADOA locus on 7q33‐q35 and identified three different missense variants in <i>SSBP1</i> (NM_001256510.1; c.113G&gt;A (p.(Arg38Gln)), c.320G&gt;A (p.(Arg107Gln)) and c.422G&gt;A (p.(Ser141Asn))) in affected individuals from two families and two singletons with ADOA and variable retinal degeneration. The mutated arginine residues are part of a basic patch that is essential for single‐strand DNA binding. The loss of a positive charge at these positions is very likely to lower the affinity of SSBP1 to ssDNA. Antisense‐mediated knockdown of endogenous <i>ssbp1</i> mRNA in zebrafish resulted in compromised differentiation of retinal ganglion cells. A similar effect was achieved when mutated mRNAs were administered. These findings point to an essential role of <i>ssbp1</i> in retinal development and the dominant‐negative nature of the identified human variants, which is consistent with the segregation pattern observed in two multi‐generation families studied.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SSBP1 is an essential protein for mtDNA replication and maintenance. Our data established pathogenic variants in <i>SSBP1</i> as a cause of ADOA and variable retinal degeneration.</p>

<p>We present cortical surface parcellation using spherical deep convolutional
neural networks. Traditional multi-atlas cortical surface parcellation requires
inter-subject surface registration using geometric features with high
processing time on a single subject (2-3 hours). Moreover, even optimal surface
registration does not necessarily produce optimal cortical parcellation as
parcel boundaries are not fully matched to the geometric features. In this
context, a choice of training features is important for accurate cortical
parcellation. To utilize the networks efficiently, we propose cortical
parcellation-specific input data from an irregular and complicated structure of
cortical surfaces. To this end, we align ground-truth cortical parcel
boundaries and use their resulting deformation fields to generate new pairs of
deformed geometric features and parcellation maps. To extend the capability of
the networks, we then smoothly morph cortical geometric features and
parcellation maps using the intermediate deformation fields. We validate our
method on 427 adult brains for 49 labels. The experimental results show that
our method out-performs traditional multi-atlas and naive spherical U-Net
approaches, while achieving full cortical parcellation in less than a minute.

<p>Jellyfish nerve nets provide insight into the origins of nervous systems, as
both their taxonomic position and their evolutionary age imply that jellyfish
resemble some of the earliest neuron-bearing, actively-swimming animals. Here
we develop the first neuronal network model for the nerve nets of jellyfish.
Specifically, we focus on the moon jelly Aurelia aurita and the control of its
energy-efficient swimming motion. The proposed single neuron model disentangles
the contributions of different currents to a spike. The network model
identifies factors ensuring non-pathological activity and suggests an
optimization for the transmission of signals. After modeling the jellyfish's
muscle system and its bell in a hydrodynamic environment, we explore the
swimming elicited by neural activity. We find that different delays between
nerve net activations lead to well-controlled, differently directed movements.
Our model bridges the scales from single neurons to behavior, allowing for a
comprehensive understanding of jellyfish neural control.

The development of two-photon microscopy has revolutionized our understanding of how synapses are formed and how they transform synaptic inputs in dendritic spines – tiny protrusions that cover the dendrites of pyramidal neurons that receive most excitatory synaptic information in the brain. These discoveries have led us to better comprehend the neuronal computations that take place at the level of dendritic spines as well as within neuronal circuits with unprecedented resolution. Here we describe a method that uses a two-photon (2P) microscope and 2P uncaging of caged neurotransmitters for the activation of single and multiple spines in the dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, we propose a cost-effective description of the components necessary for the construction of a one laser source-2P microscope capable of nearly simultaneous 2P uncaging of neurotransmitters and 2P calcium imaging of the activated spines and nearby dendrites. We provide a brief overview on how the use of these techniques have helped researchers in the last 15 years unravel the function of spines in a) information processing, b) storage and c) integration of excitatory synaptic inputs.

Introduction: In-vivo quantification of the serotonin transporter (SERT) guided our understanding of many neuropsychiatric disorders. A recently introduced bolus plus constant infusion protocol has been shown to allow the reliable determination of SERT binding with reduced scan time. In this work, the outcomes of two methods, a bolus injection paradigm on a GE PET camera and a bolus plus infusion paradigm on a combined Siemens PET/MR camera were compared.
Methods: 7 healthy subjects underwent paired PET and paired PET/MR scans each with intravenous double-blind application of 7.5 mg citalopram or saline in a randomized cross-over study design. While PET scans were performed according to standard protocols and nondisplaceable binding potentials (BPND) were calculated using the multi-linear reference tissue model, during PET/MR measurements [11C]DASB was applied as bolus plus constant infusion and BPND was calculated using the steady state method and data acquired at tracer equilibrium. Occupancies were calculated as the relative decrease in BPND between saline and citalopram scans. 
Results:  During placebo scans, a mean difference in BPND of -0.08 (-11.71%) across all ROIs was found between methods. PET/MR scans resulted in higher BPND estimates than PET scans in all ROIs except the midbrain. A mean difference of -0.19 (-109.40%) across all ROIs between methods was observed for citalopram scans. PET/MR scans resulted in higher BPND estimates than PET scans in all ROIs. For occupancy, a mean difference of 23.12% (21.91%) was observed across all ROIs. PET/MR scans resulted in lower occupancy compared to PET scans in all ROIs except the temporal cortex. While for placebo, BPND of high-binding regions (thalamus and striatum) exhibited moderate reliability (ICC=0.66), during citalopram scans ICC decreased (0.36-0.46). However, reliability for occupancy remained high (0.57-0.82). 
Conclusion: Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of reliable and non-invasive SERT quantification using a [11C]DASB bolus plus constant infusion protocol at a hybrid PET/MR scanner, which might facilitate future pharmacological imaging studies. Highest agreement with established methods for quantification of occupancy and SERT binding potentials at baseline was observed in subcortical high-binding regions.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable and progressively fatal neurodegenerative disease that manifests with distinct clinical phenotypes, which are seen in neuroimaging and clinical studies. T2- and proton density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displays hyperintense signal along the corticospinal tract (CST) in some ALS patients with upper motor neuron (UMN)-predominant signs. These patients tend to be younger and have signiﬁcantly faster disease progression. We hypothesize that such ALS patients with CST hyperintensity (ALS-CST+) comprise a clinical subtype distinct from other ALS subtypes, namely patients with UMN-predominant ALS without CST hyperintensity, classic ALS, and ALS with frontotemporal dementia. Novel approaches such as fractal dimension analysis on conventional MRI (cMRI) and advanced MR techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging reveal significant differences between ALS-CST+ and the aforementioned ALS subtypes. Our unbiased neuroimaging studies demonstrate that the ALS-CST+ group, which can be initially identified by T2-, PD-, and FLAIR-weighted cMRI, is distinctive and distinguishable from other ALS subtypes with possible differences in disease pathogenesis.

During speech perception listeners rely on multimodal input and make use of both auditory and visual information. When presented with speech, for example syllables, the differences in brain responses to distinct stimuli are not, however, caused merely by the acoustic or visual features of the stimuli. The congruency of the auditory and visual information and the familiarity of a syllable, that is, whether it appears in the listener’s native language or not, also modulates brain responses. We investigated how the congruency and familiarity of the presented stimuli affect brain responses to audio-visual (AV) speech in 12 adult Finnish native speakers and 12 adult Chinese native speakers. They watched videos of a Chinese speaker pronouncing syllables (/pa/, /pha/, /ta/, /tha/, /fa/) during a magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurement where only /pa/ and /ta/ were part of Finnish phonology while all the stimuli were part of Chinese phonology. The stimuli were presented in audio-visual (congruent or incongruent), audio only, or visual only conditions. The brain responses were examined in five time-windows: 75–125 ms, 150–200 ms, 200–300 ms, 300–400 ms and 400–600 ms. We found significant differences for the congruency comparison in the fourth time-window (300–400 ms) in both sensor and source level analysis. Larger responses were observed for the incongruent stimuli than for the congruent stimuli. For the familiarity comparisons no significant differences were found. The results are in line with earlier studies reporting modulation of brain responses for audio-visual congruency around 250–500 ms. This suggests a much stronger process for the general detection of mismatch between predictions based on lip movements and the auditory signal than for the top-down modulation of brain responses based on phonological information.

The idea that intelligence is embedded not only in a single brain network, but instead in a complex, well-optimized system of complementary networks, has led to the development of whole brain network analysis. Using graph theory to analyze resting-state functional MRI data, we investigated the brain graph networks (or brain networks) of high intelligence quotient (HIQ) children. To this end, we computed the “hub disruption index κ”, an index sensitive to graph network modifications. We found significant topological differences in the integration and segregation properties of brain networks in HIQ compared to standard IQ children, not only for the whole brain graph, but also for each hemispheric graph, and for the homotopic connectivity. Moreover, two profiles of HIQ children, homogenous and heterogeneous, based on the differences between the two main IQ subscales (verbal comprehension index (VCI) and perceptual reasoning index (PRI)), were compared. Brain networks changes were more pronounced in the heterogeneous HIQ than in the homogeneous HIQ subgroups. Finally, we found significant correlations between the graph networks’ changes and the full-scale IQ (FSIQ), as well as the subscales VCI and PRI. Specifically, the higher the FSIQ the greater was the brain organization modification in the whole brain, the left hemisphere, and the homotopic connectivity. These results shed new light on the relation between functional connectivity topology and high intelligence, as well as on different intelligence profiles.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00234">Binocular Summation and Suppression of Contrast Sensitivity in Strabismus, Fusion and Amblyopia</a></h4>

Purpose: Amblyopia and strabismus affect 2-5% of the population and cause a broad range of visual deficits. The response to treatment is generally assessed using visual acuity, which is relatively insensitive to binocular vision gains and may therefore underestimate binocular vision deficits in these patients. The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) generally takes longer to assess than visual acuity, but it is better correlated with improvement in a range of visual tasks and, notably, with improvements in binocular vision. The present study aims to assess monocular and binocular CSFs in amblyopia and strabismus patients.

Methods: Both monocular CSFs and the binocular CSF were assessed for subjects with amblyopia (n=11), strabismus without amblyopia (n=20), and normally sighted controls (n=24) using a tablet-based implementation of the quick CSF, which can assess a full CSF in &lt;3 minutes. Binocular summation was evaluated against a baseline model of simple probability summation.

Results: The CSF of amblyopic eyes was impaired at mid-to-high spatial frequencies compared to fellow eyes, strabismic eyes without amblyopia, and control eyes. Binocular contrast summation exceeded probability summation in controls, but not in subjects with amblyopia (with or without strabismus) or strabismus without amblyopia who were able to fuse at the test distance. Binocular summation was less than probability summation in strabismic subjects who were unable to fuse.

Conclusions: We conclude that monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity deficits define important characteristics of amblyopia and strabismus that are not captured by visual acuity alone and can be measured efficiently using the quick CSF.

Magnetic resonance images of brain tumors are routinely used in neuro-oncology clinics for diagnosis, treatment planning and post-treatment tumor surveillance. Currently, physicians spend considerable time manually delineating different structures of the brain. Spatial and structural variations, as well as intensity inhomogeneity across images, make the problem of computer- assisted segmentation very challenging. We propose a new image segmentation framework for tumor delineation that benefits from two state-of-the-art machine learning architectures in computer vision, i.e., Inception modules and U-Net image segmentation architecture. Furthermore, our framework includes two learning regimes, i.e., learning to segment intra-tumoral structures (necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core, peritumoral edema, and enhancing tumor) or learning to segment glioma sub-regions (whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor). These learning regimes are incorporated into a newly proposed loss function which is based on the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). In our experiments, we quantified the impact of introducing the Inception modules in the U-Net architecture, as well as, changing the objective function for the learning algorithm from segmenting the intra-tumoral structures to glioma sub-regions. We found that incorporating Inception modules significantly improved the segmentation performance (p &lt; 0.001) for all glioma sub-regions. Moreover, in architectures with Inception modules, the models trained with the learning objective of segmenting the intra-tumoral structures outperformed the models trained with the objective of segmenting the glioma sub-regions for the whole tumor (p &lt; 0.001). The improved performance is linked to multiscale features extracted by newly introduced Inception module and the modified loss function based on the DSC.

The presubiculum plays a key role in processing and integrating spatial and head-directional information. Layer III neurons of the presubiculum provide strong projections to the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex in the rat. Our previous study revealed that the terminal distribution of efferents from layer III cells of the presubiculum was organized in a band-like fashion within the medial entorhinal cortex, and the transverse axis of these zones ran parallel to the rhinal fissure. Identifying axonal branching patterns of layer III neurons of the presubiculum is important to further elucidate the functional roles of the presubiculum. In the present study, we visualized all axonal processes and terminal distributions of single presubicular layer III neurons in the rat, using in vivo injection of a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted palmitoylation site-attached green fluorescent protein. We found that layer III of the rat presubiculum comprised multiple types of neurons (n=12) with characteristic patterns of axonal collateralization, including cortical projection neurons (n=6) and several types of intrinsic connectional neurons (n=6). Two of six cortical projection neurons provided two or three major axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and formed elaborate terminal arbors within the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. The width and axis of the area of their terminal distribution resembled that of the band-like terminal field seen in our massive-scale observation. Two of the other four cortical projection neurons gave off axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and also to the subiculum, and each of the other two neurons sent axons to the subiculum or parasubiculum. Patterns of axonal arborization of six intrinsic connectional neurons were distinct from each other, with four neurons sending many axonal branches to both superficial and deep layers of the presubiculum and the other two neurons showing sparse axonal branches with terminations confined to layers III-V of the presubiculum. These data demonstrate that layer III of the rat presubiculum consists of multiple types of cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and also suggest that inputs from a single presubicular layer III neuron can directly affect a band-like zone of the medial entorhinal cortex.

The role of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been well studied. However, the normal function of APP in the nervous system is poorly understood. Here, we characterized the role of the Drosophila homologue (APPL) in the adult giant fiber (GF) neurons. We find that endogenous APPL is transported from the synapse to the soma in the adult. Live-imaging revealed that retrograde moving APPL vesicles co-traffic with L1-type cell adhesion molecule Neuroglian (Nrg). In APPL null mutants, stationary Nrg vesicles were increased along the axon, and the number of Nrg vesicles moving in retrograde but not anterograde direction was reduced. In contrast, trafficking of endo-lysosomal vesicles, which did not co-localize with APPL in GF axons, was not affected. This suggests that APPL loss of function does not generally disrupt axonal transport but that APPL has a selective role in the effectiveness of retrograde transport of proteins it co-traffics with. While the GF terminals of APPL loss of function animals exhibited pruning defects, APPL gain of function had no disruptive effect on GF morphology and function, or on retrograde axonal transport of Nrg. However, cell-autonomous developmental expression of a secretion-deficient form of APPL (APPL-SD), lacking the α-, β- and, -secretase cleavage sites, resulted in progressive retraction of the GF terminals. Conditional expression of APPL-SD in mature GFs caused accumulation of Nrg in normal sized synaptic terminals, which was associated with severely reduced retrograde flux of Nrg labeled vesicles in the axons. Albeit β-secretase null mutants developed GF terminals they also exhibited Nrg accumulations. This suggests that cleavage defective APPL has a toxic effect on retrograde trafficking and that β-secretase cleavage has a function in Nrg sorting in endosomal compartments at the synapse. In summary, our results suggest a role for APPL and its proteolytic cleavage sites in retrograde trafficking, thus our findings are of relevance to the understanding of the endogenous role of APP as well as to the development of therapeutic treatments of Alzheimer’s disease.

Aging is a multifactorial phenomenon that results in several changes at cellular and molecular levels and is considered the main risk factor for some neurodegenerative diseases. Several evidences show the participation of the kallikrein-kinin system in neurodegeneration and this system has been associated with inflammation and immunogenic responses in the central and peripheral systems by the activation of the B1 and B2 receptors. Previous work by our group showed that bradykinin and the B2 receptor played a possible role in neuroprotection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the participation of B2 receptors in cell viability, neuroinflammatory response and neuroplasticity in organotypic hippocampal cultures of 6 and 12 month old mice. It was observed that activation of the B2 receptor by bradykinin decreased the inflammatory response and increased plasticity in 12 months old slices. Conversely, there was an increase in the inflammatory response and a decrease in neural plasticity in the six-months old slices. In both ages an increase in cell viability was observed. This data suggests that the function of the kinin B2 receptor in the hippocampus is modulated by age, providing neuroprotective action in old age.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48214">The perception and misperception of optical defocus, shading, and shape</a></h4>

The human visual system is tasked with recovering the different physical sources of optical structure that generate our retinal images. Separate research has focused on understanding how the visual system estimates (a) environmental sources of image structure and (b) blur induced by the eye's limited focal range, but little is known about how the visual system distinguishes environmental sources from optical defocus. Here, we present evidence that this is a fundamental perceptual problem and provide insights into how and when the visual system succeeds and fails in solving it. We show that fully focused surface shading can be misperceived as defocused and that optical blur can be misattributed to the material properties and shape of surfaces. We further reveal how these misperceptions depend on the relationship between shading gradients and sharp contours, and conclude that computations of blur are inherently linked to computations of surface shape, material, and illumination.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47395"><i>N</i>-chlorination mediates protective and immunomodulatory effects of oxidized human plasma proteins</a></h4>

Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a powerful antimicrobial oxidant, is produced by neutrophils to fight infections. Here we show that <i>N</i>-chlorination, induced by HOCl concentrations encountered at sites of inflammation, converts blood plasma proteins into chaperone-like holdases that protect other proteins from aggregation. This chaperone-like conversion was reversible by antioxidants and was abrogated by prior methylation of basic amino acids. Furthermore, reversible <i>N</i>-chlorination of basic amino acid side chains is the major factor that converts plasma proteins into efficient activators of immune cells. Finally, HOCl-modified serum albumin was found to act as a pro-survival molecule that protects neutrophils from cell death induced by highly immunogenic foreign antigens. We propose that activation and enhanced persistence of neutrophils mediated by HOCl-modified plasma proteins, resulting in the increased and prolonged generation of ROS, including HOCl, constitutes a potentially detrimental positive feedback loop that can only be attenuated through the reversible nature of the modification involved.

Individual malaria infections can carry multiple strains of Plasmodium falciparum with varying levels of relatedness. Yet, how local epidemiology affects the properties of such mixed infections remains unclear. Here, we develop an enhanced method for strain deconvolution from genome sequencing data, which estimates the number of strains, their proportions, identity-by-descent (IBD) profiles and individual haplotypes. Applying it to the Pf3k data set, we find that the rate of mixed infection varies from 29% to 63% across countries and that 51% of mixed infections involve more than two strains. Furthermore, we estimate that 47% of symptomatic dual infections contain sibling strains likely to have been co-transmitted from a single mosquito, and find evidence of mixed infections propagated over successive infection cycles. Finally, leveraging data from the Malaria Atlas Project, we find that prevalence correlates within Africa, but not Asia, with both the rate of mixed infection and the level of IBD.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>It is well established that motor impairment often occurs alongside healthy aging, leading to problems with fine motor skills and coordination. Although previously thought to be caused by neuronal death accumulating across the lifespan, it is now believed that the source of this impairment instead stems from more subtle changes in neural connectivity. The dendritic spine is a prime target for exploration of this problem because it is the postsynaptic partner of most excitatory synapses received by the pyramidal neuron, a cortical cell that carries much of the information processing load in the cerebral cortex. We repeatedly imaged the same dendrites in young adult and aged mouse motor cortex over the course of 1 month to look for differences in the baseline state of the dendritic spine population. These experiments reveal increased dendritic spine density, without obvious changes in spine clustering, occurring at the aged dendrite. Additionally, aged dendrites exhibit elevated spine turnover and stabilization alongside decreased long-term spine survival. These results suggest that at baseline the aged motor cortex may exist in a perpetual state of relative instability and attempts at compensation. This phenotype of aging may provide clues for future targets of aging-related motor impairment remediation.</span>

<p>by Annett Erkes, Stefanie Mücke, Maik Reschke, Jens Boch, Jan Grau</p>

Plant-pathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> bacteria secrete transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) into host cells, where they act as transcriptional activators on plant target genes to support bacterial virulence. TALEs have a unique modular DNA-binding domain composed of tandem repeats. Two amino acids within each tandem repeat, termed repeat-variable diresidues, bind to contiguous nucleotides on the DNA sequence and determine target specificity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for TALE target prediction to identify potential virulence targets. Our approach accounts for recent findings concerning TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths, and the flexible strand orientation of target boxes relative to the transcription start of the downstream target gene. The computational model can account for dependencies between adjacent RVD positions. Model parameters are learned from the wealth of quantitative data that have been generated over the last years. We benchmark the novel approach, termed PrediTALE, using RNA-seq data after <i>Xanthomonas</i> infection in rice, and find an overall improvement of prediction performance compared with previous approaches. Using PrediTALE, we are able to predict several novel putative virulence targets. However, we also observe that no target genes are predicted by any prediction tool for several TALEs, which we term orphan TALEs for this reason. We postulate that one explanation for orphan TALEs are incomplete gene annotations and, hence, propose to replace promoterome-wide by genome-wide scans for target boxes. We demonstrate that known targets from promoterome-wide scans may be recovered by genome-wide scans, whereas the latter, combined with RNA-seq data, are able to detect putative targets independent of existing gene annotations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zalOH3GnNWw" width="1" />

<p>by Emma D. Wilson, Sean R. Anderson, Paul Dean, John Porrill</p>

Substantial experimental evidence suggests the cerebellum is involved in calibrating sensorimotor maps. Consistent with this involvement is the well-known, but little understood, massive cerebellar projection to maps in the superior colliculus. Map calibration would be a significant new role for the cerebellum given the ubiquity of map representations in the brain, but how it could perform such a task is unclear. Here we investigated a dynamic method for map calibration, based on electrophysiological recordings from the superior colliculus, that used a standard adaptive-filter cerebellar model. The method proved effective for complex distortions of both unimodal and bimodal maps, and also for predictive map-based tracking of moving targets. These results provide the first computational evidence for a novel role for the cerebellum in dynamic sensorimotor map calibration, of potential importance for coordinate alignment during ongoing motor control, and for map calibration in future biomimetic systems. This computational evidence also provides testable experimental predictions concerning the role of the connections between cerebellum and superior colliculus in previously observed dynamic coordinate transformations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f7heAWtqEn8" width="1" />

<p>by Jennifer Crodelle, Sofia H. Piltz, Megan Hastings Hagenauer, Victoria Booth</p>

Experimental studies show that human pain sensitivity varies across the 24-hour day, with the lowest sensitivity usually occurring during the afternoon. Patients suffering from neuropathic pain, or nerve damage, experience an inversion in the daily modulation of pain sensitivity, with the highest sensitivity usually occurring during the early afternoon. Processing of painful stimulation occurs in the dorsal horn (DH), an area of the spinal cord that receives input from peripheral tissues via several types of primary afferent nerve fibers. The DH circuit is composed of different populations of neurons, including excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, and projection neurons, which constitute the majority of the output from the DH to the brain. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of the dorsal horn neural circuit to investigate mechanisms for the daily modulation of pain sensitivity. The model describes average firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations and projection neurons, whose activity is directly correlated with experienced pain. Response in afferent fibers to peripheral stimulation is simulated by a Poisson process generating nerve fiber spike trains at variable firing rates. Model parameters for fiber response to stimulation and the excitability properties of neuronal populations are constrained by experimental results found in the literature, leading to qualitative agreement between modeled responses to pain and experimental observations. We validate our model by reproducing the wind-up of pain response to repeated stimulation. We apply the model to investigate daily modulatory effects on pain inhibition, in which response to painful stimuli is reduced by subsequent non-painful stimuli. Finally, we use the model to propose a mechanism for the observed inversion of the daily rhythmicity of pain sensation under neuropathic pain conditions. Underlying mechanisms for the shift in rhythmicity have not been identified experimentally, but our model results predict that experimentally-observed dysregulation of inhibition within the DH neural circuit may be responsible. The model provides an accessible, biophysical framework that will be valuable for experimental and clinical investigations of diverse physiological processes modulating pain processing in humans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/66XoGNgHN1w" width="1" />

<p>by Tsuyoshi Mikkaichi, Michael R. Yeaman, Alexander Hoffmann, MRSA Systems Immunobiology Group </p>

Persistent bacteremia caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (SA), especially methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA), is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite susceptibility phenotypes <i>in vitro</i>, persistent MRSA strains fail to clear with appropriate anti-MRSA therapy during bacteremia <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, identifying the factors that cause such MRSA persistence is of direct and urgent clinical relevance. To address the dynamics of MRSA persistence in the face of host immunity and typical antibiotic regimens, we developed a mathematical model based on the overarching assumption that phenotypic heterogeneity is a hallmark of MRSA persistence. First, we applied an ensemble modeling approach and obtained parameter sets that satisfied the condition of a minimum inoculum dose to establish infection. Second, by simulating with the selected parameter sets under vancomycin therapy which follows clinical practices, we distinguished the models resulting in resolving or persistent bacteremia, based on the total SA exceeding a detection limit after five days of treatment. Third, to find key determinants that discriminate resolving and persistent bacteremia, we applied a machine learning approach and found that the immune clearance rate of persister cells is a key feature. But, fourth, when relapsing bacteremia was considered, the growth rate of persister cells was also found to be a key feature. Finally, we explored pharmacological strategies for persistent and relapsing bacteremia and found that a persister killer, but not a persister formation inhibitor, could provide for an effective cure the persistent bacteremia. Thus, to develop better clinical solutions for MRSA persistence and relapse, our modeling results indicate that we need to better understand the pathogen-host interactions of persister MRSAs <i>in vivo</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aVMsQDX9bf4" width="1" />

<p>by Guido Zampieri, Supreeta Vijayakumar, Elisabeth Yaneske, Claudio Angione</p>

Omic data analysis is steadily growing as a driver of basic and applied molecular biology research. Core to the interpretation of complex and heterogeneous biological phenotypes are computational approaches in the fields of statistics and machine learning. In parallel, constraint-based metabolic modeling has established itself as the main tool to investigate large-scale relationships between genotype, phenotype, and environment. The development and application of these methodological frameworks have occurred independently for the most part, whereas the potential of their integration for biological, biomedical, and biotechnological research is less known. Here, we describe how machine learning and constraint-based modeling can be combined, reviewing recent works at the intersection of both domains and discussing the mathematical and practical aspects involved. We overlap systematic classifications from both frameworks, making them accessible to nonexperts. Finally, we delineate potential future scenarios, propose new joint theoretical frameworks, and suggest concrete points of investigation for this joint subfield. A multiview approach merging experimental and knowledge-driven omic data through machine learning methods can incorporate key mechanistic information in an otherwise biologically-agnostic learning process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WSLW814PUw0" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Brain computations involve multiple processes by which sensory information is encoded and transformed to drive behavior. These computations are thought to be mediated by dynamic interactions between populations of neurons. Here, we demonstrate that human brains exhibit a reliable sequence of neural interactions during speech production. We use an autoregressive Hidden Markov Model (ARHMM) to identify dynamical network states exhibited by electrocorticographic signals recorded from human neurosurgical patients. Our method resolves dynamic latent network states on a trial-by-trial basis. We characterize individual network states according to the patterns of directional information flow between cortical regions of interest. These network states occur consistently and in a specific, interpretable sequence across trials and subjects: the data support the hypothesis of a fixed-length visual processing state, followed by a variable-length language state, and then by a terminal articulation state. This empirical evidence validates classical psycholinguistic theories that have posited such intermediate states during speaking. It further reveals these state dynamics are not localized to one brain area or one sequence of areas, but are instead a network phenomenon.</p>

Abstract<p>Grasping is an action engraved in the human genome, enabling newborn infants to hang from a monkey-bar immediately after birth. The grasp force provides rich information about the brain’s control of arm movements. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the grasp force increases to improve the hand’s movement precision during reaching. In two reaching experiments, subjects increased grasp force to suppress movement imprecision that arose from both self-generated motor noise and from an unpredictable environment. Furthermore, the grasp force did not increase constantly, but increased specifically along the movement where the hand’s deviation was greatest. The increased grasp was premeditated and wasn’t a reaction to environmental forces, suggesting that the central nervous system has a predictive, state-dependent model of movement precision during reaching. The grasp force provides a high temporal resolution and calibration-less estimate of movement precision adaptation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Humans use their hands on a daily basis to interact with the environment. Many tasks require the hand’s movement to be precise. Standard measures of movement precision resort to measuring the stiffness of the arm, which is notoriously difficult to measure during motion. We show that the power grasp force is correlated with movement precision, and that it provides a real-time measure of movement precision adaptation. Furthermore, the grasp force measure reveals that the brain has a state-dependent adaptation of movement precision, such that it increased grasped force in locations where the hand’s deviation was greatest.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>Quantification of gait with wearable technology is promising; recent cross‐sectional studies showed that gait characteristics are potential prodromal markers for Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this longitudinal prospective observational study was to establish gait impairments and trajectories in the prodromal phase of PD, identifying which gait characteristics are potentially early diagnostic markers of PD.</p>


<h2>METHODS</h2>
<p>696 healthy controls (HC, 63±7 years) recruited in the TREND study were included. Assessments were performed longitudinally four times at 2‐year intervals and people who converted to PD identified. Participants were asked to walk at different speed under single and dual‐tasking, with a wearable placed on the lower back; fourteen validated clinically relevant gait characteristics were quantified. Cox regression was used to examine whether gait at first visit could predict time to PD conversion after controlling for age and sex. Random effects linear mixed‐models (RELMs) were used to establish longitudinal trajectories of gait and model the latency between impaired gait and PD diagnosis.</p>


<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>Sixteen participants were diagnosed with PD on average 4.5 years after first visit (converters, PDC). Higher step time variability and asymmetry of all gait characteristics were associated with a shorter time to PD diagnosis. RELMs indicated gait (lower pace) deviates from non‐PDC approximately four years prior to diagnosis.</p>


<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>Together with other prodromal markers, quantitative gait characteristics can play an important role to identify prodromal PD and progression within this phase.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postoperative resting state functional MRI in children with intractable epilepsy has not been quantified in relation to seizure outcome. Therefore, its value as a biomarker for epileptogenic pathology is not well understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a sample of children with intractable epilepsy who underwent prospective resting state guided epilepsy surgery, post‐operative resting state functional MRI was performed 6 to 12 months later. Graded normalization of the post‐operative resting state seizure onset zone was compared to seizure outcomes, patient, surgery, and anatomical MRI characteristics.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 64 cases were evaluated. Post‐operative rs‐fMRI normalization was significantly (p‐value &lt;0.001) correlated with seizure reduction, with Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.83. Of 39 cases with post‐operative resting state seizure onset zone normalization, 38 (97%) became completely seizure free. In contrast, of the 25 cases without complete rs‐fMRI SOZ normalization, only 3 (5%) become seizure free. The accuracy of rs‐fMRI as a biomarker predicting seizure freedom is 94%, with 96% sensitivity and 93% specificity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Among seizure localization techniques in pediatric epilepsy, post‐operative rs‐fMRI normalization has high correlation with seizure freedom. This study shows that pre‐operative resting state functional MRI abnormalities can be used as a biomarker of the epileptogenic zone and the post‐operative rs‐fMRI normalization is a biomarker for seizure onset zone quiescence.</p>

<p>Distinct clinical syndromes have been associated with pathogenic <i>MT‐ATP6</i> variants. In this cohort study, we identified 125 individuals (60 families) including 88 clinically affected individuals and 37 asymptomatic carriers. Thirty‐one individuals presented with Leigh syndrome and 7 with neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa. The remaining 50 patients presented with variable nonsyndromic features including ataxia, neuropathy, and learning disability. We confirmed maternal inheritance in 39 families and demonstrated that tissue segregation patterns and phenotypic threshold are variant dependent. Our findings suggest that <i>MT‐ATP6</i>–related mitochondrial DNA disease is best conceptualized as a mitochondrial disease spectrum disorder and should be routinely included in genetic ataxia and neuropathy gene panels.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify disease‐causing variants in autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy with optic atrophy and provide targeted replacement therapy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed genome‐wide sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and segregation analysis for novel disease‐causing gene discovery. We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombinant protein, patient‐derived fibroblasts, plasma, and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology, and biochemical quantification.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified biallelic mutations in <i>PDXK</i> in 5 individuals from 2 unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair‐bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP‐binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in 1 family, improvement in power, pain, and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to walk independently during the first year of PLP normalization.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that mutations in <i>PDXK</i> cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement. As B<sub>6</sub> is a cofactor in diverse essential biological pathways, our findings may have direct implications for neuropathies of unknown etiology characterized by reduced PLP levels.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent reports have described single individuals with neurodevelopmental disability (NDD) harboring heterozygous <i>KCNQ3</i> de novo variants (DNVs). We sought to assess whether pathogenic variants in <i>KCNQ3</i> cause NDD and to elucidate the associated phenotype and molecular mechanisms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with NDD and <i>KCNQ3</i> DNVs were identified through an international collaboration. Phenotypes were characterized by clinical assessment, review of charts, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and parental interview. Functional consequences of variants were analyzed in vitro by patch‐clamp recording.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven patients were assessed. They had recurrent heterozygous DNVs in <i>KCNQ3</i> affecting residues R230 (R230C, R230H, R230S) and R227 (R227Q). All patients exhibited global developmental delay within the first 2 years of life. Most (8/11, 73%) were nonverbal or had a few words only. All patients had autistic features, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was diagnosed in 5 of 11 (45%). EEGs performed before 10 years of age revealed frequent sleep‐activated multifocal epileptiform discharges in 8 of 11 (73%). For 6 of 9 (67%) recorded between 1.5 and 6 years of age, spikes became near‐continuous during sleep. Interestingly, most patients (9/11, 82%) did not have seizures, and no patient had seizures in the neonatal period. Voltage‐clamp recordings of the mutant KCNQ3 channels revealed gain‐of‐function (GoF) effects.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Specific GoF variants in <i>KCNQ3</i> cause NDD, ASD, and abundant sleep‐activated spikes. This new phenotype contrasts both with self‐limited neonatal epilepsy due to <i>KCNQ3</i> partial loss of function, and with the neonatal or infantile onset epileptic encephalopathies due to <i>KCNQ2</i> GoF.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Heightened somatic symptoms are reported by a wide range of patients with chronic pain and have been associated with emotional distress and physical dysfunction. Despite their clinical significance, molecular mechanisms leading to their manifestation are not understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used an association study design based on a curated list of 3,295 single nucleotide polymorphisms mapped to 358 genes to test somatic symptoms reporting using the Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness questionnaire from a case–control cohort of orofacial pain (n = 1,607). A replication meta‐analysis of 3 independent cohorts (n = 3,189) was followed by functional validation, including in silico molecular dynamics, in vitro enzyme assays, and measures of serotonin (5‐HT) plasma concentration.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>An association with the T allele of rs11575542 coding for an arginine to glutamine substitution in the L‐aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme was replicated in a meta‐analysis of 3 independent cohorts. In a combined meta‐analysis of all cohorts, this association reached <i>p</i> = 6.43 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. In silico studies demonstrated that this substitution dramatically reduces the conformational dynamics of AADC, potentially lowering its binding capacity to a cofactor. in vitro enzymatic assays showed that this substitution reduces the maximum kinetic velocity of AADC, hence lowering 5‐HT levels. Finally, plasma samples from 90 subjects showed correlation between low 5‐HT levels and heightened somatic symptoms.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using functional genomics approaches, we identified a polymorphism in the AADC enzyme that contributes to somatic symptoms through reduced levels of 5‐HT. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of somatic symptoms and opens up new treatment options targeting the serotonergic system. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:168–180</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide repeats expansions account for almost half of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. Recent imaging studies in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> carriers have demonstrated cerebral white (WM) and gray matter (GM) degeneration before the age of 40 years. The objective of this study was to characterize cervical spinal cord (SC) changes in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide carriers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seventy‐two asymptomatic individuals were enrolled in a prospective study of first‐degree relatives of ALS and FTD patients carrying the <i>c9orf72</i> hexanucleotide expansion. Forty of them carried the pathogenic mutation (C9<sup>+</sup>). Each subject underwent quantitative cervical cord imaging. Structural GM and WM metrics and diffusivity parameters were evaluated at baseline and 18 months later. Data were analyzed in C9<sup>+</sup> and C9<sup>−</sup> subgroups, and C9<sup>+</sup> subjects were further stratified by age.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, significant WM atrophy was detected at each cervical vertebral level in C9<sup>+</sup> subjects older than 40 years without associated changes in GM and diffusion tensor imaging parameters. At 18‐month follow‐up, WM atrophy was accompanied by significant corticospinal tract (CST) fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions. Intriguingly, asymptomatic C9<sup>+</sup> subjects older than 40 years with family history of ALS (as opposed to FTD) also exhibited significant CST FA reduction at baseline.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cervical SC imaging detects WM atrophy exclusively in C9<sup>+</sup> subjects older than 40 years, and progressive CST FA reductions can be identified on 18‐month follow‐up. Cervical SC magnetic resonance imaging readily captures presymptomatic pathological changes and disease propagation in <i>c9orf72</i>‐associated conditions. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:158–167</p>

<p>Reflex epilepsies have been demonstrated to exploit specific networks that subserve normal physiological function. It is unclear whether more common forms of epilepsy share this particular feature. By measuring interictal spikes in patients with a range of epilepsies, we show that 2 tasks known to specifically engage the hippocampus and temporal neocortex promoted increased interictal spiking within these regions, whereas a nonhippocampal dependent task did not. This indicates that interictal spike frequency may reflect the processing demands being placed on specific functional–anatomical networks in epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:304–309</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To provide evidence that early electroencephalography (EEG) allows for reliable prediction of poor or good outcome after cardiac arrest.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a 5‐center prospective cohort study, we included consecutive, comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. Continuous EEG recordings were started as soon as possible and continued up to 5 days. Five‐minute EEG epochs were assessed by 2 reviewers, independently, at 8 predefined time points from 6 hours to 5 days after cardiac arrest, blinded for patients’ actual condition, treatment, and outcome. EEG patterns were categorized as generalized suppression (&lt;10 μV), synchronous patterns with ≥50% suppression, continuous, or other. Outcome at 6 months was categorized as good (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] = 1–2) or poor (CPC = 3–5).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 850 patients, of whom 46% had a good outcome. Generalized suppression and synchronous patterns with ≥50% suppression predicted poor outcome without false positives at ≥6 hours after cardiac arrest. Their summed sensitivity was 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42–0.51) at 12 hours and 0.30 (95% CI = 0.26–0.33) at 24 hours after cardiac arrest, with specificity of 1.00 (95% CI = 0.99–1.00) at both time points. At 36 hours or later, sensitivity for poor outcome was ≤0.22. Continuous EEG patterns at 12 hours predicted good outcome, with sensitivity of 0.50 (95% CI = 0.46–0.55) and specificity of 0.91 (95% CI = 0.88–0.93); at 24 hours or later, specificity for the prediction of good outcome was &lt;0.90.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EEG allows for reliable prediction of poor outcome after cardiac arrest, with maximum sensitivity in the first 24 hours. Continuous EEG patterns at 12 hours after cardiac arrest are associated with good recovery. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:203–214</p>

<p>Global brain activity self-organizes into discrete patterns characterized by
distinct behavioral observables and modes of information processing. The human
thalamocortical system is a densely connected network where local neural
activation reciprocally influences coordinated collective dynamics. We
introduce a semi-empirical model to investigate the relationship between
regional activation and long-range functional connectivity in the different
brain states visited during the natural wake-sleep cycle. Our model combines
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, in vivo estimates of
structural connectivity, and anatomically-informed priors that constrain the
independent variation of regional activation. As expected, priors based on
functionally coherent networks resulted in the best fit between empirical and
simulated brain activity. We show that sleep progressively divided the cortex
into regions presenting opposite dynamical behavior: frontoparietal regions
approached a bifurcation towards local oscillatory dynamics, while sensorimotor
regions presented stable dynamics governed by noise. In agreement with human
electrophysiological experiments, sleep onset induced subcortical deactivation
and uncoupling, which was subsequently reversed for deeper stages. Finally, we
introduced external forcing of variable intensity to simulate external
perturbations, and identifiedthe key regionsespecially relevant for the
recovery of wakefulness from deep sleep. Our model represents sleep as a state
where long-range decoupling and regional deactivation coexist with the latent
capacity for a rapid transition towards wakefulness. The mechanistic insights
provided by our simulations allow the in silico parametric exploration of such
transitions in terms of external perturbations, with potential applications for
the control of physiological and pathological brain states.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00816">Cholinergic switch between two types of slow waves in cerebral cortex. (arXiv:1810.00816v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Sleep slow waves are known to participate in memory consolidation, yet slow
waves occurring under anesthetized states present no positive effects on
memory. Here, we shed light onto this paradox, based on a combination of
extracellular recordings in vivo, in vitro and computational models. We find
two types of slow waves, based on analyzing the temporal patterns of successive
slow-wave events. The first type of slow waves is seen during sleep, while the
second type prevails in anesthetized states. Network models of spiking neurons
predict that the two slow wave types emerge due to a different gain on
inhibitory vs excitatory cells and that different levels of spike-frequency
adaptation in excitatory cells can account for dynamical distinctions between
the two types. This prediction was tested in vitro by varying adaptation
strength using an agonist of acetylcholine receptors, which demonstrated a
neuromodulatory switch between the two types of slow waves. Finally, we show
that the first type of slow-wave dynamics is more sensitive to external
stimuli, which can explain how slow waves in sleep and anesthesia
differentially affect memory consolidation, as well as provide a link between
slow-wave dynamics and memory diseases.

Background: There is accumulating evidence suggesting a connection between the gut and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Gut microbiota may play an important role in the intestinal lesions in PD patients.
Objective: This study aims to determine whether gut microbiota differs between PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast of China, and to identify the factors that influence the changes in the gut microbiota. 
Methods: We enrolled 51 PD patients and 48 healthy controls in this study. Microbial species in stool samples were determined through 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. Dietary intakes were collected from subset of 42 patients and 23 controls using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Gut microbiota species richness, diversity, differential abundance of individual taxa between PD patients and controls, and the relationship between the gut microbiota abundance and the dietary and clinical factors were analyzed.
Results: PD patients showed decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls. PD-associated clinical scores appeared to be the most influential factors that correlated with the abundance of a variety of taxa. The most consistent findings suggested by multiple analyses used in this study were the increase of Akkermansia and the decrease of Lactobacillus in PD patients in Northeast China.
Conclusion: Gut microbiota significantly differed between a group of PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast China, with decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls.

Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (ITON) is a condition that is often associated with traumatic brain injury and can result in significant vision loss due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons at the time of injury or within the ensuing weeks. We used a mouse model of eye-directed air-blast exposure to characterize the histopathology of blast-induced ITON. This injury caused a transient elevation of intraocular pressure with subsequent retinal ganglion cell death and axon degeneration that was similar throughout the length of the optic nerve. Deficits in active anterograde axon transport to the superior colliculus accompanied axon degeneration and first appeared in peripheral representations of the retina. Glial area in the optic nerve increased early after injury and involved a later period of additional expansion. The increase in area involved a transient change in astrocyte organization independent of axon degeneration. While levels of many cytokines and chemokines did not change, IL-1α and IL-1β increased in both the optic nerve and retina. In contrast, glaucoma shows distal to proximal axon degeneration with astrocyte remodeling and increases in many cytokines and chemokines. Further, direct traumatic optic neuropathies have a clear site of injury with rapid, progressive axon degeneration and cell death. These data show that blast-induced ITON is a distinct neuropathology from other optic neuropathies.

The choice of the reference electrode scheme is an important step in event-related potential (ERP) analysis. In order to explore the optimal electroencephalogram reference electrode scheme for the ERP signal related to facial recognition, we investigated the influence of average reference (AR), mean mastoid reference (MM) and Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) on the N170 component via statistical analysis, statistical parametric scalp mappings (SPSM) and source analysis. The statistical results showed that the choice of reference electrode scheme has little effect on N170 latency (p&gt;0.05), but has a greater impact on N170 amplitude (p&lt;0.05). ANOVA results show that, for the three references scheme, there was statistically significant difference between N170 latency and amplitude induced by the unfamiliar face and that induced by the scrambled face (p&lt;0.05). Specifically, the SPSM results show an anterior and a temporo-occipital distribution for AR and REST, with just anterior distribution shown for MM. However, the circumstantial evidence provided by source analysis is more consistent with SPSM of AR and REST. These results indicate that the experimental results under the AR and REST references are more objective and appropriate. Thus, it is more appropriate to use AR and REST reference scheme settings in future facial recognition experiments.

To maximize brain plasticity after stroke, several rehabilitation strategies have been explored, including the use of intensive motor training, motor imagery, and action observation. Growing evidence of the positive impact of virtual reality (VR) techniques on recovery following stroke has been shown. However, most VR tools are designed to exploit active movement, and hence patients with low level of motor control cannot fully benefit from them. Consequently, the idea of directly training the central nervous system has been promoted by utilizing motor-imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To date, detailed information on which VR strategies lead to successful functional recovery is still largely missing, and very little is known about how to optimally integrate BCI and VR paradigms for stroke rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a BCI-VR system using a MI paradigm for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation on functional assessments, and related changes in MI ability and brain imaging. To achieve this, a 60 years old male chronic stroke patient was recruited. The patient underwent a 3-week intervention in a clinical environment, resulting in 10 BCI-VR training sessions. The patient was assessed before and after intervention, as well as on a one-month follow-up, in terms of clinical scales and brain imaging using functional MRI (fMRI). Consistent with prior research, we found important improvements in upper extremity scores (Fugl-Meyer) and identified increases in brain activation measured by fMRI that suggest neuroplastic changes in brain motor networks. This study expands on the current body of evidence as more data are needed on the effect of this type of interventions not only on functional improvement but also through brain imaging to study the effect of the intervention on plasticity.

Human motor response time is determined by the matureness of the preceding neural motor preparation process.  In the current study, we characterize the optimal temporal boundaries required for the motor preparation process, and its impact on the overall motor response time. In particular, we contrasted short and long preparation durations by measuring the resulting differences in motor response times, in an attempt to find whether an optimal preparation time exists. Using a “Timed Response” paradigm, we presented participants with varying planning intervals prior to a requested motor response, and studied their effect on the timing of initiation of the following movement. We found that, as expected, reaction time shortens as more planning time is provided, yet only until reaching a minimal response time, after which additional preparation time increases the motor response time, thus creating a U-shaped behavioral function. Furthermore, since the minimal response time was found to be an individual characteristic, we suggest that there is an individual optimal time window for motor planning. The existence and personal timing of an optimal timing window can assist in the characterization and medical surveillance of patients with neurological disorders.

Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have difficulty performing and learning motor skills. Automatic activation of the mirror neuron system (MNS) during action observation and its coupling to the motor output system are important neurophysiological processes that underpin observational motor learning. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that MNS function is disrupted in children with DCD by using sensitive EEG-based measures of MNS activation during action observation. Specifically, we predicted reduced mu-suppression and coherence in DCD compared with typically developing children.  
Neural activation of the motor network was measured by EEG, specifically event-related desynchronization (ERD) of mu rhythms and fronto-parietal coherence. Children (15 DCD / 15 controls) were tested under two task conditions: observational learning (imitation of an observed action) and detection (report a deviant movement after observation). EEG-metrics were compared between groups using linear mixed-effects models.  
As predicted, children with DCD showed lower levels of mu suppression and reduced modulation of coherence during the observational learning task compared with their non-DCD peers. Notably, mu suppression was reduced in DCD over the entire imitation task (repetitions, and both observation and pause intervals).
Action observation can be used for the acquisition of new motor skills. This form of learning entails the transposition of the observed action to the existing internal representations of the observer’s own motor system. The present neurophysiological results suggest that this process of learning is impaired in children with DCD. Results are discussed in relation to current hypotheses on mechanisms of DCD.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00047">The Orientation Selectivity of Spike-LFP Synchronization in Macaque V1 and V4</a></h4>

Orientation selectivity is a fundamental property of visual cortical neurons and plays a crucial role in pattern perception. Although many studies have dedicated to explain how the orientation selectivity emerged, the mechanism underlying orientation selectivity is still not clear. In this work, we investigated the synchronization between spikes and local field potentials (LFP) in gamma band, with the aim of providing a new avenue to analyze the orientation selectivity. The experimental data were recorded by utilizing two chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, where each array consisted of 48 electrodes and was placed over V1 and V4 respectively in two macaques performing a selective visual attention task. An unbiased and robust measure for quantifying the synchronization between spikes and LFP was employed in the analysis process, which is termed as spike-triggered correlation matrix synchronization (SCMS) and performs reliably for limited samples of data. We observed the spike-LFP synchronization in three cases, i.e. spikes and LFP in V1, spikes and LFP in V4, spikes in V4 and LFP in V1. From the orientation tuning curves based on the spike-LFP synchronization, it is found that there is a strong correlation between the synchronization and grating orientation. The neurons in both V1 and V4 exhibit orientation selectivity, but V1 is stronger. In addition, the spike-LFP synchronization strength between V1 and V4 also shows orientation selectivity to drifting gratings. It means that the synchronization not only reflects the basic features of visual stimulation, but also describes the orientation tuning characteristics of neurons in different regions. Our results suggest that the spike-LFP synchronization can be used as an alternative and effective method to study the mechanism for generating orientation selectivity of visual neurons.

Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) mediate a range of signaling and plasticity processes in the brain and are of growing importance as potential therapeutic targets in clinical trials for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Fundamental knowledge regarding the functional effects of mGluRs upon pyramidal neurons and interneurons is derived largely from rodent brain, and their effects upon human neurons are predominantly untested. We therefore addressed how group I mGluRs affect microcircuits in human neocortex. We show that activation of group I mGluRs elicits action potential firing in Martinotti cells, which leads to increased synaptic inhibition onto neighboring neurons. Other interneuron types, including fast-spiking interneurons, are depolarized but do not fire action potentials in response to group I mGluR activation. Furthermore, we confirm the existence of group I mGluR-mediated LTD of excitatory synapses in human pyramidal neurons. We propose that the strong increase in inhibition and depression of excitatory synapses upon group I mGluR activation likely results in a shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition in the human cortical network.

What type of principle features intrinsic inside of the fluctuated input signals could drive neurons with the maximal excitations is one of the crucial neural coding issues. In this article, we examined both experimentally and theoretically the cortical neuronal responsivity (including firing rate and spike timing reliability) to input signals with different intrinsic correlational statistics (e.g., white-type noise, showed 1/f0 power spectrum, pink noise 1/f and brown noises 1/f2) and different frequency ranges. Our results revealed that the response sensitivity and reliability of cortical neurons is much higher in response to 1/f noise stimuli with long-term correlations than 1/f0 with short-term correlations for a broad frequency range, and also higher than 1/f2 for all frequency ranges. In addition, we found that neuronal sensitivity diverges to opposite directions for 1/f noise comparing with 1/f0 white noise as a function of cutoff frequency of input signal. As the cutoff frequency is progressively increased from 50 to 1000 Hz, the neuronal responsiveness increased gradually for 1/f noise, while decreased exponentially for white noise. Computational simulations of a general cortical model revealed that, neuronal sensitivity and reliability to input signal statistics was majorly dominated by fast sodium inactivation, potassium activation and membrane time constants.

Objective: The aim of this review was to synthesize, using random-effects model of meta-analysis, the link between dopaminergic system and Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: A detailed analysis protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database prior to data extraction (CRD42018110798). Electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Psyc-ARTICLES were searched up to December 2018 for studies that examined dopamine and dopamine receptors in relation to Alzheimer’s disease. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated to assess group differences in the levels of dopaminergic neurometabolites.
Results: Seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria. Collectively, they included 512 patients and 500 healthy controls. There were significantly lower levels of dopamine in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls (SMD= -1.56, 95% CI: -2.64 to -0.49). In addition, dopamine 1 receptor (SMD=-5.05, 95% CI: -6.14 to -3.97) and dopamine 2 receptor (SMD=-1.13, 95% CI: -1.52 to -0.74) levels were decreased in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls. The results of network meta-analysis indicated that the rank of correlation with Alzheimer’s disease from highest to lowest was dopamine (0.74), dopamine 2 receptor (0.49), dopamine 3 receptor (0.46), dopamine 4 receptor (0.33), dopamine 5 receptor (0.31), and dopamine 1 receptor (0.64).
Conclusions: Overall, decreased levels of dopaminergic neurotransmitters were linked with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for more prospective studies to validate these hypotheses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46814">A quantitative model of conserved macroscopic dynamics predicts future motor commands</a></h4>

In simple organisms such as <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, whole brain imaging has been performed. Here, we use such recordings to model the nervous system. Our model uses neuronal activity to predict expected time of future motor commands up to 30 s prior to the event. These motor commands control locomotion. Predictions are valid for individuals not used in model construction. The model predicts dwell time statistics, sequences of motor commands and individual neuron activation. To develop this model, we extracted loops spanned by neuronal activity in phase space using novel methodology. The model uses only two variables: the identity of the loop and the phase along it. Current values of these macroscopic variables predict future neuronal activity. Remarkably, our model based on macroscopic variables succeeds despite consistent inter-individual differences in neuronal activation. Thus, our analytical framework reconciles consistent individual differences in neuronal activation with macroscopic dynamics that operate universally across individuals.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, areal organization, and pioneer axon wiring are critical events during early forebrain development, yet remain incompletely understood, especially in human. Here, we studied forebrain development in human embryos aged 5 to 8 postconceptional weeks (WPC5–8), stages that correspond to the neuroepithelium/early marginal zone (WPC5), telencephalic preplate (WPC6 &amp; 7), and incipient cortical plate (WPC8). We show that early telencephalic neurons are formed at the neuroepithelial stage; the most precocious ones originate from local telencephalic neuroepithelium and possibly from the olfactory placode. At the preplate stage, forebrain organization is quite similar in human and mouse in terms of areal organization and of differentiation of Cajal-Retzius cells, pioneer neurons, and axons. Like in mice, axons from pioneer neurons in prethalamus, ventral telencephalon, and cortical preplate cross the diencephalon–telencephalon junction and the pallial–subpallial boundary, forming scaffolds that could guide thalamic and cortical axons at later stages. In accord with this model, at the early cortical plate stage, corticofugal axons run in ventral telencephalon in close contact with scaffold neurons, which express CELSR3 and FZD3, two molecules that regulates formation of similar scaffolds in mice.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The prefrontal cortex is vital for a range of cognitive processes, including working memory, attention, and decision-making. Notably, its absence impairs the performance of tasks requiring the maintenance of information through a delay period. In this paper, we formulate a rodent task—which requires maintenance of delay-period activity—as a Markov decision process and treat optimal task performance as an (active) inference problem. We simulate the behavior of a Bayes optimal mouse presented with 1 of 2 cues that instructs the selection of concurrent visual and auditory targets on a trial-by-trial basis. Formulating inference as message passing, we reproduce features of neuronal coupling within and between prefrontal regions engaged by this task. We focus on the micro-circuitry that underwrites delay-period activity and relate it to functional specialization within the prefrontal cortex in primates. Finally, we simulate the electrophysiological correlates of inference and demonstrate the consequences of lesions to each part of our in silico prefrontal cortex. In brief, this formulation suggests that recurrent excitatory connections—which support persistent neuronal activity—encode beliefs about transition probabilities over time. We argue that attentional modulation can be understood as the contextualization of sensory input by these persistent beliefs.</span>

<p>by Chun Chan, Xiaoyun Pang, Yan Zhang, Tongxin Niu, Shengjiang Yang, Daohui Zhao, Jian Li, Lanyuan Lu, Victor W. Hsu, Jian Zhou, Fei Sun, Jun Fan</p>

Studies on the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain have advanced a fundamental understanding of how proteins deform membrane. We previously showed that a BAR domain in tandem with a Pleckstrin Homology (PH domain) underlies the assembly of ACAP1 (Arfgap with Coil-coil, Ankryin repeat, and PH domain I) into an unusual lattice structure that also uncovers a new paradigm for how a BAR protein deforms membrane. Here, we initially pursued computation-based refinement of the ACAP1 lattice to identify its critical protein contacts. Simulation studies then revealed how ACAP1, which dimerizes into a symmetrical structure in solution, is recruited asymmetrically to the membrane through dynamic behavior. We also pursued electron microscopy (EM)-based structural studies, which shed further insight into the dynamic nature of the ACAP1 lattice assembly. As ACAP1 is an unconventional BAR protein, our findings broaden the understanding of the mechanistic spectrum by which proteins assemble into higher-ordered structures to achieve membrane deformation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/niya2q5wcbg" width="1" />

<p>Myelination of axons facilitates the rapid propagation of electrical signals and the long-term integrity of axons. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for proper protein homeostasis, which is particularly crucial for interactions of postmitotic cells. In our study, we examined how the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO7-SCF (SKP1, Cul1, F-box protein) expressed in myelinating cells affects the axon-myelin unit. Deletion of <i>Fbxo7</i> in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells in mice using the Cnp1-<i>Cre</i> driver line led to motor impairment due to hindlimb paresis. It did not result in apoptosis of myelinating cells, nor did it affect the proper myelination of axons or lead to demyelination. It however triggered axonal degeneration in the CNS and resulted in the severe degeneration of axons in the PNS, inducing a full-blown neuropathy. Both the CNS and PNS displayed inflammation, while the PNS was also characterized by fibrosis, massive infiltration of macrophages, and edema. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of <i>Fbxo7</i>, after myelination using the Plp1-<i>CreERT2</i> line, led to a small number of degenerated axons and hence a very mild peripheral neuropathy. Interestingly, loss of <i>Fbxo7</i> also resulted in reduced proteasome activity in Schwann cells but not in cerebellar granule neurons, indicating a specific sensitivity of the former cell type. Together, our results demonstrate an essential role for FBXO7 in myelinating cells to support associated axons, which is fundamental to the proper developmental establishment and the long-term integrity of the axon-myelin unit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The myelination of axons facilitates the fast propagation of electrical signals and the trophic support of the myelin-axon unit. Here, we report that deletion of <i>Fbxo7</i> in myelinating cells in mice triggered motor impairment but had no effect on myelin biogenesis. Loss of Fbxo7 in myelinating glia, however, led to axonal degeneration in the CNS and peripheral neuropathy of the axonal type. In addition, we found that Schwann cells were particularly sensitive to Fbxo7 deficiency reflected by reduced proteasome activity. Based on these findings, we conclude that Fbxo7 is essential for the support of the axon-myelin unit and long-term axonal health.</p>

<p>Chronic social defeat (CSD) in male mice can produce anxiety and aberrant socialization. Animals susceptible to CSD show activation of microglia, which have elevated levels of oxidative stress markers. We hypothesized that microglia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production contribute to the CSD stress-induced changes in affective behavior. First, we selectively depleted microglia (99%) by administering the CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor) antagonist PLX5622 before and during the 14 d CSD procedure. Microglia-depleted mice in contrast to nondepleted mice were protected from the stress effects measured by light/dark and social interaction tests. ROS production, measured histochemically following dihydroethidium administration, was elevated by CSD, and the production was reduced to basal levels in mice lacking microglia. The deleterious stress effects were also blocked in nondepleted mice by continuous intracerebral administration of <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine (NAC), a ROS inhibitor. In a second experiment, at the end of the CSD period, PLX5622 was discontinued to allow microglial repopulation. After 14 d, the brain had a full complement of newly generated microglia. At this time, the mice that had previously been protected now showed behavioral deficits, and their brain ROS production was elevated, both in all brain cells and in repopulated microglia. NAC administration during repopulation prevented the behavioral decline in the repopulated mice, and it supported behavioral recovery in nondepleted stressed mice. The data suggest that microglia drive elevated ROS production during and after stress exposure. This elevated ROS activity generates a central state supporting dysregulated affect, and it hinders the restoration of behavioral and neurochemical homeostasis after stress cessation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic psychosocial stress is associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Understanding the details of CNS cellular contributions to stress effects could lead to the development of intervention strategies. Inflammation and oxidative stress are positively linked to depression severity, but the cellular nature of these processes is not clear. The chronic social defeat (CSD) paradigm in mice produces mood alterations and microglial activation characterized by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The depletion of microglia or ROS inhibition prevented adverse stress effects. Microglial repopulation of the brain post-CSD reintroduced adverse stress effects, and ROS inhibition in this phase protected against the effects. The results suggest that stress-induced microglial ROS production drives a central state that supports dysregulated affective behavior.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/28/5581?rss=1">Disrupted Plasma Membrane Protein Homeostasis in a Xenopus Laevis Model of Retinitis Pigmentosa</a></h4>

<p>Rhodopsin mislocalization is frequently observed in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients. For example, class I mutant rhodopsin is deficient in the VxPx trafficking signal, mislocalizes to the plasma membrane (PM) of rod photoreceptor inner segments (ISs), and causes autosomal dominant RP. Mislocalized rhodopsin causes photoreceptor degeneration in a manner independent of light-activation. In this manuscript, we took advantage of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> models of both sexes expressing wild-type human rhodopsin or its class I Q344ter mutant fused to Dendra2 fluorescent protein to characterize a novel light-independent mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration caused by mislocalized rhodopsin. We found that rhodopsin mislocalized to the PM is actively internalized and transported to lysosomes where it is degraded. This degradation process results in the downregulation of a crucial component of the photoreceptor IS PM: the sodium-potassium ATPase α-subunit (NKAα). The downregulation of NKAα is not because of decreased NKAα mRNA, but due to cotransport of mislocalized rhodopsin and NKAα to lysosomes or autophagolysosomes. In a separate set of experiments, we found that class I mutant rhodopsin, which causes NKAα downregulation, also causes shortening and loss of rod outer segments (OSs); the symptoms frequently observed in the early stages of human RP. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of NKAα led to shortening and loss of rod OSs. These combined studies suggest that mislocalized rhodopsin leads to photoreceptor dysfunction through disruption of the PM protein homeostasis and compromised NKAα function. This study unveiled a novel role of lysosome-mediated degradation in causing inherited disorders manifested by mislocalization of ciliary receptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Retinal ciliopathy is the most common form of inherited blinding disorder frequently manifesting rhodopsin mislocalization. Our understanding of the relationships between rhodopsin mislocalization and photoreceptor dysfunction/degeneration has been far from complete. This study uncovers a hitherto uncharacterized consequence of rhodopsin mislocalization: the activation of the lysosomal pathway, which negatively regulates the amount of the sodium-potassium ATPase (NKAα) on the inner segment plasma membrane. On the plasma membrane, mislocalized rhodopsin extracts NKAα and sends it to lysosomes where they are co-degraded. Compromised NKAα function leads to shortening and loss of the photoreceptor outer segments as observed for various inherited blinding disorders. In summary, this study revealed a novel pathogenic mechanism applicable to various forms of blinding disorders caused by rhodopsin mislocalization.</p>

<p>We previously identified that <i>ngr1</i> allele deletion limits the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by preserving axonal integrity. However, whether this favorable outcome observed in EAE is a consequence of an abrogated neuronal-specific pathophysiological mechanism, is yet to be defined. Here we show that, Cre-loxP-mediated neuron-specific deletion of <i>ngr1</i> preserved axonal integrity, whereas its re-expression in <i>ngr1<sup>–/–</sup></i> female mice potentiated EAE-axonopathy. As a corollary, myelin integrity was preserved under Cre deletion in <i>ngr1<sup>flx/flx</sup></i>, retinal ganglion cell axons whereas, significant demyelination occurred in the <i>ngr1<sup>–/–</sup></i> optic nerves following the re-introduction of NgR1. Moreover, Cre-loxP-mediated axon-specific deletion of <i>ngr1</i> in <i>ngr1<sup>flx/flx</sup></i> mice also demonstrated efficient anterograde transport of fluorescently-labeled ChTxβ in the optic nerves of EAE-induced mice. However, the anterograde transport of ChTxβ displayed accumulation in optic nerve degenerative axons of EAE-induced <i>ngr1<sup>–/–</sup></i> mice, when NgR1 was reintroduced but was shown to be transported efficiently in the contralateral non- recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2-transduced optic nerves of these mutant mice. We further identified that the interaction between the axonal motor protein, Kinesin-1 and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) was unchanged upon Cre deletion of <i>ngr1</i>. Whereas, this Kinesin-1/CRMP2 association was reduced when NgR1 was re-expressed in the <i>ngr1<sup>–/–</sup></i> optic nerves. Our data suggest that NgR1 governs axonal degeneration in the context of inflammatory-mediated demyelination through the phosphorylation of CRMP2 by stalling axonal vesicular transport. Moreover, axon-specific deletion of <i>ngr1</i> preserves axonal transport mechanisms, blunting the induction of inflammatory demyelination and limiting the severity of EAE.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is commonly induced by aberrant immune-mediated destruction of the protective sheath of nerve fibers (known as myelin). However, it has been shown that MS lesions do not only consist of this disease pattern, exhibiting heterogeneity with continual destruction of axons. Here we investigate how neuronal NgR1 can drive inflammatory-mediated axonal degeneration and demyelination within the optic nerve by analyzing its downstream signaling events that govern axonal vesicular transport. We identify that abrogating the NgR1/pCRMP2 signaling cascade can maintain Kinesin-1-dependent anterograde axonal transport to limit inflammatory-mediated axonopathy and demyelination. The ability to differentiate between primary and secondary mechanisms of axonal degeneration may uncover therapeutic strategies to limit axonal damage and progressive MS.</p>

<p>Numerous behavioral studies have shown that visual function can improve with training, although perceptual refinements generally require weeks to months of training to attain. This, along with questions about long-term retention of learning, limits practical and clinical applications of many such paradigms. Here, we show for the first time in female and male human participants that just 10 d of visual training coupled with transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over visual areas causes dramatic improvements in visual motion perception. Relative to control conditions and anodal stimulation, tRNS-enhanced learning was at least twice as fast, and, crucially, it persisted for 6 months after the end of training and stimulation. Notably, tRNS also boosted learning in patients with chronic cortical blindness, leading to recovery of motion processing in the blind field after just 10 d of training, a period too short to elicit enhancements with training alone. In sum, our results reveal a remarkable enhancement of the capacity for long-lasting plastic and restorative changes when a neuromodulatory intervention is coupled with visual training.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our work demonstrates that visual training coupled with brain stimulation can dramatically reduce the training period from months to weeks, and lead to fast improvement in neurotypical subjects and chronic cortically blind patients, indicating the potential of our procedure to help restore damaged visual abilities for currently untreatable visual dysfunctions. Together, these results indicate the critical role of early visual areas in perceptual learning and reveal its capacity for long-lasting plastic changes promoted by neuromodulatory intervention.</p>

<p>Healthy aging is accompanied by disruptions in the functional modular organization of the human brain. Cross-sectional studies have shown age-related reductions in the functional segregation and distinctiveness of brain networks. However, less is known about the longitudinal changes in brain functional modular organization and their associations with aging-related cognitive decline. We examined age- and aging-related changes in functional architecture of the cerebral cortex using a dataset comprising a cross-sectional healthy young cohort of 57 individuals (mean ± SD age, 23.71 ± 3.61 years, 22 males) and a longitudinal healthy elderly cohort of 72 individuals (mean ± baseline age, 68.22 ± 5.80 years, 39 males) with 2–3 time points (18–24 months apart) of task-free fMRI data. We found both cross-sectional (elderly vs young) and longitudinal (in elderly) global decreases in network segregation (decreased local efficiency), integration (decreased global efficiency), and module distinctiveness (increased participation coefficient and decreased system segregation). At the modular level, whereas cross-sectional analyses revealed higher participation coefficient across all modules in the elderly compared with young participants, longitudinal analyses revealed focal longitudinal participation coefficient increases in three higher-order cognitive modules: control network, default mode network, and salience/ventral attention network. Cross-sectionally, elderly participants also showed worse attention performance with lower local efficiency and higher mean participation coefficient, and worse global cognitive performance with higher participation coefficient in the dorsal attention/control network. These findings suggest that healthy aging is associated with whole-brain connectome-wide changes in the functional modular organization of the brain, accompanied by loss of functional segregation, particularly in higher-order cognitive networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated age-related reductions in the functional segregation and distinctiveness of brain networks. However, longitudinal aging-related changes in brain functional modular architecture and their links to cognitive decline remain relatively understudied. Using graph theoretical and community detection approaches to study task-free functional network changes in a cross-sectional young and longitudinal healthy elderly cohort, we showed that aging was associated with global declines in network segregation, integration, and module distinctiveness, and specific declines in distinctiveness of higher-order cognitive networks. Further, such functional network deterioration was associated with poorer cognitive performance cross-sectionally. Our findings suggest that healthy aging is associated with system-level changes in brain functional modular organization, accompanied by functional segregation loss particularly in higher-order networks specialized for cognition.</p>

<p>The auditory system converts the physical properties of a sound waveform to neural activities and processes them for recognition. During the process, the tuning to amplitude modulation (AM) is successively transformed by a cascade of brain regions. To test the functional significance of the AM tuning, we conducted single-unit recording in a deep neural network (DNN) trained for natural sound recognition. We calculated the AM representation in the DNN and quantitatively compared it with those reported in previous neurophysiological studies. We found that an auditory-system-like AM tuning emerges in the optimized DNN. Better-recognizing models showed greater similarity to the auditory system. We isolated the factors forming the AM representation in the different brain regions. Because the model was not designed to reproduce any anatomical or physiological properties of the auditory system other than the cascading architecture, the observed similarity suggests that the AM tuning in the auditory system might also be an emergent property for natural sound recognition during evolution and development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study suggests that neural tuning to amplitude modulation may be a consequence of the auditory system evolving for natural sound recognition. We modeled the function of the entire auditory system; that is, recognizing sounds from raw waveforms with as few anatomical or physiological assumptions as possible. We analyzed the model using single-unit recording, which enabled a fair comparison with neurophysiological data with as few methodological biases as possible. Interestingly, our results imply that frequency decomposition in the inner ear might not be necessary for processing amplitude modulation. This implication could not have been obtained if we had used a model that assumes frequency decomposition.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/28/5506?rss=1">Interactions between Conscious and Subconscious Signals: Selective Attention under Feature-Based Competition Increases Neural Selectivity during Brain Adaptation</a></h4>

<p>Efficient perception in natural environments depends on neural interactions between voluntary processes within cognitive control, such as attention, and those that are automatic and subconscious, such as brain adaptation to predictable input (also called repetition suppression). Although both attention and adaptation have been studied separately and there is considerable knowledge of the neurobiology involved in each of these processes, how attention interacts with adaptation remains equivocal. We examined how attention interacts with visual and auditory adaptation by measuring neuroimaging effects consistent with changes in either neural gain or selectivity. Male and female human participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) first while they discriminated repetition of morphed faces or voices and either directed their attention to stimulus identity or spatial location. Attention to face or voice identity, while ignoring stimulus location, solely increased the gain of respectively face- or voice-sensitive cortex. The results were strikingly different in an experiment when participants attended to voice identity versus stimulus loudness. In this case, attention to voice while ignoring sound loudness increased neural selectivity. The combined results show that how attention affects adaptation depends on the level of feature-based competition, reconciling prior conflicting observations. The findings are theoretically important and are discussed in relation to neurobiological interactions between attention and different types of predictive signals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adaptation to repeated environmental events is ubiquitous in the animal brain, an automatic typically subconscious, predictive signal. Cognitive influences, such as by attention, powerfully affect sensory processing and can overcome brain adaptation. However, how neural interactions occur between adaptation and attention remains controversial. We conducted fMRI experiments regulating the focus of attention during adaptation to repeated stimuli with perceptually balanced stimulus expectancy. We observed an interaction between attention and adaptation consistent with increased neural selectivity, but only under conditions of feature-based competition, challenging the notion that attention interacts with brain adaptation by only affecting response gain. This demonstrates that attention retains its full complement of mechanistic influences on sensory cortex even as it interacts with more automatic or subconscious predictive processes.</p>

<p>Although spatial and feature attention have differing effects on neuronal responses in visual cortex, it remains unclear why. Response normalization has been implicated in both types of attention (Carandini and Heeger, 2011), and single-unit studies have demonstrated that the magnitude of spatial attention effects on neuronal responses covaries with the magnitude of normalization effects. However, the relationship between feature attention and normalization remains largely unexplored. We recorded from individual neurons in the middle temporal area of rhesus monkeys using a task that allowed us to isolate the effects of feature attention, spatial attention, and normalization on the responses of each neuron. We found that the magnitudes of neuronal response modulations due to spatial attention and feature attention are correlated; however, whereas modulations due to spatial attention are correlated with normalization strength, those due to feature attention are not. Additionally, spatial attention modulations are stronger with multiple stimuli in the receptive field, whereas feature attention modulations are not. These findings are captured by a model in which spatial and feature attention share common top-down attention signals that nonetheless result in differing sensory neuron response modulations because of a spatially tuned sensory normalization mechanism. This model explains previously reported commonalities and differences between these two types of attention by clarifying the relationship between top-down attention signals and sensory normalization. We conclude that similar top-down signals to visual cortex can have distinct effects on neuronal responses due to distinct interactions with sensory mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Subjects use attention to improve their visual perception in several ways, including by attending to a location in space or to a visual feature. Prior studies have found both commonalities and differences between the effects of spatial and feature attention on neuronal responses in visual cortex, although it is unclear what mechanisms could explain this range of effects. Normalization, a computation by which neuronal responses are modified by stimulus context, has been implicated in many neuronal mechanisms throughout the brain. Here we propose that normalization provides a simple explanation for how spatial and feature attention could share common top-down attention signals that still affect sensory neuron responses differently.</p>

<p>Myelin loss occurring in demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, is the leading cause of long-lasting neurological disability in adults. While endogenous remyelination, driven by resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), might partially compensate myelin loss in the early phases of demyelinating disorders, this spontaneous reparative potential fails at later stages. To investigate the cellular mechanisms sustaining endogenous remyelination in demyelinating disorders, we focused our attention on endogenous neural precursor cells (eNPCs) located within the subventricular zone (SVZ) since this latter area is considered one of the primary sources of new OPCs in the adult forebrain. First, we fate mapped SVZ-eNPCs in cuprizone-induced demyelination and found that SVZ endogenous neural stem/precursor cells are recruited during the remyelination phase to the corpus callosum (CC) and are capable of forming new oligodendrocytes. When we ablated SVZ-derived eNPCs during cuprizone-induced demyelination in female mice, the animals displayed reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes within the lesioned CC. Although this reduction in oligodendrocytes did not impact the ensuing remyelination, eNPC-ablated mice experienced increased axonal loss. Our results indicate that, in toxic models of demyelination, SVZ-derived eNPCs contribute to support axonal survival.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One of the significant challenges in MS research is to understand the detrimental mechanisms leading to the failure of CNS tissue regeneration during disease progression. One possible explanation is the inability of recruited oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to complete remyelination and to sustain axonal survival. The contribution of endogenous neural precursor cells (eNPCs) located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) to generate new OPCs in the lesion site has been debated. Using transgenic mice to fate map and to selectively kill SVZ-derived eNPCs in the cuprizone demyelination model, we observed migration of SVZ-eNPCs after injury and their contribution to oligodendrogenesis and axonal survival. We found that eNPCs are dispensable for remyelination but protect partially from increased axonal loss.</p>

<p>cAMP signaling is known to be critical in neuronal survival and axon growth. Increasingly the subcellular compartmentation of cAMP signaling has been appreciated, but outside of dendritic synaptic regulation, few cAMP compartments have been defined in terms of molecular composition or function in neurons. Specificity in cAMP signaling is conferred in large part by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that localize protein kinase A and other signaling enzymes to discrete intracellular compartments. We now reveal that cAMP signaling within a perinuclear neuronal compartment organized by the large multivalent scaffold protein mAKAPα promotes neuronal survival and axon growth. mAKAPα signalosome function is explored using new molecular tools designed to specifically alter local cAMP levels as studied by live-cell FRET imaging. In addition, enhancement of mAKAPα-associated cAMP signaling by isoform-specific displacement of bound phosphodiesterase is demonstrated to increase retinal ganglion cell survival <i>in vivo</i> in mice of both sexes following optic nerve crush injury. These findings define a novel neuronal compartment that confers cAMP regulation of neuroprotection and axon growth and that may be therapeutically targeted in disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> cAMP is a second messenger responsible for the regulation of diverse cellular processes including neuronal neurite extension and survival following injury. Signal transduction by cAMP is highly compartmentalized in large part because of the formation of discrete, localized multimolecular signaling complexes by A-kinase anchoring proteins. Although the concept of cAMP compartmentation is well established, the function and identity of these compartments remain poorly understood in neurons. In this study, we provide evidence for a neuronal perinuclear cAMP compartment organized by the scaffold protein mAKAPα that is necessary and sufficient for the induction of neurite outgrowth <i>in vitro</i> and for the survival of retinal ganglion cells <i>in vivo</i> following optic nerve injury.</p>

<p>Sleep deprivation (SD) interferes with hippocampal structural and functional plasticity, formation of long-term memory and cognitive function. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are incompletely understood. Here, we show that SD impaired synaptic tagging and capture and behavioral tagging, two major mechanisms of associative learning and memory. Strikingly, mutant male mice lacking the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) were resistant to the detrimental effects of SD on hippocampal plasticity at both cellular and behavioral levels. Mechanistically, SD increased p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression and its interaction with phosphodiesterase. p75<sup>NTR</sup> deletion preserved hippocampal structural and functional plasticity by preventing SD-mediated effects on hippocampal cAMP–CREB-BDNF, cAMP-PKA-LIMK1-cofilin, and RhoA-ROCK2 pathways. Our study identifies p75<sup>NTR</sup> as an important mediator of hippocampal structural and functional changes associated with SD, and suggests that targeting p75<sup>NTR</sup> could be a promising strategy to limit the memory and cognitive deficits that accompany sleep loss.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lack of sufficient sleep is a major health concern in today's world. Sleep deprivation (SD) affects cognitive functions such as memory. We have investigated how associative memory mechanisms, synaptic tagging and capture (STC), was impaired in SD mice at cellular and behavioral level. Interestingly, mutant male mice that lacked the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) were seen to be resistant to the SD-induced impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and STC. Additionally, we elucidated the molecular pathways responsible for this rescue of plasticity in the mutant mice. Our study has thus identified p75<sup>NTR</sup> as a promising target to limit the cognitive deficits associated with SD.</p>

<p>The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA) is a ubiquitous membrane-bound enzyme responsible for generating and maintaining the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradients across the plasmalemma of living cells. Numerous studies in non-neuronal tissues have shown that this transport mechanism is reversibly regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the catalytic α subunit and/or associated proteins. In neurons, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transport by NKA is essential for almost all neuronal operations, consuming up to two-thirds of the neuron's energy expenditure. However, little is known about its cellular regulatory mechanisms. Here we have used an electrophysiological approach to monitor NKA transport activity in male rat hippocampal neurons <i>in situ</i>. We report that this activity is regulated by a balance between serine/threonine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation by the protein kinases PKG and PKC inhibits NKA activity, whereas dephosphorylation by the protein phosphatases PP-1 and PP-2B (calcineurin) reverses this effect. Given that these kinases and phosphatases serve as downstream effectors in key neuronal signaling pathways, they may mediate the coupling of primary messengers, such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors, to the NKAs, through which multiple brain functions can be regulated or dysregulated.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA), known as the "Na<sup>+</sup> pump," is a ubiquitous membrane-bound enzyme responsible for generating and maintaining the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane of living cells. In neurons, as in most types of cells, the NKA generates the negative resting membrane potential, which is the basis for almost all aspects of cellular function. Here we used an electrophysiological approach to monitor physiological NKA transport activity in single hippocampal pyramidal cells <i>in situ</i>. We have found that neuronal NKA activity is oppositely regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and we have identified the main protein kinases and phosphatases mediating this regulation. This fundamental form of NKA regulation likely plays a role in multiple brain functions.</p>

<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) is a key player in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Mutations in <i>Camk2a</i> or <i>Camk2b</i> cause intellectual disability in humans, and severe plasticity and learning deficits in mice, indicating unique functions for each isoform. However, considering the high homology between CAMK2A and CAMK2B, it is conceivable that for critical functions, one isoform compensates for the absence of the other, and that the full functional spectrum of neuronal CAMK2 remains to be revealed.</p>
<p>Here we show that germline as well as adult deletion of both CAMK2 isoforms in male or female mice is lethal. Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activity as well as autonomous activity of CAMK2 is essential for survival. Loss of both CAMK2 isoforms abolished LTP, whereas synaptic transmission remained intact. The double-mutants showed no gross morphological changes of the brain, and in contrast to the long-considered role for CAMK2 in the structural organization of the postsynaptic density (PSD), deletion of both CAMK2 isoforms did not affect the biochemical composition of the PSD. Together, these results reveal an essential role for CAMK2 signaling in early postnatal development as well as the mature brain, and indicate that the full spectrum of CAMK2 requirements cannot be revealed in the single mutants because of partial overlapping functions of CAMK2A and CAMK2B.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> CAMK2A and CAMK2B have been studied for over 30 years for their role in neuronal functioning. However, most studies were performed using single knock-out mice. Because the two isoforms show high homology with respect to structure and function, it is likely that some redundancy exists between the two isoforms, meaning that for critical functions CAMK2B compensates for the absence of CAMK2A and vice versa, leaving these functions to uncover. In this study, we generated <i>Camk2a/Camk2b</i> double-mutant mice, and observed that loss of CAMK2, as well as the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent activity of CAMK2 is lethal. These results indicate that despite 30 years of research the full spectrum of CAMK2 functioning in neurons remains to be unraveled.</p>

Abstract
<p>The intrinsic vasopressin system of the olfactory bulb is involved in social odor processing and consists of glutamatergic vasopressin cells (VPCs) located at the medial border of the glomerular layer. To characterize VPCs in detail, we combined various electrophysiological, neuroanatomical, and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging techniques in acute bulb slices from juvenile transgenic rats with eGFP-labeled VPCs. VPCs showed regular non-bursting firing patterns, and displayed slower membrane time constants and higher input resistances versus other glutamatergic tufted cell types. VPC axons spread deeply into the external plexiform and superficial granule cell layer (GCL). Axonal projections fell into two subclasses, with either denser local columnar collaterals or longer-ranging single projections running laterally within the internal plexiform layer and deeper within the granule cell layer. VPCs always featured lateral dendrites and a tortuous apical dendrite that innervated a single glomerulus with a homogenously branching tuft. These tufts lacked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in response to single somatically-evoked action potentials and showed a moderate Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase upon prolonged action potential trains.</p>
<p>Notably, electrical olfactory nerve stimulation did not result in synaptic excitation of VPCs, but triggered substantial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated IPSPs that masked excitatory barrages with yet longer latency. Exogenous vasopressin application reduced those IPSPs, as well as olfactory nerve-evoked EPSPs recorded from external tufted cells. In summary, VPCs can be classified as non-bursting, vertical superficial tufted cells. Moreover, our findings imply that sensory input alone cannot trigger excitation of VPCs, arguing for specific additional pathways for excitation or disinhibition in social contexts.</p>

<p>Physical activity is a critical behavioral variable in many research studies and is, therefore, important to quantify. However, existing methods for measuring physical activity have limitations which include high expense, specialized caging or equipment, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present an open-source, cost-effective, device for measuring rodent activity. Our device is battery powered and designed to be placed in vivarium home cages to enable high-throughput, long-term operation with minimal investigator intervention. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using passive infrared (PIR) sensors and microcontroller-based dataloggers in a rodent home cages to collect physical activity records. To this end, we developed an open-source PIR based data-logging device called the rodent activity detector (RAD). We publish the design files and code so others can readily build the RAD in their own labs. To demonstrate its utility, we used the RAD to collect physical activity data from 40 individually housed mice for up to 10 weeks. This dataset demonstrates the ability of the RAD to (1) operate in a high-throughput installation, (2) detect high-fat diet (HFD)-induced changes in physical activity, and (3) quantify circadian rhythms in individual animals. We further validated the data output of the RAD with simultaneous video tracking of mice in multiple caging configurations, to determine the features of physical activity that it detects. The RAD is easy to build, economical, and fits in vivarium caging. The scalability of such devices will enable high-throughput studies of physical activity in research studies.</p>

Abstract
<p>The transentorhinal cortex (TEC) is an obliquely oriented cortex located in the medial temporal lobe and, together with the entorhinal cortex, is one of the first affected areas in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the most widely accepted hypotheses is that synaptopathy (synaptic alterations and loss) represents the major structural correlate of the cognitive decline observed in AD. However, very few electron microscope (EM) studies are available; the most common method to estimate synaptic density indirectly is by counting, at the light microscopic level, immunoreactive puncta using synaptic markers. To investigate synaptic morphology and possible alterations related to AD, a detailed three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning EM (FIB/SEM) was performed in the neuropil of Layer II of the TEC in human brain samples from non-demented subjects and AD patients. Evaluation of the proportion and shape of asymmetric synapses (AS) and symmetric synapses (SS) targeting spines or dendritic shafts was performed using 3D reconstructions of every synapse. The 3D analysis of 4722 synapses revealed that the preferable targets were spine heads for AS and dendritic shafts for SS, both in control and AD cases. However, in AD patients, we observed a reduction in the percentage of synapses targeting spine heads. Regarding the shape of synapses, in both control cases and AD samples, the vast majority of synapses had a macular shape, followed by perforated or horseshoe-shaped synapses, with fragmented synapses being the least frequent type. Moreover, comparisons showed an increased number of fragmented AS in AD patients.</p>

Abstract
<p>Thanks to patients Phineas Gage and Henry Molaison, we have long known that behavioral control depends on the frontal lobes, whereas declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For decades, cognitive functions—behavioral control, declarative memory—have served as labels for characterizing the division of labor in cortex. This approach has made enormous contributions to understanding how the brain enables the mind, providing a systems-level explanation of brain function that constrains lower-level investigations of neural mechanism. Today, the approach has evolved such that functional labels are often applied to brain networks rather than focal brain regions. Furthermore, the labels have diversified to include both broadly-defined cognitive functions (declarative memory, visual perception) and more circumscribed mental processes (recollection, familiarity, priming). We ask whether a process—a high-level mental phenomenon corresponding to an introspectively-identifiable cognitive event—is the most productive label for dissecting memory. For example, recollection conflates a neurocomputational <i>operation</i> (pattern completion-based retrieval) with a class of <i>representational content</i> (associative, high-dimensional memories). Because a full theory of memory must identify operations and representations separately, and specify how they interact, we argue that processes like recollection constitute inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms. Instead, we advocate considering the component operations and representations of processes like recollection in isolation. For the organization of memory, the evidence suggests that pattern completion is recapitulated widely across the ventral visual stream and MTL, but the division of labor between sites within this pathway can be explained by representational content.</p>

Abstract
<p>Microglia play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis of the CNS. There is growing interest in understanding how microglia influence normal brain function and disease progression. Several microglia-specific Cx3cr1-Cre lines have been developed and have become indispensable tools in many investigations of microglial function. However, some recent studies have reported that these lines may have significant leakage into neurons. Other studies have reported that Cx3cr1 is expressed in non-microglial cells, including neurons and astrocytes, in vitro or in vivo either during brain development or upon neurological insult. All these reports raise serious concerns about the trustworthiness of these Cre-lines and whether the conclusions drawn from previous studies are valid. Here, we found that a floxed fluorescent reporter mouse line which has been frequently used to verify Cre lines displayed spontaneous expression of the GFP reporter, independent of Cre recombinase, thus revealing a potential caveat in assessing cre lines. We further confirmed that two Cx3cr1-Cre mouse lines can drive fluorescent reporter expression largely restrictively in microglia. Finally, we clarified that these two mouse lines maintain microglia-specific expression even following excitatory injury. Together, our findings confirm that two previously created Cx3cr1-Cre lines remain as invaluable tools for studying microglia. Moreover, to ensure the quality of data generated and the soundness of conclusions drawn from such data, it should be compulsory to thoroughly examine reporter lines for spontaneous leakiness when labeling cells to study CNS function and diseases.</p>

Abstract
<p>In the parkinsonian state, the motor cortex and basal ganglia (BG) undergo dynamic remodeling of movement representation. One such change is the loss of the normal contralateral lateralized activity pattern. The increase in the number of movement-related neurons responding to ipsilateral or bilateral limb movements may cause motor problems, including impaired balance, reduced bimanual coordination, and abnormal mirror movements. However, it remains unknown how individual types of motor cortical neurons organize this reconstruction. To explore the effect of dopamine depletion on lateralized activity in the parkinsonian state, we used a partial hemiparkinsonian model [6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion] in Long–Evans rats performing unilateral movements in a right–left pedal task, while recording from primary (M1) and secondary motor cortex (M2). The lesion decreased contralateral preferred activity in both M1 and M2. In addition, this change differed among identified intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) cortical projection neurons, depending on the cortical area. We detected a decrease in lateralized activity only in PT neurons in M1, whereas in M2, this change was observed in IT neurons, with no change in the PT population. Our results suggest a differential effect of dopamine depletion in the lateralized activity of the motor cortex, and suggest possible compensatory changes in the contralateral hemisphere.</p>

Abstract
<p>The aging of the human brain in the absence of diseases is accompanied by subtle changes of neuronal morphology, such as dendrite restructuring, neuronal sprouting, and synaptic deteriorations, rather than neurodegeneration or gross deterioration. Similarly, the nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> does not show neurodegeneration or gross deterioration during normal aging, but displays subtle alterations in neuronal morphology. The occurrence of these age-dependent abnormalities is stochastic and dynamic, which poses a major challenge to fully capture them for quantitative comparison. Here, we developed a semi-automated pipeline for quantitative image analysis of these features during aging. We employed and evaluated this pipeline herein to reproduce findings from previous studies using visual inspection of neuronal morphology. Importantly, our approach can also quantify additional features, such as soma volume, the length of neurite outgrowths, and their location along the aged neuron. We found that, during aging, the soma of neurons decreases in volume, whereas the number and length of neurite outgrowths from the soma both increase. Long-lived animals showed less decrease in soma volume, fewer and shorter neurite outgrowths, and protection against abnormal sharp bends preferentially localized at the distal part of the dendrites during aging. We found a correlation of sharp bends with neurite outgrowth, suggesting the hypothesis that sharp bends might proceed neurite outgrowths. Thus, our semi-automated pipeline can help researchers to obtain and analyze quantitative datasets of this stochastic process for comparison across genotypes and to identify correlations to facilitate the generation of novel hypothesis.</p>

Abstract
<p>Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is an essential behavior for animal survival. Conditioned animals show avoidance and decreased palatability to a conditioned stimulus (CS) on CTA retrieval. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) is involved in CTA retrieval and whether avoidance and palatability in CTA retrieval are processed in the BLA. We developed an experimental chamber for time-course analysis of the behavior to approach a spout and lick a CS. In this experimental chamber, we analyzed the behavior of male rats following microinjections of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist muscimol or saline into the BLA. The rats showed two types of approach behavior: they either (1) approached and licked the spout or (2) approached but did not lick the spout. Muscimol injection into the BLA decreased the frequency of the latter type of approach behavior, indicating that BLA inactivation reduced avoidance to the CS. The muscimol injection into the BLA also significantly increased the consumption of the CS. Lick microstructure analysis demonstrated that intra-BLA muscimol significantly increased licking burst number and size, indicating that BLA inactivation attenuated aversion to the CS as large burst licking is an indicator of high palatability. These results suggest that the increase in CS consumption with intra-BLA muscimol injection was due to alterations in approach and aversive responses to the CS. Therefore, we conclude that the BLA plays an essential role in CTA retrieval by parallel processing of avoidance and palatability.</p>

<p>This paper presents methods that quantify the structure of statistical
interactions within a given data set, and was first used in \cite{Tapia2018}.
It establishes new results on the k-multivariate mutual-informations (I_k)
inspired by the topological formulation of Information introduced in. In
particular we show that the vanishing of all I_k for 2\leq k \leq n of n random
variables is equivalent to their statistical independence. Pursuing the work of
Hu Kuo Ting and Te Sun Han, we show that information functions provide
co-ordinates for binary variables, and that they are analytically independent
on the probability simplex for any set of finite variables. The maximal
positive I_k identifies the variables that co-vary the most in the population,
whereas the minimal negative I_k identifies synergistic clusters and the
variables that differentiate-segregate the most the population. Finite data
size effects and estimation biases severely constrain the effective computation
of the information topology on data, and we provide simple statistical tests
for the undersampling bias and the k-dependences following. We give an example
of application of these methods to genetic expression and unsupervised
cell-type classification. The methods unravel biologically relevant subtypes,
with a sample size of 41 genes and with few errors. It establishes generic
basic methods to quantify the epigenetic information storage and a unified
epigenetic unsupervised learning formalism. We propose that higher-order
statistical interactions and non identically distributed variables are
constitutive characteristics of biological systems that should be estimated in
order to unravel their significant statistical structure and diversity. The
topological information data analysis presented here allows to precisely
estimate this higher-order structure characteristic of biological systems.

<p>Analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results in
constructing functional brain networks. Principal component analysis (PCA) and
independent component analysis (ICA) are widely used to generate functional
brain networks. Moreover, dictionary learning and sparse representation provide
some latent patterns that rules brain activities and they can be interpreted as
brain networks. However, these methods lack modeling dependencies of the
discovered networks. In this study an alternative to these conventional methods
is presented in which dependencies of the networks are considered via
correlated sparsity patterns. We formulate this challenge as a new dictionary
learning problem and propose two approaches to solve the problem effectively.

<p>Preventing early progression of epilepsy and so the severity of seizures
requires an effective diagnosis. Epileptic transients indicate the ability to
develop seizures but humans overlook such brief events in an
electroencephalogram (EEG) what compromises patient treatment. Traditionally,
training of the EEG event detection algorithms has relied on ground truth
labels, obtained from the consensus of the majority of labelers. In this work,
we go beyond labeler consensus on EEG data. Our event descriptor integrates EEG
signal features with one-hot encoded labeler category that is a key to improved
generalization performance. Notably, boosted decision trees take advantage of
singly-labeled but more varied training sets. Our quantitative experiments show
the proposed labeler-hot epileptic event detector consistently outperforms a
consensus-trained detector and maintains confidence bounds of the detection.
The results on our infant EEG recordings suggest datasets can gain higher event
variety faster and thus better performance by shifting available human effort
from consensus-oriented to separate labeling when labels include both, the
event and the labeler category.

The sensory recruitment model envisages visual working memory (VWM) as an emergent property that is encoded and maintained in sensory (visual) regions. The model implies that enhanced sensory-perceptual functions, as in synaesthesia, entail a dedicated VWM-system, showing reduced visual cortex activity as a result of neural specificity. By contrast, sensory-perceptual decline, as in old age, is expected to show enhanced visual cortex activity as a result of neural broadening. To test this model, young grapheme-colour synaesthetes, older adults and young controls engaged in a delayed pair-associative retrieval and a delayed matching-to-sample task, consisting of achromatic fractal stimuli that do not induce synaesthesia. While a previous analysis of this dataset (Pfeifer et al., 2016) has focused on cued retrieval and recognition of pair-associates (i.e. long-term memory), the current study focuses on visual working memory and considers, for the first time, the crucial delay period in which no visual stimuli are present, but working memory processes are engaged. Participants were trained to criterion and demonstrated comparable behavioural performance on VWM tasks. Whole-brain and region-of-interest-analyses revealed significantly lower activity in synaesthetes’ middle frontal gyrus and visual regions (cuneus, inferior temporal cortex) respectively, suggesting greater neural efficiency relative to young and older adults in both tasks. The results support the sensory recruitment model and can explain age and individual WM-differences based on neural specificity in visual cortex.

Over the past 2,500 years, contemplative traditions have explored the nature of the mind using meditation. More recently, neuroimaging research on meditation has revealed differences in brain function and structure in meditators. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. In order to understand how meditation shapes global activity through the brain, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics across the whole-brain functional network using the Intrinsic Ignition Framework. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that different states of consciousness differ in their underlying dynamical complexity, i.e., how the broadness of communication is elicited and distributed through the brain over time and space. In this work, controls and experienced meditators were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). Our results evidenced that the dynamical complexity underlying meditation shows less complexity than during resting-state in the meditator group but not in the control group. Furthermore, we report that during resting-state, the brain activity of experienced meditators showed higher metastability (i.e., a wider dynamical regime over time) than the one observed in the control group. Overall, these results indicate that the meditation state operates in a different dynamical regime compared to the resting-state.

Objective
In children screened for dizziness with vergence disorders, we tested short and long term efficacy of orthoptic vergence training (OVT) and instructions to reduce screen usage.
Methods
Prospective study. Of the 179 children referred for vertigo or dizziness (over 3 years) and ophthalmological disorder as the only problem after complete oto-neuro-vestibular testing, 69 presented vergence insufficiency, and 49 accepted to participate to this study. 109 healthy children served as controls. All subjects performed classic orthoptic evaluation and video binocular movement recordings during various oculomotor tasks. Patients were evaluated before OVT (M0), after the end of OVT (M3) and 6 months later (M9). Statistics compared orthoptic and oculomotor parameters between patients and controls over time with one-way ANCOVA, and mixed models, controlling for age and gender.
Results
Patients reported vertigo that was usually rotatory, lasting &lt;15 min, associated or alternating with headache (50%). Their exposure to small videoscreens and TV was intensive (~3.6 h per day). At M0, all orthoptic and oculomotor parameters were statistically different in patients relative to controls (p&lt;0.0001) except for divergence. At M3, vertigo symptoms had disappeared in all of the patients, and all eye movement parameters improved significantly (p&lt;0.0001). At M9, this improvement remained stable or continued. 
Conclusion
Vergence disorders (assessed by abnormal orthoptic and oculomotor parameters) can generate symptoms of dizziness in children. Orthoptic treatment and instruction to reduce screen usage has a significant and long term effect on vertigo symptoms as well as oculomotor performances. Dizzy children should be screened for vergence disorders.

Limited in part by the spatial resolution of typical in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, recent neuroimaging studies have only identified a connectivity-based shell-core-like partitioning of the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in humans. This has hindered the process of making a more refined description of the Acb using non-invasive neuroimaging technologies and approaches. In this study, high-resolution ex vivo macaque brain diffusion MRI data were acquired to investigate the tractography-based parcellation of the Acb. Our results identified a shell-core-like partitioning in macaques that is similar to that in humans as well as an alternative solution that subdivided the Acb into four parcels, the medial shell, the lateral shell, the ventral core, and the dorsal core. Furthermore, we characterized the specific anatomical and functional connectivity profiles of these Acb subregions and generalized their specialized functions to establish a fine-grained macaque Acb brainnetome atlas. This atlas should be helpful in neuroimaging, stereotactic surgery, and comparative neuroimaging studies to reveal the neurophysiological substrates of various diseases and cognitive functions associated with the Acb.

Electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments are contaminated by large gradient artefacts (GA). The amplitude of the GA depends on the area of the wire loops formed by the EEG leads, as well as on the rate of switching of the magnetic field gradients, which are essential for MR imaging. Average artefact subtraction (AAS), the method most commonly used method for GA correction, relies on the EEG amplifier having a large enough dynamic range to characterize the artefact voltages. Low-pass filtering (250 Hz cut-off) is generally used to attenuate the high-frequency voltage fluctuations of the GA, but even with this precaution channel saturation can occur, particularly during acquisition of high spatial resolution MRI data. Previous work has shown that the ribbon cable, used to connect the EEG cap and amplifier, makes a significant contribution to the GA, since the cable geometry produces large effective wire-loop areas. However, by appropriately connecting the wires of the ribbon cable to the EEG cap it should be possible to minimize the overall range and root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the GA by producing partial cancellation of the cap and cable contributions. Here by modifying the connections of the EEG cap to a 1 m ribbon cable we were able to reduce the range of the GA for a high-resolution coronal echo planar Imaging (EPI) acquisition by a factor of ~ 1.6 and by a factor of ~ 1.15 for a standard axial EPI acquisition. These changes could potentially be translated into a reduction in the required dynamic range, an increase in the EEG bandwidth or an increase in the achievable image resolution without saturation, all of which could be beneficially exploited in EEG-fMRI studies. The re-wiring could also prevent the system from saturating when small subject movements occur using the standard recording bandwidth.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00683">On the Role of Adenosine A2A Receptor Gene Transcriptional Regulation in Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

Adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) have attracted considerable attention as an important molecular target for the design of Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapeutic compounds. Here, we studied the transcriptional regulation of the A2AR gene in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from PD patients and in the striatum of the well-validated, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD mouse model.  We report an increase in A2AR mRNA expression and protein levels in both human cells and mice striata, and in the latter we could also observe a consistent reduction in DNA methylation at gene promoter and an increase in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9. Of particular relevance in clinical samples, we also observed higher levels in the receptor gene expression in younger subjects, as well as in those with less years from disease onset and less severe disease according to clinical scores. In conclusion, the present findings provide further evidence of the relevant role of A2AR in PD and, based on the clinical data, highlight its potential role as disease biomarker for PD especially at the initial stages of disease development. Furthermore, our preclinical results also suggest selective epigenetic mechanisms targeting gene promoter as tool for the development of new treatments.

Objectives: To evaluate white matter hyperintensities (WMH) quantification reproducibility from multiple aspects of view, examine the effects of scan-rescan procedure, types of scanner, imaging protocols, scanner software upgrade, and automatic segmentation tools on WMH quantification results using MRI. 
Methods: Six post-stroke subjects (4 males; mean age 62.8, range 58-72 years) were scanned and rescanned with both 3D T1-weighted, 2D and 3D T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI across four different MRI scanners within 12 hours. Two automated WMH segmentation and quantification tools were used to measure WMH volume based on each MR scan. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV).
Results: Experimental results show that the best reproducibility was achieved by using 3D T2-FLAIR MRI under intra-scanner setting with CV ranging from 2.69% to 2.97%, while the largest variability resulted from comparing WMH volumes measured based on 2D T2-FLAIR MRI with those of 3D T2-FLAIR MRI, with CV values in the range of 15.62%-29.33%. The WMH quantification variability based on 2D MRIs is larger than 3D MRIs due to their large slice thickness. In addition to image acquisition, the choice of automatic WMH segmentation tool also has a large impact on WMH quantification.
Conclusions: WMH reproducibility is one of the primary issues to be considered in multicenter and longitudinal studies. The study provides solid guidance in assisting multicenter and longitudinal study design to achieve meaningful results with enough power.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00668">Identifying Imaging Markers for Predicting Cognitive Assessments Using Wasserstein Distances Based Matrix Regression</a></h4>

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe type of neurodegeneration which worsens human memory, thinking and cognition along a temporal continuum. How to identify the informative  phenotypic neuroimaging markers and accurately predict cognitive assessment are crucial for early detection and diagnosis Alzheimer's disease. Regression models are widely used to predict the relationship between imaging biomarkers and cognitive assessment, and identify discriminative neuroimaging markers. Most existing methods use different matrix norms as the similarity measures of the empirical loss or regularization to improve the prediction performance, but ignore the inherent geometry of the cognitive data. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel robust matrix regression model with imposing Wasserstein distances on both loss function and regularization. It successfully integrate Wasserstein distance into the regression model, which can excavate the latent geometry of cognitive data. We introduce an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed new model with convergence analysis. Empirical results on cognitive data of the  ADNI cohort demonstrate the great effectiveness of the proposed method for clinical cognitive predication.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00618">Characterizing Rapid Fluctuations of Resting State Functional Connectivity in Demyelinating, Neurodegenerative, and Psychiatric Conditions: From Static to Time-Varying Analysis</a></h4>

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at resting state (RS) has been widely used to characterize the main brain networks. Functional connectivity (FC) has been mostly assessed assuming that FC is stationary across the whole fMRI examination. However, FC is highly variable at a very fast time-scale, as demonstrated by neurophysiological techniques. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) is a novel approach that allows capturing reoccurring patterns of interaction among functional brain networks. Aim of this review is to provide a description of the methods currently used to assess dFC on RS fMRI data, and to summarize the main results of studies applying dFC in healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). An overview of the main results obtained in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions is also provided.
The most popular dFC approach is based on the so-called “sliding windows”, in which the RS fMRI acquisition is divided in small temporal segments (windows). A window of fixed length is shifted over RS fMRI time courses, and data within each window are used to calculate FC and its variability over time. Sliding windows can be combined with clustering techniques to identify recurring FC states or used to assess global dFC properties of large-scale functional networks or specific brain regions. 
dFC studies have used heterogeneous methodologies so far. Despite this, similar results have been obtained across investigations. In healthy subjects, the default-mode network (DMN) exhibited the highest degree of connectivity dynamism. In MS patients, abnormal global dFC properties and dFC strengths were found mainly in sensorimotor, DMN and salience networks, and were associated with more severe structural MRI damage and with more severe physical and cognitive disability. Conversely, abnormal dFC measures of the temporal network were correlated with better cognitive performances and less severe fatigue. In patients with neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, dFC abnormalities of the DMN, attention and executive networks were associated to more severe clinical manifestations.
Dynamic FC helps to provide novel insights into fundamental properties of functional networks, and improves the understanding of brain reorganization mechanisms. Future technical advances might help to clarify dFC association with disease prognosis and response to treatment.

To become acquainted with large-scale environments such as cities people combine direct
experience and indirect sources such as maps. To ascertain which type of spatial knowledge is
acquired by which source is difficult to evaluate. Using virtual reality enables the possibility
to investigate whether knowledge is learned by direct experience or the use of a map
differentially. Therefore, we designed a large virtual city, comprised of over 200 houses, and
evaluated spatial knowledge acquisition after city exploration with an interactive map
following one and three 30-minute exploration sessions. We tested subjects’ knowledge of the
orientation of houses facing directions towards cardinal north, of orientations of houses facing
directions relative to each other and pointing from one house to another. Our results revealed
that increased familiarity after extended exploration with the map improved task accuracy.
Further, it revealed task differences, caused mainly by a better accuracy in the relative
orientation task than the pointing task. Time for cognitive reasoning improved overall task
accuracy. Learning with our VR city map revealed an absence of distance effect, an alignment
effect of tested house orientation towards map north and an angular difference effect between
tested stimuli. Self-reported knowledge of cardinal directions learned in the real environment
was positively correlated with task accuracy testing houses orientations towards cardinal
north. Overall, our results suggest that participants learned spatial information that is directly
available in the interactive map, while a spatial task that needed integration of learned
knowledge stayed at lower accuracy levels.

There is sufficient evidence to believe that variations in the error-related negativity (ERN) are linked to dispositional characteristics in individuals. However, explanations of individual differences in the amplitude of the ERN cannot be derived from functional theories of the ERN. The ERN has a counterpart that occurs after correct responses (correct-response negativity, CRN). Based on the assumption that ERN and CRN reflect an identical cognitive process, variations in CRN might be associated with dispositional characteristics as well. Higher CRN amplitudes have been found to reflect task engagement. In the present study, a simple-choice-reaction task was used to investigate ERN and CRN amplitudes in relation to their score on a conscientiousness scale. The task consisted of a simple rule that required pressing the left or right key when a circle or square appeared, respectively. During alternative conditions that occur infrequently, participants were instructed to violate or reverse the previously established response rules. Smaller ΔERN amplitudes (manifested in almost equal CRN and ERN amplitudes) and a tendency of better task performance from participants scoring high on the conscientiousness scale might indicate a greater focus on the task and higher motivation of responding correctly. In addition, higher Pc amplitudes directly following the CRN indicated that the response monitoring system of less conscientious participants showed a higher disengagement. The role of individual differences in CRN amplitude should be studied in future experiments on performance monitoring.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00237">Promoting Psychological Well-Being Through an Evidence-Based Mindfulness Training Program</a></h4>

Psychological well-being is a core feature of mental health, and may be defined as including hedonic (enjoyment, pleasure) and eudaimonic (meaning, fulfilment) happiness, as well as resilience (coping, emotion regulation, healthy problem solving). To promote psychological well-being, it is helpful to understand the underlying mechanisms associated with this construct and then develop targeted and effective training programs. In this perspective paper, we discuss key components and potential brain-body mechanisms related to psychological well-being and propose mindfulness training as a promising way to improve it. Based on a series of RCT studies of one form of mindfulness training in adolescents and adults, the integrative body-mind training (IBMT), we use IBMT as an exemplar to provide research evidence of the positive effects of mindfulness training on psychological well-being. We focus on one of the mechanisms by which IBMT enhances psychological well-being – the interaction between mind (mindfulness) and body (bodifulness) -- which involves both the central nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. We also highlight the role of brain self-control networks, including the anterior cingulate cortex/prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC), in improving psychological well-being. We suggest that mindfulness training may be a promising program that promotes the synergistic engagement of mind and body to achieve the goals of enhancing psychological well-being.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00040">A Computational Model of Attention Control in Multi-Attribute, Context-Dependent Decision Making</a></h4>

Real-life decisions often require a comparison of multi-attribute options with various benefits and costs, and the evaluation of each option depends partly on the other ones in the choice set (i.e., the choice context). Although reinforcement learning models have successfully described choice behavior, it remains unclear how multi-attribute information is taken into account for making a context-dependent decision in reinforcement learning algorithms. Here we develop a computational model of attention control that includes context effects on multi-attribute decisions, linking a context-dependent choice model with a reinforcement learning model. The overall model suggests that the distinctiveness of attributes guides an individual’s preferences among multi-attribute options via an attention-control mechanism that determines whether choices are selectively biased toward the most distinctive attribute (selective attention) or proportionally distributed based on the relative distinctiveness of attributes (divided attention). To test the model, we conducted a behavioral experiment in rhesus monkeys, in which they made simple multi-attribute decisions over three conditions that manipulated the degree of distinctiveness between alternatives: (1) four foods of different size and calorie; (2) four pieces of the same food in different colors; and (3) four identical pieces of food. The model simulation of the choice behavior captured the preference bias (i.e., overall preference structure) and the choice persistence (repeated choices) in the empirical data, providing evidence for the respective influences of attention and memory on preference bias and choice persistence. Our study provides insights into computations underlying multi-attribute decisions, linking attentional control to decision-making processes.

Spiking activities of midbrain dopaminergic neurons are critical for key brain functions including motor control and affective behaviors. Voltage-gated Na+ channels determine neuronal excitability and action potential (AP) generation. Previous studies on dopaminergic neuron excitability mainly focused on Na+ channels at the somatodendritic compartments. Properties of axonal Na+ channels, however, remain largely unknown. Using patch-clamp recording from somatic nucleated patches and isolated axonal blebs from the axon initial segment (AIS) of dopaminergic neurons in mouse midbrain slices, we found that AIS channel density is approximately 4-9 fold higher than that at the soma. Similar voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation was observed between somatic and axonal channels in both SNc and VTA cells, except that SNc somatic channels inactivate at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials (Vm). In both SNc and VTA, axonal channels take longer time to inactivate at a subthreshold depolarization Vm level, but are faster to recover from inactivation than somatic channels. Moreover, we found that immunosignals of Nav1.2 accumulate at the AIS of dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 immunosignals are not detectible. Together, our results reveal a high density of Na+ channels at the AIS and their molecular identity. In general, somatic and axonal channels of both SNc and VTA dopaminergic neurons share similar biophysical properties. The relatively delayed inactivation onset and faster recovery from inactivation of axonal Na+ channels may ensure AP initiation at high frequencies and faithful signal conduction along the axon.

Mitochondria are the critical organelles for energy metabolism and cell survival in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies demonstrated that mitochondria can intercellularly transfer between mammalian cells. In neural cells, astrocytes transfer mitochondria into neurons in a CD38-dependent manner. Here, using co-culture system of neural cell lines, primary neural cells, and human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural cells, we further revealed that mitochondria dynamically transferred between astrocytes and also from neuronal cells into astrocytes, to which CD38/cADPR signaling and mitochondrial Rho GTPases (MIRO1 and MIRO2) contributed. The transfer consequently elevated mitochondrial membrane potential in the recipient cells. By introducing Alexander disease (AxD)-associated hotspot mutations (R79C, R239C) into GFAP gene of hPSCs and subsequently inducing astrocyte differentiation, we found that GFAP mutations impaired mitochondrial transfer from astrocytes and reduced astrocytic CD38 expression. Thus, our study suggested that mitochondria dynamically transferred between neural cells and revealed that AxD-causing mutations disrupted the astrocytic transfer, providing a potential pathogenic mechanism in AxD.

Trans-synaptic neurotransmission of both electrical and neurochemical information in the central nervous system (CNS) is achieved through a highly interactive network of neuron-specific synaptic proteins that include pre-synaptic and post-synaptic elements. These elements include a family of several well-characterized integral- and trans-membrane synaptic core proteins necessary for the efficient operation of this complex signaling network, and include the pre-synaptic proteins: (i) neurexin-1 (NRXN-1); (ii) the synaptosomal-associated phosphoprotein-25 (SNAP-25); and (iii) the phosphoprotein synapsin-2 (SYN-2); and the post-synaptic elements: (iv) neuroligin (NLGN), a critical cell adhesion protein; and (v) the SH3-ankyrin repeat domain, proline-rich cytoskeletal scaffolding protein SHANK3. All five of these pre- and post-synaptic proteins have been found to be significantly down-regulated in primary human neuronal-glial (HNG) cell co-cultures after exposure to Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide (BF-LPS). Interestingly, LPS has also been reported to be abundant in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affected brain cells where there are significant deficits in this same family of synaptic components. This ‘Perspectives‘ paper will review current research progress and discuss the latest findings in this research area. Overall these experimental results provide evidence (i) that gastrointestinal (GI) tract-derived Gram-negative bacterial exudates such as BF-LPS express their neurotoxicity in the CNS in part through the directed down-regulation of neuron-specific neurofilaments and synaptic signaling proteins; and (ii) that this may explain the significant alterations in immune-responses and cognitive deficits observed after bacterial-derived LPS exposure to the human CNS.

The incoming signals from injured sensory neurons upon peripheral inflammation are processed in the dorsal horn of spinal cord, where glial cells accumulate and play a critical role in initiating allodynia (increased pain in response to light-touch). However, how painful stimuli in the periphery engage glial reactivity in the spinal cord remains unclear. Here, we found that a hind paw inflammation induced by CFA produce robust morphological changes in spinal astrocytes and microglia compatible with the reactive phenotype. Strikingly, we discovered that a single intrathecal injection with venom peptides that inhibit calcium channels reversed all the glial pathological features of the peripheral inflammation. These effects were more apparent in rats treated with the Phα1β spider toxin (non-specific calcium channel antagonist) than ω-MVIIA cone snail toxin (selective N-type calcium channel antagonist). These data reveal for the first time a venom peptide acting on glial structural remodeling in vivo. We, therefore, suggest that calcium-dependent plasticity is an essential trigger for glial cells to initiate reactivity, which may represent a new target for the antinociceptive effects of Phα1β and ω-MVIIA toxins in inflammatory pain conditions

Sepsis-associated encephalopathy induces cognitive dysfunction via mechanisms that commonly involve neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity impairment of the hippocampus. The β2–adrenoceptor (β2–AR) is a G–protein coupled receptor that regulates immune response and synaptic plasticity, whereas its dysfunction has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we hypothesized abnormal β2–AR signaling is involved in sepsis–induced cognitive impairment. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to mimic the clinical human sepsis-associated encephalopathy. The levels of hippocampal β2–AR, proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF–α), interleukin–1β (IL–1β), IL–6, cAMP–response element binding protein (CREB), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), post–synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and NMDA receptor 2 B subtypes (GluN2B) were determined at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 7 d, and 16 d after CLP. For the interventional study, mice were treated with β2–AR agonist clenbuterol in two ways: early treatment (immediately following CLP) and delayed treatment (on the eighth day following CLP). Neurobehavioral performances were assessed by open field and fear conditioning tests. Here, we found that hippocampal β2–AR expression was significantly decreased starting from 12 h and persisted until 16 d following CLP. Besides, sepsis mice also exhibited increasing neuroinflammation, down-regulated CREB/BDNF, decreasing PSD95 and GluN2B expression, and displayed hippocampus–dependent cognitive impairments. Notably, early clenbuterol treatment alleviated sepsis–induced cognitive deficits by polarizing microglia toward an anti–inflammatory phenotype, reducing proinflammatory cytokines including IL–1β, TNF–α , and up–regulating CREB/BDNF, PSD95 and GluN2B. Intriguingly, delayed clenbuterol treatment also improved cognitive impairments by normalization of hippocampal CREB/BDNF, PSD95 and GluN2B. In summary, our results support the beneficial effects of both early and delayed clenbuterol treatment, which suggests that activation of β2–AR has a translational value in sepsis–associated organ dysfunction including cognitive impairments.

Microglial receptors CD33 and TREM2 exhibit opposite effects on Aβ pathology and microglial activity in AD mice. In crosstalk between these receptors, TREM2 is required for differential gene expression in 5xFAD mice deficient for CD33 and acts downstream of CD33.

<p>by Aravind Chandrasekaran, Arpita Upadhyaya, Garegin A. Papoian</p>

Bundled actin structures play a key role in maintaining cellular shape, in aiding force transmission to and from extracellular substrates, and in affecting cellular motility. Recent studies have also brought to light new details on stress generation, force transmission and contractility of actin bundles. In this work, we are primarily interested in the question of what determines the stability of actin bundles and what network geometries do unstable bundles eventually transition to. To address this problem, we used the MEDYAN mechano-chemical force field, modeling several micron-long actin bundles in 3D, while accounting for a comprehensive set of chemical, mechanical and transport processes. We developed a hierarchical clustering algorithm for classification of the different long time scale morphologies in our study. Our main finding is that initially unipolar bundles are significantly more stable compared with an apolar initial configuration. Filaments within the latter bundles slide easily with respect to each other due to myosin activity, producing a loose network that can be subsequently severely distorted. At high myosin concentrations, a morphological transition to aster-like geometries was observed. We also investigated how actin treadmilling rates influence bundle dynamics, and found that enhanced treadmilling leads to network fragmentation and disintegration, while this process is opposed by myosin and crosslinking activities. Interestingly, treadmilling bundles with an initial apolar geometry eventually evolve to a whole gamut of network morphologies based on relative positions of filament ends, such as sarcomere-like organization. We found that apolar bundles show a remarkable sensitivity to environmental conditions, which may be important in enabling rapid cytoskeletal structural reorganization and adaptation in response to intracellular and extracellular cues.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FjN9IniVQbo" width="1" />

Transplanted stromal cells have demonstrated considerable promise as therapeutic agents in diverse disease settings. Paracrine signaling can be an important mediator of these therapeutic effects at the sites of acute or persistent injury and inflammation. As many stromal cell types, including bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs), display tissue-specific responses, there...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/CpkxhiIrDhY" width="1" />

Characterized by a dismal survival rate and limited response to therapy, glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most aggressive human malignancies. Recent studies of the role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the progression of GBMs have demonstrated that TAMs are significant contributors to tumor growth, invasion, and therapeutic resistance.

Abstract<p>Despite the importance of the prefrontal-amygdala network for emotion processing, valence-dependent coupling within this network remains elusive. In this study, we assessed the effect of emotional valence on brain activity and effective connectivity. We tested which functional pathways within the prefrontal-amygdala network are specifically engaged during the processing of emotional valence. Thirty-three healthy adults were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a dynamic faces and dynamic shapes matching task. The valence of the facial expressions varied systematically between positive, negative, and neutral across the task. Functional contrasts determined core areas of the emotion processing circuitry, comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the right lateral prefrontal cortex, the amygdala and the right fusiform face area. Dynamic causal modelling demonstrated that the bidirectional coupling within the prefrontal-amygdala circuitry is modulated by emotional valence. Additionally, Bayesian model averaging showed significant bottom-up connectivity from the amygdala to the MPFC during negative and neutral, but not positive, valence. Thus, our study provides strong evidence for alterations of bottom-up coupling within the prefrontal-amygdala network as a function of emotional valence. Thereby our results not only advance the understanding of the human prefrontal-amygdala circuitry in varying valence context, but, moreover, provide a model to examine mechanisms of valence-sensitive emotional dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Recent neuroimaging studies have emphasized the importance of valence-sensitivity within the prefrontal-amygdala network during emotion processing. Yet, it remains elusive which specific pathways are involved in processing affective information, and how this information is integrated in the brain’s network. In particular, the amygdala’s role in signaling valence information to the cortex is subject to ongoing discussions. Moreover, as aberrant brain function has been found in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex in various debilitating psychiatric disorders, understanding the mechanisms of processing emotional stimuli with different valence (positive, negative, neutral) is particularly relevant for the field. Our findings indicate changes in coupling strength as a function of emotional valence within the prefrontal-amygdala network.</p>

<p>Understanding neurocognitive computations will require not just localizing
cognitive information distributed throughout the brain but also determining how
that information got there. We review recent advances in linking (empirical and
simulated) brain network organization with cognitive information processing.
Building on these advances, we offer a new framework for understanding the role
of connectivity in cognition - network coding (encoding/decoding) models. These
models utilize connectivity to specify the transfer of information via neural
activity flow processes, successfully predicting the formation of cognitive
representations (e.g., face selectivity in the fusiform face area). The success
of these models supports the possibility that localized neural functions
mechanistically emerge (are computed) from distributed activity flow processes
that are specified primarily by connectivity patterns.

<p>Bounded diffusion processes are models of transport phenomena with wide
applicability across many fields. These processes are described by their
probability density functions (PDFs), which often obey Fokker-Planck equations
(FPEs). While obtaining analytical solutions is often possible in unbounded
regions, obtaining closed-form solutions to the FPE is more challenging once
absorbing boundaries are present. As a result, analyses of these processes have
largely relied on approximations or direct simulations. In this paper, we
studied two-dimensional, time-homogeneous, spatially-correlated diffusion with
absorbing boundaries. Our main results is the explicit construction of a full
family of closed-form solutions for their PDFs using the method of images
(MoI). We found that such solutions can be built if and only if the correlation
coefficient $\rho$ between the two diffusing processes takes one of a numerable
set of values. Using a geometric argument, we derived the complete set of
$\rho$'s where such solutions can be found. Solvable $\rho$'s are given by
$\rho = - \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{k} \right)$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \{
-1\}$. Solutions were validated in simulations. Qualitative behaviors of the
process appear to vary smoothly over $\rho$, allowing extrapolation from our
solutions to cases with unsolvable $\rho$'s.

<p>The scientific study of consciousness is a new field which has emerged as a
response to groundbreaking developments in neuroscience, cognitive psychology
and analytic philosophy. Its aim is to develop a scientific account, formulated
in terms of formal mathematical laws or regularities, of how conscious
experience relates to the physical domain (e.g. to brain processes). Even
though several models of consciousness have been proposed in the literature,
details of the underlying conceptual terminology and formal framework remain
poorly understood. This paper aims to improve this situation by proposing a
grounding of the scientific study of consciousness which is based on a concise
definition of the object of investigation and gives rise to a clear-cut
mathematical framework for models of consciousness. Several examples are
studied and an application of this framework is given. The underlying
definitions are a further development of the grounding of the scientific study
of consciousness developed by David Chalmers and Thomas Nagel.

<p>In lieu of an abstract here is the first paragraph: No other species remotely
approaches the human capacity for the cultural evolution of novelty that is
accumulative, adaptive, and open-ended (i.e., with no a priori limit on the
size or scope of possibilities). By culture we mean extrasomatic
adaptations--including behavior and technology--that are socially rather than
sexually transmitted. This chapter synthesizes research from anthropology,
psychology, archaeology, and agent-based modeling into a speculative yet
coherent account of two fundamental cognitive transitions underlying human
cultural evolution that is consistent with contemporary psychology. While the
chapter overlaps with a more technical paper on this topic (Gabora &amp; Smith
2018), it incorporates new research and elaborates a genetic component to our
overall argument. The ideas in this chapter grew out of a non-Darwinian
framework for cultural evolution, referred to as the Self-other Reorganization
(SOR) theory of cultural evolution (Gabora, 2013, in press; Smith, 2013), which
was inspired by research on the origin and earliest stage in the evolution of
life (Cornish-Bowden &amp; C\'ardenas 2017; Goldenfeld, Biancalani, &amp; Jafarpour,
2017, Vetsigian, Woese, &amp; Goldenfeld 2006; Woese, 2002). SOR bridges
psychological research on fundamental aspects of our human nature such as
creativity and our proclivity to reflect on ideas from different perspectives,
with the literature on evolutionary approaches to cultural evolution that
aspire to synthesize the behavioral sciences much as has been done for the
biological scientists. The current chapter is complementary to this effort, but
less abstract; it attempts to ground the theory of cultural evolution in terms
of cognitive transitions as suggested by archaeological evidence.

Prions are lethal pathogens, which cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals. They are unique infectious agents and are composed of self-propagating multi-chain assemblies of misfolded host-encoded prion protein (PrP). Understanding prion structure is fundamental to understanding prion disease pathogenesis however to date, the high-resolution structure of authentic ex vivo infectious prions remains unknown. Advances in determining prion structure have been severely impeded by the difficulty in recovering relatively homogeneous prion particles from infected brain and definitively associating infectivity with the PrP assembly state. Recently however, images of highly infectious ex vivo PrP rods that produce prion-strain specific disease phenotypes in mice have been obtained using cryo-electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. These images have provided the most detailed description of ex vivo mammalian prions reported to date and have established that prions isolated from multiple strains have a common hierarchical structure. Misfolded PrP is assembled into 20 nm wide rods containing two fibres, each with double helical repeating substructure, separated by a characteristic central gap 8–10 nm in width. Irregularly structured material with adhesive properties distinct to that of the fibres is present within the central gap of the rod. Prions are clearly distinguishable from non-infectious recombinant PrP fibrils generated in vitro and from all other propagating protein structures so far described in other neurodegenerative diseases. The basic architecture of mammalian prions appears to be exceptional and fundamental to their lethal pathogenicity.

Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) is a Na+-dependent transporter that plays a key role in glutamate homeostasis by removing excess glutamate in the central nervous system (CNS).  GLT-1 dysregulation occurs in various neurological diseases including Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and epilepsy.  Downregulation or dysfunction of GLT-1 has been a common finding across these diseases but how this occurs is still under investigation.  This review aims to highlight post-translational regulation of GLT-1 which leads to its downregulation including sumoylation, palmitoylation, nitrosylation, ubiquitination and subcellular localization.  Various therapeutic interventions to restore GLT-1, their proposed mechanism of action and functional effects will be examined as potential treatments to attenuate the neurological symptoms associated with loss or downregulation of GLT-1.

Numerous neurodegenerative diseases including prion, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are characterized by accumulation of protein aggregates in brain. Prion disease is unique in that the natively folded prion protein forms diverse misfolded aggregates with distinct molecular conformations (strains), which underlie different disease phenotypes. In addition, the conformational strains are able to self-propagate their unique conformations by recruiting normal protein monomers and converting their conformations to misfolded conformers. There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests other aggregation-prone proteins including tau and alpha-synuclein associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, respectively, also behave like a prion that has conformational strains with self-propagation (seeding) property. Moreover, misfolded protein aggregates can promote misfolding and aggregation of different proteins through cross-seeding, which might be associated with co-occurrence of multiple neurodegenerative diseases in the same patient. Elucidation of diverse conformational strains with self-propagation capability and of molecular basis for the cross-talk between misfolded proteins is essential to the development of effective therapeutic intervention.

Although maladaptive sensory processing has been observed among individuals with persistent heightened anxiety, it is unclear if difficulties processing sensory input early in life lead to anxiety disorders in adulthood and what mechanisms would drive this progression. In a transdiagnostic clinical sample of 231 adults characterized by heightened difficulties with emotion regulation, the present study sought to examine whether (a) childhood sensory processing disorder (SPD) symptoms predict an increased probability of an anxiety disorder diagnosis in adulthood and (b) difficulties with emotion regulation and adult SPD symptoms mediate this relationship. Participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis-I disorders and self-reported symptoms of SPD experienced in childhood and adulthood. Results from suggested that childhood SPD symptoms were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of a lifetime anxiety disorder diagnosis. Difficulties with emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between childhood SPD and (a) any anxiety disorder in adulthood and, specifically (b) current generalized anxiety disorder. Further, we found evidence for a candidate model accounting for the relationship among childhood SPD, adulthood SPD, difficulties with emotion regulation, and anxiety disorders in adulthood. Specifically, our data indicated that high symptoms of SPD in childhood may lead to high SPD symptoms in adulthood, which then lead to high emotion dysregulation, ultimately conferring vulnerability for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Taken together, these findings provide preliminary evidence for how sensory processing impairments in childhood may relate to anxiety through difficulties regulating emotion regulation.

Objectives: Trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia (TPHN) often presents with moderate to severe pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. Conventional analgesic treatments are poorly effective, which seriously affects the quality of life. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for the treatment of TPHN. 
Methods: A total of 90 TPHN patients were selected between January 2014 and December 2016 in the Department of Pain Management, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups according to the order of enrollment (n=45 per group): group A, peripheral nerve (supraorbital nerve, infraorbital nerve and mental nerve) PRF; group B, gasserian ganglion PRF. Follow-up assessments of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain assessment, SF-36 health status questionnaire, total efficiency rate, and drug dosage of anticonvulsants and opioid analgesics were performed at time points of 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. 
Results: At each postsurgery time point, the VAS decreased, SF-36 (physical and mental components) increased, and drug dosage of anticonvulsants and opioids analgesics decreased in both treatment groups; values at each time point were significantly different from presurgery values (P&lt;0.05). Compared with group A, VAS decreased, SF-36 increased, and dosage of anticonvulsants and opioids analgesics decreased significantly in group B (P&lt;0.05). The total efficiency rates one year after surgery in group A and group B were 68.9% and 86.7%, respectively. The total efficiency rate of group B was statistically higher than that of group A (P&lt;0.05).
Conclusion: PRF relieved TPHN, and gasserian ganglion PRF was more effective than peripheral nerve PRF. The method was effective and improved the quality of life of the patients. PRF is recommended as a treatment for TPHN.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00703">The Effects of Stimulator, Waveform, and Current Direction on Intracortical Inhibition and Facilitation: A TMS Comparison Study</a></h4>

Background: Cortical function is dependent on the balance between excitatory and inhibitory influences. In the human motor cortex, surrogates of these interactions can be measured in-vivo, non-invasively with double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To compare results from data acquired with different available setups and bring data together, it is inevitable to determine whether different TMS setups lead to comparable or differential results.
Objective: We assessed and compared short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) testing four different experimental conditions.
Methods: SICI and ICF were studied with different stimulators (Magstim BiStim² or MagVenture MagPro X100), waveforms (monophasic or biphasic), current directions (anterior-posterior or posterior-anterior) at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1, 3, 10, 15 ms.
Results: We were not able to detect differences for SICI and ICF, when comparing the tested conditions, except for 3 ms SICI in which the anterior-posterior current direction led to stronger modulation. Correlation analysis suggested comparability for 3 ms SICI for the Magstim monophasic posterior-anterior condition with both tested MagVenture conditions. 
Conclusions: 3 ms SICI data sets obtained with two different, commonly used stimulators (Magstim BiStim² or MagVenture MagPro X100) with conventionally used stimulation parameters are largely comparable.  This may allow the combination of data sets in an open science view.

Background:
Cranial irradiation is a common therapy for the treatment of brain tumors, but unfortunately patients suffer from side effects, particularly cognitive impairment, caused by neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory mechanisms. Finding a therapeutic agent protecting hippocampal neurons would be beneficial. Fingolimod (FTY720), a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator approved for multiple sclerosis, is an immunosuppressant and known to enhance proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs). 
Objectives:
To investigate whether pre-treatment with FTY720 protects NPCs in vitro and in vivo from irradiation-induced damage. 
Methods:
NPCs were isolated from E13 C57BL/6 wildtype mice, treated at day 0 of differentiation with FTY720 and irradiated on day 6 with 1 Gy. NPCs were analyzed for markers of cell death (PI, Caspase 3), proliferation (Ki67), and differentiation (DCX, βIII-tubulin). Adult C57BL/6 wildtype mice were treated with FTY720 (1 mg/kg) and received a single dose of 6 Gy cranial irradiation at day 7. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed DCX and BrdU as markers of neurogenesis and Iba1, GFAP, and CD3 to visualize inflammation in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone. B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J DCX-luc reporter mice were used for bioluminescence imaging to evaluate the effect of FTY720 on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and the spinal cord of naïve mice. 
Results:
FTY720 protected NPCs against irradiation induced cell death in vitro. Treatment with FTY720 dose-dependently reduced the number of PI+ cells 24 and 96 h after irradiation without effecting proliferation or neuronal differentiation. In vivo treatment resulted in a significant survival of DCX+ neurons in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone 4 weeks after irradiation as well as a slight increase of proliferating cells. FTY720 inhibited microglia activation 24 h after X-ray exposure in the dentate gyrus, while astrocyte activation was unaffected and no lymphocyte infiltrations were found. In naïve mice, FTY720 treatment for 4 weeks had no effect on neurogenesis. 
Conclusions:
FTY720 treatment of NPCs prior to X-ray exposure and of mice prior to cranial irradiation is neuroprotective. No effects on neurogenesis were found.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00685">Tracking the Main States of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Resting State</a></h4>

Dynamical changes have been recently tracked in functional connectivity (FC) calculated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI), when a person is conscious but not carrying out a directed task during scanning. Diverse dynamical FC states (dFC) are believed to represent different internal states of brain, in terms of brain-regional interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol, the signed community clustering with the optimized modularity by two-step procedures, to track dynamical whole brain functional connectivity (dWFC) states. This protocol is assumption free without a priori threshold for the number of clusters. By applying our method on sliding window based dWFC’s with automated anatomical labeling 2 (AAL2), three main dWFC states were extracted from R-fMRI datasets in Human Connectome Project, that are independent on window size. Through extracting the FC features of these states, we found the functional links in state 1 (WFC-C1) mainly involved visual, somatomotor, attention and cerebellar (posterior lobe) modules. State 2 (WFC-C2) was similar to WFC-C1, but more FC’s linking limbic, default mode and frontoparietal modules and less linking the cerebellum, sensory and attention modules. State 3 had more FC’s linking default mode, limbic, and cerebellum, compared to WFC-C1 and WFC-C2. With test of robustness and stability, our work provides a solid, hypothesis-free tool to detect dWFC states for the possibility of tracking rapid dynamical change in FCs among large data set.

Background and Purpose: Cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) are the leading cause of death in the first week following stroke. Despite this, current treatments are limited and fail to address the underlying mechanisms of swelling, highlighting the need for targeted treatments. When screening promising novel agents, it is essential to use clinically-relevant large animal models to increase the likelihood of successful clinical translation.  As such, we sought to develop a survival model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in the sheep and subsequently characterize the temporal profile of cerebral edema and elevated ICP following stroke in this novel, clinically-relevant model. 

Methods: Merino-sheep (27M;31F) were anesthetized and subject to 2 hours tMCAO with reperfusion or sham surgery. Following surgery, animals were allowed to recover and returned to their home pens. At preselected times points ranging from 1 to 7 days post-stroke, animals were re-anesthetized, ICP measured for 4 hours, followed by imaging with MRI to determine cerebral edema, midline shift and infarct volume (T2, FLAIR, DWI). Animals were subsequently euthanized and their brain removed for immunohistochemical analysis. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were also collected and analyzed for substance P (SP) using ELISA.

Results: ICP and MRI scans were normal in sham animals. Following stroke, ICP rose gradually over time and by 5 days was significantly (p&lt;0.0001) elevated above sham levels. Profound cerebral edema was observed as early as 2 days post-stroke and continued to evolve out to 6 days, resulting in significant midline shift which was most prominent at 5 days post-stroke (p&lt;0.01), in keeping with increasing ICP. Serum SP levels were significantly elevated (p&lt;0.01) by 7 days post tMCAO.

Conclusion: We have successfully developed a survival model of ovine tMCAO and characterized the temporal profile of ICP. Peak ICP elevation, cerebral edema and midline shift occurred at day 5-6 following stroke, accompanied by an elevation in serum SP. Our findings suggest that novel therapeutic agents screened in this model targeting cerebral edema and elevated ICP would most likely be effective when administered prior to 5 days, or as early as possible following stroke onset.

Oxytocin is known to play an important role in trust, whereas the involvement of other peptide hormones has not been evaluated. In this study, we focused on microsatellite polymorphisms in the intron of the arginine-vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) gene and examined whether the association between the repeat lengths in the intron of AVPR1a is associated with trust and reciprocity in humans. Four hundred and thirty-three participants played the trust game, answered the attitudinal trust question, and their buccal cells were collected. Results showed that men with a short form of AVPR1a tend to send more money to the opponent, even if there is a possibility of being betrayed by the opponent. Additionally, people with a short form of AVPR1a tended to return money to the opponent who trusts them. However, attitudinal trust was not associated with AVPR1a. These results indicate that arginine-vasopressin receptor 1a plays an important role in trust and reciprocal behaviors.

Identifying neurocognitive mechanisms underlying optimism bias is essential to understand its benefits for well-being and mental health. The combined cognitive biases hypothesis suggests that biases (e.g., in expectancies and attention) interact and mutually enforce each other. Whereas, in line with this hypothesis, optimistic expectancies have been shown to guide attention to positive information, reverse causal effects have not been investigated yet. Revealing such bidirectional optimism-attention interactions both on a behavioral and neural level could explain how cognitive biases contribute to a self-sustaining upward spiral of positivity. In this behavioral study, we hypothesized that extensive training to direct attention to positive information enhances optimism bias. To test this hypothesis, for two weeks 149 participants underwent a daily on-line 80-trial attention bias modification training (ABMT) to accepting and away from rejecting faces or a neutral control training. Participants in the ABMT group were instructed to click as quickly as possible on the accepting face among 15 rejecting faces randomly displayed on a 4-by-4 matrix; participants in the control group were instructed to click on the five-petaled flower depicted among 15 seven-petaled flowers. Comparative optimism bias and state optimism were measured via questionnaires before, after one, and after two training weeks. ABMT enhanced comparative optimism bias, whereas control training did not. Our findings reveal that ABMT to positive social information causally influences comparative optimism bias and may, thereby, trigger the biases’ benefits for well-being and mental health. These results can (a) stimulate future neurophysiological research in the area of positive psychology and (b) reveal an innovative low-cost and easy-to-access intervention that may support psychotherapy in times of rising numbers of patients with psychological disorders.

Brain training is a large and expanding industry, and yet there is a recurrent and ongoing debate concerning its scientific basis or evidence for efficacy. Much of evidence for the efficacy of brain training within this debate is from small-scale studies that do not assess the type of ‘brain training’, the specificity of transfer effects, or the length of training required to achieve a generalised effect. To explore these factors, we analyse cross-sectional data from two large Internet-cohort studies (total N=60,222) to determine whether cognition differs at the population level for individuals who report that they brain train on different devices, and across different timeframes, with programmes in common use circa 2010-2013. Examining scores for an assessment of working-memory, reasoning and verbal abilities shows no cognitive advantages for individuals who brain train. This contrasts unfavourably with significant advantages for individuals who regularly undertake other cognitive pursuits such as computer, board and card games. However, finer grained analyses reveal a more complex relationship between brain training and cognitive performance. Specifically, individuals who have just begun to brain train start from a low cognitive baseline compared to individuals who have never engaged in brain training, whereas those who have trained for a year or more have higher working-memory and verbal scores compared to those who have just started, thus suggesting an efficacy for brain training over an extended period of time. The advantages in global function, working memory, and verbal memory after several months of training are plausible and of clinically relevant scale. However, this relationship is not evident for reasoning performance or self-report measures of everyday function (e.g., employment status and problems with attention). These results accord with the view that although brain training programs can produce benefits, these might extend to tasks that are operationally similar to the training regime. Furthermore, the duration of training regime required for effective enhancement of cognitive performance is longer than that applied in most previous studies.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00045">A Game-Theoretical Network Formation Model for C. elegans Neural Network</a></h4>

Studying and understanding human brain structures and functions have become one of the most challenging issues in neuroscience today. However, the mammalian nervous system is made up of hundreds of millions of neurons and billions of synapses.
This complexity made it impossible to reconstruct such a huge nervous system in the laboratory. So, most researchers focus on C.elegans neural network. The C.elegans neural network is the only biological neural network that is fully mapped. This nervous system is the simplest neural network that exists. However, many fundamental behaviors like movement emerge from this basic network. These features made C.elegans a convenient case to study the nervous systems. Many studies try to propose a network formation model for C.elegans neural network. However, these studies could not meet all characteristics of C.elegans neural network such as significant factors that play a role in the formation of C.elegans neural network. Thus, new models are needed to be proposed in order to explain all aspects of C.elegans neural network.

In this paper, a new model based on game theory is proposed in order to understand the factors affecting the formation of nervous systems, which meet the C.elegans frontal neural network characteristics. In this model, neurons are considered to be agents. The strategy for each neuron includes either making or removing links to other neurons.
 After choosing the basic network, the utility function is built using structural and functional factors. In order to find the coefficients for each of these factors, linear programming is used. Finally, the output network is compared with C.elegans frontal neural network and previous models. The results implicate that the game-theoretical model proposed in this paper can better predict the influencing factors in the formation of C.elegans neural network compared to previous models.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00305">Malformations of Human Neocortex in Development – Their Progenitor Cell Basis and Experimental Model Systems</a></h4>

Malformations of the human neocortex in development constitute a heterogeneous group of complex disorders, resulting in pathologies such as intellectual disability and abnormal neurological/psychiatric conditions such as epilepsy or autism. Advances in genomic sequencing and genetic techniques have allowed major breakthroughs in the field, revealing the molecular basis of several of these malformations. Here, we focus on those malformations of the human neocortex, notably microcephaly and macrocephaly, where an underlying basis has been established at the level of the neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) from which neurons are directly or indirectly derived. Particular emphasis is placed on NPC cell biology and NPC markers. A second focus of this review is on experimental model systems used to dissect the underlying mechanisms of malformations of the human neocortex in development at the cellular and molecular level. The most commonly used model system have been genetically modified mice. However, although basic features of neocortical development are conserved across the various mammalian species, some important differences between mouse and human exist. These pertain to the abundance of specific NPC types and/or their proliferative capacity, as exemplified in the case of basal radial glia. These differences limit the ability of mouse models to fully recapitulate the phenotypes of malformations of the human neocortex. For this reason, additional experimental model systems, notably the ferret, non-human primates and cerebral organoids, have recently emerged as alternatives and shown to be of increasing relevance. It is therefore important to consider the benefits and limitations of each of these model systems for studying malformations of the human neocortex in development.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00304">Interleukin-1β Promotes Schwann Cells De-Differentiation in Wallerian Degeneration via the c-JUN/AP-1 Pathway</a></h4>

Schwann cells (SCs) de-differentiate in Wallerian degeneration (WD) following nerve injury and, by doing so, can actively promote nerve repair and functional recovery. An innate-immune response is an important component of the complex of events referred to as WD. Damaged PNS SCs produce IL-1β and other inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that, in addition to a role in immune responses, IL-1β participates in de-differentiation and proliferation of SCs. 
qPCR and ELISA demonstrated that expression of Il-1β mRNAs and protein increased after nerve injury. Immunofluorescent staining and western blotting demonstrated that expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) was significantly increased and levels of myelin protein zero (MPZ) were significantly decreased after IL-1β exposure compared with control groups in vitro WD. Additionally, qPCR demonstrated that IL-1β elevated expression of the de-differentiation gene p75NTR and decreased expression of myelination locus MPZ and promoted SCs de-differentiation. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining, western blotting, qPCR and ELISA revealed that IL-1β promoted c-JUN expression and activation of AP-1 activity of SCs in an in vitro WD model. Finally, Immunofluorescent staining illustrated that IL-1β elevated expression of Ki67 in Schwann cells nuclei, the apoptosis of Schwann cells were detected by TUNEL. SCs of WD produce IL-1β which promotes SCs de-differentiation and proliferation.

The definition of consciousness remains a difficult issue that requires urgent understanding and resolution. Currently, consciousness research is an intensely focused area of neuroscience. However, to establish a greater understanding of the concept of consciousness, more detailed, intrinsic neurobiological research is needed. Additionally, an accurate assessment of the level of consciousness may strengthen our awareness of this concept and provide new ideas for patients undergoing clinical treatment of consciousness disorders. In addition, research efforts that help elucidate the concept of consciousness have important scientific and clinical significance. This review presents the latest progress in consciousness research and proposes our assumptions with regard to the network of consciousness.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00300">Local Drug Delivery for Prevention of Hearing Loss</a></h4>

Systemic delivery of therapeutics for targeting the cochlea to prevent or treat hearing loss is challenging. Systemic drugs have to cross the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB).  BLB can significantly prevent effective penetration of drugs in appropriate concentrations to protect against hearing loss caused by inflammation, ototoxic drugs or acoustic trauma. This obstacle may be obviated by local administration of protective agents. This route can deliver higher concentration of drug compared to systemic application and preclude systemic side effects. Protective agents have been administered by intra-tympanic injection in numerous preclinical studies. Drugs such as steroids, etanercept, D and L-methionine, pifithrin-alpha, adenosine agonists, melatonin, kenpaullone (a cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor) have been reported to show efficacy against cisplatin ototoxicity in animal models. Several siRNAs have been shown to ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity when administered by intra-tympanic injection. The application of corticosteroids and a number of other drugs with adjuvants appears to enhance efficacy. Administration of siRNAs to knock down AMPK kinase, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) or G9a in the cochlea have been found to ameliorate noise-induced hearing loss. The local administration of these compounds appears to be effective in protecting the cochlea against damage from cisplatin or noise trauma.  Furthermore the intra-tympanic route yields maximum protection in the basal turn of the cochlea which is most vulnerable to drug ototoxicity and noise trauma. There appears to be very little transfer of these agents to the systemic circulation.  This would avoid potential side effects including interference with anti-tumor efficacy of cisplatin. Nanotechnology offers strategies to effectively deliver protective agents to the cochlea. This review summarizes the pharmacology of local drug delivery by intra-tympanic injection to prevent hearing loss caused by cisplatin and noise exposure in animals. Future refinements in local protective agents provide exciting prospects for amelioration of hearing loss resulting from cisplatin or noise exposure.

Background：Exogenous insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) is known to be neuroprotective in animal models with brain insults, while it can also cause hyperexcitability in rodents. In this regard, the role of endogenous IGF-1 in brain responses to brain insults like excitotoxicity, a common pathology in brain injuries remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the potential role of cell-specific endogenous IGF-I in the kainic acid (KA) -induced degeneration of the neurons. 
Methods: KA was given to primary cultured cortical neurons and co-cultured astrocytes were added as a supportive system. We evaluated the cell proliferation rate, IGF-1 level in different groups and applied the PCR-Chip assay to explore the downstream of IGF-1. In addition, we applied the viral transfer of astrocytic IGF-1 to rodents treated with KA and assessed the associated molecular marker and behavioural outcomes in these rodents.
Results: We found KA induced increased cell death and hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons; co-cultured astrocytes could prevent these pathologies, and this rescuing effect was abrogated with blockade of the astrocytic IGF-1 with AG1024 (IGF-1R inhibitor). PCR-Chip assay identified that astrocytic IGF-1 could decrease the p-GSK-3 at Tyr 216 in neurons treated with KA and this effect was abrogated with AG1024 as well. In addition, in-vivo study showed that gene transfer of astrocytic IGF-1 decreased p-tau and cognitive dysfunction in KA mice. 
Conclusion: Our results show astrocytic IGF-1 exhibit neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative processes in the CNS.

Hibernation is a natural phenomenon in many species which helps them to survive under extreme ambient conditions, such as cold temperatures and reduced availability of food in the winter months. It is characterized by a dramatic and regulated drop of body temperature, which in some cases can be near 0°C. Additionally, neural control of hibernation is maintained over all phases of a hibernation bout, including entrance into, during and arousal from torpor, despite a marked decrease in overall neural activity in torpor. In the present review we provide an overview on what we know about neuronal activity in the hibernating brain focusing on cold-induced adaptations. We discuss pioneer and more recent in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological data and molecular analyses of activity markers which strikingly contributed to our understanding of the brain’s sensitivity to dramatic changes in temperature across the hibernation cycle. Neuronal activity is markedly reduced with decreasing body temperature, and many neurons may fire infrequently in torpor at low brain temperatures. Still, there is convincing evidence that specific regions maintain their ability to generate action potentials in deep torpor, at least in response to adequate stimuli. Those regions include the peripheral system and primary central regions. However, further experiments on neuronal activity are needed to more precisely determine temperature effects on neuronal activity in specific cell types and specific brain nuclei.

Neurodevelopmental disorders, including those involving intellectual disability, are characterized by abnormalities in formation and functions of synaptic circuits. Traditionally, research on synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission in health and disease focused on neurons, however, a growing number of studies have highlighted the role of astrocytes in this context. Tight structural and functional interactions of astrocytes and synapses indeed play important roles in brain functions, and the repertoire of astroglial regulations of synaptic circuits is large and complex.

<p>by Elyse H. Norton, Luigi Acerbi, Wei Ji Ma, Michael S. Landy</p>

Optimal sensory decision-making requires the combination of uncertain sensory signals with prior expectations. The effect of prior probability is often described as a shift in the decision criterion. Can observers track sudden changes in probability? To answer this question, we used a change-point detection paradigm that is frequently used to examine behavior in changing environments. In a pair of orientation-categorization tasks, we investigated the effects of changing probabilities on decision-making. In both tasks, category probability was updated using a sample-and-hold procedure: probability was held constant for a period of time before jumping to another probability state that was randomly selected from a predetermined set of probability states. We developed an ideal Bayesian change-point detection model in which the observer marginalizes over both the current run length (i.e., time since last change) and the current category probability. We compared this model to various alternative models that correspond to different strategies—from approximately Bayesian to simple heuristics—that the observers may have adopted to update their beliefs about probabilities. While a number of models provided decent fits to the data, model comparison favored a model in which probability is estimated following an exponential averaging model with a bias towards equal priors, consistent with a conservative bias and a flexible variant of the Bayesian change-point detection model with incorrect beliefs. We interpret the former as a simpler, more biologically plausible explanation suggesting that the mechanism underlying change of decision criterion is a combination of on-line estimation of prior probability and a stable, long-term equal-probability prior, thus operating at two very different timescales.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/It-Ebd4v1rU" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Navigating through natural environments requires localizing objects along three distinct spatial axes. Information about position along the horizontal and vertical axes is available from an object’s position on the retina, while position along the depth axis must be inferred based on second-order cues such as the disparity between the images cast on the two retinae. Past work has revealed that object position in 2D retinotopic space is robustly represented in visual cortex, and can be robustly predicted using a multivariate encoding model, in which an explicit axis is modeled for each spatial dimension. However, no study to date has used an encoding model to estimate a representation of stimulus position in depth. Here, we recorded BOLD fMRI while human subjects viewed a stereoscopic random-dot sphere at various positions along the depth (Z) and the horizontal (X) axes, and the stimuli were presented across a wider range of disparities (out to ~40 arcmin) compared to previous neuroimaging studies. In addition to performing decoding analyses for comparison to previous work, we built encoding models for depth position and for horizontal position, allowing us to directly compare encoding between these dimensions. Our results validate this method of recovering depth representations from retinotopic cortex. Furthermore, we find convergent evidence that depth is encoded most strongly in dorsal area V3A.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Estimating the position of objects in depth is essential for human behaviors such as reaching and navigating in a 3D environment. Single neurons in visual cortex appear to support these abilities by encoding the depth position of stimuli, however, only a few studies have investigated how depth information is encoded by population-level representations in the human brain. Here, we collected fMRI data and used two multivariate analysis methods to examine the accuracy of depth encoding in retinotopic visual cortex. Our results show that depth representations are widespread in retinotopic cortex, with most accurate and robust encoding in intermediate dorsal region V3A. These findings are in agreement with past work, and may inform future studies of human 3D spatial perception.</p>

Homozygous and heterozygous mutations in GBA1, the gene implicated in Gaucher disease, increase the risk and severity of Parkinson disease (PD). We evaluated the design, phenotype, strengths, and limitations of current GBA1-associated PD mouse models. Although faithful modeling of a genetic risk factor poses many challenges, the different approaches taken were successful in revealing predisposing abnormalities in heterozygotes for GBA1 mutations and demonstrating the deleterious effects of GBA1 impairment on the PD course in PD models.

<p>by Peter Vincent, Thomas Parr, David Benrimoh, Karl J Friston</p>

Living creatures must accurately infer the nature of their environments. They do this despite being confronted by stochastic and context sensitive contingencies—and so must constantly update their beliefs regarding their uncertainty about what might come next. In this work, we examine how we deal with uncertainty that evolves over time. This prospective uncertainty (or imprecision) is referred to as volatility and has previously been linked to noradrenergic signals that originate in the locus coeruleus. Using pupillary dilatation as a measure of central noradrenergic signalling, we tested the hypothesis that changes in pupil diameter reflect inferences humans make about environmental volatility. To do so, we collected pupillometry data from participants presented with a stream of numbers. We generated these numbers from a process with varying degrees of volatility. By measuring pupillary dilatation in response to these stimuli—and simulating the inferences made by an ideal Bayesian observer of the same stimuli—we demonstrate that humans update their beliefs about environmental contingencies in a Bayes optimal way. We show this by comparing general linear (convolution) models that formalised competing hypotheses about the causes of pupillary changes. We found greater evidence for models that included Bayes optimal estimates of volatility than those without. We additionally explore the interaction between different causes of pupil dilation and suggest a quantitative approach to characterising a person’s prior beliefs about volatility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/igJm9qjK6Ho" width="1" />

Cancer is mainly caused by somatic genome alterations (SGAs). Precision oncology involves identifying and targeting tumor-specific aberrations resulting from causative SGAs. We developed a novel tumor-specific computational framework that finds the likely causative SGAs in an individual tumor and estimates their impact on oncogenic processes, which suggests the disease mechanisms that are acting in that tumor. This information can be used to guide precision oncology. We report a tumor-specific causal inference (TCI) framework, which estimates causative SGAs by modeling causal relationships between SGAs and molecular phenotypes (e.g., transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomic changes) within an individual tumor. We applied the TCI algorithm to tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and estimated for each tumor the SGAs that causally regulate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in that tumor. Overall, TCI identified 634 SGAs that are predicted to cause cancer-related DEGs in a significant number of tumors, including most of the previously known drivers and many novel candidate cancer drivers. The inferred causal relationships are statistically robust and biologically sensible, and multiple lines of experimental evidence support the predicted functional impact of both the well-known and the novel candidate drivers that are predicted by TCI. TCI provides a unified framework that integrates multiple types of SGAs and molecular phenotypes to estimate which genome perturbations are causally influencing one or more molecular/cellular phenotypes in an individual tumor. By identifying major candidate drivers and revealing their functional impact in an individual tumor, TCI sheds light on the disease mechanisms of that tumor, which can serve to advance our basic knowledge of cancer biology and to support precision oncology that provides tailored treatment of individual tumors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CjIns0WTCck" width="1" />

<p>by Juan J. Cáceres, Alberto Paccanaro</p>

Network medicine approaches have been largely successful at increasing our knowledge of molecularly characterized diseases. Given a set of disease genes associated with a disease, neighbourhood-based methods and random walkers exploit the interactome allowing the prediction of further genes for that disease. In general, however, diseases with no known molecular basis constitute a challenge. Here we present a novel network approach to prioritize gene-disease associations that is able to also predict genes for diseases with no known molecular basis. Our method, which we have called Cardigan (ChARting DIsease Gene AssociatioNs), uses semi-supervised learning and exploits a measure of similarity between disease phenotypes. We evaluated its performance at predicting genes for both molecularly characterized and uncharacterized diseases in OMIM, using both weighted and binary interactomes, and compared it with state-of-the-art methods. Our tests, which use datasets collected at different points in time to replicate the dynamics of the disease gene discovery process, prove that Cardigan is able to accurately predict disease genes for molecularly uncharacterized diseases. Additionally, standard leave-one-out cross validation tests show how our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods at predicting genes for molecularly characterized diseases by 14%-65%. Cardigan can also be used for disease module prediction, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 87%-299%.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8WzpOXWlG88" width="1" />

<p>by Jane Loveless, Konstantinos Lagogiannis, Barbara Webb</p>

The <i>Drosophila</i> larva executes a stereotypical exploratory routine that appears to consist of stochastic alternation between straight peristaltic crawling and reorientation events through lateral bending. We present a model of larval mechanics for axial and transverse motion over a planar substrate, and use it to develop a simple, reflexive neuromuscular model from physical principles. The mechanical model represents the midline of the larva as a set of point masses which interact with each other via damped translational and torsional springs, and with the environment via sliding friction forces. The neuromuscular model consists of: 1. segmentally localised reflexes that amplify axial compression in order to counteract frictive energy losses, and 2. long-range mutual inhibition between reflexes in distant segments, enabling overall motion of the model larva relative to its substrate. In the absence of damping and driving, the mechanical model produces axial travelling waves, lateral oscillations, and unpredictable, chaotic deformations. The neuromuscular model counteracts friction to recover these motion patterns, giving rise to forward and backward peristalsis in addition to turning. Our model produces spontaneous exploration, even though the nervous system has no intrinsic pattern generating or decision making ability, and neither senses nor drives bending motions. Ultimately, our model suggests a novel view of larval exploration as a deterministic superdiffusion process which is mechanistically grounded in the chaotic mechanics of the body. We discuss how this may provide new interpretations for existing observations at the level of tissue-scale activity patterns and neural circuitry, and provide some experimental predictions that would test the extent to which the mechanisms we present translate to the real larva.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JJidlxXe2c4" width="1" />

Electrocommunication and -localization behaviors of weakly electric fish have been studied extensively in the lab, mostly by means of short-term observations on constrained fish. Far less is known about their behaviors in more natural-like settings, where fish are less constrained in space and time. We tracked individual fish in a population of fourteen brown ghost knifefish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) housed in a large 2  indoor tank based on their electric organ discharges (EOD). The tank contained four different natural-like microhabitats (gravel, plants, isolated stones, stacked stones). In particular during the day individual fish showed preferences for specific habitat which provided appropriate shelter. Male fish with higher EOD frequencies spent more time in their preferred habitat during the day, moved more often between habitats during the night, and less often during the day in comparison to low-frequency males. Our data thus revealed a link between dominance indicated by higher EOD frequency, territoriality, and a more explorative personality in male A. leptorhynchus. In females, movement activity during both day and night correlated positively with EOD frequency. In the night, fish of either sex moved to another habitat after about 6 seconds on average. During the day, the average transition time was also very short at about 20 seconds. However, these activity phases were interrupted by phases of inactivity that lasted on average about 20 minutes during the day, but only 3 minutes in the night. The individual preference for daytime retreat sites did not reflect the frequent explorative movements at night.

Accumulation of misfolded proteins results in cellular stress, and is detected by specific sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum, collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). It has been prominently proposed that the UPR is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In the present study, the levels of the UPR proteins and mRNA transcripts were quantified in post mortem brain tissue from PD patients and matched controls. The level of a key mediator of the UPR pathway, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), was significantly decreased in temporal cortex and cingulate gyrus, whereas there were no significant changes in the caudate nucleus, prefrontal or parietal cortex regions. On the other hand, GRP78 mRNA level was significantly increased in caudate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, prefrontal, and parietal cortex regions. GRP78 protein level was also measured in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, but there were no differences in these levels between PD patients and control subjects.  Furthermore, immunofluorescence labelling of the CD4+ T cells from PD patients showed that GRP78 protein is found in the cytoplasm. However, GRP78 level in PD patients was not significantly different from control subjects. Unlike the previous Lewy body dementia study, the present investigation reports reduced cortical protein, but increased transcript levels of GPR78 in PD. In summary, these data provide further evidence that GRP78 regulation is dysfunctional in the brains of PD patients.

The development of implantable neuroelectrodes is advancing rapidly as these tools are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in clinical practice, especially for the treatment of traumatic and neurodegenerative disorders. Electrodes have been exploited in a wide number of neural interface devices, such as deep brain stimulation, which is one of the most successful therapies with proven efficacy in the treatment of diseases like Parkinson or epilepsy. However, one of the main caveats related to the clinical application of electrodes is the nervous tissue response at the injury site, characterized by a cascade of inflammatory events, which culminate in chronic inflammation, and, in turn, result in the failure of the implant over extended periods of time. To overcome current limitations of the most widespread macroelectrode based systems, new design strategies and the development of innovative materials with superior biocompatibility characteristics are currently being investigated. 
This review describes the current state of the art of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models available for the study of neural tissue response to implantable microelectrodes. We particularly highlight new models with increased complexity that closely mimic in vivo scenarios and that can serve as promising alternatives to animal studies for investigation of microelectrodes in neural tissues. Additionally, we also express our view on the impact of the progress in the field of neural tissue engineering on neural implant research.

Background and Purpose: The morbidity and early mortality associated with stroke is largely attributable to cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Existing pharmacotherapies do not target the underlying pathophysiology and are often ineffective in sustainably lowering ICP whilst decompressive craniectomy (DC) surgery is life-saving yet with surgical/peri-operative risk and increased morbidity in the elderly. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for therapies that directly target the mechanisms of edema genesis. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by substance P (SP) binding to the tachykinin NK1 receptor (NK1-r), is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, cerebral edema and poor outcome post-stroke. NK1-r antagonist treatment ameliorates BBB dysfunction and cerebral edema in rodent stroke models. However, treatment has not been investigated in a large animal model, an important step towards clinical translation. Consequently, the current study compared the efficacy of NK1-r antagonist treatment to DC surgery in reducing ICP post-stroke in a clinically-relevant ovine model. 

Methods: Anaesthetized female Merino sheep (65±6 kg, 18-24 months) underwent sham surgery (n=4) or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (n=22). Stroke animals were randomized into one of 5 treatments: 1xNK1 bolus (4h), 2xNK1 bolus (4h;9h), 3xNK1 bolus (4h;9h;14h), DC surgery (performed at 4h) or saline vehicle. ICP, blood pressure and blood gases were monitored for 24h post-stroke. At 24h post-stroke anaesthetized animals underwent MRI, followed by perfusion and brains removed and processed for histological assessment. 

Results: 2xNK1, 3xNK1 administration or DC surgery significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced ICP compared to vehicle. 1xNK1 was ineffective in sustainably lowering ICP. On MRI, midline shift and cerebral edema were more marked in vehicles compared to NK1-r treatment groups. 

Conclusion: Two or 3 boluses of NK1-r antagonist reduced ICP comparable to DC surgery, suggesting it may provide a novel alternative to invasive surgery for management of elevated ICP.

Arterial input function (AIF) is estimated from perfusion images as a basic curve for the calculus of hemodynamic variables used as surrogate markers of the vascular status of tissues. However, at present, identification of AIF is made manually leading by prior knowledge. We propose an automatic estimation of  AIF in perfusion images, which is based on a multi-stream 3D CNN, which combined spatial and temporal features together to estimate AIF ROI. The model is trained by manual annotations. The proposed method was trained and tested by 100 cases of PWI images. The result was evaluated by dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which reached to 0.79. The trained model had a better performance than the traditional method. After segmentation of AIF ROI, AIF was calculated by average of all voxels in ROI. We compared AIF result with manual and traditional method, and father process parameter maps such as Tmax and rCBF. The result had a better performance. We had applied the method on a cloud platform Estroke, which can  evaluation ischemic penumbra to help make treatment decision.

A major challenge in neuroscience is to understand what happens to a brain as it ages. Such insights could make it possible to distinguish between individuals who will undergo typical aging and those at risk for neurodegenerative disease. Over the last quarter century, thousands of human brain imaging studies have probed the neural basis of age-related cognitive decline.  “Aging” studies generally enroll adults over the age of 65, a historical precedent rooted in the average retirement age of U.S. wage-earners. A consequence of this research tradition is that it overlooks one of the most significant neuroendocrine changes in a woman’s life: the transition to menopause. The menopausal transition is marked by an overall decline in ovarian sex steroid production – up to 90% in the case of estradiol – a dramatic endocrine change that impacts multiple biological systems, including the brain. Despite sex differences in the risk for dementia, the influence that biological sex and sex hormones have on the aging brain is historically understudied, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the aging process. In this Perspective, we highlight the influence that endocrine factors have on the aging brain. We devote particular attention to the neural and cognitive changes that unfold in the middle decade of life, as a function of reproductive aging. Next, we consider emerging evidence from animal and human studies that other endocrine factors occurring earlier in life (e.g. pregnancy, hormonal birth control use) also shape the aging process.

The amygdala, which is involved in human social information processing and social emotional response neuronal circuits, is segmented into three subregions that are responsible for perception, affiliation, and aversion. Though there is different functional and effective connectivity (EC) among these networks, age-related structural changes and associations between structure and function within the amygdala remain unclear. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data (106 participants) to investigate age-related structural changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) of amygdalar subregions. We also examined the relationship between FA and EC within the subregions. We found that the FA of the amygdalar subregions exhibited inverted-U shape trends with age. Moreover, over the human lifespan, there were negative correlations between the FA of the right ventrolateral amygdala (VLA.R) and the Granger-based EC (GC) of VLA.R → perception network (PerN), the FA of the VLA.R and the GC of the net flow from VLA.R → PerN, and the FA of the left dorsal amygdala (DorA.L) and the GC of the aversion network (AveN). Conversely, there was a positive correlation between the FA of the DorA.L and the GC of the net flow from DorA.L → AveN. Our results suggest that age-related changes in function of brain are constrained by the underlying white matter architectures, while the functional information flow changes influence white matter structure. This work increases our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms in the maturation and aging process.

The analysis of Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is of ulterior importance to aid in the diagnosis of mental disease and to increase our understanding of the brain.  Traditionally, clinical EEG has been analyzed in terms of temporal waveforms, looking at rhythms in spontaneous activity, subjectively identifying troughs and peaks in Event-Related Potentials (ERP), or by studying graphoelements in pathological sleep stages.
Additionally, the discipline of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) requires new methods to decode patterns from non-invasive EEG signals.  This field is developing alternative communication pathways to transmit volitional information from the Central Nervous System. The technology could potentially enhance the quality of life of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders and other mental illness. This work mimics what electroencephalographers have been doing clinically, visually inspecting and categorizing phenomena within the EEG by the extraction of features from images of signal plots.  These features are constructed based on the calculation of histograms of oriented gradients from pixels around the signal plot. It aims to provide a new objective framework to analyze, characterize and classify EEG signal waveforms. The feasibility of the method is outlined by detecting the P300, an ERP elicited by the oddball paradigm of rare events, and implementing an offline P300-based BCI Speller.  The validity of the proposal is shown by offline processing a public dataset of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and an own dataset of healthy subjects.

The artiodactyl brain has multiple levels of vascular pooling and the rostral epidural rete mirabile (RERM) at its base. The current study is the first of its kind to precisely demonstrate the arterial vasculature of the dromedary brain, utilizing a new casting method with coloured latex and epoxy paint.
In total, 35 freshly slaughtered dromedary heads were injected with coloured latex or coloured epoxy paint prior to dissection in order to reveal cerebral vasculature; Ten processed heads were chemically digested with 5% potassium hydroxide to obtain hard casts of cerebral arteries and anastomosing structures. 
The outcomes of this study ascertain the distinct vascular features of dromedaries that set them apart from other artiodactyls. In addition to the RERM, the dromedary possesses a well-developed ophthalmic and chiasmatic rete. The dromedary is similar to giraffe, goat, cat and pig in the contribution of middle meningeal artery to the rete mirabile; however, dromedaries have several arteries emerging directly from the cerebral arterial circle that supply the choroid plexus and pineal gland. Additionally, dromedaries exhibit a dominant basilar system that dominates the, blood supply to the medulla oblongata, pons, and cerebellum. In our study, we were able to graphically prove the lack of connection between the areas supplied by vertebrobasilar system and carotid system in the dromedary. Furthermore, the vertebral artery does not branch into the basilar artery; instead, it acts as a contributing vessel to the ventral spinal artery that later fuse to form the basilar artery. 
This study employed the new casting method to illustrate a new arterial source to RERM and the various anastomoses among arterial sources supplying the brain in the dromedary. These anastomoses play an important role in maintaining an uninterrupted cerebral blood supply, decreasing the vulnerability of the fragile brain against ischaemia and stroke, as well as, play an important role in maintaining blood pressure and flow in long-necked dromedaries when they raise or lower their heads.

Stroke patients have only limited therapeutic options and often remain with considerable disabilities. To promote neurological recovery, angiogenesis in the ischemic peri-infarct region has been recognized as an encouraging therapeutic target. Despite advances in mechanistic understanding of vascular growth and repair, effective and safe angiogenic treatments are currently missing. Besides the most intensively studied angiogenic growth factors, recent research has indicated that the process of vascular sprouting and migration also requires the participation of guidance molecules, many of which were initially identified as regulators of axonal growth.

Neural correlates of consciousness (for brevity NCC) are foundational to the scientific study of consciousness. David Chalmers (2000) has provided the most informative and influential definition of NCC, according to which neural correlates are minimally sufficient for consciousness. However, the sense of sufficiency needs further clarification since there are several relevant senses with different entailments. In section one of this article, we give an overview of the desiderata for a good definition of NCC and Chalmers’s definition. The second section analyzes the merit of understanding the sufficiency of neural correlates for corresponding consciousness according to three relevant types of sufficiency: logical, metaphysical, and physical. In section three, a theoretical approach to consciousness studies is suggested in light of the sense in which NCC are sufficient for consciousness. Section four addresses a concern some might have about this approach. By the end, it will become apparent that our conception of NCC has important implications for research methodology, neuroethics, and the vitality of the search for NCC.

The tendency of customers’ preference to their local brands over the foreign ones is known as the consumer ethnocentrism, and it is one of the important issues in international marketing. This study aims at identifying the behavioral and neural correlates of Consumer Ethnocentrism in the field of brand preference by using Event-Related Potential (ERP). We sampled subjects from two ethnic groups, the Chinese ethnic group and the sub-Sahara black Africans group from the Zhejiang University. The subjects faced two sequential stimuli, S1 followed by S2. The S1 consisted of 40 pictures of 20 Chinese and 20 Africans black peoples wearing traditional clothes, and S2 consisted of 40 fake brand-logos which were divided randomly into two groups of 20 each. The subjects were informed that the people in the S1 purchased and recommended the products with the brand-logos presented in S2, and the subjects were asked to rate their preference degree toward these logos. The brand-logos were called the “in-group recommended logos” if the recommender in S1 were the same race as the subjects, otherwise, the “out-group recommended logos”.The results revealed that the race of the brand-logo recommender highly impacted the Chinese subjects’ preference for the brand-logos. The N200 component elicited by in-group recommended logos were significantly lower than those elicited by out-group recommended logos. Besides, there was evidence that being familiar with foreign cultures reduces consumer ethnocentrism. The African subjects were familiar with Chinese people and adopted Chinese culture, as a result, they did not differ in showing preferences between in-group and out-group recommended logos.

Increasing evidence supports a role for cerebrovasculature dysfunction in the aetiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Blood vessels in the brain are composed of a collection of cells and acellular material that comprise the neurovascular unit (NVU). The NVU in the hippocampus and cortex receives innervation from cholinergic neurons that originate in the basal forebrain.  Death of these neurons and their nerve fibres is an early feature of AD. However, the effect of the loss of cholinergic innervation on the NVU is not well characterised. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the loss of cholinergic innervation of components of the NVU at capillaries, arteries and veins in the hippocampus and cortex. Adult male C57BL/6 mice received an intracerebroventricular injection of the immunotoxin p75NTR mu-saporin to induce the loss of cholinergic neurons. Quadruple labelling immunohistochemistry and 3D reconstruction were carried out to characterise specific points of contact between cholinergic fibres and collagen IV, smooth muscle cells and astrocyte endfeet. Innate differences were observed between vessels of the hippocampus and cortex of control mice, including a greater amount of cholinergic contact with perivascular astrocytes in hippocampal capillaries and a thicker basement membrane in hippocampal veins. Saporin treatment induced a loss of cholinergic innervation at the arterial basement membrane and smooth muscle cells of both the hippocampus and the cortex. In the cortex, there was an additional loss of innervation at the astrocytic endfeet. The current results suggest that cortical arteries are more strongly affected by cholinergic denervation than arteries in the hippocampus. This regional variation may have implications for the etiology of the vascular pathology that develops in AD.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00161">Early Secure Attachment as a Protective Factor Against Later Cognitive Decline and Dementia</a></h4>

Although genetic factors contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, the etiology of these disorders is complex and incompletely understood. Thus, a growing interest in different approaches including a developmental perspective to these pathologies is gaining momentum. Including environmental factors offers the possibility to enhance our understanding of the etiological factors resulting in the emergence of neurodegenerative processes.
Brain, cognitive, and affective reserves can constitute protective factors against the manifestation of symptoms or signs related to cognitive decline in elderly people. These reserves are shaped by the interactions between the person and their environment. Therefore, they are influenced by the quality of the individual’s socio-economic situation, their level of education, the variety and quality of intellectual stimulations and social interactions. 
Both current and past environment may be of importance. Attachment theory appears to be a valuable candidate to approach the study of the relational early-life environment, as it bears on numerous facets of a person’s development. Besides its established impact on the development of social and affective competencies, recent results highlight that the quality of attachment relations between the child and their caregivers also influences the development of cognitive competencies and, thus, may influence the cognitive reserve in later life. Furthermore, attachment is likely to be involved in neurobiological aspects of brain development as well as in certain epigenetic processes. 
Through the lens of the attachment theory, this review will attempt to show how the previously mentioned components participate in the development of affective, cognitive and brain reserves, which can in turn act as protective factors against cognitive decline in elderly people.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Astrocytes play key roles in brain functions through dynamic interactions with neurons. One of their typical features is to express high levels of connexins (Cxs), Cx43 and Cx30, the gap junction (GJ)-forming proteins. Cx30 is involved in basic cognitive processes and shapes synaptic and network activities, as shown by recent studies in transgenic animals. Yet it remains unknown whether astroglial Cx30 expression, localization, and functions are endogenously and dynamically regulated by neuronal activity and could therefore play physiological roles in neurotransmission. We here show that neuronal activity increased hippocampal Cx30 protein levels via a posttranslational mechanism regulating lysosomal degradation. Neuronal activity also increased Cx30 protein levels at membranes and perisynaptic processes, as revealed by superresolution imaging. This translated at the functional level in the activation of Cx30 hemichannels and in Cx30-mediated remodeling of astrocyte morphology independently of GJ biochemical coupling. Altogether, these data show activity-dependent dynamics of Cx30 expression, perisynaptic localization, and functions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Secondhand smoke exposure is a major public health risk that is especially harmful to the developing brain, but it is unclear if early exposure affects brain structure during middle age and older adulthood. Here we analyzed brain MRI data from the UK Biobank in a population-based sample of individuals (ages 44–80) who were exposed (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 2510) or unexposed (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 6079) to smoking around birth. We used robust statistical models, including quantile regressions, to test the effect of perinatal smoke exposure (PSE) on cortical surface area (SA), thickness, and subcortical volumes. We hypothesized that PSE would be associated with cortical disruption in primary sensory areas compared to unexposed (PSE<sup>−</sup>) adults. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, SA was significantly lower in the pericalcarine (PCAL), inferior parietal (IPL), and regions of the temporal and frontal cortex of PSE<sup>+</sup> adults; these abnormalities were associated with increased risk for several diseases, including circulatory and endocrine conditions. Sensitivity analyses conducted in a hold-out group of healthy participants (exposed, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 109, unexposed, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 315) replicated the effect of PSE on SA in the PCAL and IPL.

<p>by Andrea Komljenovic, Hao Li, Vincenzo Sorrentino, Zoltán Kutalik, Johan Auwerx, Marc Robinson-Rechavi</p>

The evolutionarily conserved nature of the few well-known anti-aging interventions that affect lifespan, such as caloric restriction, suggests that aging-related research in model organisms is directly relevant to human aging. Since human lifespan is a complex trait, a systems-level approach will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying aging landscape. Here, we integrate evolutionary and functional information of normal aging across human and model organisms at three levels: gene-level, process-level, and network-level. We identify evolutionarily conserved modules of normal aging across diverse taxa, and notably show proteostasis to be conserved in normal aging. Additionally, we find that mechanisms related to protein quality control network are enriched for genes harboring genetic variants associated with 22 age-related human traits and associated to caloric restriction. These results demonstrate that a systems-level approach, combined with evolutionary conservation, allows the detection of candidate aging genes and pathways relevant to human normal aging.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n__Vy_y-Nug" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Identified neurons and the networks they compose produce stereotypical, albeit individually unique, activity across members of a species. We propose, for a motor circuit driven by a central pattern generator (CPG), that the uniqueness derives mainly from differences in synaptic strength rather than from differences in intrinsic membrane conductances. We studied a dataset of recordings from six leech (Hirudo sp.) heartbeat control networks, containing complete spiking activity patterns from inhibitory premotor interneurons, motor output spike patterns, and synaptic strength patterns to investigate the source of uniqueness. We used a conductance-based multi-compartmental motor neuron model to construct a bilateral motor circuit model, and controlled it by playing recorded input spike trains from premotor interneurons to generate output inhibitory synaptic patterns similar to experimental measurements. By generating different synaptic conductance parameter sets of this circuit model, we found that relative premotor synaptic strengths impinging onto motor neurons must be different across individuals to produce animal-specific output burst phasing. Obtaining unique outputs from each individual’s circuit model did not require different intrinsic ionic conductance parameters. Furthermore, changing intrinsic conductances failed to compensate for modified synaptic strength patterns. Thus the pattern of synaptic strengths of motor neuron inputs is critical for the phasing of this motor circuit and can explain individual differences. When intrinsic conductances were allowed to vary, they exhibited the same conductance correlations across individuals, suggesting a motor neuron ’type’ required for proper network function. Our results are general and may translate to other systems and neuronal networks that control output phasing.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Each member of a species is unique, down to its neurons. The ability to experimentally identify a specific neuron across individuals allows investigating the neuron’s variability in spiking activity patterns and therefore its function. Identified neuron types produce stereotypical, albeit individually unique, activity patterns. Uniqueness of activity can be caused by variability observed in the intrinsic properties of neurons and the synaptic connections of the circuit. Here, we propose that, for a rhythmic neuronal motor circuit, the uniqueness derives mainly from differences in synaptic strength rather than from differences in intrinsic membrane conductances. The neuron types that we studied are from the leech heartbeat system. However, our results are general and can translate to other neuronal networks that control output phasing.</p>

The investigation of GABAergic inhibitory circuits has substantially expanded over the past few years. The development of new tools and technology has allowed investigators to classify many diverse groups of inhibitory neurons by several delineating factors: these include their connectivity motifs, expression of specific molecular markers, receptor diversity, and ultimately their role in brain function. Despite this progress, however, there is still limited understanding of how GABAergic neurons are recruited by their input and how their activity is modulated by behavioral states. This limitation is primarily due to the fact that studies of GABAergic inhibition are mainly geared toward determining how, once activated, inhibitory circuits regulate the activity of excitatory neurons. In this review, we will outline recent work investigating the anatomical and physiological properties of inputs that activate cortical GABAergic neurons, and discuss how these inhibitory cells are differentially recruited during behavior.

Our memories are essential in our daily lives. The frontal and cingulate cortices, hippocampal system and medial temporal lobes are key brain regions. In addition, severe amnesia also occurs after damage or dysfunction to the anterior thalamic nuclei; this subcortical thalamic hub is interconnected to these key cortical memory structures. Behavioural, anatomical, and physiological evidence across mammalian species has shown that interactions between the anterior thalamic nuclei, cortex and hippocampal formation are vital for spatial memory processing. Furthermore, the adjacent laterodorsal thalamic nucleus, interconnected to the retrosplenial cortex and visual system, also contributes to spatial memory in mammals. However, how these thalamic nuclei contribute to memory still remains largely unknown. Fortunately, our understanding of the importance of the thalamus in cognitive processes is being redefined, as widespread evidence challenges the established view of the thalamus as a passive relay of sensory and subcortical information to the cortex. In this review, we examine whether the anterior thalamic nuclei and the adjacent laterodorsal thalamic nuclei are suitable candidates for ‘higher-order’ thalamic nuclei, as defined by the Sherman and Guillery model. Rather than simply relaying information to cortex, ‘higher-order’ thalamic nuclei have a prominent role in cognition, as they can regulate how areas of the cortex interact with one another. These considerations along with a review of the latest research will be used to suggest future studies that will clarify the contributions that the anterior and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei have in supporting cortical functions during cognitive processes.

A field’s priorities are reflected by the contents of its high-impact journals. Researchers in turn may choose to pursue research objectives based on what is believed to be most highly valued by their peers. However, these assessments of the field’s priorities are often subjective, owing to a lack of formal quantification of high-impact journals’ contents. By compiling a corpus of abstracts from within the field neuroscience, I was able to analyze which terms had differential frequencies between 12 high-impact and 13 medium-impact journals. Approximately 50,000 neuroscience abstracts were analyzed over the years 2014-2018. Several broad trends emerged from the analysis of which terms were biased towards high-impact journals. Generally speaking, high-impact journals tended to feature: genetic or psychiatric studies, use of the latest and most sophisticated methods, examinations of the orbitofrontal cortex or amygdala, and/or use of human or non-mammalian subjects. Medium-impact journals tended to feature motor or cardiovascular studies, use of older methods, examinations of caudal brain regions, and/or rats as subjects. This approach also allowed for the comparison of high-impact bias among: brain regions, methods, neurotransmitters, study species, and broad themes within neuroscience. A systematic approach to the contents of high-impact journals offers the field an objective view of itself.

Objective: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) is an important cause of vascular cognitive impairment (CI). However, a considerable portion of individuals with WMH do not develop CI. The present study aimed to investigate distinctive regional brain activity and connectivity patterns in WMH subjects with and without CI, who displayed comparable WMH burden. 
Methods: Fourteen WMH subjects with CI, 16 WMH subjects without CI and 37 healthy subjects underwent multimodal MRI scans and neuropsychological tests. All WMH subjects displayed Fazekas grade 2 of WMH. Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) patterns were identified based on resting-state functional MRI data. 
Results: No significant differences in WMH volume, the number of WMH lesions and brain volume were shown between the 2 WMH groups. In contrast, the WMH with CI group showed higher ReHo in bilateral superior parietal gyrus (SPG)/superior occipital gyrus (SOG) than the WMH without CI group. Compared with the WMH without CI group, the WMH with CI group also displayed higher FC of the left SPG/SOG with frontal regions, and higher FC of the right SPG/SOG with parietal regions. Furthermore, higher FC of the left SPG/SOG with frontal regions were significantly associated with less worse executive dysfunction in WMH with CI subjects, suggesting a compensatory effect. 
Conclusions: Higher local coherence of activities in the SPG/SOG and higher connectivity of the SPG/SOG with parietal and frontal regions are related to CI in WMH subjects. The findings provide novel insights into functional alterations underlying the cognitive variety in WMH subjects.

Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which consist mainly of aggregated αSyn, are widely observed in the affected regions of patient brains. Except for some familial forms of PD, most sporadic PD patients express the wild-type αSyn protein without any mutations, and the mechanisms as to how wild-type αSyn gains the propensity to pathologically aggregate still remains unclear. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which the same αSyn protein can cause different synucleinopathies with distinct phenotypes and pathologies, such as PD, DLB, and multiple system atrophy, still remain largely unknown. Recently, mutations in the GBA1 gene have been reported be the strongest risk factor for developing sporadic PD. Furthermore, decreased glucocerebrosidase activity has also been reported in the brains of patients with sporadic PD. Moreover, αSyn pathology have also been shown in the brains of lysosomal storage disorder patients, which show glycosphingolipid accumulation. These observations suggest the possibility that altered lipid metabolism and lipid accumulation play roles in αSyn aggregation and PD pathogenesis. Indeed, several previous studies have demonstrated that lipid interactions affect the conformation of αSyn and induces its oligomerization and aggregation. In this review, we will give an overview of the association between αSyn aggregation and lipid interactions from the viewpoints of the etiology, pathology, and genetics of PD. We also discuss the distinct species of αSyn aggregates and their association with specific types of synucleinopathies, and introduce our hypothesis that lipid interactions play a role as trans-acting effectors in producing distinct strains of αSyn fibrils.

Image characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) may change over the course of a study. To monitor these changes a quality assurance (QA) protocol is necessary. QA can be realized both by performing regular phantom measurements and by controlling the human MRI datasets (e.g. noise detection in structural or movement parameters in functional datasets). Several QA tools for the assessment of MRI data quality have been developed. Many of them are freely available. This allows in principle the flexible set-up of a QA protocol specifically adapted to the aims of one’s own study. However, setup and maintenance of these tools bind time, in particular since the installation and operation often require a fair amount of technical knowledge. In this article we present a light-weighted virtual machine, named LAB-QA2GO, which provides scripts for fully automated QA analyses of phantom and human datasets. This virtual machine is ready for analysis by starting it the first time. With minimal configuration in the guided web-interface the first analysis can start within 10 minutes, while adapting to local phantoms and needs is easily possible. The usability and scope of LAB–QA2GO is illustrated using a data set from the QA protocol of our lab. With LAB–QA2GO we hope to provide an easy-to-use toolbox that is able to calculate QA statistics without high effort.

Brain inflammation can result in functional disorders observed in several neurodegenerative diseases and that can be also associated with reduced neurogenesis. In this study, we investigate the effect of mild inflammation, induced by unilateral injection of Endotoxin (ET) in the substantia nigra (SN)/ ventral tegmental area (VTA), on the proliferation and survival of stem/progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Adult female rats received unilateral injection of ET (2 µg/2 µl saline) or sterile saline (2 µl) in the right SN followed by 5’-Bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) injections (66 mg/kg/injection). Intranigral ET injection induced bilateral decrease in the number of newly born BrdU positive cells in the DG. This effect was paralleled by a significant decrease in the exploratory behavior of rats, as assessed by the Y-maze novel arm exploration task. ET also induced a transient decrease in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase -positive cells in the injected SN, impaired motor behavior, and caused microglial activation in the SN. This study provides an experimental simulation of the remote effects of moderate and reversible neuroinflammation resulting in impaired communication between midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the hippocampus.

Digital pathology is increasingly prominent in neurodegenerative disease research, but variability in immunohistochemical staining intensity between staining batches prevents large-scale comparative studies. Here we provide a statistically rigorous method to account for staining batch effects in a large sample of brain tissue with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-Tau, N=39) or TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP, N=53). We analyzed the relationship between duplicate measurements of digital pathology, i.e. percent area occupied by pathology (%AO) for grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), from two distinct staining batches. We found a significant difference in duplicate measurements from distinct staining batches in FTLD-Tau (mean difference: GM=1.13±0.44, WM=1.28±0.56; p&lt;0.001) and FTLD-TDP (GM=0.95±0.66, WM=0.90±0.77; p&lt;0.001), and these measurements were linearly related (R-squared [Rsq]: FTLD-Tau GM=0.92, WM=0.92; FTLD-TDP GM=0.75, WM=0.78; p&lt;0.001 all). We therefore used linear regression to transform %AO from distinct staining batches into equivalent values. Using a train-test set design, we examined transformation prerequisites (i.e. Rsq) from linear-modeling in training sets, and we applied equivalence factors (i.e. beta, intercept) to independent testing sets to determine transformation outcomes (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]). First, random iterations (x100) of linear regression showed that smaller training sets (N=12-24), feasible for prospective use, have acceptable transformation prerequisites (mean Rsq: FTLD-Tau≥0.9; FTLD-TDP≥0.7). When cross-validated on independent complementary testing sets, in FTLD-Tau, N=12 training sets resulted in 100% of GM and WM transformations with optimal transformation outcomes (ICC≥0.8), while in FTLD-TDP N=24 training sets resulted in optimal ICC in testing sets (GM=72%, WM=98%). We therefore propose training sets of N=12 in FTLD-Tau and N=24 in FTLD-TDP for prospective transformations. Finally, the transformation enabled us to significantly reduce batch-related difference in duplicate measurements in FTLD-Tau (GM/WM: p&lt;0.001 both) and FTLD-TDP (GM/WM: p&lt;0.001 both), and to decrease the necessary sample size estimated in a power analysis in FTLD-Tau (GM:-40%; WM:-34%) and FTLD-TDP (GM:-20%; WM:-30%). Finally, we tested generalizability of our approach using a second, open-source, image analysis platform and found similar results. We concluded that a small sample of tissue stained in duplicate can be used to account for pre-analytical variability such as staining batch effects, thereby improving methods for future studies.

Drug-seeking in opioid dependence is due in part to the severe negative emotion associated with the withdrawal syndrome. It is well-established that negative emotional states emerge from activity in the amygdala. More recently, gut microflora have been shown to contribute substantially to such emotions. We measured gene expression in single glia and neurons gathered from the amygdala using laser capture microdissection and simultaneously measured gut microflora in morphine-dependent and withdrawn rats to investigate drivers of negative emotion in opioid withdrawal. We found that neuroinflammatory genes, notably Tnf, were upregulated in the withdrawal condition and that astrocytes, in particular, were highly active. We also observe a decreased Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio in opioid withdrawal indicating gut dysbiosis. We speculate that these inflammatory and gut microflora changes contribute to the negative emotion experienced in opioid withdrawal that motivates dependence.

Collecting multiple modalities of neuroimaging data on the same subject is increasingly becoming the norm in clinical practice and research. Fusing multiple modalities to find related patterns is a challenge in neuroimaging analysis. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is commonly used as a symmetric data fusion technique to find related patterns among multiple modalities. In CCA-based data fusion, principal component analysis (PCA) is frequently applied as a preprocessing step to reduce data dimension followed by CCA on dimension-reduced data. PCA, however, does not differentiate between informative voxels from non-informative voxels in the dimension reduction step. Sparse PCA (sPCA) extends traditional PCA by adding sparse regularization that assigns zero weights to non-informative voxels. In this study, sPCA is incorporated into CCA-based fusion analysis and applied on neuroimaging data. A cross-validation method is developed and validated to optimize the parameters in sPCA. Different simulations are carried out to evaluate the improvement by introducing sparsity constraint to PCA. Four fusion methods including sPCA+CCA, PCA+CCA, parallel ICA and sparse CCA were applied on structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data of mild cognitive impairment subjects and normal controls. Our results indicate that sPCA significantly can reduce the impact of non-informative voxels and lead to improved statistical power in uncovering disease-related patterns by a fusion analysis.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00042">Auditory Stream Segregation Can Be Modeled by Neural Competition in Cochlear Implant Listeners</a></h4>

Auditory stream segregation is a perceptual process by which the human auditory system groups sounds from different sources into perceptually meaningful elements (e.g. a voice or a melody). The perceptual segregation of sounds is important, for example, for the understanding of speech in noisy scenarios, a particularly challenging task for listeners with a cochlear implant (CI). It has been suggested that some aspects of stream segregation may be explained by relatively basic neural mechanisms at a cortical level. During the past decades, a variety of models have been proposed to account for the data from stream segregation experiments in normal-hearing (NH) listeners. However, little attention has been given to corresponding findings in CI listeners. The present study investigated whether a neural model of sequential stream segregation, proposed to describe the behavioral effects observed in NH listeners, can account for behavioral data from CI listeners. The model operates on the stimulus features at the cortical level and includes a competition stage between the neuronal units encoding the different percepts. The competition arises from a combination of mutual inhibition, adaptation and additive noise. The model was found to capture the main trends in the behavioral data from CI listeners, such as the larger probability of a segregated percept with increasing the feature difference between the sounds as well as the build-up effect. Importantly, this was achieved without any modification to the model’s competition stage, suggesting that stream segregation could be mediated by a similar mechanism in both groups of listeners.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00044">Stimulus-Specific Adaptation Decreases the Coupling of Spikes to LFP Phase</a></h4>

Stimulus repetition suppresses the neural activity in different sensory areas of the brain. This mechanism of so-called stimulus-specific adaptation has been observed in both spiking activity and local field potential (LFP) responses. However, much remains to be known about the effect of stimulus-specific adaptation on the spike-LFP relation. In this study, we approached this issue by investigating the spike-phase coupling (SPC) in control and adapting paradigms. For the control paradigm, pure tones were presented in a random unbiased sequence. In the adapting paradigm, the same stimuli were presented in a random pattern but it was biased to an adapter stimulus. In fact, the adapter occupied 80% of the adapting sequence. During the tasks, LFP and multi-unit activity were recorded simultaneously from the primary auditory cortex of 15 anesthetized rats. To clarify the effect of adaptation on the relation between spike and LFP responses, the SPC of the adapter stimulus in these two paradigms were evaluated. Here, we employed phase locking value (PLV) method for calculating the SPC. Our data shows a strong coupling of spikes to LFP phase most prominently in beta band. This coupling was observed to decrease in the adapting condition compared to the control one. Importantly, we found that adaptation reduces spikes dominantly from the preferred phase of LFP in which spikes are more likely to be present there. This highlights the crucial role of LFP phase and its relation to spikes in neural adaptation mechanism. This finding is important for interpretation of the underlying neural mechanism of adaptation and also can be used in the context of the network and related connectivity models.

Iron levels in the brain can be estimated using newly developed specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. This technique has several applications, especially in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease. Coupling ex vivo MRI with histology allows neuroscientists to better understand what they see in the images. Iron is one of the most extensively studied elements, both by MRI and using histological or physical techniques. Researchers were initially only able to make visual comparisons between MRI images and different types of iron staining, but the emergence of specific MRI sequences like R2* or quantitative susceptibility mapping meant that quantification became possible, requiring correlations with physical techniques. Today, with advances in MRI and image post-processing, it is possible to look for MRI/histology correlations by matching the two sorts of images. For the result to be acceptable, the choice of methodology is crucial, as there are hidden pitfalls every step of the way. In order to review the advantages and limitations of ex vivo MRI correlation with iron-based histology, we reviewed all the relevant articles dealing with the topic in humans. We provide separate assessments of qualitative and quantitative studies, and after summarizing the significant results, we emphasize all the pitfalls that may be encountered.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Pyramidal neurons are the most common cell type and are considered the main output neuron in most mammalian forebrain structures. In terms of function, differences in the structure of the dendrites of these neurons appear to be crucial in determining how neurons integrate information. To further shed light on the structure of the human pyramidal neurons we investigated the geometry of pyramidal cells in the human and mouse CA1 region—one of the most evolutionary conserved archicortical regions, which is critically involved in the formation, consolidation, and retrieval of memory. We aimed to assess to what extent neurons corresponding to a homologous region in different species have parallel morphologies. Over 100 intracellularly injected and 3D-reconstructed cells across both species revealed that dendritic and axonal morphologies of human cells are not only larger but also have structural differences, when compared to mouse. The results show that human CA1 pyramidal cells are not a stretched version of mouse CA1 cells. These results indicate that there are some morphological parameters of the pyramidal cells that are conserved, whereas others are species-specific.</span>

Whether dynamic changes in genome architecture underlie transcriptional and functional plasticity in mature neurons has been technically challenging to address. A recent study (Yamada et al., Nature, 2019) exploited experimental advantages of the cerebellum to reveal cell type-specific changes in chromatin architecture that coordinate neural activity-induced changes in gene transcription and contribute to sensorimotor learning.

This motivates a new framework that views vision as consisting of encoding, selection, and decoding stages, placing selection on center stage. It suggests a massive loss of non-selected information from V1 downstream along the visual pathway. Hence, feedback from downstream visual cortical areas to V1 for better decoding (recognition), through analysis-by-synthesis, should query for additional information and be mainly directed at the foveal region. Accordingly, non-foveal vision is not only poorer in spatial resolution, but also more susceptible to many illusions.</p></div>

The application of super-resolution optical microscopy to investigating synaptic structures has revealed a highly heterogeneous and variable intra-synaptic organization. Dense subsynaptic protein assemblies named subsynaptic domains or SSDs have been proposed as structural units that regulate the efficacy of neuronal transmission. However, an in-depth characterization of subsynaptic domains has been hampered by technical limitations of super-resolution microscopy of synapses, namely the stochasticity of the signals during the imaging procedures and the variability of the synaptic structures. Here, we synthetize the available evidence for the existence of subsynaptic domains at central synapses, as well as the possible functional relevance of SSDs. In particular, we discuss the possible regulation of co-transmission at mixed inhibitory synapses as a consequence of the subsynaptic distribution of glycine receptors (GlyRs) and GABAA receptors (GABAARs).

Methamphetamine abuse has become a serious public health problem. However, effective treatment for methamphetamine addiction still remains elusive, especially considering its high rate of relapse after treatment. A conditioned stimulus (CS) memory retrieval-extinction procedure has been demonstrated to decrease reinstatement of cocaine, heroin and alcohol seeking in rats, and to reduce cue-induced craving in heroin and nicotine addicts. The goal of the present study was to explore the effect of CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on methamphetamine seeking in rats and the underlying mechanisms. We found that daily presenting extinction training within reconsolidation time window attenuated subsequent drug priming-induced reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of methamphetamine seeking. We also found retrieval of methamphetamine-associated memories induced neuronal activation in basolateral amygdala (BLA), while presenting extinction within the time window of reconsolidation abolished the neuronal activation in BLA. These results indicated that the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure could prevent reconsolidation of methamphetamine memory traces in BLA and subsequent methamphetamine craving and relapse.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), like exosomes, play a critical role in physiological processes, including synaptic transmission and nerve regeneration. However, exosomes in particular can also contribute to the development of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, and prion diseases. All of these disorders are characterized by protein aggregation and deposition in specific regions of the brain. Several lines of evidence indicate that protein in exosomes is released from affected neurons and propagated along neuroanatomically connected regions of the brain, thus spreading the neurodegenerative disease. Also, different cell types contribute to the progression of tauopathy, such as microglia.  Several groups have reported tau release via exosomes by cultured neurons or cells overexpressing human tau. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the propagation of protein aggregates are not fully understood, recent findings have implicated EVs in this process. The AD brain has two hallmarks, namely the presence of amyloid--containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the latter formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Both amyloid peptide and tau protein are present in specific exosomes. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of exosomes in the pathology of AD, with a special focus on tau protein.

Computer aided diagnosis systems based on brain imaging are an important tool to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, whose ultimate goal is the detection by automatic recognizing of patterns that characterize the disease. In recent times Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proved to be amazingly useful for that task. The drawback, however, is that 3D brain images contain a huge amount of information that leads to complex CNN architectures. When these architectures become too complex, classification performances often degrades because the limitations of the training algorithm and overfitting. Thus, this paper proposes the use of isosurfaces as a way to reduce such amount of data while keeping the most relevant information. These isosurfaces are then used to implement a classification system which uses two of the most well-known CNN architectures, LeNet and AlexNet, to classify DaTScan images with an average accuracy of 95.1% and AUC=97%, obtaining comparable (slightly better) values to those obtained for most of the recently proposed systems. It can be concluded therefore that the computation of isosurfaces reduces the complexity of the inputs significantly, resulting in high classification accuracies with reduced computational burden.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00066">Post-mortem 11.7 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging vs. Polarized Light Imaging Microscopy to Measure the Angle and Orientation of Dorsal Root Afferents in the Human Cervical Dorsal Root Entry Zone</a></h4>

BACKGROUND: Destruction of the afferents by dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) surgery may be an effective treatment of intractable neuropathic pain, though it remains a high risk surgical intervention. Potential complications due to the lesioning of structures within the cervical spinal cord other than the DREZ can be minimized by accurate knowledge of the optimal insertion angle (i.e., the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus). The employed insertion angle has based on measurements between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus on post-mortem transverse slices. However, new, more sophisticated imaging techniques are currently available and are thought to yield higher spatial resolution and more accurate images. 
OBEJCTIVE: This paper measures the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus on 11.7T post-mortem magnetic resonance images and compares these findings with polarized light imaging (PLI) microscopy images of the same specimens in order to quantify fiber orientation within the DREZ. 
METHODS: To visualize the anatomy of the cervical DREZ, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), probabilistic tractography, and polarized light imaging (PLI)) were performed on 3 post-mortem human cervical spinal cords at level C5-C6. The MR data was used to measure the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus. MR images were complemented by probabilistic tractography results. Then, the orientation of fibers within the DREZ was quantified by use of PLI microscopy. 
RESULTS: Median angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus, as measured on MR-images, was found to be 40.1° (ranging from 34.2-49.1°) and 39.8°  (ranging from 31.1-47.8°) in the left and right hemicord, respectively. Median fiber orientation within the DREZ, as quantified by PLI, was 28.5° (ranging from 12.0-44.3°) and 27.7° (ranging from 8.5-38.1°) in the left and right hemicord, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: Our study, which provides an improved understanding of the anatomy of the DREZ, the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus and the median fiber orientation within the DREZ, could contribute to safer DREZ-lesioning surgery to treat chronic neuropathic pain in the future.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00169">Cerebral Blood Flow in Community-Based Older Twins Is Moderately Heritable: An Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion Imaging Study</a></h4>

Adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) is necessary to maintain brain metabolism and function. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) is an emerging MRI technique offering a non-invasive and reliable quantification of CBF. The genetic basis of CBF has not been well documented, and one approach to investigate this is to examine its heritability. The current study aimed to examine the heritability of CBF using ASL data from a cohort of community-dwelling older twins (41 monozygotic and 25 dizygotic twin pairs; age range, 65-93 years; 56.4% female). Results showed that the cortex had higher CBF than subcortical grey matter (GM) regions, and CBF in the GM regions of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory was lower than that of the middle (MCA) and posterior (PCA) cerebral arteries. After accounting for the effects of age, sex and scanner, moderate heritability was identified for global CBF (h2 = 0.611; 95% CI = 0.380-0.761), as well as for cortical and subcortical GM and the GM in the major arterial territories (h2 = 0.500-0.612). Strong genetic correlations were found between CBF in subcortical and cortical GM regions, as well as among the three arterial territories (ACA, MCA, PCA), suggesting a largely convergent genetic control for the CBF in brain GM. The moderate heritability of CBF warrants future investigations to uncover the genetic variants and genes that regulate CBF.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00166">Differential Associations Between Distinct Components of Cognitive Function and Mobility: Implications for Understanding Aging, Turning and Dual-Task Walking</a></h4>

Objective: Cognition and mobility are interrelated. However, this association can be impacted by the specific facets of cognition and mobility that are measured, and further by the different task conditions, single- versus dual-task walking, under which these associations are evaluated. Systematically studying the multiple facets of cognitive-mobility associations under both the task conditions is critical because both cognition and mobility change with age and pose significant risks associated with falls, morbidity, and disability. Methods: Using a cross-sectional, prospective study design, data from 124 healthy adults (mean age (SD) = 61.51 (11.90); mean education (SD) = 15.94 (2.18)) was collected. A comprehensive battery of cognitive tests was administered, and gait was assessed using a small, lightweight, three-axis accelerometer with a gyroscope. Analytical Plan: Data was transformed, and only relatively strong relationships survived after strict statistical criteria adjusting for multiple comparisons was applied. Spearman rho correlation coefficients were used to examine the matrix of correlations between the cognitive-motor variables while adjusting for age and gender. Results: Executive functions, processing speed, and language were associated with distinct facets of variability, pace, asymmetry, especially under the dual-task walking condition. Both turns and transitions were also associated with cognition during the Timed Up and Go task. Conclusion: Our results extend converging evidence for the involvement of executive functions and processing speed in specific aspects of mobility, along with the role of language. The study has important implications for aging in terms of both assessment and rehabilitation of cognition and gait as well as for the emerging dual-tasking theories and the role of the neural pathways involved in mobility.

Stroke patients often exhibit difficulties performing a cognitive task while walking, defined as a dual task (DT). Their prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity is higher in DT than in single task (ST). The effects of an increasing load on PFC activity during DT in subacute stroke patients remains unexplored. Our objective was to assess the effects of N-back tasks (low/high load) on cerebral activity, gait parameters and cognitive performances. Eleven subacute stroke patients (days post-stroke 45.8±31.6) participated in this study (71.4±10 yrs, BMI 26.7±4.8 kg.m-2, Barthel index 81.8±11.0). Patients completed a STwalk, and 4 conditions with 1-back (low load) and 2-back (high load): STlow, SThigh, DTlow and DThigh. Overground walking was performed at a comfortable pace and -N-back conditions were carried out verbally. Both gait (speed, stride variability) and cognitive (rate of correct answers) performances were recorded. Changes in PFC oxyhemoglobin (∆O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (∆HHb) were measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results showed an increase of ∆O2Hb while walking, which was not augmented by cognitive loads in DT. Walking speed was reduced by low and high cognitive loads in DT compared to STwalk (P&lt;0.05), but was not different between DTlow and DThigh. Cognitive performances were negatively impacted by both walking (P&lt;0.05) and cognitive load (between ‘low’ and ‘high’, P&lt;0.001). These data highlight a “ceiling” effect in ∆O2Hb levels while walking, leaving no available resources for simultaneous cognitive tasks, during the early recovery period following stroke. In these patients, cognitive, but not motor, performances declined with a higher cognitive load.

Large-scale brain networks exhibit changes in functional connectivity during the aging process. Recent literature data suggests that Yoga and other contemplative practices may revert, at least in part, some of the aging effects in brain functional connectivity, including of the Default Mode Network (DMN). The aim of this cross-sectional investigation was to compare resting-state functional connectivity of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex - precuneus (PCC-Precuneus) in long-term elderly Yoga practitioners and healthy paired Yoga-naïve controls. Two paired groups: yoga (Y-20 women, Hatha Yoga practitioners; minimum twice a week of practice frequency for at least 8 years) and control group (C-20 women, Yoga-naïve, matched by age, years of formal education, and physical activity) were evaluated for: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and open-eyes resting-state fMRI - seed to voxel connectivity analysis (CONN toolbox 17.f) with pre-processing - realignment and unwarping, slice-timing correction, segmentation, normalization, outlier detection, and spatial filtering. Analysis included a priori regions of interest (ROI) of DMN main nodes – MPFC and PCC-Precuneus. There was no difference between groups for: age, years of formal education, MMSE, BDI and IADL. Yoga group had higher correlation between MPFC and right angular gyrus, compared to controls. Elderly women with at least 8 years of yoga practice presented greater intra-network anteroposterior brain functional connectivity of the default mode network. This finding may contribute for the understanding of the influences of Yoga practice for a healthier cognitive aging process.

Platelets are anucleate cells that circulate in blood and are essential components of the hemostatic system. During aging, platelet numbers decrease and their aggregation capacity is reduced. Platelet dysfunctions associated with aging can be linked to molecular alterations affecting several cellular systems that include cytoskeleton rearrangements, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking and protein degradation. Age platelets may adopt a phenotype characterized by robust secretion of extracellular vesicles that could in turn account for about 70-90% of blood circulating vesicles. Interestingly these extracellular vesicles are loaded with messenger RNAs and microRNAs that may have a profound impact on protein physiology at the systems level. Age platelet dysfunction is also associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Thereby understanding the mechanisms of aging in platelets as well as their age-dependent dysfunctions may be of interest when evaluating the contribution of aging to the onset of age-dependent pathologies, such as those affecting the nervous system. In this review we summarize the findings that link platelet dysfunctions to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Huntington’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. We discuss the role of platelets as drivers of protein dysfunctions observed in these pathologies, their association with aging and the potential clinical significance of platelets, and related miRNAs, as peripheral biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract

Objective: the purpose of this study was to analyze quantitative sleep changes and their implication in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Objective sleep pattern was investigated through actigraphy recorded at the baseline and at the follow-up after two years. The aim of the study was to examine specific sleep alterations in SCD. 

Background: sleep disorders are very common among average elderly adults and an altered sleep pattern is known to be a risk factor for future development of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. Recent studies have shown how sleep is objectively altered in average senior adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), without any other significant change in cognition and behavior or brain structure. Considering that both SCD and disrupted sleep are risk factors for future MCI and dementia, with sleep only as a modifiable risk factor, further research is required to deeply investigate the interaction between sleep and SCD.

Methods:  among seventy community-dwelling elderly individuals who had been enrolled at baseline, thirty-five (64.6 5.6 y, 15M/20F) underwent a complete neuropsychological battery and one-week wrist actigraphy recording two years later during the follow-up stage.  Individuals were divided into two groups according to their Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q) score. Sleep hours, sleep efficiency and onset latency, napping and time awake after sleep onset (WASO) were collected. All individuals underwent structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination to exclude brain disorders. Data collection was performed at baseline and after two years at the follow-up phase.

Results:  a significantly different night sleep time between the two groups was observed: SCD showed a lower total sleep time (TST) than non-SCD subjects. Moreover, a total time spent in bed (TIB) was significantly lower in SCD subjects over two years of observation.

Conclusions:  objective changes over time of the sleep pattern, specifically total time spent in bed and total sleep time, are present in SCD individuals. The results of the study show that sleep alterations are common in SCD and underline the clinical importance of screening in order to assess sleep alterations as well as improve sleep in average adults with SCD complaints.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuroimaging studies show that ventral face-selective regions, including the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA), preferentially respond to faces presented in the contralateral visual field (VF). In the current study we measured the VF response of the face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Across 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, participants viewed face videos presented in different parts of the VF. Consistent with prior results, we observed a contralateral VF bias in bilateral FFA, right OFA (rOFA), and bilateral human motion-selective area MT+. Intriguingly, this contralateral VF bias was absent in the bilateral pSTS. We then delivered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over right pSTS (rpSTS) and rOFA, while participants matched facial expressions in both hemifields. TMS delivered over the rpSTS disrupted performance in both hemifields, but TMS delivered over the rOFA disrupted performance in the contralateral hemifield only. These converging results demonstrate that the contralateral bias for faces observed in ventral face-selective areas is absent in the pSTS. This difference in VF response is consistent with face processing models proposing 2 functionally distinct pathways. It further suggests that these models should account for differences in interhemispheric connections between the face-selective areas across these 2 pathways.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Down syndrome (DS) is the most common liveborn autosomal chromosomal anomaly and is a major cause of developmental disability. Atypical brain development and the resulting intellectual disability originate during the fetal period. Perinatal interventions to correct such aberrant development are on the horizon in preclinical studies. However, we lack tools to sensitively measure aberrant structural brain development in living human fetuses with DS. In this study, we aimed to develop safe and precise neuroimaging measures to monitor fetal brain development in DS. We measured growth patterns of regional brain structures in 10 fetal brains with DS (29.1 ± 4.2, weeks of gestation, mean ± SD, range 21.7~35.1) and 12 control fetuses (25.2 ± 5.0, range 18.6~33.3) using regional volumetric analysis of fetal brain MRI. All cases with DS had confirmed karyotypes. We performed non-linear regression models to compare fitted regional growth curves between DS and controls. We found decreased growth trajectories of the cortical plate (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.033), the subcortical parenchyma (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.010), and the cerebellar hemispheres (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.0001) in DS compared to controls. This study provides proof of principle that regional volumetric analysis of fetal brain MRI facilitates successful evaluation of brain development in living fetuses with DS.</span>

How does the brain process natural versus drug rewards? Alhadeff et al. demonstrate that food and drugs signal from the periphery to the hypothalamus via distinct pathways. Furthermore, bidirectional and coordinated interactions between hypothalamic and dopamine circuits potentiate responses to rewards.

ABSTRACT<p>Sex differences in human cognitive performance are well characterized. However, the neural correlates of these differences remain elusive. This issue may be clarified using nonhuman primates, for which sociocultural influences are minimized. We used the marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) to investigate sex differences in two aspects of executive function: Reversal Learning and Intradimensional/Extradimensional (ID/ED) set shifting. Stress reactivity and motor function were also assessed. In agreement with human literature, females needed more trials than males to acquire the reversals. No sex differences in ED set shifting or motivational measures were observed. The findings suggest enhanced habit formation in females, perhaps due to striatal estrogenic effects. Both sexes showed increased urinary cortisol during social separation stressor, but females showed an earlier increase in cortisol and a greater increase in agitated locomotion, possibly indicating enhanced stress reactivity. Independent of sex, basal cortisol predicted cognitive performance. No sex differences were found in motor performance. Associations between brain networks and reversal learning performance were investigated using resting state fMRI. Resting state functional connectivity analyses revealed sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Correlations between cognitive flexibility and neural connectivity indicate that sex differences in cognitive flexibility are related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Overall, our findings reveal sex differences in reversal learning, brain networks, and their relationship in the marmoset, positioning this species as an excellent model to investigate the biological basis of cognitive sex differences.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We examined sex differences in multiple outcomes (cognition, motor function, stress reactivity and resting state functional connectivity) in middle-aged marmosets. We found that female marmosets had poorer reversal learning relative to males. Resting state functional connectivity analyses revealed substantial sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in both overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Sex-dependent correlations between reversal learning and neural connectivity measures indicate that the sex difference in cognitive performance is related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Although these data are correlational and cannot determine causal effects, they are consistent with human resting state data, supporting the idea that cognitive sex differences have identifiable intrinsic neural correlates.</p>

Paul Greengard, co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000, Vincent Astor Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience at the Rockefeller University in New York City, died of an apparent heart attack at age 93. Paul will be remembered for his seminal contributions to neuroscience, for pioneering the field of neuronal signal transduction and for training hundreds of neuroscientists. For anyone who knew Paul it will come as no surprise that up until a few hours before his death, Paul was doing what he liked the best: working on a scientific manuscript.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/lVMMcSN8IDQ" width="1" />

The current review summarizes the pathobiology of nerve growth factor and its cognate receptors during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Both protein and transcript data indicate that cholinotrophic neuronal dysfunction is related to an imbalance between TrkA-mediated survival signaling and proNGF/p75NTR-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling, which may be related to alteration in the metabolism of NGF. Data indicate a spatiotemporal pattern of degeneration related to the evolution of tau pathology within cholinotrophic neuronal subgroups located within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM). Despite these degenerative events the cholinotrophic system is capable of cellular resilience and/or plasticity during the prodromal (and later stages of the disease. In addition to neurotrophin dysfunction, studies indicate alterations nuclear epigenetic proteins occur within cholinotrophic nbM neurons during the progression of AD, suggesting a mechanism that may underlie changes in transcript expression. Findings suggest that postmortem intraventricular or premortem CSF levels of proNGF mark the onset of MCI and the transition to AD suggesting this proneurotrophin to be a potential biomarker for the progression of MCI. Novel therapeutics to treat NGF dysfunction included NGF gene therapy and the development of small molecule agonists for the high affinity TrkA survival receptor and antagonists against the low affinity p75NTR death receptor for the treatment of AD.

As a neurodevelopmental disorder with serious lifelong consequences, autism has received considerable attention from neuroscientists and geneticists. We present a hypothesis of mechanisms plausibly affected during brain development in autism, based on neural pathways that are associated with social behavior and connect the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the basal ganglia (BG). We consider failure of social approach in autism as a special case of imbalance in the fundamental dichotomy between behavioral approach and avoidance.

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an evolutionarily conserved, structural, and functional separation between circulating blood and the central nervous system (CNS). By controlling permeability into and out of the nervous system, the BBB has a critical role in the precise regulation of neural processes. Here, we review recent studies demonstrating that permeability at the BBB is dynamically controlled by circadian rhythms and sleep. An endogenous circadian rhythm in the BBB controls transporter function, regulating permeability across the BBB.

Using high-content screening, we identified a class of planar small molecules that can (1) modulate the dynamics of neurodegeneration-linked stress granules (SGs), (2) reduce SG association of ALS-linked RNA-binding proteins, and (3) prevent accumulation of TDP-43 within persistent cytoplasmic puncta.

Abstract<p>During early postnatal life, speed up of signal propagation through many central and peripheral neurons has been associated with an increase in axon diameter or/and myelination. Especially in unmyelinated axons postnatal adjustments of axonal membrane conductances is potentially a third mechanism but solid evidence is lacking. Here we show that axonal action potential conduction velocity in the <i>Drosophila</i> giant fiber interneuron (GF), that is required for fast long distance signal conduction through the escape circuit, is increased by 80% during the first day of adult life. Genetic manipulations indicate that this postnatal increase in action potential conduction velocity in the unmyelinated GF axon is likely owed to adjustments of ion channel expression or properties rather than axon diameter increases. Specifically, targeted RNAi knockdown of either Para fast voltage-gated sodium, Shaker potassium (<i>Kv1</i> homologue), or surprisingly, L-type like calcium channels counteracts postnatal increases in GF axonal conduction velocity. By contrast, the calcium-dependent potassium channel Slowpoke (BK) is not essential for postnatal speeding, though it also significantly increases conduction velocity. Therefore, we identified multiple ion channels that function to support fast axonal action potential conduction velocity, but only a subset of these are regulated during early postnatal life to maximize conduction velocity. Despite its large diameter (~ 7µm) and postnatal regulation of multiple ionic conductances, mature GF axonal conduction velocity is still 20-60 times slower than that of vertebrate Aβ sensory axons and α motoneurons, thus unraveling the limits of long range information transfer speed through invertebrate circuits.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> An effective mechanism to increase information processing speed through neural circuits is enhancing plasma membrane insulation through optimizing myelination, a means that cannot be capitalized on un-myelinated invertebrate axons. We identify postnatal adjustments of the expression levels of fast sodium, Shaker potassium, and L-type calcium channels as a mechanism to almost double axonal conduction velocity in the <i>Drosophila</i> giant fiber axon, the core component for long range information transfer through a neural circuit optimized for fast escape responses. However, despite the regulation of multiple ion channels, mature giant fiber axonal conduction velocity still lacks magnitudes of order behind that of myelinated vertebrate fibers, thus hinting to long distance information transfer as a size-constrain in the evolution of invertebrate circuits.</p>

Nerve injuries are a common clinical problem and cause inconvenience in daily life. It is of great importance to get a full understanding of the biological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying nerve injury to find and target specific molecules in nerve regeneration. Numerous studies have shown that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in diverse biological processes and diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are two major groups of ncRNAs, which attract growing attention. The expression of lncRNAs and circRNAs are altered following nerve injury and are associated with nerve regeneration. This review will give a brief introduction of the origins, characteristics and classifications of lncRNAs and circRNAs. We then summarize the current studies on lncRNAs and circRNAs following peripheral nerve injury and spinal cord injury. Typical lncRNAs and circRNAs are introduced to illustrate the diverse molecular mechanisms. In addition, we also discuss some issues to be addressed in future investigations on lncRNAs and circRNAs.

Lithium has been used for decades to treat Bipolar Disorder. Some of its therapeutic benefits may be through inhibition of Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK)-3. Enhanced GSK3 activity associates with development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), therefore lithium is a currently used therapeutic with potential to be repurposed for prevention of Dementia. An important step towards a clinical trial for AD prevention using lithium is to establish the dose of lithium that blocks GSK3 in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a high-risk condition for progression to AD. We investigated volunteer recruitment, retention and tolerance in this population, and assessed biomarkers of GSK3 in MCI compared to control and after lithium treatment.
Recruitment was close to target, with higher than anticipated interest. Drop out was not related to lithium blood concentration. Indeed, 33% of the withdrawals were in the first week of very low dose lithium. Most made it through to the highest dose of lithium with no adverse events. We analysed 18 potential biomarkers of GSK3 biology in rat PBMCs, but only 4 of these gave a robust reproducible baseline signal. The only biomarker that was modified by acute lithium injection in the rat was the inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser9 of GSK3beta (enhanced in PBMCs) and this associated with reduced activity of GSK3beta. In contrast to the rat PBMC preparations the protein quality of the human PBMC preparations was extremely variable. There was no difference between GSK3 biomarkers in MCI and control PBMC preparations and no significant effect of chronic lithium on the robust GSK3 biomarkers, indicating that the dose reached may not be sufficient to modify these markers. 
In summary, the high interest from the MCI population, and the lack of any adverse events, suggest that it would be relatively straightforward and safe to recruit to a larger clinical trial within this dosing regimen. However, it is clear that we will need an improved PBMC isolation process along with more robust, sensitive and validated biomarkers of GSK3 function, in order to use GSK3 pathway regulation in human PBMC preparations as a biomarker of GSK3 inhibitor efficacy, within a clinical trial setting.

Recent research has shown that event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded while participants view lists of different consumer goods can be modulated by their preferences towards these products. However, it remains largely unknown whether ERP activity specific to a single consumer item can be informative about whether or not this item will be preferred in a shopping context. In this study, we examined whether single-item ERPs could reliably predict consumer preferences towards specific consumer goods. We recorded scalp EEG from 40 participants while they were viewing pictures of consumer goods and we subsequently asked them to indicate their preferences for each of these items. Replicating previous results, we found that ERP activity averaged over the six most preferred products was significantly differentiated from ERP activity averaged across the six least preferred products for three ERP components: The N200, the late positive potential (LPP) and positive slow waves (PSW). We also found that using single-item ERPs to infer behavioural preferences about specific consumer goods led to an overall accuracy of 71%, although this figure varied according to which ERPs were targeted. Later positivities such as the late posterior positivity (LPP) and positive slow waves (PSW) yielded relatively higher predictive accuracy rates than the frontal N200.  Our results suggest that ERPs related to single consumer items can be relatively accurate predictors of behavioural preferences depending on which type of ERP effects are chosen by the researcher, and ultimately on the level of prediction errors that users choose to tolerate.

Brand extension is a marketing strategy leveraging well-established brand to promote new offerings provided as goods or service. The previous neurophysiological studies on goods-to-goods brand extension have proposed that categorization and semantic memory processes are involved in brand extension evaluation. However, it is unknown whether these same processes also underlie service-to-service brand extension. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate neural processes in consumers underlying their judgement of service-to-service brand extension. Specifically, we investigated human electroencephalographic responses to extended services that were commonly considered to fit well or badly with parent brand among consumers. For this purpose, we proposed a new stimulus grouping method to find commonly acceptable or unacceptable service extensions. In the experiment, participants reported the acceptability of fifty-six brand extension pairs, consisting of parent brand name (S1) and extended service name (S2). From individual acceptability responses, we assigned each pair to one of the three fit levels: high- (i.e. highly acceptable), low-, and mid-fit. Next, we selected stimuli that received high/low-fit evaluations from a majority of participants (i.e. &gt; 85%) and assigned them to a high/low population-fit group. A comparison of event-related potentials (ERPs) between population-fit groups through a paired t-test showed significant differences in the fronto-central N2 and fronto-parietal P300 amplitudes. We further evaluated inter-subject variability of these ERP components by a decoding analysis that classified N2 and/or P300 amplitudes into a high, or low population-fit class using a support vector machine. Leave-one-subject-out validation revealed classification accuracy of 60.35% with N2 amplitudes, 78.95 % with P300 and 73.68% with both, indicating a relatively high inter-subject variability of N2 but low for P300. This validation showed that fronto-parietal P300 reflected neural processes more consistent across subjects in service-to-service brand extension. We further observed that the left frontal P300 amplitude was increased as fit-level increased across stimuli, indicating a semantic retrieval process to evaluate a semantic link between S1 and S2. Parietal P300 showed a higher amplitude in the high population-fit group, reflecting a similarity-based categorization process. In sum, our results suggest that service-to-service brand extension evaluation may share similar neural processes with goods-to-goods brand extension.

In Huntington’s disease (HD), while the ubiquitously expressed mutant Huntingtin (mtHTT) protein primarily compromises striatal and cortical neurons, glia also undergo disease-contributing alterations. Existing HD models using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have not extensively characterized the role of mtHTT in patient-derived astrocytes. Here physiologically mature astrocytes are generated from HD patient iPSCs. These human astrocytes exhibit hallmark HD phenotypes that occur in mouse models, including impaired inwards rectifying K+ currents, lengthened spontaneous Ca2+ waves and reduced cell membrane capacitance. HD astrocytes in co-culture provided reduced support for the maturation of iPSC-derived neurons. In addition, neurons exposed to chronic glutamate stimulation are not protected by HD astrocytes. This iPSC-based HD model demonstrates the critical effects of mtHTT on human astrocytes, which not only broadens the understanding of disease susceptibility beyond cortical and striatal neurons but also increases potential drug targets.

Animal behavior is the final and integrated output of brain activity. Thus, recording and analyzing behavior is critical to understand the underlying brain function. While recording animal behavior has become easier than ever with the development of compact and inexpensive devices, detailed behavioral data analysis requires sufficient previous knowledge and/or high content data such as video images of animal postures, which makes it difficult for most of the animal behavioral data to be efficiently analyzed to understand brain function. Here, we report a versatile method using a hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning approach to efficiently estimate behavioral states and to extract important behavioral features only from low-content animal trajectory data. As proof of principle experiments, we analyzed trajectory data of worms, fruit flies, rats, and bats in the laboratories, and penguins and flying seabirds in the wild, which were recorded with various methods and span a wide range of spatiotemporal scales—from mm to 1000 km in space and from sub-seconds to days in time. We estimated several states during behavior and comprehensively extracted characteristic features from a behavioral state and/or a specific experimental condition. Physiological and genetic experiments in worms revealed that the extracted behavioral features reflected specific neural or gene activities. Thus, our method provides a versatile and unbiased way to extract behavioral features from simple trajectory data to understand brain function.

K-complexes identification is a challenging task in sleep research. The detection of k-complexes in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on visual inspection is time-consuming, prone to errors, and requires well-trained knowledge. Many existing methods for k-complexes detection rely mainly on analysing EEG signals in time and frequency domains. In this study, an efficient method is proposed to detect k-complexes from EEG signals based on the fractal dimension (FD) of time-frequency (T-F) images coupled with undirected graph features. Firstly, the EEG signal is partitioned into smaller segments using a sliding window technique. Each EEG segment is passed through a spectrogram of short time Fourier transform (STFT) to obtain T-F images. Secondly, the box-counting method is applied to each T-F image to estimate and discover the FDs in EEG signals. A vector of FD features are extracted from each T-F image and then mapped into an undirected graph.  The structural properties of the graphs are used as the representative features of the original EEG signals for the input of a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. Key graphic features are extracted from the undirected graphs. The extracted graph features are forwarded to the LS-SVM for classification. To investigate the classification ability of the proposed feature extraction combined with the LS-SVM classifier, the extracted features are also forwarded to a k-means classifier for comparison. The proposed method is compared with several existing k-complexes detection methods in which the same datasets were used. The findings of this study shows that the proposed method yields better classification results than other existing methods in the literature. An average accuracy of 97% for the detection of the k-complexes is obtained using the proposed method. The proposed method could lead to an efficient tool for the scoring of automatic sleep stages which could be useful for doctors and neurologists in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders and for sleep research

Indentifying lateralization of bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a challenging issue, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and routine band electrocorticography (ECoG) fail to reveal the epileptogenic focus for further temporal lobectomy treatment. HFOs can be utilized as a biomarker for lateralizing the onset zone in suspected bitemporal epilepsy. Except subjective vision detect the HFOs, objective verification should be performed to raising the accuracy. In present research, we prospectively studied 10 patients with refractory temporal seizures and underwent electrocorticography (ECoG) with wide-band frequency amplifiers (2048Hz), all patients had a Class I outcome after temporal resection. Pre- and ictal HFOs will be analyzed by wavelet transform (WT) and Granger causality (GC) for objectively verifying lateralization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). WT analysis showed ictal HFOs in 10 patients mainly covered from 80Hz to 115 Hz (average, 92.59 ± 10.23Hz ), and there was distinct band-pass boundary between pre-ictal HFOs and ictal HFOs. GC analysis showed 5 patients (2, 4, 5, 6, 7), no matter pre-ictal or ictal state, had highest GC degree in SOZ itself. The remaining patients (1, 3, 8, 9, 10) had highest GC degree in SOZ with its adjacent regions in pre-ictal and ictal stage. GC analysis further confirmed the result of WT, and suggested HFOs is initiated and propagated in local brain region mainly, afterwards, transmitting to adjacent brain regions. These results indicated that combination of WT and GC analysis significantly contribute to accurate lateralizing patients with suspected bitemporal epilepsy.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00041">A Temporal Signal-Processing Circuit Based on Spiking Neuron and Synaptic Learning</a></h4>

Time is a continuous, homogeneous, one-way and independent signal that cannot be modified by human will. Nearly 2,500 ago, Aristotle contended that, “time is the most unknown of all unknown things.” However, both humans and other animals have the ability to perceive time, and it is extremely easy to reproduce the time interval between two consecutive events. This ability to sense time is the basis of many normal cognitive activities, such as listening, speaking, and motion control. Although we constantly use our ability to perceive time, we do not know how our brain processes it. At present, time processing is generally divided into three categories: millisecond scale processing, second scale processing, and circadian rhythms. Different time processing scales correspond to different time processing mechanisms. The millisecond-scale processing range we have studied has a great effect on human perception and motion processing. This paper presents a model that uses spike neuron to construct a complete circuit for temporal processing. By combining the time-adaptive drift-diffusion model (TDDMs) with the transmission of impulse information between neurons, this new model is able to successfully reproduce the synchronization-continuation tapping task (SCT) experiments results. We also discovered that the neurons we used exhibited some of the firing properties of the time-related neurons detected by electrophysiological experiments. Therefore we believe that our model is closer to the neural circuit in the biological brain and can explain some of the phenomena in the temporal perception process.

The aim of this review is to summarize the effect of human intestinal microbiome on cognitive impairments and to focus primarily on the impact of diet and eating habits on learning processes. Better understanding of the microbiome could revolutionize the possibilities of therapy for many diseases. The authors performed a literature review of available studies on the research topic describing influence of human microbiome and diet on cognitive impairment or learning processes found in the world’s acknowledged databases Web of Science, PubMed, Springer, and Scopus. The digestive tube is populated by billions of living microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and microscopic fungi. In adulthood, under physiological conditions, the intestinal microbiome appears to be relatively steady. However, it is not true that it would not be influenced, both in the positive sense of the word and in the negative one. The basic pillars that maintain a steady microbiome are genetics, lifestyle, diet and eating habits, geography, and age. It is reported that the gastrointestinal tract and the brain communicate with each other through several pathways and one can speak about gut-brain axis. New evidence is published every year about the association of intestinal dysbiosis and neurological/psychiatric diseases. On the other hand, specific diets and eating habits can have positive effect on a balanced microbiota composition and thus contribute to the enhancement of cognitive functions, which are important for any learning process.

Exploratory behavior and responsiveness to novelty play an important role in maintaining cognitive function in older adults. Inferences about age- or disease-related differences in neural and behavioral responses to novelty are most often based on results from single experimental testing sessions. There has been very limited research on whether such findings represent stable characteristics of populations studied, which is essential if investigators are to determine the result of interventions aimed at promoting exploratory behaviors or draw appropriate conclusions about differences in the processing of novelty across diverse clinical groups. The goal of the current study was to investigate the short-term test-retest reliability of event-related potential (ERP) and behavioral responses to novel stimuli in cognitively normal older adults. ERPs and viewing durations were recorded in 70 healthy older adults participating in a subject-controlled visual novelty oddball task during two sessions occurring seven weeks apart. Mean midline P3 amplitude and latency, mean midline amplitude during successive 50ms intervals, temporospatial factors derived from principal component analysis, and viewing duration in response to novel stimuli were measured during each session.  ANOVAs revealed no reliable differences in the value of any measurements between time 1 and 2. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) between time 1 and 2 were excellent for mean P3 amplitude (ICC = .86), the temporospatial factors consistent with the P3 components (ICC of .88 and .76 respectively) and viewing duration of novel stimuli (ICC=.81). Reliability was only fair for P3 peak latency (ICC=.56). Successive 50ms mean amplitude measures from 100-1000ms yielded fair to excellent reliabilities, and all but one of the 12 temporospatial factors identified demonstrated ICCs in the good to excellent range. We conclude that older adults demonstrate substantial stability in ERP and behavioral responses to novel visual stimuli over a seven-week period. These results suggest that older adults may have a characteristic way of processing novelty that appears resistant to transient changes in their environment or internal states, which can be indexed during a single testing session. The establishment of reliable measures of novelty processing will allow investigators to determine whether proposed interventions have an impact on this important aspect of behavior.

Introduction: Tactile sensitivity is impaired in older adults, which contributes to the loss of manual dexterity and mobility function. The reliability of classical psychophysical tests, such as two-point gap discrimination, has been questioned. Here we tested a new method to determine tactile acuity during dynamic touch, which is more functional than static touch. The aim was to validate a method providing a high level of discrimination of tactile acuity in the elderly.
Methods: We tested the ability of subjects to evaluating the distance between bands printed on poly-methyl-methacrylate sheets. Pairs of sheets were compared in two groups of participants aged from 60 to 74 years; the test group was required to apply a cosmetic foam with an active ingredient on both their hands twice a day for one month, the control group had an identical task, but used the same cosmetic foam without any active ingredient. The tests were run in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
Results: The tactile discrimination threshold decreased by 83 µm after one month of cosmetic application in the group using the active ingredient while it was unchanged in the control group. 
Discussion: The test presented here provided highly accurate results and should be useful to determine tactile performance. It allows the monitoring of tactile rehabilitation and/or skin treatments used to restore tactile acuity in the elderly.

Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reported significant associations between gray matter (GM) density changes in various limbic and neocortical areas and worst cognitive performances in elderly controls. Longitudinal studies in this field remain scarce and led to conflicting data. We report a clinico-radiological investigation of 380 cognitively preserved individuals who undergo neuropsychological assessment at baseline and after 18 months. All cases were assessed using a continuous cognitive score taking into account the global evolution of neuropsychological performances. The vast majority of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 29 and 30 cases showed equal or worst performance at follow-up due to a ceiling effect. GM densities, white matter hyperintensities and arterial spin labeling (ASL) values were assessed in the hippocampus, amygdala, mesial temporal and parietal cortex at inclusion using 3 Tesla MRI Scans. Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid was available in a representative subsample of 64 cases. Regional amyloid uptake ratios (SUVr), mean cortical SUVr values (mcSUVr) and corresponding z-scores were calculated. Linear regression models were built to explore the association between the continuous cognitive score and imaging variables. The presence of an APOE-ε4 allele was negatively related to the continuous cognitive score. Among the areas studied, significant associations were found between GM densities in the hippocampus and amygdala but not mesial temporal and parietal areas and continuous cognitive score. Neither ASL values, Fazekas score nor mean and regional PET amyloid load were related to the cognitive score. In multivariate models, the presence of APOE-ε4 allele and GM densities in the hippocampus and amygdala were independently associated with worst cognitive evolution at follow-up. Our data support the idea that early GM damage in the hippocampus and amygdala occur long before the emergence of the very first signs of cognitive failure in brain aging.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The ability to adapt gait when negotiating unexpected hazards is crucial to maintain stability and avoid falling. This study investigated cognitive, physical and psychological factors associated with gait adaptability required for obstacle and stepping target negotiation in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
METHODS: Fifty-four people with PD were instructed to either (a) avoid an obstacle at usual step distance or (b) step onto a target at either a short or long step distance projected on a walkway two heel strikes ahead and then continue walking. Participants also completed clinical (Hoehn and Yahr rating scale; Movement Disorders Society version of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor section [MDS-UPDRS-III]), cognitive (simple reaction time, Trail Making and Stroop stepping [difference between incongruent and standard choice stepping reaction time] tests), physical (hip abductor muscle power and reactive balance [pull test from the MDS-UPDRS-III]) and psychological (Fall Efficacy Scale–International) assessments.
RESULTS: Discriminant function analysis revealed Stroop stepping test (inhibitory control) performance was the best predictor of stepping errors across the gait adaptability test conditions. Poorer executive function (Trail Making test) and reactive balance predicted poorer stepping accuracy in the short target condition; poorer reactive balance predicted increased number of steps taken to approach the obstacle and the long target; and poorer executive function predicted obstacle avoidance. Weaker hip abductor muscle power, poorer reactive balance, slower reaction time, poorer executive function and higher concern about falling were significant predictors of shorter step length while negotiating the obstacle/targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Superior executive function, effective reactive balance and good muscle power were associated with successful gait adaptability. Executive function and reactive balance appear particularly important for precise foot placements; and cognitive capacity for step length adjustments for avoiding obstacles. These findings suggest that impaired inhibitory control contributes to stepping errors and may increase fall risk in people with PD. These findings help elucidate mechanisms for why people with PD fall and may facilitate fall risk assessments and fall prevention strategies for this group.

Previous studies investigating working memory performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have mainly focused on the neural mechanisms of alterations in activation. To date, very few studies have investigated background network alterations in the working memory state. Therefore, the present study investigated the static and temporal dynamic changes in the background network in MCI patients during a working memory task.
A hybrid delayed-match-to-sample task was used to examine working memory performance in MCI patients. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected and the marker of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was used to investigate alterations in the background network.
The present study demonstrated static and dynamic alterations of ALFF in MCI patients during working memory tasks, relative to the resting state. Traditional static analysis revealed that ALFF decreased in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and left supplementary motor area for normal controls (NCs) in the working memory state. However, the same regions showed increased ALFF in MCI patients. Furthermore, relative to NCs, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related functional connectivity (FC) patterns, with the right VLPFC and right DLPFC as ROIs. In terms of temporal dynamic analysis, the present study found that in the working memory state dynamic ALFF of bilateral thalamus regions was increased in NCs but decreased in MCI patients. Additionally, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related coefficient of variation patterns; the regions in MCI patients were larger, and more widely distributed in the parietal and temporal lobes, relative to NCs.
This is the first study to examine static and temporal dynamic alterations of ALFF in the background network of MCI patients in working memory states. The results extend previous studies by providing a new perspective on the neural mechanisms of working memory deficits in MCI patients.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A large amount of brain imaging research has focused on group studies delineating differences between males and females with respect to both cognitive performance as well as structural and functional brain organization. To supplement existing findings, the present study employed a machine learning approach to assess how accurately participants’ sex can be classified based on spatially specific resting state (RS) brain connectivity, using 2 samples from the Human Connectome Project (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>1 = 434, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>2 = 310) and 1 fully independent sample from the 1000BRAINS study (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 941). The classifier, which was trained on 1 sample and tested on the other 2, was able to reliably classify sex, both within sample and across independent samples, differing both with respect to imaging parameters and sample characteristics. Brain regions displaying highest sex classification accuracies were mainly located along the cingulate cortex, medial and lateral frontal cortex, temporoparietal regions, insula, and precuneus. These areas were stable across samples and match well with previously described sex differences in functional brain organization. While our data show a clear link between sex and regionally specific brain connectivity, they do not support a clear-cut dimorphism in functional brain organization that is driven by sex alone.</span>

These drug-induced epigenetic adaptations mediate enduring changes in brain function which contribute to life-long, drug-related behavioral abnormalities that define addiction. Targeting these epigenetic alterations will enhance our understanding of the biological basis of addiction and might even yield more effective anti-addiction therapies. However, the complexity of the neuroepigenetic landscape makes it difficult to determine which drug-induced epigenetic changes causally contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of drug addiction. In this review, we highlight the evidence that epigenetic modifications, specifically histone modifications, within key brain reward regions are correlated with addiction. We then discuss the emerging field of locus-specific neuroepigenetic editing, which is a promising method for determining the causal epigenetic molecular mechanisms that drive an addicted state. Such approaches will substantially increase the field’s ability to establish the precise epigenetic mechanisms underlying drug addiction, and could lead to novel treatments for addictive disorders.</p></div>

This neurogenesis process requires intricate genetic regulation involving a combination of cell intrinsic transcription factors and extrinsic signaling molecules, and many critical factors have been identified that influence the timing and composition of the developing retina. Adding complexity to the process, over the past decade, a variety of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms have been shown to influence neurogenesis, and these include changes in histone modifications and the chromatin landscape and changes in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns.

Spinocerebellar ataxia 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), is a rare autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene. In the present study, we performed a global metabolomic analysis to identity pathogenic biochemical pathways and novel biomarkers implicated in SCA3 patients. Metabolic profiling of serum samples from 13 preclinical SCA3 patients, 13 symptomatic SCA3 patients, and 15 healthy controls were mapped using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. The symptomatic SCA3 patients showed a metabolic profile significantly distinct from those of the preclinical SCA3 patients and healthy controls. The principal differential metabolites were involved in the amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism pathways. In addition, four candidate serum biomarkers, FFA 16:1 (palmitoleic acid), FFA 18:3 (linolenic acid), L-Proline and L-Tryptophan, were selected to discriminate between symptomatic SCA3 patients and healthy controls by receiver operator curve analysis with area under the curve of 0.979. Our study demonstrates that symptomatic SCA3 patients present distinct metabolic profiles with perturbed amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, and FFA 16:1, FFA 18:3, L-Proline and L-Tryptophan are identified as potential disease biomarkers.

PARK20, an early onset autosomal recessive parkinsonism is due to mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-phosphatase Synaptojanin 1 (Synj1).
We have recently shown that the early endosomal compartments are profoundly altered in PARK20 fibroblasts as well as the endosomal trafficking. Here, we report that PARK20 fibroblasts also display a drastic alteration of the architecture and function of the early secretory compartments. Our results show that the exit machinery from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and the ER-to-Golgi trafficking are markedly compromised in patient cells. As a consequence, PARK20 fibroblasts accumulate large amounts of cargo proteins within the ER, leading to the induction of ER stress. Interestingly, this stressful state is coupled to the activation of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). In addition, PARK20 fibroblasts reveal upregulation of oxidative stress markers and total ROS production with concomitant alteration of the morphology of the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, treatment of PARK20 cells with GSK2606414 (GSK), a specific inhibitor of PERK activity, restores the level of ROS, signalling a direct correlation between ER stress and the induction of oxidative stress in the PARK20 cells. 
All together, these findings suggest that dysfunction of early secretory pathway might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00648">Eigenvector Centrality Dynamics From Resting-State fMRI: Gender and Age Differences in Healthy Subjects</a></h4>

With the increasing use of functional brain network properties as markers of brain disorders, efficient visualisation and evaluation methods have become essential. Eigenvector centrality mapping (ECM) of functional MRI (fMRI) data enables the representation of per-node graph theoretical measures as brain maps. This paper studies the use of centrality dynamics for measuring group differences in imaging studies.

Imaging data were used from a publicly available imaging study, which included resting fMRI data.  After warping the images to a standard space and masking cortical regions, ECM were computed in a sliding window. The dual regression method was used to identify dynamic centrality differences inside well-known resting state networks between gender and age groups.

Gender-related differences were found in the medial and lateral visual, motor, default mode, and executive control RSN, where male subjects had more consistent centrality variations within the network. Age-related differences between the youngest and oldest subjects, based on a median split, were found in the medial visual, executive control and left frontoparietal networks, where younger subjects had more consistent centrality variations within the network.

Our findings show that centrality dynamics can be used to identify between-group functional brain network centrality differences, and that age and gender distributions studies need to be taken into account in functional imaging studies.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00634">Characterizing Whole Brain Temporal Variation of Functional Connectivity via Zero and First Order Derivatives of Sliding Window Correlations</a></h4>

Brain functional connectivity has been shown to change over time during resting state fMRI experiments. Close examination of temporal changes have revealed a small set of whole-brain connectivity patterns called dynamic states. Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) studies have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate the dynamic states across several resting state experiments. However, estimation of states and their temporal dynamicity still suffers from noisy and imperfect estimations. In regular dFNC implementations, states are estimated by comparing connectivity patterns through the data without considering time, in other words only zero order changes are examined. In this work we propose a method that includes first order variations of dFNC in the searching scheme of dynamic connectivity patterns. Our approach, referred to as temporal variation of functional network connectivity (tvFNC), estimates the derivative of dFNC, and then searches for reoccurring patterns of concurrent dFNC states and their derivatives. The tvFNC method is first validated using a simulated dataset and then applied to a resting-state fMRI sample including healthy controls (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) patients and compared to the standard dFNC approach. Our dynamic approach reveals extra patterns in the connectivity derivatives complementing the already reported state patterns. State derivatives consist of additional information about increment and decrement of connectivity among brain networks not observed by the original dFNC method. The tvFNC shows more sensitivity than regular dFNC by uncovering additional FNC differences between the HC and SZ groups in each state. In summary, the tvFNC method provides a new and enhanced approach to examine time-varying functional connectivity.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of both upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) in the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. The neurodegenerative mechanisms leading to MN loss in ALS are not fully understood. Importantly, the reasons why MNs are specifically targeted in this disorder are unclear, when the proteins associated genetically or pathologically with ALS are expressed ubiquitously. Furthermore, MNs themselves are not affected equally; specific MNs subpopulations are more susceptible than others in both animal models and human patient tissues. Corticospinal MNs and lower somatic MNs, which innervate voluntary muscles, degenerate more readily than specific subgroups of lower MNs, which remain resistant to degeneration, reflecting the clinical manifestations of ALS. In this review, we discuss the possible factors intrinsic to MNs that render them uniquely susceptible to neurodegeneration in ALS. We also speculate why some MN subpopulations are more vulnerable than others, focussing on both their molecular and physiological properties. Finally, we review the anatomical network and neuronal microenvironment as determinants of MN subtype vulnerability and hence the progression of ALS.

γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) are the major mediators of synaptic inhibition in the brain. Aberrant GABAAR activity or regulation is observed in various neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and mental illnesses, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia. Benzodiazepines, anesthetics and other pharmaceutics targeting these receptors find broad clinical use, but their inherent lack of receptor subtype specificity causes unavoidable side effects, raising a need for new or adjuvant medications. In this review we introduce a new strategy to modulate GABAeric signaling: Targeting the intracellular protein interactors of GABAARs. Of special interest are scaffolding, anchoring and supporting proteins that display high GABAAR subtype specificity. Recent efforts to target gephyrin, the major intracellular integrator of GABAergic signaling, confirm that GABAAR-associated proteins can be successfully targeted through diverse molecules, including recombinant proteins, intrabodies, peptide-based probes and small molecules. Small-molecule artemisinins and peptides derived from endogenous interactors, that specifically target the universal receptor binding site of gephyrin, acutely affect synaptic GABAAR numbers and clustering, modifying neuronal transmission. Interference with GABAAR trafficking provides another way to modulate inhibitory signaling. Peptides blocking the binding site of GABAAR to AP2 increase the surface concentration of GABAAR clusters and enhance GABAergic signaling. Engineering of gephyrin binding peptides delivered superior means to interrogate neuronal structure and function. Fluorescent peptides, designed from gephyrin binders, enable live neuronal staining and visualization of gephyrin in the post synaptic sites with nanometer resolution. We anticipate that in the future, novel fluorescent probes, with improved size and binding efficiency, may find wide application in super resolution microscopy studies, enlightening the nanoscale architecture of the inhibitory synapse. Broader studies on GABAAR accessory proteins and the identification of the exact molecular binding interfaces and affinities will advance the development of novel GABAAR modulators and following in-vivo studies will reveal their clinical potential as adjuvant or stand-alone drugs.

The diversity of inhibitory interneurons allows for the coordination and modulation of excitatory principal cell firing. Interneurons that release GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) onto the soma and axon exert powerful control by virtue of proximity to the site of action potential generation at the axon initial segment (AIS). Here we review and examine the cellular and molecular regulation of soma and axon targeting GABAergic synapses in the cortex and hippocampus. We also describe their role in controlling network activity in normal and pathological states. Recent studies have demonstrated a specific role for postsynaptic dystroglycan in the formation and maintenance of cholecystokinin positive basket cell terminals contacting the soma, and postsynaptic collybistin in parvalbumin positive chandelier cell contacts onto the AIS. Unique presynaptic molecular contributors, LGI2 and FGF13, expressed in parvalbumin positive basket cells and chandelier cells respectively, have also recently been identified. Mutations in the genes encoding proteins critical for somatic and AIS inhibitory synapses have been associated with human disorders of the nervous system. Dystroglycan dysfunction in some congenital muscular dystrophies is associated with developmental brain malformations, intellectual disability, and rare epilepsy. Collybistin dysfunction has been linked to hyperekplexia, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and developmental disorders. Both LGI2 and FGF13 mutations are implicated in syndromes with epilepsy as a component. Advancing our understanding of the powerful roles of somatic and axonic GABAergic contacts in controlling activity patterns in the cortex and hippocampus will provide insight into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00664">Mitochondrial Complex I Function Is Essential for Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells Proliferation and Differentiation</a></h4>

Neurogenesis in developing and adult mammalian brain is a tightly regulated process that relies on neural stem cell activity. There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial metabolism affects neural stem cell homeostasis and differentiation but the precise role of mitochondrial function in the neurogenic process requires further investigation. Here, we have analyzed how mitochondrial complex I (MCI) dysfunction affects neural stem cell viability, proliferation and differentiation, as well as survival of the neural progeny. We have generated a conditional knockout model (hGFAP-NDUFS2 mice) in which expression of the NDUFS2 protein, essential for MCI function, is suppressed in cells expressing the Cre recombinase under the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, active in mouse radial glial cells and in neural stem cells that reside in adult neurogenic niches. In this model we observed that survival of central neural stem cell population does not appear to be severely affected by MCI dysfunction. However, perinatal brain development was markedly inhibited and Ndufs2 knockout mice died before the tenth postnatal day. In addition, in vitro studies of subventricular zone neural stem cells showed that active neural progenitors require a functional MCI to produce ATP and to proliferate. In vitro differentiation of neural precursors into neurons and oligodendrocytes was also profoundly affected. These data indicate the need of a correct MCI function and oxidative phosphorylation for glia-like neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and subsequent oligodendrocyte or neuronal maturation.

Abstract 
Objectives: This paper aims to determine if hypnotic suggestion analgesia and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) have a differential effect on pain perception. We hypothesized that tDCS would be more effective than hypnotic suggestion at changing the descending pain modulating system (DPMS), whereas the hypnotic suggestion would have a greater effect in quantitative sensory testing (QST). 
Design: This research was conducted as a randomized, blind and crossover trial. 
Settings: All the stages of this clinical trial were performed at the Laboratory of Pain and Neuromodulation of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre.
Subjects: Were included 24 healthy females aged from 18 to 45 years old, with a high susceptibility to hypnosis, according to the Waterloo-Stanford Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form C (15). 
Methods: The subjects received a random and crossover tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (2mA for 20min) and hypnotic analgesia (20min). 
Results: Only hypnotic suggestion produced changes that are statistically significant from pre- to post-intervention in the following outcomes measures: heat pain threshold (HPT), heat pain tolerance (HPTo), cold pressure test (CPT) and serum brain-derivate-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF). The analysis showed a significant main effect for treatment (F=4.32; P=0.04) when we compared the delta-(Δ) of CPM task between the tDCS and hypnotic suggestion groups. Also, the change in the Δ-BDNF was positively correlated with the CPM task. 
Conclusions: The results confirm a differential effect between hypnotic suggestion and tDCS on the pain measures. They suggest that the impact of the interventions has differential neural mechanisms, since the hypnotic suggestion improved pain perception, whereas the tDCS increased inhibition in the DPMS.

Registration information clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03744897.

Perspective: These findings highlight the effect of hypnotic suggestion on contra-regulating mechanisms involved in pain perception, while the tDCS increased inhibition in the DPMS. They could help clinicians comprehend the mechanisms involved in hypnotic analgesia and tDCS and thus may contribute to pain and disability management.

Keywords: Hypnotic analgesia, tDCS, Pain threshold, CPM, BDNF, Pain.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00654">Manganese-Induced Neurotoxicity: New Insights Into the Triad of Protein Misfolding, Mitochondrial Impairment, and Neuroinflammation</a></h4>

Occupational or environmental exposure to manganese (Mn) can lead to the development of “Manganism”, a neurological condition showing certain motor symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Like PD, Mn toxicity is seen in the central nervous system mainly affecting nigrostriatal neuronal circuitry and subsequent behavioral and motor impairments. Since the first report of Mn-induced toxicity in 1837, various experimental and epidemiological studies have been conducted to understand this disorder. While early investigations focused on the impact of high concentrations of Mn on the mitochondria and subsequent oxidative stress, current studies have attempted to elucidate the cellular and molecular pathways involved in Mn toxicity. In fact, recent reports suggest the involvement of Mn in the misfolding of proteins such as α-synuclein and amyloid, thus providing credence to the theory that environmental exposure to toxicants can either initiate or propagate neurodegenerative processes by interfering with disease-specific proteins.  Besides manganism and PD, Mn has also been implicated in other neurological diseases such as Huntington’s and Prion diseases. While many reviews have focused on Mn homeostasis, the aim of this review is to concisely synthesize what we know about its effect primarily on the nervous system with respect to its role in protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, and consequently, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Based on the current evidence, we propose a ‘Mn Mechanistic Neurotoxic Triad’ comprising 1) mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, 2) protein trafficking and misfolding, and 3) neuroinflammation.
