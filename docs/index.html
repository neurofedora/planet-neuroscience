              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00545">Segmentation algorithms and modeling of recurrent bursting events in neuronal and glial time series</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-time series of neuronal recordings are resulting from the activity of connected neuronal networks. Yet how neuronal properties can be extracted remains empirical. We review here the data analysis based on network models to recover physiological parameters from electrophysiological and calcium recordings in neurons and astrocytes. After, we present the recording techniques and activation events, such as burst and interburst and Up and Down states. We then describe time-serie segmentation methods developed to detect and to segment these events. To interpret the statistics extracted from time series, we present computational models of neuronal populations based on synaptic short-term plasticity and After hyperpolarization. We discuss how these models are calibrated so that they can reproduce the statistics observed in the experimental time series. They serve to extract specific parameters by comparing numerical and experimental statistical moment or entire distributions. Finally, we discus cases where calibrated models are used to predict the selective impact of some parameters on the circuit behavior, properties that would otherwise be difficult to dissect experimentally.

Abstract: In 2023, Lubineau et al. published an article [1] detailing several experiments carried out with dyslexic readers. These authors attempted to measure the change in reading performance under different reading conditions using flickering devices. Beyond the low-frequency systems which have nevertheless shown their interest for some cases, we restrict here our response to the high-frequency systems, i.e. electronically controlled glasses (Lexilens) and lamps, designed and built upon recent work by Le Floch and Ropars [2]. Lubineau et al. found no significant change in reading performance at either low or high frequencies and concluded that these devices provide no or minor benefits. Unfortunately, experimental misunderstandings and some methodological issues invalidate namely the main conclusion concerning the high frequency systems.

                arXiv:2411.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the spike-adding mechanism in a class of three-dimensional fast-slow systems with three distinct timescales, inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model driven by periodic input. First, we numerically generate a bifurcation diagram for the FHN model by varying the frequency and amplitude of the input, revealing that as the frequency decreases and the amplitude increases, the number of spikes within each burst grows. Next, we apply methods from geometric singular perturbation theory to compute critical and super-critical manifolds of the fast-slow system. We use them to characterize the emergence of new burst-spikes in the FHN model, when the periodic forcing resembles a low frequency-band brain rhythm. We then describe how the uncovered spike-adding mechanism defines the boundaries that separate regions with different spike counts in the parameter space.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00238">Understanding the Limits of Vision Language Models Through the Lens of the Binding Problem</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00661">Unveiling Normative Trajectories of Lifespan Brain Maturation Using Quantitative MRI</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Brain maturation and aging involve significant microstructural changes, resulting in functional and cognitive alterations. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) can measure this evolution, distinguishing the physiological effects of normal aging from pathological deviations.
  Methods: We conducted a multicentre study using qMRI metrics (R1, R2*, and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping) to model age trajectories across brain structures, including tractography-based white matter bundles (TWMB), superficial white matter (SWM), and cortical grey matter (CGM). MRI data from 537 healthy subjects, aged 8 to 79 years, were harmonized using two independent methods. We modeled age trajectories and performed regional analyses to capture maturation patterns and aging effects across the lifespan.
  Findings: Our findings revealed a distinct brain maturation gradient, with early qMRI peak values in TWMB, followed by SWM, and culminating in CGM regions. This gradient was observed as a posterior-to-anterior maturation pattern in the cortex and an inferior-to-superior maturation pattern in white matter tracts. R1 demonstrated the most robust age trajectories, while R2* and susceptibility exhibited greater variability and different patterns. The normative modeling framework confirmed the reliability of our age-modelled trajectories across datasets.
  Interpretation: Our study highlights the potential of multiparametric qMRI to capture complex, region-specific brain development patterns, addressing the need for comprehensive, age-spanning studies across multiple brain structures. Various harmonization strategies can merge qMRI cohorts, improving the robustness of qMRI-based age models and facilitating the understanding of normal patterns and disease-associated deviations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09614">Exploring Behavior-Relevant and Disentangled Neural Dynamics with Generative Diffusion Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.09614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ``how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors''. However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11459">Du-IN: Discrete units-guided mask modeling for decoding speech from Intracranial Neural signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.11459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Invasive brain-computer interfaces with Electrocorticography (ECoG) have shown promise for high-performance speech decoding in medical applications, but less damaging methods like intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) remain underexplored. With rapid advances in representation learning, leveraging abundant recordings to enhance speech decoding is increasingly attractive. However, popular methods often pre-train temporal models based on brain-level tokens, overlooking that brain activities in different regions are highly desynchronized during tasks. Alternatively, they pre-train spatial-temporal models based on channel-level tokens but fail to evaluate them on challenging tasks like speech decoding, which requires intricate processing in specific language-related areas. To address this issue, we collected a well-annotated Chinese word-reading sEEG dataset targeting language-related brain networks from 12 subjects. Using this benchmark, we developed the Du-IN model, which extracts contextual embeddings based on region-level tokens through discrete codex-guided mask modeling. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 61-word classification task, surpassing all baselines. Model comparisons and ablation studies reveal that our design choices, including (i) temporal modeling based on region-level tokens by utilizing 1D depthwise convolution to fuse channels in the ventral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and (ii) self-supervision through discrete codex-guided mask modeling, significantly contribute to this performance. Overall, our approach -- inspired by neuroscience findings and capitalizing on region-level representations from specific brain regions -- is suitable for invasive brain modeling and represents a promising neuro-inspired AI approach in brain-computer interfaces.

                arXiv:2410.22283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient deep learning solution for decoding motor movements from neural recordings in non-human primates. An Autoencoder Gated Recurrent Unit (AEGRU) model was adopted as the model architecture for this task. The autoencoder is only used during the training stage to achieve better generalization. Together with the preprocessing techniques, our model achieved 0.71 $R^2$ score, surpassing the baseline models in Neurobench and is ranked first for $R^2$ in the IEEE BioCAS 2024 Grand Challenge on Neural Decoding. Model pruning is also applied leading to a reduction of 41.4% of the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations with little change in the $R^2$ score compared to the unpruned model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01354">Long-Range Feedback Spiking Network Captures Dynamic and Static Representations of the Visual Cortex under Movie Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2306.01354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used models for investigating biological visual representations. However, existing DNNs are mostly designed to analyze neural responses to static images, relying on feedforward structures and lacking physiological neuronal mechanisms. There is limited insight into how the visual cortex represents natural movie stimuli that contain context-rich information. To address these problems, this work proposes the long-range feedback spiking network (LoRaFB-SNet), which mimics top-down connections between cortical regions and incorporates spike information processing mechanisms inherent to biological neurons. Taking into account the temporal dependence of representations under movie stimuli, we present Time-Series Representational Similarity Analysis (TSRSA) to measure the similarity between model representations and visual cortical representations of mice. LoRaFB-SNet exhibits the highest level of representational similarity, outperforming other well-known and leading alternatives across various experimental paradigms, especially when representing long movie stimuli. We further conduct experiments to quantify how temporal structures (dynamic information) and static textures (static information) of the movie stimuli influence representational similarity, suggesting that our model benefits from long-range feedback to encode context-dependent representations just like the brain. Altogether, LoRaFB-SNet is highly competent in capturing both dynamic and static representations of the mouse visual cortex and contributes to the understanding of movie processing mechanisms of the visual system. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Grasshlw/SNN-Neural-Similarity-Movie.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24070">Dynamical similarity analysis uniquely captures how computations develop in RNNs</a></h4>

Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems are increasingly popular tools in neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Measures comparing neural activations across conditions, architectures, and species give scalable ways to understand information transformation within different neural networks. However, recent findings show that some metrics respond to spurious signals, leading to misleading results. Establishing benchmark test cases is thus essential for identifying the most reliable metric and potential improvements. We propose that compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can provide a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. Implementing this case allows us to evaluate if metrics can identify representations that develop throughout learning and determine if representations identified by metrics reflect the network's actual computations. Building both attractor and RNN based test cases, we show that the recently proposed Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and reliably identifies behaviorally relevant representations compared to prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also demonstrate how such test cases can extend beyond metric evaluation to study new architectures. Specifically, testing DSA in modern (Mamba) state space models suggests that these models, unlike RNNs, may not require changes in recurrent dynamics due to their expressive hidden states. Overall, we develop test cases that showcase how DSA's enhanced ability to detect dynamical motifs makes it highly effective for identifying ongoing computations in RNNs and revealing how networks learn tasks.

Abstract: The recent success of Vision Transformers has generated significant interest in attention mechanisms and transformer architectures. Although existing methods have proposed spiking self-attention mechanisms compatible with spiking neural networks, they often face challenges in effective deployment on current neuromorphic platforms. This paper introduces a novel model that combines vision transformers with the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) to facilitate efficient neuromorphic deployment. Our experiments show that ViT-LCA achieves higher accuracy on ImageNet-1K dataset while consuming significantly less energy than other spiking vision transformer counterparts. Furthermore, ViT-LCA's neuromorphic-friendly design allows for more direct mapping onto current neuromorphic architectures.

                arXiv:2411.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization has burgeoned as a potent methodology for informed decision-making in enhanced geothermal systems, aiming to concurrently maximize economic yield, ensure enduring geothermal energy provision, and curtail carbon emissions. However, addressing a multitude of design parameters inherent in computationally intensive physics-driven simulations constitutes a formidable impediment for geothermal design optimization, as well as across a broad range of scientific and engineering domains. Here we report an Active Learning enhanced Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization algorithm, integrated with hydrothermal simulations in fractured media, to enable efficient optimization of fractured geothermal systems using few model evaluations. We introduce probabilistic neural network as classifier to learns to predict the Pareto dominance relationship between candidate samples and reference samples, thereby facilitating the identification of promising but uncertain offspring solutions. We then use active learning strategy to conduct hypervolume based attention subspace search with surrogate model by iteratively infilling informative samples within local promising parameter subspace. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting extensive experimental tests of the integrated framework, including multi-objective benchmark functions, a fractured geothermal model and a large-scale enhanced geothermal system. Results demonstrate that the ALEMO approach achieves a remarkable reduction in required simulations, with a speed-up of 1-2 orders of magnitude (10-100 times faster) than traditional evolutionary methods, thereby enabling accelerated decision-making. Our method is poised to advance the state-of-the-art of renewable geothermal energy system and enable widespread application to accelerate the discovery of optimal designs for complex systems.

Abstract: In this survey, we introduce Meta-Black-Box-Optimization (MetaBBO) as an emerging avenue within the Evolutionary Computation (EC) community, which incorporates Meta-learning approaches to assist automated algorithm design. Despite the success of MetaBBO, the current literature provides insufficient summaries of its key aspects and lacks practical guidance for implementation. To bridge this gap, we offer a comprehensive review of recent advances in MetaBBO, providing an in-depth examination of its key developments. We begin with a unified definition of the MetaBBO paradigm, followed by a systematic taxonomy of various algorithm design tasks, including algorithm selection, algorithm configuration, solution manipulation, and algorithm generation. Further, we conceptually summarize different learning methodologies behind current MetaBBO works, including reinforcement learning, supervised learning, neuroevolution, and in-context learning with Large Language Models. A comprehensive evaluation of the latest representative MetaBBO methods is then carried out, alongside an experimental analysis of their optimization performance, computational efficiency, and generalization ability. Based on the evaluation results, we meticulously identify a set of core designs that enhance the generalization and learning effectiveness of MetaBBO. Finally, we outline the vision for the field by providing insight into the latest trends and potential future directions. Relevant literature will be continuously collected and updated at https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Awesome-MetaBBO.

Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) are a powerful tool for addressing physical systems, particularly those governed by conservation laws. LNNs can parametrize the Lagrangian of a system to predict trajectories with nearly conserved energy. These techniques have proven effective in unconstrained systems as well as those with holonomic constraints. In this work, we adapt LNN techniques to mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. We test our approach on some well-known examples with nonholonomic constraints, showing that incorporating these restrictions into the neural network's learning improves not only trajectory estimation accuracy but also ensures adherence to constraints and exhibits better energy behavior compared to the unconstrained counterpart.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00156">Unlocking the Potential of Global Human Expertise</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving societal problems on a global scale requires the collection and processing of ideas and methods from diverse sets of international experts. As the number and diversity of human experts increase, so does the likelihood that elements in this collective knowledge can be combined and refined to discover novel and better solutions. However, it is difficult to identify, combine, and refine complementary information in an increasingly large and diverse knowledge base. This paper argues that artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in this process. An evolutionary AI framework, termed RHEA, fills this role by distilling knowledge from diverse models created by human experts into equivalent neural networks, which are then recombined and refined in a population-based search. The framework was implemented in a formal synthetic domain, demonstrating that it is transparent and systematic. It was then applied to the results of the XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge, in which over 100 teams of experts across 23 countries submitted models based on diverse methodologies to predict COVID-19 cases and suggest non-pharmaceutical intervention policies for 235 nations, states, and regions across the globe. Building upon this expert knowledge, by recombining and refining the 169 resulting policy suggestion models, RHEA discovered a broader and more effective set of policies than either AI or human experts alone, as evaluated based on real-world data. The results thus suggest that AI can play a crucial role in realizing the potential of human expertise in global problem-solving.

                arXiv:2411.00222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adversarial example is a modified input image designed to cause a Machine Learning (ML) model to make a mistake; these perturbations are often invisible or subtle to human observers and highlight vulnerabilities in a model's ability to generalize from its training data. Several adversarial attacks can create such examples, each with a different perspective, effectiveness, and perceptibility of changes. Conversely, defending against such adversarial attacks improves the robustness of ML models in image processing and other domains of deep learning. Most defence mechanisms require either a level of model awareness, changes to the model, or access to a comprehensive set of adversarial examples during training, which is impractical. Another option is to use an auxiliary model in a preprocessing manner without changing the primary model. This study presents a practical and effective solution -- using predictive coding networks (PCnets) as an auxiliary step for adversarial defence. By seamlessly integrating PCnets into feed-forward networks as a preprocessing step, we substantially bolster resilience to adversarial perturbations. Our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of PCnets in mitigating adversarial examples with about 82% and 65% improvements in robustness, respectively. The PCnet, trained on a small subset of the dataset, leverages its generative nature to effectively counter adversarial efforts, reverting perturbed images closer to their original forms. This innovative approach holds promise for enhancing the security and reliability of neural network classifiers in the face of the escalating threat of adversarial attacks.

                arXiv:2411.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crucial role of convolutional models, both as standalone vision models and backbones in foundation models, necessitates effective acceleration techniques. This paper proposes a novel method to learn semi-structured sparsity patterns for convolution kernels in the form of maskings enabling the utilization of readily available hardware accelerations. The approach accelerates convolutional models more than two-fold during inference without decreasing model performance. At the same time, the original model weights and structure remain unchanged keeping the model thus easily updatable. Beyond the immediate practical use, the effect of maskings on prediction is easily quantifiable. Therefore, guarantees on model predictions under maskings are derived showing stability bounds for learned maskings even after updating the original underlying model.

                arXiv:2411.00335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video color style transfer aims to transform the color style of an original video by using a reference style image. Most existing methods employ neural networks, which come with challenges like opaque transfer processes and limited user control over the outcomes. Typically, users cannot fine-tune the resulting images or videos. To tackle this issue, we introduce a method that predicts specific parameters for color style transfer using two images. Initially, we train a neural network to learn the corresponding color adjustment parameters. When applying style transfer to a video, we fine-tune the network with key frames from the video and the chosen style image, generating precise transformation parameters. These are then applied to convert the color style of both images and videos. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses current methods in color style transfer quality. Moreover, each parameter in our method has a specific, interpretable meaning, enabling users to understand the color style transfer process and allowing them to perform manual fine-tuning if desired.

                arXiv:2006.11444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world optimization problems can be stated in terms of submodular functions. Furthermore, these real-world problems often involve uncertainties which may lead to the violation of given constraints. A lot of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms following the Pareto optimization approach have recently been analyzed and applied to submodular problems with different types of constraints. We present a first runtime analysis of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms based on Pareto optimization for chance-constrained submodular functions. Here the constraint involves stochastic components and the constraint can only be violated with a small probability of alpha. We investigate the classical GSEMO algorithm for two different bi-objective formulations using tail bounds to determine the feasibility of solutions. We show that the algorithm GSEMO obtains the same worst case performance guarantees for monotone submodular functions as recently analyzed greedy algorithms for the case of uniform IID weights and uniformly distributed weights with the same dispersion when using the appropriate bi-objective formulation. As part of our investigations, we also point out situations where the use of tail bounds in the first bi-objective formulation can prevent GSEMO from obtaining good solutions in the case of uniformly distributed weights with the same dispersion if the objective function is submodular but non-monotone due to a single element impacting monotonicity. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of the evolutionary multi-objective algorithms GSEMO, NSGA-II and SPEA2 on different submodular chance-constrained network problems. Our experimental results show that the use of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms leads to significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art greedy algorithms for submodular optimization.

                arXiv:2402.17423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has found successful applications in many fields of science and engineering. Recently, there has been a growing interest in meta-learning particular components of BBO algorithms to speed up optimization and get rid of tedious hand-crafted heuristics. As an extension, learning the entire algorithm from data requires the least labor from experts and can provide the most flexibility. In this paper, we propose RIBBO, a method to reinforce-learn a BBO algorithm from offline data in an end-to-end fashion. RIBBO employs expressive sequence models to learn the optimization histories produced by multiple behavior algorithms and tasks, leveraging the in-context learning ability of large models to extract task information and make decisions accordingly. Central to our method is to augment the optimization histories with \textit{regret-to-go} tokens, which are designed to represent the performance of an algorithm based on cumulative regret over the future part of the histories. The integration of regret-to-go tokens enables RIBBO to automatically generate sequences of query points that satisfy the user-desired regret, which is verified by its universally good empirical performance on diverse problems, including BBO benchmark functions, hyper-parameter optimization and robot control problems.

SNNs emulate the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, making them particularly well-suited for real-time, event-driven processing. To fully harness the potential of SNNs across different neuromorphic platforms, effective training methodologies are essential. In SNNs, learning rules are based on neurons' spiking behavior, that is, if and when spikes are generated due to a neuron's membrane potential exceeding that neuron's spiking threshold, and this spike timing encodes vital information. However, the threshold is generally treated as a hyperparameter, and incorrect selection can lead to neurons that do not spike for large portions of the training process, hindering the effective rate of learning. This work focuses on the significance of learning neuron thresholds alongside weights in SNNs. Our results suggest that promoting threshold from a hyperparameter to a trainable parameter effectively addresses the issue of dead neurons during training. This leads to a more robust training algorithm, resulting in improved convergence, increased test accuracy, and a substantial reduction in the number of training epochs required to achieve viable accuracy on spatiotemporal datasets such as NMNIST, DVS128, and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), with up to 30% training speed-up and up to 2% higher accuracy on these datasets.

Abstract: We present a novel method for symbolic regression (SR), the task of searching for compact programmatic hypotheses that best explain a dataset. The problem is commonly solved using genetic algorithms; we show that we can enhance such methods by inducing a library of abstract textual concepts. Our algorithm, called LaSR, uses zero-shot queries to a large language model (LLM) to discover and evolve concepts occurring in known high-performing hypotheses. We discover new hypotheses using a mix of standard evolutionary steps and LLM-guided steps (obtained through zero-shot LLM queries) conditioned on discovered concepts. Once discovered, hypotheses are used in a new round of concept abstraction and evolution. We validate LaSR on the Feynman equations, a popular SR benchmark, as well as a set of synthetic tasks. On these benchmarks, LaSR substantially outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art SR approaches based on deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we show that LaSR can be used to discover a novel and powerful scaling law for LLMs.

Abstract: We consider the problem of team formation within multiagent adversarial games. We propose BERTeam, a novel algorithm that uses a transformer-based deep neural network with Masked Language Model training to select the best team of players from a trained population. We integrate this with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning, which trains a diverse set of individual players to choose teams from. We test our algorithm in the multiagent adversarial game Marine Capture-The-Flag, and we find that BERTeam learns non-trivial team compositions that perform well against unseen opponents. For this game, we find that BERTeam outperforms MCAA, an algorithm that similarly optimizes team formation.

                arXiv:2410.23126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal memorization capacity of modern Hopfield models and Kernelized Hopfield Models (KHMs), a transformer-compatible class of Dense Associative Memories. We present a tight analysis by establishing a connection between the memory configuration of KHMs and spherical codes from information theory. Specifically, we treat the stored memory set as a specialized spherical code. This enables us to cast the memorization problem in KHMs into a point arrangement problem on a hypersphere. We show that the optimal capacity of KHMs occurs when the feature space allows memories to form an optimal spherical code. This unique perspective leads to: (i) An analysis of how KHMs achieve optimal memory capacity, and identify corresponding necessary conditions. Importantly, we establish an upper capacity bound that matches the well-known exponential lower bound in the literature. This provides the first tight and optimal asymptotic memory capacity for modern Hopfield models. (ii) A sub-linear time algorithm $\mathtt{U}\text{-}\mathtt{Hop}$+ to reach KHMs' optimal capacity. (iii) An analysis of the scaling behavior of the required feature dimension relative to the number of stored memories. These efforts improve both the retrieval capability of KHMs and the representation learning of corresponding transformers. Experimentally, we provide thorough numerical results to back up theoretical findings.

	<p>Background: Accounting for dementia risk factors is essential in identifying people who would benefit most from intervention programs. The CAIDE dementia risk score is commonly applied, but its link to brain function remains unclear. This study aims to determine whether the variation in this score is associated with neurophysiological changes and cognitive measures in normative individuals. Methods: The sample comprised 38 participants aged between 54 and 79 (M = 67.05; SD = 6.02). Data were collected using paper-and-pencil tests and electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in the resting state, channels FP1 and FP2. The EEG signals were analyzed using Power Spectral Density (PSD)-based features. Results: The CAIDE score is positively correlated with the relative power activation of the &amp;amp;theta; band and negatively correlated with the MMSE cognitive test score, and MMSE variations align with those found in distributions of EEG-extracted PSD-based features. Conclusions: The findings suggest that CAIDE scores can identify individuals without noticeable cognitive changes who already exhibit brain activity similar to that seen in people with dementia. They also contribute to the convergent validity between CAIDE and the risk of cognitive decline. This underscores the importance of early monitoring of these factors to reduce the incidence of dementia.</p>

	<p>Background: Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) represents one of the most common and debilitating effects in patients surviving after cancer treatments. Neurocognitive deficits are important causes of disability and burden in cancer survivors. The true magnitude of CRCI is difficult to define due to significant heterogeneity of literature data. At present, there is no agreement on the gold standard for detection and grading of CRCI in clinical trials, and there is a lack of clear knowledge of its pathophysiology. Objectives: In this review, we aim to discuss some perspectives for future research to pursue in order to cover the gaps in knowledge in the CRCI field. Methods: We focused our literature research on the following relevant issues: neuroradiological correlates of CRCI; objective neuropsychological evaluation and subjective complaint assessment and their correlation with objective measures; timing of assessment; and possible treatments. Results: The correct methodology for evaluating cognitive deficits induced by anti-tumor treatments still requires a definition based on quality scientific evidence, and literature data are currently scarce. Conclusions: This review highlights the need for further research to understand the causes and consequences of cancer-related cognitive impairment using standardized and sensitive measures of cognitive functions and the long-term effects of chemotherapy on cognitive functions and to develop effective interventions.</p>

">Tachykinin1-expressing neurons in the parasubthalamic nucleus control active avoidance learning</a></h4>

              
                Active avoidance is a type of instrumental behavior that requires an organism actively to engage in specific actions to avoid or escape from a potentially aversive stimulus and is crucial for the survival and well-being of organisms. It requires a widely distributed, hard-wired neural circuits spanning multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and thalamus. However, less is known about whether and how the hypothalamus encodes and controls active avoidance learning. Here we identify a previously unknown role for the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), located in the lateral subdivision of the posterior hypothalamus, in the encoding and control of active avoidance learning. Fiber photometry calcium imaging shows that the activity of tachykinin1-expressing PSTN (PSTNTac1) neurons progressively increases during this learning. Cell-type specific ablation and optogenetic inhibition of PSTNTac1 neurons attenuates active avoidance learning, whereas optogenetic activation of these cells promotes this learning via a negative motivational drive. Moreover, the PSTN mediates this learning differentially through its downstream targets. Together, this study identifies the PSTN as a new member of the neural networks involved in active avoidance learning and offers us potential implications for therapeutic interventions targeting anxiety disorders and other conditions involving maladaptive avoidance learning.

">An exploration of complex action stopping across multiple datasets: Insights into the mechanisms of action cancellation and re-programming</a></h4>

              
                A long history of psychological experiments has utilised stop signal paradigms to assess action inhibition. Recent studies have investigated complex stopping behaviours, such as response-selective stopping where only one component of a bimanual action requires cancellation. A current emphasis has been to utilise electromyographical (EMG) recordings to assess the temporal dynamics of action inhibition at the level of the muscle, beyond those based solely on observable behavioural events. Here, we combine EMG and behavioural data from 17 cohorts of healthy younger and older adults yielding over 42,000 response-selective stopping trials, providing unique insights into this emerging field. Expanding from past research in this area, our robust single-trial EMG analyses permit detection of cancelled (partial) and response-generating EMG bursts in both hands, revealing substantial overlaps in the distributions of timing of action cancellation and re-programming. These findings are consistent with recent experimental and modelling evidence, suggesting that response-selective stopping involves two independent processes: a discrete bimanual stop and initiation of a new unimanual response. This overlap appears incompatible with the recent pause-then-cancel model, and more consistent with a broader 'pause-then-retune' account, where a slower process mediates any action updating, not just cancellation. Moreover, this independence means that cancellation can happen at any time during motor planning and execution, against the notion of an observable 'point of no return' in motor actions. We also discuss best practices for the analysis of EMG data and indicate how methodological aspects, such as choosing appropriate reference time points, can influence the outcomes and their interpretation.

">Synaptic and Somatic Targeting of ArcLight, a Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicator</a></h4>

              
                Voltage signals in neurons are highly compartmentalized, which can influence their specific functions within neuronal circuits. Targeting of a genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) to specific subcellular compartments can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and provide more precise information about the location and timing of synaptic firing across different neuronal regions, reducing spatiotemporal signal convolution. To achieve subcellular targeting of the GEVI, ArcLight, we utilized five different postsynaptic targeting sequences (Shaker K+ channel C-terminus, stargazin C-terminus, rat Neuroligin-1 C-terminus, and anti-homer1 nanobodies HC20 & HC87) to direct ArcLight expression to the excitatory postsynaptic density. Additionally, we assessed a presynaptic-targeting tag (rat Neurexin-1{beta} C-terminus) and a somatodendritic targeting tag (Kv2.1-Lk-Tlcn C-terminus). Patch clamp experiments in HEK293 cells showed that the targeting tags used in this study did not significantly alter ArcLight's voltage sensitivity compared to controls. AAV infection in the mouse olfactory bulb demonstrated that the subcellular targeting sequences effectively localized GEVI expression to specific compartments of mitral/tufted cells, including postsynaptic densities, presynaptic terminals, and somatodendritic regions. Furthermore, in vivo voltage imaging in mice expressing targeting-enhanced ArcLight variants revealed odorant-evoked responses similar to those observed with the original ArcLight. This indicates that subcellular targeting did not significantly impact the voltage sensing capability of ArcLight in mitral/tufted cells.

                Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) activate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on dopamine axons to extend the range of dopamine release. Here we show that synchronous activation of CINs induces and extends the range of local serotonin release via a similar mechanism. This process is exaggerated in the hypercholinergic striatum of a mouse model of OCD-like behavior, implicating CINs as critical regulators of serotonin levels in the healthy and pathological striatum.

">Pyramidal cell types and 5-HT2A receptors are essential for psilocybin's lasting drug action</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with therapeutic potential for treating mental illnesses. At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodeling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell type-specific circuits to produce psychedelics' behavioral actions. Here, we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation, and cell type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increased the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviorally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin's ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin's effects on stress-related behavior and structural plasticity. Collectively these results identify a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex as playing essential roles for psilocybin's long-term drug action.

">Cilia dysfunction in the lateral ventricles after neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage does not lead to functional changes in cilia-based CSF flow networks</a></h4>

              
                Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) has long been thought to lead to motile cilia dysfunction whereby intraventricular blood breakdown products damage and slough cilia from the ependymal wall. However, specifically how IVH may affect cilia development, structure, and transcriptional activation is not well-understood. Moreover, the impact of blood breakdown product-mediated cilia damage on the functional organization of cilia-based CSF flow networks is unknown. Here, we show hemoglobin exposure affects the number of ciliated ependymal cells in the lateral ventricle (LV) but does not impact in vitro beat frequency of the remaining cilia. Ultrastructurally, IVH decreases the total number of ciliary tufts without impacting axoneme structure. IVH does not result in changes in the expression of cilia-related genes and instead leads to downregulation of neurogenesis markers in parallel with innate immune upregulation. Functionally, we identify three previously uncharacterized cilia-mediated CSF flow domains in the LV lateral wall and show that IVH does not result in widespread disruption of their functional organization. These data de-emphasize cilia as a major contributor to global CSF dysfunction after IVH, and instead call attention to preserving the neurodevelopmental environment and preventing runaway innate immune system activation, as considerations to developing treatment strategies to prevent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus and other neurodevelopmental sequelae.

">A Bidirectional Brain-Fat Body Axis for Pathogen Avoidance</a></h4>

              
                Ingesting pathogens through spoiled food can cause serious harm, including infections, tissue damage, and even death. To prevent these outcomes, many animals have evolved behaviors to avoid consuming harmful pathogens. While pathogen avoidance behavior is conserved across species, the mechanisms linking immune responses of the body with neuron-controlled behavior remain unclear. Building on our previous findings, we here present a new bidirectional body-brain communication between the fat body and the nervous system that drives immune receptor-induced avoidance behavior. We show that immune receptor signaling and a specific antimicrobial peptide (AMP) are essential in both octopaminergic neuromodulatory neurons and the fat body for rapidly reducing pathogen intake after initial ingestion. Mechanistically, the octopaminergic neurons innervate the fly fat body where they trigger a calcium response through a specific octopamine receptor. This octopaminergic signal prompts the fat body to release dopamine. In turn, Dop1R1 signaling in output neurons of the mushroom body, the insect higher brain center, drives pathogen avoidance. Together, our data suggest that ingested pathogens are detected by immune receptors in neurons, which, through synaptic connections, trigger the release of dopamine and AMPs from fat cells. While AMPs combat the pathogens, dopamine reduces further ingestion by inducing behavioral changes. This mechanism demonstrates efficient communication between the body and brain, coordinating survival behaviors through systemic dopamine signaling from the fat body to the brain.

">Neuron-astrocyte Coupling in Lateral Habenula Mediates Depressive-like Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                The lateral habenular (LHb) neurons and astrocytes have been strongly implicated in depression etiology but it was not clear how the two dynamically interact during depression onset. Here, using multi-brain-region calcium photometry recording in freely-moving mice, we discover that stress induces a unique, bimodal neuronal response and a most rapid astrocytic response in the LHb. LHb astrocytic calcium requires the 1A-adrenergic receptor, and depends on a recurrent neural network between the LHb and locus coeruleus (LC). Through the gliotransmitter glutamate and ATP/Adenosine, LHb astrocytes mediate the second-wave activation of local LHb neurons as well as release of norepinephrine (NE). Activation or inhibition LHb astrocytic calcium signaling facilitates or prevents stress-induced depressive-like behaviors respectively. These results identify a stress-induced positive feedback loop in the LHb-LC axis, with astrocytes being a critical signaling relay. The identification of this prominent neuron-glia interaction may shed light on stress management and depression prevention.

">On the neural substrates of mind wandering and dynamic thought: A drug and brain stimulation study</a></h4>

              
                The impact of mind wandering on our daily lives ranges from diminishing productivity, to facilitating creativity and problem solving. There is evidence that distinct internal thought types can be modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), although little is known about optimal stimulation parameters or the mechanisms behind such effects. In addition, recent findings suggest changes in dopamine availability may alter the effect tDCS has on neural and behavioural outcomes. Dopaminergic functioning has also been implicated in executive processes anticorrelated with mind wandering such as attention and working memory, however the neurochemical mechanisms involved in internal thoughts are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of dopamine, and tDCS, on internal thought processes. Specifically, using an attentional control task, we tested whether dopamine availability (levodopa or placebo) mediated the effects of online high definition tDCS (HD-tDCS; 2mA, or sham). There was no evidence for our hypothesised effect of left prefrontal cortex HD-tDCS reducing task unrelated thought, nor freely moving thought. This failure to replicate previous HD-tDCS findings emphasises the importance of employing robust methodological practices within this field to improve confidence in the findings. However, we did find that levodopa reduced freely moving thought, relative to placebo. We also found preliminary evidence that dopamine availability may moderate the relationship between stimulation and behavioural variability performance during periods of task unrelated thought. Overall, these findings suggest that stimulation does not affect dynamic internal thought, however there is initial evidence for the potential effectiveness of targeting the dopaminergic system to reduce spontaneous internal thoughts and improve behavioural performance.

">Computational modelling shows evidence in support of both sensory and frontal theories of consciousness</a></h4>

              
                The role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in consciousness is hotly debated. Frontal theories argue that the PFC is necessary for consciousness, while sensory theories propose that consciousness arises from recurrent activity in the posterior cortex alone, with activity in the PFC resulting from the mere act of reporting. To resolve this dispute, we re-analysed an EEG dataset of 30 participants from a no-report inattentional blindness paradigm where faces are (un)consciously perceived. Dynamic causal modelling was used to estimate the effective connectivity between the key contended brain regions, the prefrontal and the posterior cortices. Then, a second-level parametric empirical Bayesian model was conducted to determine how connectivity was modulated by awareness and task-relevance. While an initial data-driven search could not corroborate neither sensory nor frontal theories of consciousness, a more directed hypothesis-driven analysis revealed strong evidence that both theories could explain the data, with a very slight preference for frontal theories. Specifically, a model with backward connections switched off within the posterior cortex explained awareness better (53%) than a model without backward connections from the PFC to sensory regions. Our findings provide some support for a subtle, yet crucial, contribution of the frontal cortex in consciousness, and highlight the need to revise current theories of consciousness.

">Mild focal cooling selectively impacts computations in dendritic trees</a></h4>

              
                Focal cooling is a powerful technique to temporally scale neural dynamics. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms causing this scaling remain unresolved. Here, using targeted focal cooling (with a spatial resolution of 100 micrometers), dual somato-dendritic patch clamp recordings, two-photon calcium imaging, transmitter uncaging, and modeling we reveal that a 5 deg C drop can enhance synaptic transmission, plasticity, and input-output transformations in the distal apical tuft, but not in the basal dendrites of intrinsically bursting L5 pyramidal neurons. This enhancement depends on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and Kv4.2, suggesting electrical structure modulation. Paradoxically, and despite the increase in tuft excitability, we observe a reduced rate of recovery from inactivation for apical Na+ channels, thereby regulating back-propagating action potential invasion, coincidence detection, and overall burst probability, resulting in an apparent slowing of somatic spike output. Our findings reveal a differential temperature sensitivity along the basal-tuft axis of L5 neurons analog modulates cortical output.

">The role of REM sleep in neural differentiation of memories in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cues that generated the prediction from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim et al. (2017) found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In the morning, participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/DG ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. Differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, the results presented here provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.

                Nervous systems learn representations of the world and policies to act within it. We present a framework that uses reward-dependent noise to facilitate policy optimization in representation learning networks. These networks balance extracting normative features and task-relevant information to solve tasks. Moreover, their representation changes reproduce several experimentally observed shifts in the neural code during task learning. Our framework presents a biologically plausible mechanism for emergent policy optimization amid evidence that representation learning plays a vital role in governing neural dynamics.

                Sleep disruption drastically impacts cognitive functions including decision-making and attention across many different species. In this study, we leveraged the small size and conserved vertebrate brain structure of larval zebrafish to investigate how sleep disruption modulates visual- and olfactory-decision-making. Strikingly, sleep disruption improved performance in both paradigms. Specifically, sleep disruption lengthens reaction times and increases correct decisions in a visual motion discrimination task, an effect that we attribute to longer integration periods in disrupted animals. Using a drift diffusion model, we predict specific circuit changes underlying these effects. Additionally, we demonstrate that sleep disruption heightens odor sensitivity in an olfactory decision-making task, likely mediated by cortisol. Our findings lay essential groundwork for investigating the brain circuit changes that arise from sleep disruption across species.

                While cannabis use during pregnancy is often perceived as harmless, little is known about its consequences on offspring neurodevelopment. There is an urgent need to map the effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on the brain through the course of the lifespan. We used magnetic resonance imaging spanning nine timepoints, behavioral assays, and electron microscopy to build a trajectory from gestation to adulthood in mice exposed prenatally to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Our results demonstrate a spatio-temporal patterning, with ventriculomegaly in THC-exposed embryos followed by a deceleration of brain growth in neonates that is sustained until adulthood, especially in females. We observed consistently impacted regions in both the cortex and subcortex, aligned with sex-dependent changes to social behavior in neonates and increased anxiety-like behavior in adolescents. Our results suggest prenatal THC exposure has a sustained sex-dependent impact on neurodevelopment that may persist into early adulthood.

                CX3CR1-Cre mouse lines have produced important advancements in our understanding of microglial biology. Recent studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of tamoxifen-induced CX3CR1-Cre expression during development, which include changes in microglial density, phenotype, and DNA damage, as well as anxiety-like behavior. However, the unintended effects of constitutive CX3CR1-BAC-Cre expression remain unexplored. Here, we characterized the effects of CX3CR1-BAC-Cre expression on microglia in CX3CR1-BAC-Cre+/- and CX3CR1-BAC-Cre-/- male and female littermates during early postnatal development and adulthood in multiple brain regions. Additionally, we performed anxiety-like behavior tests to assess changes caused by Cre expression. We found that CX3CR1-BAC-Cre expression causes subtle region-and sex-specific changes in microglial density, volume, and morphology during development, but these changes normalized by adulthood in all brain regions except the hippocampus. No behavioral effects were found. Our findings suggest that the constitutive-Cre model might be less detrimental than the inducible model, and highlight the need for proper controls.

">Investigate c-Fos changes in genetically identified amygdala neurons after mild footshock stress</a></h4>

              
                The amygdala is a key brain region that processes stress-related inputs to reshape future behaviors. The lateral amygdala (LA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and central amygdala (CeA) are important subregions that mediate different aspects of stress experiences from receiving sensory input to memory formation and behavioral responding. The principal neurons in these regions are glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, which are genetically separable into two subpopulations, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B-positive (Ppp1r1b, also known as DARPP-32) parvocellular neurons and R-spondin2-positive (Rspo2) magnocellular neurons. Recent studies show that these two subpopulations of amygdala neurons differentially regulate appetitive versus aversive behaviors. The research goal of this study is to explore whether amygdala Ppp1r1b and Rspo2 neurons are transcriptionally activated by moderate stress experience, such that persistent cellular changes are made to influence future functional output of these two subtypes of neurons. To test transcriptional activation, we focused on c-Fos, one of the early genes that are transiently expressed in response to cellular stimulations to regulate downstream gene transcription. Moderate stress was introduced through brief footshocks, with mice without footshock as controls. Between shocked and control mice, we observed similar numbers of Ppp1r1b or Rspo2 neurons per unit area that expressed c-Fos, which was consistent across LA-BLA and CeA. Moreover, in LA-BLA, Ppp1r1b/c-Fos cells consistently outnumber Rspo2/c-Fos cells across treatment conditions, and the reverse is true in CeA. These results suggest that moderate stress experience is not sufficient to induce robust transcriptional alterations in the two key subpopulations of amygdala neurons, and Ppp1r1b versus Rspo2 neuron activities, as measured by c-Fos expression levels, show differential dominance in amygdala subregions.

">Dampened α7 nAChR activity contributes to audiogenic seizures and hyperactivity in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and often accompanied with debilitating pathologies including seizures and hyperactivity. FXS arises from a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene that silences expression of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Despite progress in understanding FMRP functions, the identification of effective therapeutic targets has lagged and at present there are no viable treatment options. Here we identify the 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) as candidate target for intervention in FXS. In the early postnatal hippocampus of Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, an established pre-clinical model of FXS, the 7 nAChR accessory protein Ly6H is abnormally enriched at the neuronal surface and mislocalized in dendrites. Ly6H, a GPI-anchored protein, binds 7 nAChRs with high affinity and can limit 7 nAChR surface expression and signaling. We find that 7 nAChR-evoked Ca2+ responses are dampened in immature Glutamatergic and GABAergic Fmr1KO neurons compared to wild type. Knockdown of endogenous Ly6H in Fmr1KO neurons is sufficient to rescue dampened 7 nAChR Ca2+ responses in vitro, providing evidence of a cell-autonomous role for Ly6H aberrant expression in 7 nAChR hypofunction. In line with intrinsic deficits in 7 nAChR activity in Fmr1KO neurons, in vivo administration of the 7 nAChR-selective positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 reduced hyperactivity and seizure severity in adolescent Fmr1KO mice. Our mechanistic studies together with evidence of the in vivo efficacy of 7 nAChR augmentation implicate 7 nAChR hypofunction in FXS pathology.

">Two ways to learn in visuomotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Previous research has demonstrated significant inter-individual variability in the recruitment of the fast-explicit and slow-implicit processes during motor adaptation. In addition, we previously identified qualitative individual differences in adaptation linked to the formation and updating of new memory processes. Here, we investigated quantitative and qualitative differences in visuomotor adaptation with a design incorporating repeated learning and forgetting blocks, allowing for precise estimation of individual learning and forgetting rates in fast-slow adaptation models. Participants engaged in a two-day online visuomotor adaptation task. They first adapted to a 30-degree perturbation to eight targets in three blocks separated by short blocks of no feedback trials. Approximately 24 hours later, they performed a no-feedback retention block and a relearning block. We clustered the participants into strong and weak learners based on adaptation levels at the end of day one and fitted a fast-slow system to the adaptation data. Strong learners exhibited a negative correlation between the estimated slow and fast processes, which predicted 24-hour retention and savings, respectively, supporting the engagement of a fast-slow system. The pronounced individual differences in the recruitment of the two processes were attributed to wide ranges of estimated learning rates. Conversely, weak learners exhibited a positive correlation between the two estimated processes, as well as retention but no savings, supporting the engagement of a single slow system. Finally, both during baseline and adaptation, reaction times were shorter for weak learners. Our findings thus revealed two distinct ways to learn in visuomotor adaptation and highlight the necessity of considering both quantitative and qualitative individual differences in studies of motor learning.

">Planning and movement activities co-adapt in a motor-reference frame during 3D BCI-controlled reach adaptation in monkey frontal and parietal cortices</a></h4>

              
                Perturbing visual feedback is a powerful tool for studying visuomotor adaptation. However, unperturbed proprioceptive signals in common paradigms inherently co-varies with physical movements and causes incongruency with the visual input. This can create challenges when interpreting underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. We employed a brain-computer interface (BCI) in rhesus monkeys to investigate spatial encoding in frontal and parietal areas during a 3D visuomotor rotation task where only visual feedback was movement-contingent. We found that both brain regions better reflected the adapted motor commands than the perturbed visual feedback during movement preparation and execution. This adaptive response was observed in both local and remote neurons, even when they did not directly contribute to the BCI input signals. The transfer of adaptive changes in planning activity to corresponding movement corrections was stronger in the frontal than in the parietal cortex. Our results suggest an integrated large-scale visuomotor adaptation mechanism in a motor-reference frame spanning across frontoparietal cortices.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively studied asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> mutation carriers, identifying those developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 56 asymptomatic family members (AFM) with a <i>C9orf72</i> mutation (AFM C9+), 132 non-carriers (AFM C9−), and 359 population-based controls. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we measured cortical thickness, gyrification, and subcortical volumes longitudinally. Linear mixed-effects models on non-converting AFM C9+ scans (n = 107) created a reference for these measurements, establishing individual atrophy patterns. Atrophy patterns from presymptomatic phenoconverters (n = 10 scans) served as a template for group comparisons and similarity assessments. Similarity with phenoconverters was quantified using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for cortical and Kullback–Leibler similarity (KLS) for subcortical measures. Using longitudinal similarity assessments, we predicted when participants would reach the average similarity level of phenoconverters at their first post-onset scan.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five AFM C9+ converted to ALS or ALS-FTD. Up to 6 years before symptoms, these phenoconverters exhibited significant atrophy in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortex, along with smaller thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala compared to other AFM C9+. Some non-converted AFM C9+ had high DSC and KLS, approaching values of phenoconverters, whereas others, along with AFM C9− and controls, had lower values. At age 80, we predicted 27.9% (95% confidence interval, 13.2–40.1%) of AFM C9+ and no AFM C9− would reach the same DSC as phenoconverters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Distinctive atrophy patterns are visible years before symptom onset on presymptomatic scans of phenoconverters. Combining baseline and follow-up similarity measures may serve as a promising imaging biomarker for identifying those at risk of ALS or ALS-FTD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Extensive research has been focused in the past century on structural, physiological, and molecular attributes of the hippocampus. This interest was created by the unique involvement of the hippocampus in cognitive and affective functions of the brain. Functional analysis revealed that the hippocampus has divergent properties along its axial dimension to the extent that the dorsal sector (dorsal hippocampus, DH) has different connections with the rest of the brain than those of the ventral sector (VH). Still, longitudinal pathways connect the DH with the VH and dampen the functional differences between the sectors. To be able to identify the intrinsic functional difference between the DH and VH, we produced dissociated monolayer cultures from prenatal DH and VH and examined their properties at 10–20 days after plating by imaging the spontaneous activity of the network using Fluo-2 AM, a calcium indicator. Surprisingly, while DH and VH sectors produced dissociated cultures with similar morphological attributes, VH cultures were more active spontaneously than DH cultures. Furthermore, when stimulated to produce action potentials, VH neurons triggered network bursts in postsynaptic neurons more often than DH cultures. Finally, in both DH and VH cultures, electrical stimulation of single cells produced network bursts in response to a burst of action potentials rather than to single spikes. These experiments indicate that even in dissociated cultures, neurons of the VH are more excitable and sensitive to electrical stimulation than DH; hence, they are more likely to generate network bursts and epileptic seizures, as suggested for in vivo brains.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-894/v2?src=rss">Identification of heart rate dynamics during treadmill and cycle ergometer exercise: the role of model zeros and dead time [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The response of heart rate to changes in exercise intensity is comprised of several dynamic modes with differing magnitudes and temporal characteristics. Investigations of empirical identification of dynamic models of heart rate showed that second-order models gave substantially and significantly better model fidelity compared to the first order case. In the present work, we aimed to reanalyse data from previous studies to more closely consider the effect of including a zero and a pure delay in the model. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 22 treadmill (TM) and 54 cycle ergometer (CE) data sets from a total of 38 healthy participants. A linear, time-invariant plant model structure with up to two poles, a zero and a dead time is considered. Empirical estimation of the free parameters was performed using least-squares optimisation. The primary outcome measure is model fit, which is a normalised root-mean-square model error. Results A model comprising parallel connection of two first-order transfer functions, one with a dead time and one without, was found to give the highest fit (56.7 % for TM, 54.3 % for CE), whereby the non-delayed component appeared to merely capture initial transients in the data and the part with dead time likely represented the true dynamic response of heart rate to the excitation. In comparison, a simple first-order model without dead time gave substantially lower fit than the parallel model (50.2 % for TM, 47.9 % for CE). Conclusions This preliminary analysis points to a linear first-order system with dead time as being an appropriate model for heart rate response to exercise using treadmill and cycle ergometer modalities. In order to avoid biased estimates, it is vitally important that, prior to parameter estimation and validation, careful attention is paid to data preprocessing in order to eliminate transients and trends.

                Background We analysed the prevalence of depression under among pregnant women both in the immigrant and native populations in a Health Region of Spain, and evaluated the maternal factors associated with it. Methods We performed a retrospective observational cohort study in pregnant women in the Health Region of Lleida between 2012 and 2018. We analysed the following variables: age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, country of origin, and antidepressant drug prescribed. We performed a multivariate analysis and obtained the linear regression coefficients and their 95% confidence interval (CI). Results In a sample of 17177 pregnant women, 2.5% had a diagnosis of depression. The patients with depression had an average age of 32 years (SD 5.56) compared to the rest of the women who had an average age of 30 (SD 5.85) years of age. Obesity was present in 17.7% of patients with depression compared to 14.3% in the rest. A high percentage of women from Western Europe presented depression (2.9%); followed by women from Latin America (2.6%) and Eastern Europe (2.3%). The values for Africa, (0.8%) and Asia and the Middle East (0.5%) were significantly lower. We did not observe any relationship between depression and hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Conclusions In our study, we found a prevalence of depression similar to the one found in other publications. As main risk factors, we identified age, weight, and geographical origin.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1312/v1?src=rss">The emergence of green finance a conceptual framework for environmental sustainability: innovation viewpoint [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background of the study This study intends to contribute to the continuing discussion about green economic growth by objectively investigating the consequences of clean energy generation, cutting-edge green practices, and ethical business on global sustainability. This study also examines how green finance laws effectively handle the financial limitations that companies face when pursuing green innovation. Green finance enables the development and implementation of sustainable business models, investments, trade, economic, environmental, and social projects through the effective utilization of financial resources. Methods This article offers a complete evaluation of the current state and advancements in green finance research using a mixed-methods approach, which includes bibliometric and qualitative analysis. We analysed a big dataset of research papers after entering the keywords into the Scopus database. Results This study found that green bank products include green securities, investments, climate financing, carbon finance, insurance, credit, and infrastructure bonds. Sustainability, sustainable development, investments, environmental economics, sustainable finance, green bonds, and the green economy dominate as a most prevalent theme. China has the strongest bibliometric linkages to other nations, followed by the US and UK. This study also examines whether green finance policies address firm financial restrictions while pursuing green innovation. VOS-viewer generates co-authorship-based keyword occurrence links and network maps. Conclusion Green finance strives to increase funding flows to sustainable development goals while mitigating environmental and social hazards. “Going green,” pricing, forecasting, modelling, picking the most efficient tool, and influencing investor behaviour toward environmentally friendly operations are all challenges. Environmental policies, interest rates, religion, risks, social inclusion, and banking laws all have an impact on bank green financing initiatives. The study’s main contribution is an overview of green finance breakthroughs for sustainability, which may help scholars and practitioners understand the trend and future research directions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1311/v1?src=rss">Global trends in research of Work-related musculoskeletal disorders among surgeons: Bibliometric analysis and visualization from 1991 to 2024 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Surgeons are highly exposed to Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). Assessing the prevalence of these disorders, both overall and by body area, has become a focus of interest, and numerous articles have been published on the subject. Methods Journal articles and reviews focused on WMSDs published until today and referenced in PubMed/Medline, ScienceDirect, Science.gov, Mendeley and Google Scholar were analysed. VOSviewer version 1.6.20 and Microsoft Excel were used to perform a bibliometric and visualization analyses. Overall distribution of publications by year, sources with country and related indicators, research areas, authors with their affiliations, references and keywords were studied. Results Of the total 2338 items identified, 184 articles (174 articles and 10 reviews) published between 1991 and 2024 were included. Results showed an increase in the number of publications over the years, with a significant increase from 2016 onwards (R2 = 0.8693). The United States is the leader in the field, with 89 publications (37.6%) and 2,631 citations. Hallbeck MS (USA) is the most prolific author (11 publications and 601 citations). World Neurosurgery and Work were the journals with the highest number of publications (n=7). Applied ergonomics has the highest number of citations. Medicine is the research area most present. Epstein’s work has the most citations worldwide, while Park et al’s work is the most cited of the 184 studies considered. “Ergonomics”, “musculoskeletal disorders”, “surgeons”, and “work-related musculoskeletal disorders” are the keywords most used by authors. Their use increased significantly since 2016, with an average year of publication around 2020. Conclusions The study of WMSDs in surgeons is a young research topic that is evolving significantly. North America, Europe and Asia have been the main contributors, with the USA in the lead. Subjective prevalence analysis based on questionnaires and ergonomic assessment using quantitative tools are the two main lines of research.

                Cortical activity is constantly fluctuating between distinct spatiotemporal activity patterns denoted by changes in brain state. States of cortical desynchronization arise during motor generation, increased attention, and high cognitive load. Synchronized brain states comprise spatially widespread, coordinated low-frequency neural activity during rest and sleep when disengaged from the external environment or ‘offline’. The claustrum is a small subcortical structure with dense reciprocal connections with the cortex suggesting modulation by, or participation in, brain state regulation. Here, we highlight recent work suggesting that neural activity in the claustrum supports cognitive processes associated with synchronized brain states characterized by increased low-frequency network activity. As an example, we outline how claustrum activity could support episodic memory consolidation during sleep.

                piRNAs protect germline genomes by repressing transposons. Daedalus and Gasz bind to each other and form a mitochondrial scaffold for Armitage, a factor required for endonuclease Zucchini-dependent piRNA maturation. Their roles are distinct: Daedalus interacts with Armitage, while Gasz supports Daedalus. Daedalus binds to Armitage through an extended coiled-coil domain, which tethers it to mitochondria, and a SAM domain, which controls piRNA length. Without the Daedalus SAM domain, piRNAs cannot fully silence transposons. Daedalus is Dipteran specific, unlike other species, where exonucleases regulate piRNA length.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94811">Human DCP1 is crucial for mRNA decapping and possesses paralog-specific gene regulating functions</a></h4>

              
                The mRNA 5'-cap structure removal by the decapping enzyme DCP2 is a critical step in gene regulation. While DCP2 is the catalytic subunit in the decapping complex, its activity is strongly enhanced by multiple factors, particularly DCP1, which is the major activator in yeast. However, the precise role of DCP1 in metazoans has yet to be fully elucidated. Moreover, in humans, the specific biological functions of the two DCP1 paralogs, DCP1a and DCP1b, remain largely unknown. To investigate the role of human DCP1, we generated cell lines that were deficient in DCP1a, DCP1b, or both to evaluate the importance of DCP1 in the decapping machinery. Our results highlight the importance of human DCP1 in decapping process and show that the EVH1 domain of DCP1 enhances the mRNA-binding affinity of DCP2. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses outline the distinct functions of DCP1a and DCP1b in human cells, regulating specific endogenous mRNA targets and biological processes. Overall, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of human DCP1 in mRNA decapping and shed light on the distinct functions of its paralogs.

                Interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons are critical to computations in cortical circuits but their organization is difficult to assess with standard electrophysiological approaches. Within the medial entorhinal cortex, representation of location by grid and other spatial cells involves circuits in layer 2 in which excitatory stellate cells interact with each other via inhibitory parvalbumin expressing interneurons. Whether this connectivity is structured to support local circuit computations is unclear. Here, we introduce strategies to address the functional organization of excitatory-inhibitory interactions using crossed Cre- and Flp-driver mouse lines to direct targeted presynaptic optogenetic activation and postsynaptic cell identification. We then use simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from postsynaptic neurons to assess their shared input from optically activated presynaptic populations. We find that extensive axonal projections support spatially organized connectivity between stellate cells and parvalbumin interneurons, such that direct connections are often, but not always, shared by nearby neurons, whereas multisynaptic interactions coordinate inputs to neurons with greater spatial separation. We suggest that direct excitatory-inhibitory synaptic interactions may operate at the scale of grid cell clusters, with local modules defined by excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, while indirect interactions may coordinate activity at the scale of grid cell modules.

                Addiction is commonly characterized by escalation of drug intake, compulsive drug seeking, and continued use despite harmful consequences. However, the factors contributing to the transition from moderate drug use to these problematic patterns remain unclear, particularly regarding the role of sex. Many preclinical studies have been limited by small sample sizes, low genetic diversity, and restricted drug access, making it challenging to model significant levels of intoxication or dependence and translate findings to humans. To address these limitations, we characterized addiction-like behaviors in a large sample of &gt;500 outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats using an extended cocaine self-administration paradigm (6 hr/daily). We analyzed individual differences in escalation of intake, progressive ratio (PR) responding, continued use despite adverse consequences (contingent foot shocks), and irritability-like behavior during withdrawal. Principal component analysis showed that escalation of intake, progressive ratio responding, and continued use despite adverse consequences loaded onto a single factor that was distinct from irritability-like behaviors. Categorizing rats into resilient, mild, moderate, and severe addiction-like phenotypes showed that females exhibited higher addiction-like behaviors, with a lower proportion of resilient individuals compared to males. These findings suggest that, in genetically diverse rats with extended drug access, escalation of intake, continued use despite adverse consequences, and PR responding are highly correlated measures of a shared underlying construct. Furthermore, our results highlight sex differences in resilience to addiction-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89572">Calcineurin inhibition enhances Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan by defecation defects-mediated calorie restriction and nuclear hormone signaling</a></h4>

              
                Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase with diverse functions. Inhibition of calcineurin is known to enhance the lifespan of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> through multiple signaling pathways. Aiming to study the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity, we discover that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in <i>C. elegans</i>. Calcineurin inhibition leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We demonstrate that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Finally, we show that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan. Our studies uncover a role for calcineurin in the <i>C. elegans</i> DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99643">Conservation of the cooling agent binding pocket within the TRPM subfamily</a></h4>

              
                Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a large and diverse family of tetrameric cation-selective channels that are activated by many different types of stimuli, including noxious heat or cold, organic ligands such as vanilloids or cooling agents, or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Structures available for all subtypes of TRP channels reveal that the transmembrane domains are closely related despite their unique sensitivity to activating stimuli. Here, we use computational and electrophysiological approaches to explore the conservation of the cooling agent binding pocket identified within the S1–S4 domain of the Melastatin subfamily member TRPM8, the mammalian sensor of noxious cold, with other TRPM channel subtypes. We find that a subset of TRPM channels, including TRPM2, TRPM4, and TRPM5, contain pockets very similar to the cooling agent binding pocket in TRPM8. We then show how the cooling agent icilin modulates activation of mouse TRPM4 to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, enhancing the sensitivity of the channel to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and diminishing outward-rectification to promote opening at negative voltages. Mutations known to promote or diminish activation of TRPM8 by cooling agents similarly alter activation of TRPM4 by icilin, suggesting that icilin binds to the cooling agent binding pocket to promote opening of the channel. These findings demonstrate that TRPM4 and TRPM8 channels share related ligand binding pockets that are allosterically coupled to opening of the pore.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103035">Distinct functions of three Wnt proteins control mirror-symmetric organogenesis in the C. elegans gonad</a></h4>

              
                Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs; Z1 and Z4). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins (CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1(RNAi) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88322">Evidence for a role of human blood-borne factors in mediating age-associated changes in molecular circadian rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with a number of physiologic changes including perturbed circadian rhythms; however, mechanisms by which rhythms are altered remain unknown. To test the idea that circulating factors mediate age-dependent changes in peripheral rhythms, we compared the ability of human serum from young and old individuals to synchronize circadian rhythms in culture. We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25–30) and old (age 70–76) individuals at 14:00 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts. We found that young and old sera are equally competent at initiating robust ~24 hr oscillations of a luciferase reporter driven by clock gene promoter. However, cyclic gene expression is affected, such that young and old sera promote cycling of different sets of genes. Genes that lose rhythmicity with old serum entrainment are associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer’s Disease as identified by STRING and IPA analyses. Conversely, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increased in the cells entrained with old serum. Genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions. We did not observe a global difference in the distribution of phase between groups, but found that peak expression of several clock-controlled genes (<i>PER3, NR1D1, NR1D2, CRY1, CRY2,</i> and <i>TEF</i>) lagged in the cells synchronized ex vivo with old serum. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that age-dependent blood-borne factors affect circadian rhythms in peripheral cells and have the potential to impact health and disease via maintaining or disrupting rhythms respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92914">A scenario for an evolutionary selection of ageing</a></h4>

              
                Signs of ageing become apparent only late in life, after organismal development is finalized. Ageing, most notably, decreases an individual’s fitness. As such, it is most commonly perceived as a non-adaptive force of evolution and considered a by-product of natural selection. Building upon the evolutionarily conserved age-related Smurf phenotype, we propose a simple mathematical life-history trait model in which an organism is characterized by two core abilities: reproduction and homeostasis. Through the simulation of this model, we observe (1) the convergence of fertility’s end with the onset of senescence, (2) the relative success of ageing populations, as compared to non-ageing populations, and (3) the enhanced evolvability (i.e. the generation of genetic variability) of ageing populations. In addition, we formally demonstrate the mathematical convergence observed in (1). We thus theorize that mechanisms that link the timing of fertility and ageing have been selected and fixed over evolutionary history, which, in turn, explains why ageing populations are more evolvable and therefore more successful. Broadly speaking, our work suggests that ageing is an adaptive force of evolution.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98096">FGF8-mediated gene regulation affects regional identity in human cerebral organoids</a></h4>

              
                The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responses <i>via</i> modulation of early target genes. The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development. We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as an <i>in vitro </i>platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic domains, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Moreover, FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development.

                Intractable epilepsy and cognitive deficits arise from missense variants in GRIN genes encoding subunits of the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Here, we go beyond typical assessments of isolated receptors to explore the impact of a human GluN1 variant across multiple scales of native NMDAR signaling. We show that isolated and integrated NMDAR signaling are differentially affected in brain slices of transgenic mice with the heterozygous GluN1 Y647S patient variant. Loss-of-function NMDARs paradoxically prolong NMDAR-dependent dendritic integration, extending cortical network activity and increasing vulnerability for seizure-like events. We identify that loss-of-function NMDARs fail to engage canonical negative feedback via calcium-activated potassium channels that prevent NMDAR overdrive. Therefore, we test an unorthodox treatment to increase NMDAR Mg2+ block and show that oral treatment with magnesium-L-threonate significantly reduces seizure occurrence and severity in the mice. We reveal a case where higher-order functional context predicts effective treatment for seizures arising from NMDAR disruption.

">Neural synchrony is "good enough" for speech comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Recent evidence indicates that neural populations exhibit synchronous firing at phrase boundaries to facilitate the encoding of syntactic units during speech comprehension. However, good-enough processing accounts of speech comprehension suggest that detailed syntactic analysis may not always be necessary for successful interpretation, especially when listeners can deduce meaning from lexical-semantic contexts. In this brief report, we evaluate this notion and assess whether neural synchrony to syntactic boundaries is modulated by local lexical-semantic content. To this end, we reanalyzed an open-source EEG dataset, consisting of brain recordings obtained while participants passively listened to an audiobook. To determine neural synchrony to phrase boundaries, we computed mutual information (MI) between delta band EEG activity (< 3Hz) and hierarchically derived syntactic structures for each sentence in the audiobook. We then quantified local-lexical semantic contexts using semantic dissimilarity values that were derived from high-dimensional vectors of co-occurrence. We then regressed MI values for each sentence against the sentence's semantic dissimilarity values, using linear mixed-effects models. Results indicated that neural synchrony to phrase boundaries showed a positive linear relationship with semantic dissimilarity. We interpret this finding as evidence that listeners' reliance on syntactic information during speech comprehension is modulated by local lexical-semantic contexts, consistent with good-enough processing accounts.

                Spinal cord injury (SCI) can result in permanent loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions, with limited therapeutic options to recover the loss. Low-frequency electric fields with changing polarity have shown promise in promoting axon regeneration and improving outcomes. However, the metal electrodes used previously were prone to corrosion, and their epidural placement limited the penetration of the electric field into the spinal cord. Here, we demonstrate that a thin-film implant with supercapacitive electrodes placed under the dura mater can safely and effectively deliver electric field treatment in rats with thoracic SCI. Subdural stimulation enhanced hind limb function and touch sensitivity compared to controls, without inducing a neuroinflammatory response in the spinal cord. While axon density around the lesion site remained unchanged after 12 weeks, in vivo monitoring and electrochemical testing of electrodes indicated that treatment was administered throughout the study. These results highlight the promise of electric field treatment as a viable therapeutic strategy for achieving long-term functional recovery in SCI.

                Transcription factor 4 (TCF4) is a transcription factor that is critical for the normal development and function of the central nervous system. Haploinsufficiency of TCF4 causes Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS), a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by seizures and intellectual disability. To expand our currently limited understanding of TCF4 function and PTHS pathophysiology, we created a mouse model of PTHS with largely astrocyte-specific heterozygous knockout of Tcf4. These mice developed severe recurrent seizures and had decreased lifespans. In addition, we found that these mice had astrogliosis as well as increased neuronal activity in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Furthermore, single nucleus RNA sequencing analysis revealed global changes in the gene expression profiles of excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes of PTHS compared to wild-type mice. Overall, this is the first report of a PTHS mouse model with seizures, providing the field with a tool to investigate the mechanisms of PTHS development and progression and develop therapeutics for PTHS and its associated epilepsy.

                Functional and structural elements of synaptic plasticity are tightly coupled, as has been extensively shown for dendritic spines. Here, we interrogated structural features of presynaptic terminals in 3DEM reconstructions from CA1 hippocampal axons that had undergone control stimulation or theta-burst stimulation (TBS) to produce long-term potentiation (LTP). We reveal that after LTP induction, the synaptic vesicle (SV) cluster is less dense, and SVs are more dispersed. The distances between neighboring SVs are greater in less dense terminals and have more SV-associated volume. We characterized the changes to the SV cluster by measuring distances between neighboring SVs, distances to the active zone, and the dispersion of the SV cluster. Furthermore, we compared the distribution of SVs with randomized ones and provided evidence that SVs gained mobility after LTP induction. With a computational model, we can predict the increment of the diffusion coefficient of the SVs in the cluster. Moreover, using a machine learning approach, we identify presynaptic terminals that were potentiated after LTP induction. Lastly, we show that the local SV density is a volume-independent property under strong regulation. Altogether, these results provide evidence that the SV cluster is undergoing a transition during LTP.

">Lateralized nodose ganglia gene expression implicates cholecystokinin receptors in interoceptive reward signaling</a></h4>

              
                The vagus nerves are important carriers of sensory information from the viscera to the central nervous system. Emerging evidence suggests that sensory signaling through the right, but not the left, vagus nerve evokes striatal dopamine release and reinforces appetitive behaviors. However, the extent to which differential gene expression within vagal sensory neurons contributes to this asymmetric reward-related signaling remains unknown. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the left and right nodose ganglia (NG) to identify candidate genes likely to contribute to vagus-mediated reward signaling. We find that a group of neurons expressing Chrna3 (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit 3) and Cckar (cholecystokinin A receptor) is preferentially expressed in the right NG of both rats and mice. This result suggests that differential expression of gut-innervating nutrient sensors in NG neurons may contribute to asymmetric encoding of interoceptive rewards by the vagus nerves.

">Bias-accounting meta-analyses overcome cerebellar neglect to refine the cerebellar behavioral topography</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum plays important roles in motor, cognitive, and emotional behaviors. Previous cerebellar coordinate-based meta-analyses and mappings have attributed different behaviors to cerebellar subareas, but an accurate behavioral topography is lacking. Here, we show overrepresentation of superior activation foci, which may be exacerbated by historical cerebellar neglect. Unequal foci distributions render the null hypothesis of standard activation likelihood estimation unsuitable. Our new method, cerebellum-specific activation-likelihood estimation (C-SALE), finds behavioral convergence beyond baseline activation rates. It does this by testing experimental foci versus null models sampled from a data-driven, biased probability distribution of finding foci at any cerebellar location. Cerebellar mappings were made across five BrainMap task domains and thirty-five subdomains, illustrating improved specificity of the new method. Twelve of forty (sub)domains reached convergence in specific cerebellar subregions, supporting dual motor representations and placing cognition in posterior-lateral regions. Repeated subsampling revealed that whereas action, language and working memory were relatively stable, other behaviors produced unstable meta-analytic maps. Lastly, meta-analytic connectivity modeling in the same debiased framework was used to reveal coactivation networks of cerebellar behavioral clusters. In sum, we created a new method for cerebellar meta-analysis that accounts for data biases and can be flexibly adapted to any part of the brain. Our findings provide a refined understanding of cerebellar involvement in human behaviors, highlighting regions for future investigation in both basic and clinical applications.

">Electroconvulsive therapy generates a hidden wave after seizure</a></h4>

              
                Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a fast-acting, highly effective, and safe treatment for medication-resistant depression. Historically, the clinical benefits of ECT have been attributed to generating a controlled seizure; however, the underlying neurobiology is understudied and remains largely unresolved. Using optical neuroimaging to probe neural activity and hemodynamics in a mouse model of ECT, we demonstrated that a second brain event follows seizure: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD). We further found that ECT stimulation pulse parameters and electrode configuration directly shaped the wave dynamics of seizure and subsequent CSD. To translate these findings to human patients, we tested for the presence of hemodynamic signatures of post-ictal CSD using non-invasive diffuse optical monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during routine ECT treatments. We found evidence that humans generate hyperemic waves after ECT seizure which are highly consistent with CSD. These results challenge a long-held assumption that seizure is the primary outcome of ECT and point to new opportunities for optimizing ECT stimulation parameters to precisely modulate brain activity and treatment outcomes.

">Speech in noise performance in adults with cochlear implants using a combined channel deactivation strategy with a variable number of dynamic focused channels</a></h4>

              
                Objectives and Methods: Cochlear implant listeners show difficulties in understanding speech in noise. Channel interactions from activating overlapping neural populations reduce the signal accuracy necessary to interpret complex signals. Optimizing programming strategies based on focused detection thresholds to reduce channel interactions has led to improved performance. In the current study, two previously suggested methods, channel deactivation and focused dynamic tripolar stimulation, were combined to create three cochlear implant programs. Utilizing an automatic channel selection algorithm from focused detection threshold profiles, three programs were created with the same deactivated channels but varying proportions of channels employing focused stimulation, monopolar, dynamic focused and a mixed program. Thirteen ears in eleven adult cochlear implant listeners with Advanced Bionics HiRes90k devices were tested. Vowel identification and sentence perception in quiet and noise served as outcome measures, and the influences of listening experience, age, clinical consonant-nucleus-consonant performance, and perceptual thresholds on speech performance were assessed. Results: Across subjects, different degrees of focusing showed individual performance improvements for vowels and sentences over the monopolar program. However, only slight trends and no significant group improvements were observed. Focused listening benefits were shown for individuals with less cochlear implant experience, and clinically poor performers seem to benefit more from focusing than good performers. Conclusion: The current findings suggest that deactivating and focusing subsets of channels improves speech performance for some individuals, especially poor performers, a possible effect of reduced channel interactions. The findings also show that individual performance is largely variable, possibly due to listening experience, age, or the underlying detection threshold.

">The most significant differences between male and female rats regarding psychostimulant self-administration behavior are unrelated to biological sex</a></h4>

              
                Background: The goals of this study were to 1) validate the MISSING (Mapping Intrinsic Sex Similarities as an Integral quality of Normalized Groups) model for psychostimulant self-administration (SA), and 2) utilize it to explain the inconsistencies in the observation of sex differences in psychostimulant SA. Methods: We allowed male and female Long Evans rats (n = 40) to self-administer methamphetamine METH dose 0.1 mg/kg (male n = 9, female n = 18) and saline (male n = 3, female n = 10) via the intravenous route, FR1 schedule, 6 h per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks. For the MISSING model, we identified behavioral clusters of males and females using normal mixtures clustering analysis of baseline intake, total intake and total intake normalized-to-baseline intake (NBI), followed by unpaired t-tests to compare clusters and Two-way ANOVA to determine if there were any SEX by cluster interactions. For the current model, we grouped our subjects according to biological sex and compared the above variables using unpaired t-tests. For both models, we employed Two-way repeated measures ANOVA and linear regression analysis to analyze SA time course. Results: For saline and METH SA, there were no sex differences when we compared males and females generally, with sex differences evident only when we compared sexes from distinct clusters. The current model could not explain the inconsistencies in the observability of sex differences in METH SA. Conclusions: We validated the MISSING model -it can explain the inconsistencies around sex differences in METH SA.

	<p>Background: In this systematic review, conducted according to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we aimed to assess differences in the cognitive processes associated with social cognition&amp;amp;mdash;namely language, theory of mind (ToM), and executive functions (EFs)&amp;amp;mdash;between ADHD and control groups. Methods: The review included studies indexed in PubMed, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO up until May 2024. Eligible original peer-reviewed articles met the following criteria: they were written in English, included a clinical group with a current primary ADHD diagnosis, were empirical, included quantitative data, and utilized standardized and validated measures with adequate psychometric properties to assess social cognitive processes. Results and Discussion: A total of 1215 individuals with ADHD participated in the selected studies. Out of the 22 articles reviewed, 17 reported significant differences between ADHD and the controls across several cognitive processes related to language and EF rather than ToM. These processes included pragmatic skills, verbal and nonverbal communication, emotional prosody, interaction skills, sarcasm, paradoxical sarcasm recognition, ambiguous situations, emotion recognition, false belief, social problem solving, social behaviors, and gesture codification. We also discuss the limitations of the research and the implications of our findings. Systematic review registration: PROSPERO ID: CRD42023474681.</p>

	<p>Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) impacts not only diagnosed individuals, but also significantly affects the quality of life of both primary and secondary caregivers. These effects are particularly pronounced when compared to caregivers of individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders. The emotional and physical demands of caring for someone with ASD can profoundly alter family dynamics and interpersonal relationships, creating challenges that require a comprehensive approach to be understood and addressed. Methods: The methodological design is a narrative review study, based on a search conducted during May, June, July, and August 2024 in the Scopus, Dialnet, and WoS databases concerning the object of study. As a result, a total of 197 articles were qualitatively analyzed. Of these, 36 articles were selected for a more detailed qualitative analysis, leading to a final sample of 14 documents. The selected studies were examined through qualitative content analysis. The inclusion criteria for this selection were as follows: empirical studies or research published in English or Spanish; open access via the Internet; categories limited to &amp;amp;ldquo;education/educational research&amp;amp;rdquo; relevant to the proposed objectives; and specific documents related to students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Results: The care of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has a significant and multifaceted impact on family life, deeply affecting the mental health of caregivers. These effects manifest in the form of chronic stress, anxiety, and interpersonal difficulties, altering family dynamics. The quality of life of caregivers varies depending on the coping strategies they employ, which are crucial for their emotional well-being. Conclusions: Understanding and optimizing these strategies is essential to mitigate the negative effects of caregiving and improving the overall well-being of families living with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Research is lacking about the development of personality disorders (PDs) from adolescence to early adulthood. This study aimed to characterize the profile of high-risk adolescents compared to adolescents with full-blown PDs and adolescents with other psychiatric disorders and to identify clinical markers that constitute a risk profile. Methods: We evaluated 99 adolescents (12&amp;amp;ndash;17 years old) through DSM-5-based semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, cognitive tasks, and scales regarding functioning and disorder severity. We divided patients into three groups: 22 adolescents with full-blown personality disorder (FBPD), 57 adolescents at high risk for personality disorders (HPD), and 20 adolescents with other DSM-5 psychiatric disorders (OTH). At follow-up, 56 patients completed the assessment. Possible developmental trajectories of FBPD and HPD patients were remission (total or partial) of PD-related symptoms, stability of symptoms, or transition from HPD to FBPD. Results: FBPD adolescents had more impaired family backgrounds. At baseline, the HPD group was mainly composed of female patients, younger than the FBPD ones. Externalizing symptoms may represent prodromal symptoms of FBPD. High-risk patients who made the transition were younger than those who did not, and their mothers reported higher internalizing symptoms at baseline. None of the FBPD patients remitted. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of a PD &amp;amp;ldquo;at-risk mental state&amp;amp;rdquo; and the importance of the implementation of PD early detection and treatment in adolescents, regardless of patient age.</p>

	<p>Background: LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy is a social development protocol that uses LEGO&amp;amp;reg; activities to support the development of a wide range of interaction skills, enhancing prosocial behaviors and mitigating the challenges associated with mental health difficulties and behavioral issues commonly observed in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Objectives: This study aimed to explore the effects of LEGO&amp;amp;reg;-based therapy on the social behavior and mental health of children with ASD, comparing stimulation mediated by expert and stimulation mediated by non-autistic peers. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee at Mackenzie Presbyterian University, ensuring adherence to ethical standards throughout the research process. Methods: This study involved 18 children with ASD, levels 1 or 2, with an intelligence quotient (IQ) above 70, and three typically developing peers, intelligence quotient (IQ) above 80, aged between 5 and 8 years old, of both sexes. Participants were randomized into three groups for stimulation (stimulation mediated by expert, by a non-autistic peer and control group). The measures were the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (parent and teacher versions), the Inventory of Difficulties in Executive Functions, Regulation, and Aversion to Delay&amp;amp;mdash;Child Version, the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, the Autism Behavior Checklist, and the Autistic Behavior Inventory. Results: After 14 sessions of 45 min in school settings, the participants of both groups (mediated by experts and non-autistic children) showed significant gains on social behavior. A statistically significant difference was observed between baseline sessions and probes (&amp;amp;chi;2 (5) = 25.905, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These gains were maintained in both follow-up points, 30 and 90 days after the completion of the stimulation sessions. Additionally, maladaptive behavior showed a significant decline when compared pre- and post-intervention. These improvements were sustained during follow-up assessments at 30 and 90 days. Conclusions: The results suggest that a structured intervention combined with peer-mediated stimulation may be an effective method for promoting adaptive and prosocial behaviors in children with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Elder abuse, and more specifically financial exploitation, is expected to be a major problem in modern societies as the worldwide population is getting older. Neuropsychological protocols regarding financial capacity assessment are the only available window allowing us to view the cognitive&amp;amp;ndash;emotional&amp;amp;ndash;behavioral strengths/deficits and vulnerabilities of individuals. Given the paucity of relevant research in Greece in the most vulnerable individuals such as older adults suffering from neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), this systematic review attempts to investigate whether NCDs impair financial capacity and to highlight the most important factors that can predict financial incapacity in Greek older patients and the likelihood of financial abuse. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Results: The search identified n = 21 relevant research articles. The synthesis of available evidence supports that financial incapacity is clearly demonstrated in the group of Greek older adults suffering from NCDs of different severity and etiology; thus, such changes can assist diagnosis, treatment, and care of these individuals, but the implications for elder abuse in the Greek cultural context have not been examined in detail so far. Conclusions: Given the unique source of information that neuropsychological assessments represent by revealing the importance of factors such as arithmetic cognition and relevant brain volume changes in the left angular gyrus, depressive mood, apathy, frailty, vascular risk factors, and financial illiteracy, forensic neuropsychology can play a vital role in protecting older individuals from financial abuse.</p>

	<p>Background: Our understanding of the relationship between neural activity and psychological states has advanced greatly in recent decades. But we are still unable to explain conscious experience in terms of physical processes occurring in our brains. Methods: This paper introduces a conceptual framework that may contribute to an explanation. All physical processes entail the transfer, transduction, and transformation of energy between portions of matter as work is performed in material systems. If the production of consciousness in nervous systems is a physical process, then it must entail the same. Here the nervous system, and the brain in particular, is considered as a material system that transfers, transduces, and transforms energy as it performs biophysical work. Conclusions: Evidence from neuroscience suggests that conscious experience is produced in the organic matter of nervous systems when they perform biophysical work at classical and quantum scales with a certain level of dynamic complexity or organization. An empirically grounded, falsifiable, and testable hypothesis is offered to explain how energy processing in nervous systems may produce conscious experience at a fundamental physical level.</p>

                Background This study examined the effect of thermocycling on the flexural strength properties of four CAD/CAM ceramic materials at different thicknesses. Methods Four CAD/CAM ceramics of different types: advanced lithium disilicate (ALD), zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) lithium disilicate (LD), and leucite reinforced (LE), and at three varying thicknesses 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were examined. After subjecting all specimens to 5000 thermomechanical cycles, flexural strength was determined using a universal testing apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed for analysis. Two factorial ANOVA models assessed the association of different factors (ceramic type and thickness) with flexural strength and elastic modulus. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and adjusted means were computed. A p-value < 0.05 was designated significant. Results ZLS exhibited the highest flexural strength at 1.5 mm thickness, while LD showed the highest Young’s modulus of elasticity. The lowest flexural strength was observed in the 0.5 mm thickness group. There were notable variations in flexural strength across all ceramic materials, with the highest adjusted mean strength in the ZLS group, ALD, LD, and LE, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were noted in ceramic thickness, with 1.5 mm thickness showing the highest strength and 0.5 mm thickness the lowest. Conclusions Ceramic material thickness significantly impacts flexural strength, with 1.5 mm thickness deemed suitable for posterior restorations. Ceramic materials with zirconia fillers or matrix demonstrated higher flexural strength than other ceramics.

                Background Different usage scenarios and design guidelines were considered when planning a factory building and its ventilation system. Accordingly, it often makes sense to analyze the actual operating conditions again during subsequent operations in order to optimally adapt the air supply to the respective conditions in terms of demand-responsive ventilation. The aim is to ensure good indoor air quality and thermal comfort while significantly reducing energy consumption. Methods For this purpose, in addition to the sensors in the building management system, approximately 120 wireless sensors were installed in the occupied areas to measure the air temperature, operating temperature, humidity, and CO2. In this way the spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, humidity, and CO2 in the hall were visualized and evaluated to reduce the volume flows of the ventilation systems. The recorded data and findings were used to optimize ventilation systems by gaining a deeper understanding of indoor air flow. Results As part of the investigation, a considerable reduction in the air volume flows and thus the required energy consumption of the air handling units was achieved while maintaining the same thermal comfort. It was shown that the temperature field and indoor air quality were not negatively affected by the change in the air volume flow over a wide range. Conclusions This was made possible by the well-designed ventilation system, which achieves a low-pulse, slightly stratified indoor airflow, and a structural envelope with very good thermal insulation.

                Background Global environmental degradation is increasingly driving poor health outcomes worldwide. Healthcare systems and services are often not environmentally sustainable and compound the problem, while healthcare professionals are also recognised as key leaders in advancing sustainable healthcare. To adopt this leadership position, healthcare professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding environmental sustainability in healthcare must be established. This article reports the development and validation of a new instrument for this purpose that corresponds to the specificities of the Southern African context. Methods Questionnaire development followed a seven-stage process. Information was obtained from a 2021 study titled ‘South African Healthcare Professionals’ Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Environmental Sustainability in Healthcare: A Mixed-Methods Study’ to develop the instrument. Information was also sourced from the literature regarding environmental sustainability and healthcare to generate the first questionnaire with 29 items. The following stages included two rounds of expert input, separated by a pilot study with the target population to receive feedback regarding the instrument’s structure, relevance, and length. Content validity was determined through statistical analysis. Results Feedback was received from nine experts in stage two and 13 pilot-study participants in stage four and incorporated to improve the questionnaire. In stage six, the questionnaire was rated by seven experts. The content validity index of the questionnaire was calculated at two different stages, after which the indices were compared. Following a final edit, the questionnaire has 24 questionnaire items. The closing analysis calculated the scale content validity index average (S-CVI/Ave) of 0,922; this indicates that the final questionnaire has excellent content validity. Conclusion A questionnaire that assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare professionals regarding environmental sustainability in Southern Africa has been developed and validated. This questionnaire can now be used for further studies in Southern Africa.

                Background Concerns regarding academic efficiency at the postgraduate level in university programs require attention from those responsible for making university administrative decisions. This study aimed to determine the terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students enrolled in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years. Methods This cross-sectional study considered all records of documents submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty in the programs offered by a dental school, published in its institutional repository between 2017 and 2023. The study variable was terminal efficiency (TE), considered both as a quantitative and qualitative variable. Additionally, some covariates were included, such as the year of formal document submission, the mode of document preparation, the second professional specialty in dentistry, and sex. Descriptive analysis was conducted to obtain absolute and relative frequencies. Bivariate analysis was performed using Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results From the evaluation of TE between 2017 and 2023, it was observed that 72.09% (n=186) of students with a document submitted for obtaining a title of second professional specialty and published in the repository had a TE categorized of “Up to 1 year”. Likewise, the mean TE was 0.95 years (SD=1.25), with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001) between medians when evaluated based on the year of formal document submission and the dental specialty program. Conclusion The mean terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students in second specialty programs in a dental school over seven years was 0.95 years.

                Preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal complications and neonatal deaths. Furthermore, in the field of obstetrics many clinical entities like uterine contractions or the occurrence of pre- eclampsia remain to be serious complications during pregnancy and represent a major psychological, financial, and economic burden for society. Several published guidelines, studies and recommendations have highlighted the importance of supplementation of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy. This narrative review aims at giving an overview on the modern perception of inflammatory processes and the role of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in their resolution, especially in obstetrics. Additionally, we highlight the possible role of SPMs in the prevention of obstetric complications through oral supplementation using enriched marine oil nutritional’s. The intake of PUFAs may result in an overall improvement of pregnancy outcomes by contributing to fetal brain growth and neurological development but more importantly though modulation of inflammation-associated pathologies. Especially the use of SPMs represents a promising approach for the management of obstetric and perinatal complications. SPMs are monohydroxylates derived from enriched marine oil nutritional’s that involve certain pro-resolutive metabolites of omega-3 long chains PUFAs and may contribute to an attenuation of inflammatory diseases. This may be obtained through various mechanisms necessary for a proper resolution of inflammation such as the termination of neutrophil tissue infiltration, initiation of phagocytosis, downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or tissue regeneration. In this way, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases associated with serious obstetrical complications can be modulated, which might contribute to an improved pregnancy outcome.

                Background The discoveries of Mulatu’s numbers, better known as Mulatu’s sequence, represent revolutionary contributions to the mathematical world. His best-known work is Mulatu’s sequence, in which each new number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. When various operations and manipulations are performed on the numbers in this sequence, beautiful and incredible patterns begin to emerge. This study aimed to identify novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Methods This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Mathematical proof techniques such as principle of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction and direct proof were utilized to substantiate findings. GNU Octave (version 9, (1)) software was applied to verify the existence, classify, and conduct computational investigations of findings prior to formal proofs. Results In this study, we provided several characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. We also investigated the properties and patterns of these fascinating numbers. Moreover, we have also shown that, similar to Fibonacci’s numbers, Mulatu’s numbers also give the so-called golden ratio, which is most applicable in numerical optimization. Furthermore, we formulated a relation among Mulatu’s numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and Lucas numbers. Finally, we provided a generating function for the Mulatu numbers. Conclusions In this study, we uncovered novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers and introduced a generating function for them. We investigated relationship between Mulatu’s numbers and the golden ratio. The results discussed offer valuable insights and enhance our understanding of their properties. Furthermore, these findings play a vital role in the boarder context of mathematical sequences, contributing significantly to the field.

                <p>by Gabriel A. A. Silva, Avril M. Harder, Kenneth B. Kirksey, Samarth Mathur, Janna R. Willoughby</p>

Wild populations are increasingly threatened by human-mediated climate change and land use changes. As populations decline, the probability of inbreeding increases, along with the potential for negative effects on individual fitness. Detecting and characterizing runs of homozygosity (ROHs) is a popular strategy for assessing the extent of individual inbreeding present in a population and can also shed light on the genetic mechanisms contributing to inbreeding depression. Here, we analyze simulated and empirical datasets to demonstrate the downstream effects of program selection and long-term demographic history on ROH inference, leading to context-dependent biases in the results. Through a sensitivity analysis we evaluate how various parameter values impact on ROH-calling results, highlighting its utility as a tool for parameter exploration. Our results indicate that ROH inferences are sensitive to factors such as sequencing depth and ROH length distribution, and with bias direction and magnitude varying with demographic history and the programs used. Estimation biases are particularly pronounced at lower sequencing depths, potentially leading to either underestimation or overestimation of inbreeding. These results are particularly important for the management of endangered species, as underestimating inbreeding signals in the genome can substantially undermine conservation initiatives. We also found that small true ROHs can be incorrectly lumped together and called as longer ROHs, leading to erroneous inference of recent inbreeding. To address these challenges, we suggest using a combination of ROH detection tools and ROH length-specific inferences, along with sensitivity analysis, to generate robust and context-appropriate population inferences regarding inbreeding history. We outline these recommendations for ROH estimation at multiple levels of sequencing effort, which are typical of conservation genomics studies.

                <p>by Lingxia Qiao, Michael Getz, Ben Gross, Brian Tenner, Jin Zhang, Padmini Rangamani</p>

The nanoscale organization of enzymes associated with the dynamics of second messengers is critical for ensuring compartmentation and localization of signaling molecules in cells. Specifically, the spatiotemporal orchestration of cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations is critical for many cellular functions. Previous experimental studies have shown that the formation of nanodomains of A-kinase anchoring protein 79/150 (AKAP150) and adenylyl cyclase 8 (AC8) on the surface of pancreatic MIN6 β cells modulates the phase of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP oscillations from out-of-phase to in-phase. In this work, we develop computational models of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP pathway and AKAP/AC nanodomain formation that give rise to the two important predictions: instead of an arbitrary phase difference, the out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation reaches Ca<sup>2+</sup> trough and cAMP peak simultaneously, which is defined as inversely out-of-phase; the in-phase and inversely out-of-phase oscillations associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP dynamics on and away from the nanodomains can be explained by an incoherent feedforward loop. Factors such as cellular surface-to-volume ratio, compartment size, and distance between nanodomains do not affect the existence of in-phase or inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation, but cellular surface-to-volume ratio and compartment size can affect the time delay for the inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation while the distance between two nanodomains does not. Finally, we predict that both the Turing pattern-generated nanodomains and experimentally measured nanodomains demonstrate the existence of in-phase and inversely out-of-phase Ca<sup>2+</sup>/cAMP oscillation when the AC8 is at a low level, consistent with the behavior of an incoherent feedforward loop. These findings unveil the key circuit motif that governs cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and advance our understanding of how nanodomains can lead to spatial compartmentation of second messengers.

                <p>by Emmanouil Giannakakis, Oleg Vinogradov, Victor Buendía, Anna Levina</p>

Cortical neurons are versatile and efficient coding units that develop strong preferences for specific stimulus characteristics. The sharpness of tuning and coding efficiency is hypothesized to be controlled by delicately balanced excitation and inhibition. These observations suggest a need for detailed co-tuning of excitatory and inhibitory populations. Theoretical studies have demonstrated that a combination of plasticity rules can lead to the emergence of excitation/inhibition (E/I) co-tuning in neurons driven by independent, low-noise signals. However, cortical signals are typically noisy and originate from highly recurrent networks, generating correlations in the inputs. This raises questions about the ability of plasticity mechanisms to self-organize co-tuned connectivity in neurons receiving noisy, correlated inputs. Here, we study the emergence of input selectivity and weight co-tuning in a neuron receiving input from a recurrent network via plastic feedforward connections. We demonstrate that while strong noise levels destroy the emergence of co-tuning in the readout neuron, introducing specific structures in the non-plastic pre-synaptic connectivity can re-establish it by generating a favourable correlation structure in the population activity. We further show that structured recurrent connectivity can impact the statistics in fully plastic recurrent networks, driving the formation of co-tuning in neurons that do not receive direct input from other areas. Our findings indicate that the network dynamics created by simple, biologically plausible structural connectivity patterns can enhance the ability of synaptic plasticity to learn input-output relationships in higher brain areas.

                <p>by Lani Fox, William C. Miller, Dionne Gesink, Irene Doherty, Marc Serre</p>

In 2008–2011 Forsyth County, North Carolina experienced a four-fold increase in syphilis rising to over 35 cases per 100,000 mirroring the 2021 state syphilis rate. Our methodology extends current models with: 1) donut geomasking to enhance resolution while protecting patient privacy; 2) a moving window uniform grid to control the modifiable area unit problem, edge effect and remove kriging islands; and 3) mitigating the “small number problem” with Uniform Model Bayesian Maximum Entropy. Data is 2008–2011 early syphilis cases reported to the NC Department of Health and Human Services for Forsyth County. Results were assessed using latent rate theory cross validation. We show combining a moving window and a UMBME analysis with geomasked data effectively predicted the true or latent syphilis rate 5% to 26% more accurate than the traditional, geopolitical boundary method. It removed kriging islands, reduced background incidence rate to 0, relocated nine outbreak hotspots to more realistic locations, and elucidated hotspot connectivity producing more realistic geographical patterns for targeted insights. Using the Forsyth outbreak as a case study showed how the outbreak emerged from endemic areas spreading through sexual core transmitters and contextualizing the outbreak to current and past outbreaks. As the dynamics of sexually transmitted infections spread have changed to online partnership selection and demographically to include more women, partnership selection continues to remain highly localized. Furthermore, it is important to present methods to increase interpretability and accuracy of visual representations of data.

Curiosity-driven exploration involves actively engaging with the environment to learn from it. Here, we hypothesize that the cognitive mechanisms underlying exploratory behavior may differ across individuals depending on personal characteristics such as autistic traits. In turn, this variability might influence successful exploration. To investigate this, we collected self- and other-reports of autistic traits from university students, and tested them in an exploration task in which participants could learn the hiding patterns of multiple characters. Participants’ prediction errors and learning progress (i.e., the decrease in prediction error) on the task were tracked with a hierarchical delta-rule model. Crucially, participants could freely decide when to disengage from a character and what to explore next. We examined whether autistic traits modulated the relation of prediction errors and learning progress with exploration. We found that participants with lower scores on other-reports of insistence-on-sameness and general autistic traits were less persistent, primarily relying on learning progress during the initial stages of exploration. Conversely, participants with higher scores were more persistent and relied on learning progress in later phases of exploration, resulting in better performance in the task. This research advances our understanding of the interplay between autistic traits and exploration drives, emphasizing the importance of individual traits in learning processes and highlighting the need for personalized learning approaches.

                <p>by Malin Ramne, Jon Sensinger</p>

Pain perception is influenced not only by sensory input from afferent neurons but also by cognitive factors such as prior expectations. It has been suggested that overly precise priors may be a key contributing factor to chronic pain states such as neuropathic pain. However, it remains an open question how overly precise priors in favor of pain might arise. Here, we first verify that a Bayesian approach can describe how statistical integration of prior expectations and sensory input results in pain phenomena such as placebo hypoalgesia, nocebo hyperalgesia, chronic pain, and spontaneous neuropathic pain. Our results indicate that the value of the prior, which is determined by the internal model parameters, may be a key contributor to these phenomena. Next, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian approach to update the parameters of the internal model based on the difference between the predicted and the perceived pain, to reflect that people integrate prior experiences in their future expectations. In contrast with simpler approaches, this hierarchical model structure is able to show for placebo hypoalgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia how these phenomena can arise from prior experiences in the form of a classical conditioning procedure. We also demonstrate the phenomenon of offset analgesia, in which a disproportionally large pain decrease is obtained following a minor reduction in noxious stimulus intensity. Finally, we turn to simulations of neuropathic pain, where our hierarchical model corroborates that persistent non-neuropathic pain is a risk factor for developing neuropathic pain following denervation, and additionally offers an interesting prediction that complete absence of informative painful experiences could be a similar risk factor. Taken together, these results provide insight to how prior experiences may contribute to pain perception, in both experimental and neuropathic pain, which in turn might be informative for improving strategies of pain prevention and relief.

                <p>by Tamjid A. Chowdhury, David A. Luy, Garrett Scapellato, Dorian Farache, Amy S. Y. Lee, Christopher C. Quinn</p>

Mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be a key component of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, intellectual disability, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that protect against mitochondrial dysfunction during neurodevelopment. Here, we address this question through the investigation of <i>rbm-26</i>, the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> ortholog of the <i>RBM27</i> autism candidate gene, which encodes an RNA-binding protein whose role in neurons is unknown. We report that RBM-26 (RBM26/27) protects against axonal defects by negatively regulating expression of the MALS-1 (MALSU1) mitoribosomal assembly factor. Autism-associated missense variants in RBM-26 cause a sharp decrease in RBM-26 protein expression along with defects in axon overlap and axon degeneration that occurs during larval development. Using a biochemical screen, we identified the mRNA for the MALS-1 mitoribosomal assembly factor as a binding partner for RBM-26. Loss of RBM-26 function causes a dramatic overexpression of <i>mals-1</i> mRNA and MALS-1 protein. Moreover, genetic analysis indicates that this overexpression of MALS-1 is responsible for the mitochondrial and axon degeneration defects in <i>rbm-26</i> mutants. These observations reveal a mechanism that regulates expression of a mitoribosomal assembly factor to protect against axon degeneration during neurodevelopment.

                <p>by F. Chris Bennett, Mariko L. Bennett</p>

Clearance of dying neurons by microglia is critical to healthy neurodevelopment, but what else do microglia eat? A new study in PLOS Biology demonstrates that microglia not only eat neurons but each other, and that this “microglia cannibalism” causes necroptotic cell death.

During brain development, neurons are selectively cleared by microglia to sculpt neural circuits. This primer discusses a recent study in PLOS Biology showing that microglia also clear away debris from other microglia, which is followed by microglial necroptosis.

The spinal cord is of fundamental importance for integrative processing in brain–body communication, yet routine noninvasive recordings in humans are hindered by vast methodological challenges. Here, we overcome these challenges by developing an easy-to-use electrophysiological approach based on high-density multichannel spinal recordings combined with multivariate spatial-filtering analyses. These advances enable a spatiotemporal characterization of spinal cord responses and demonstrate a sensitivity that permits assessing even single-trial responses. To furthermore enable the study of integrative processing along the neural processing hierarchy in somatosensation, we expand this approach by simultaneous peripheral, spinal, and cortical recordings and provide direct evidence that bottom-up integrative processing occurs already within the spinal cord and thus after the first synaptic relay in the central nervous system. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by providing noninvasive recordings of nociceptive spinal cord responses during heat-pain stimulation. Beyond establishing a new window on human spinal cord function at millisecond timescale, this work provides the foundation to study brain–body communication in its entirety in health and disease.

                <p>by Philipp Huettemann, Pavithra Mahadevan, Justine Lempart, Eric Tse, Budheswar Dehury, Brian F. P. Edwards, Daniel R. Southworth, Bikash R. Sahoo, Ursula Jakob</p>

Aberrant aggregation of α-Synuclein is the pathological hallmark of a set of neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have led to the structural determination of the first synucleinopathy-derived α-Synuclein fibrils, which contain a non-proteinaceous, “mystery density” at the core of the protofilaments, hypothesized to be highly negatively charged. Guided by previous studies that demonstrated that polyphosphate (polyP), a universally conserved polyanion, significantly accelerates α-Synuclein fibril formation, we conducted blind docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments to model the polyP binding site in α-Synuclein fibrils. Here, we demonstrate that our models uniformly place polyP into the lysine-rich pocket, which coordinates the mystery density in patient-derived fibrils. Subsequent in vitro studies and experiments in cells revealed that substitution of the 2 critical lysine residues K43 and K45 with alanine residues leads to a loss of all previously reported effects of polyP binding on α-Synuclein, including stimulation of fibril formation, change in filament conformation and stability as well as alleviation of cytotoxicity. In summary, our study demonstrates that polyP fits the unknown electron density present in in vivo α-Synuclein fibrils and suggests that polyP exerts its functions by neutralizing charge repulsion between neighboring lysine residues.

                Reproducibility is a basis of scientific integrity, yet it remains a significant challenge across disciplines in computational science. This reproducibility crisis is now being met with an Open Science movement, which has risen to prominence within the scientific community and academic libraries especially. To address the need for reproducible computational research and promote Open Science within the community, members of the Open Science and Data Collaborations Program at Carnegie Mellon University Libraries organized a single-day hackathon centered around reproducibility. Partnering with a faculty researcher in English and Digital Humanities, this event allowed several students an opportunity to interact with real research outputs, test the reproducibility of data analyses with code, and offer feedback for improvements. With Python code and data shared by the researcher in an open repository, we revealed that students could successfully reproduce most of the data visualizations, but they required completing some manual setup and modifications to address depreciated libraries to successfully rerun the code. During the event, we also investigated the option of using ChatGPT to debug and troubleshoot rerunning this code. By interacting with a ChatGPT API in the code, we found and addressed the same roadblocks and successfully reproduced the same figures as the participating students. Assessing a second option, we also collaborated with the researcher to publish a compute capsule in Code Ocean. This option presented an alternative to manual setup and modifications, an accessible option for more limited devices like tablets, and a simple solution for outside researchers to modify or build on existing research code.

                Background Coffee-growing communities in Yayu, Southwestern Ethiopia, are perceived to be food secure due to income from coffee production. However, while income ensures caloric sufficiency, it does not necessarily translate into complete food security, especially in terms of nutrient intake. Our study assessed the food and nutrition security of smallholder farm households in Yayu, with a particular focus on dietary diversity and hidden hunger. We found significant gaps in nutritional intake, especially for vulnerable groups such as women and children under five. Policy and Implications Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) targets food-insecure areas based on economic status, assuming that income ensures food security. However, our findings suggest that this approach may be flawed, as households in coffee-growing regions are often labeled food secure despite significant deficiencies in essential nutrients such as heme iron. This calls for a re-evaluation of food security policies in cash-crop-dominated areas to address not only income but also access to diverse and nutrient-rich foods. Recommendations 1. Enhance Nutritional Education: Implement targeted educational programs focusing on the importance of dietary diversity, particularly in coffee-producing areas. 2. Diversify Agriculture: Encourage smallholder farmers to diversify crops, integrating nutrient-dense foods alongside coffee cultivation. 3. Improve Market Access: Strengthen local markets to ensure that nutrient-rich foods are available and affordable during both surplus and shortage seasons. 4. Revise PSNP Criteria: Use localized food and nutrition data rather than income alone to identify food insecurity in cash-crop regions. Conclusion Income from coffee production in Yayu improves caloric sufficiency but does not guarantee nutritional adequacy. To combat hidden hunger, policies must move beyond income-based indicators of food security and prioritize access to diverse, nutrient-rich foods. This will ensure a more comprehensive approach to food and nutrition security in Ethiopia’s coffee-growing regions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-456/v2?src=rss">Delirium management and current practice among Intensive Care Units Doctors, Khartoum [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Delirium is a brain dysfunction characterized by attention and cognitive disturbances in a fluctuating manner. The international guidelines recommend daily screening for delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most commonly used methods for assessing delirium. This study aimed to identify barriers and gaps in knowledge and practice. This was a hospital-based Cross-Sectional study. Stratified random sampling was used in this study. 72 ICU doctors were randomly selected. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 23. Descriptive data were presented, and the chi-squared test was used to determine the associations among variables. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. More than 70% of the doctors were ≤ 30 years of age and female. A total of 69.4% of the participants had < 1year of experience. In total, 94.4% of the participants worked in medical ICUs. Less than 20% of the doctors used delirium assessment tools, with a statistically significant difference based on experience (p=0.012). Delirium was not regularly assessed in 13.9% of the patients. Non-pharmacological management was applied by 76.4% of doctors, and communication with patients was the most frequent (75%). Haloperidol was the most commonly used drug (83.3%). A total of 40.3% of doctors did not stop delirium medication on ICU discharge. A regular delirium assessment was performed. However, the use of validated assessment tools is uncommon. Nonpharmacological management of delirium is important and is mostly performed. Our doctors prescribed antipsychotics for the treatment of both forms of delirium, and almost half of them did not stop the medications on ICU discharge. Medication reconciliation and contact with the next in-charge of the patients are important.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27119?af=R">Cost‐Effectiveness of Endovascular Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Whereas highly cost-effective and cost-saving for patients with small infarcts, whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) remains cost-effective in patients with extensive ischemic injury is uncertain.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the United States, Australian, and Spanish societal perspectives, using a 7-state Markov model, with each state defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Initial probabilities at 3 months were derived from the SELECT2 trial. All other model inputs, including transition probabilities, health care and non-health care costs, and utility weights, were sourced from published literature and government websites. Our analysis included extensive sensitivity and subgroup analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EVT in patients with large ischemic stroke improved health outcomes and was associated with lower costs from a societal viewpoint. EVT was cost-effective with a mean between-group difference of 1.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and a cost-saving of $23,409 in the United States, $10,691 in Australia, and $30,036 in Spain, in addition to uncosted benefits in productivity for patients and carers. Subgroup analyses were directionally consistent with the overall population, notably with preserved cost-effectiveness in older patients (≥ 70 years) and those with more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 20). Sensitivity analyses were largely consistent with the base-case results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EVT demonstrated cost-effectiveness in patients with large core across different settings in the United States, Australia, and Spain, including older patients and those with more severe strokes. These results further support adaptation of systems of care to accommodate the expansion of thrombectomy eligibility to patients with large cores and maximize EVT benefits.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses high mortality and morbidity rates with limited evidence-based therapeutic approaches. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in the management of ICH.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This systematic review and meta-analysis followed recommended guidelines and protocols. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception up to April 12, 2024. The inclusion was restricted to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of high quality, ensuring they were not deemed to have a high risk of bias in any of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) domains. Primary outcomes were good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0–3) and mortality beyond 90 days. Secondary outcomes were early mortality within 30 days and rebleeding rates. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fourteen high-quality RCTs were included. There were 3,027 patients with ICH (1,475 randomized to MIS, and 1,452 randomized to medical management or craniotomy). Of included patients, 1,899 (62.7%) were males. MIS resulted in higher odds of achieving long-term good functional outcome (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.25–1.82]), lower odds of long-term mortality (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.90]) and lower odds of early mortality (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.95]). Rebleeding rates were similar (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.55–2.19]). The treatment effect of MIS was consistent across multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including individuals with deep ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This meta-analysis provides high-quality clinical trial evidence supporting the use of MIS as a primary treatment strategy in the management of ICH. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background During pregnancy, the placenta is an extremely important organ as it secretes its own hormones, e.g. insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), to ensure proper intrauterine fetal growth and development. Ethanol, an addictive and widely used drug, has numerous adverse effects during pregnancy, including fetal growth restriction (FGR). To date, the molecular mechanisms by which ethanol triggers its toxic effects during pregnancy, particularly in the placenta, are not entirely known. For this reason, a murine model of partial IGF-1 deficiency was used to determine ethanol alterations in placental morphology and aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase (AAH) expression. Methods Wild type (WT, Igf1 +/+) and heterozygous (HZ, Igf1 +/-) female mice were given 10% ethanol in water during 14 days as an acclimation period and throughout pregnancy. WT and HZ female mice given water were used as controls. At gestational day 19, pregnant dams were sacrificed, placentas were collected and genotyped for subsequent studies. Results IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption during pregnancy altered placental morphology, and decreased placental efficiency and AAH expression in placentas from all genotypes. No differences were found in Igf1, Igf2, Igf1r and Igf2r mRNA expression in placentas from all groups. Conclusions IGF-1 deficiency and ethanol consumption throughout gestation altered placental development, suggesting the crucial role of IGF-1 in the establishment of an adequate intrauterine environment that allows fetal growth. However, more studies are needed to study the precise mechanism to stablish the relation between both insults.

                Background Disregulation of coagulation is a common phenomenon in patients with high-grade glioma, a primary malignant brain tumor. Objective Identify if there is an alteration in the coagulation profile in patients with high-grade glioma compared to other patients with benign brain tumors. Methods Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) preformance status at admission, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, platelet count, and blood panel results of 21 high-grade glioma patients (cases) and 42 meningioma patients (controls) from northern Peru were reviewed. Bivariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression were performed to determine which factors are associated with glioma. Results Both groups had high proportions of high blood pressure (29%) and diabetes mellitus (14%). According to multivariate analysis, altered values for prothrombin time, platelet count, and ECOG score were associated with glioma (p=0.01). Furthermore, alterations in the blood panel were observed in both cases and controls but failed to reach statistical significance. We also observe that some glioma patients have increased prothrombin time compared to reference values. Conclusion Patients with high-grade glioma seem to suffer more from altered coagulation states than other patients with benign brain tumors, suggesting careful vigilance, measurement, and treatment of abnormal coagulation.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background People need critical thinking skills to make well-informed health choices and avoid waste and unnecessary suffering. However, educational interventions can have adverse effects, which is often overlooked. We created a framework of potential harms of interventions to improve critical thinking about health choices. The objective was to identify potential effects and articulate potential mechanisms. We intended to use the framework to inform the development and evaluation of an intervention in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Methods We created an initial framework drawing on two earlier frameworks. We surveyed external experts using Likert-scale and open-ended items, including researchers, educators, and others, in a variety of relevant fields. We emailed the survey to an international advisory network, and all other experts recommended by respondents. We analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We revised the framework based on those results. To identify any effects missing from the revised framework, we individually interviewed a convenience sample of one teacher from each of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Results We received responses from 38 of 70 external experts (54%). The quantitative survey data suggested respondents agreed with the initial framework overall. However, the qualitative data led to substantial revisions. The revised framework consists of categories of adverse outcomes; outcomes within each category; sub-outcomes; individuals, groups, and populations that might experience each adverse outcome; beneficial outcomes corresponding with adverse outcomes; and potential mechanisms of adverse effects. There are six categories: decision-making harms, psychological harms, equity harms, group and social harms, waste, and other harms. In the interviews with teachers, we did not identify any effects missing from the revised framework. Conclusions As far as we know, the framework is the first tool of its kind for education research. It can be improved upon and adapted.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93172">Exceptional longevity of mammalian ovarian and oocyte macromolecules throughout the reproductive lifespan</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms contributing to age-related deterioration of the female reproductive system are complex, however aberrant protein homeostasis is a major contributor. We elucidated exceptionally stable proteins, structures, and macromolecules that persist in mammalian ovaries and gametes across the reproductive lifespan. Ovaries exhibit localized structural and cell-type-specific enrichment of stable macromolecules in both the follicular and extrafollicular environments. Moreover, ovaries and oocytes both harbor a panel of exceptionally long-lived proteins, including cytoskeletal, mitochondrial, and oocyte-derived proteins. The exceptional persistence of these long-lived molecules suggest a critical role in lifelong maintenance and age-dependent deterioration of reproductive tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90603">Hundreds of myosin 10s are pushed to the tips of filopodia and could cause traffic jams on actin</a></h4>

              
                Myosin 10 (Myo10) is a motor protein known for its role in filopodia formation. Although Myo10-driven filopodial dynamics have been characterized, there is no information about the absolute number of Myo10 molecules during the filopodial lifecycle. To better understand molecular stoichiometries and packing restraints in filopodia, we measured Myo10 abundance in these structures. We combined SDS-PAGE densitometry with epifluorescence microscopy to quantitate HaloTag-labeled Myo10 in U2OS cells. About 6% of total intracellular Myo10 localizes to filopodia, where it enriches at opposite cellular ends. Hundreds of Myo10s are in a typical filopodium, and their distribution across filopodia is log-normal. Some filopodial tips even contain more Myo10 than accessible binding sites on the actin filament bundle. Live-cell movies reveal a dense cluster of over a hundred Myo10 molecules that initiates filopodial elongation. Hundreds of Myo10 molecules continue to accumulate during filopodial growth, but accumulation ceases when retraction begins. Rates of filopodial elongation, second-phase elongation, and retraction are inversely related to Myo10 quantities. Our estimates of Myo10 molecules in filopodia provide insight into the physics of packing Myo10, its cargo, and other filopodia-associated proteins in narrow membrane compartments. Our protocol provides a framework for future work analyzing Myo10 abundance and distribution upon perturbation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96942">Formin-like 1β phosphorylation at S1086 is necessary for secretory polarized traffic of exosomes at the immune synapse in Jurkat T lymphocytes</a></h4>

              
                We analyzed here how formin-like 1 β (FMNL1β), an actin cytoskeleton-regulatory protein, regulates microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and multivesicular bodies (MVB) polarization and exosome secretion at an immune synapse (IS) model in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. IS formation was associated with transient recruitment of FMNL1β to the IS, which was independent of protein kinase C δ (PKCδ). Simultaneous RNA interference of all FMNL1 isoforms prevented MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion, which were restored by FMNL1βWT expression. However, expression of the non-phosphorylatable mutant FMNL1βS1086A did not restore neither MTOC/MVB polarization nor exosome secretion to control levels, supporting the crucial role of S1086 phosphorylation in MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. In contrast, the phosphomimetic mutant, FMNL1βS1086D, restored MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. Conversely, FMNL1βS1086D mutant did not recover the deficient MTOC/MVB polarization occurring in PKCδ-interfered clones, indicating that S1086 FMNL1β phosphorylation alone is not sufficient for MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion. FMNL1 interference inhibited the depletion of F-actin at the central region of the immune synapse (cIS), which is necessary for MTOC/MVB polarization. FMNL1βWT and FMNL1βS1086D, but not FMNL1βS1086A expression, restored F-actin depletion at the cIS. Thus, actin cytoskeleton reorganization at the IS underlies the effects of all these FMNL1β variants on polarized secretory traffic. FMNL1 was found in the IS made by primary T lymphocytes, both in T cell receptor (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-evoked synapses. Taken together, these results point out a crucial role of S1086 phosphorylation in FMNL1β activation, leading to cortical actin reorganization and subsequent control of MTOC/MVB polarization and exosome secretion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87258">A Pvr–AP-1–Mmp1 signaling pathway is activated in astrocytes upon traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) caused by external mechanical forces is a major health burden worldwide, but the underlying mechanism in glia remains largely unclear. We report herein that <i>Drosophila</i> adults exhibit a defective blood–brain barrier, elevated innate immune responses, and astrocyte swelling upon consecutive strikes with a high-impact trauma device. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of these astrocytes revealed upregulated expression of genes encoding PDGF and VEGF receptor-related (Pvr, a receptor tyrosine kinase), adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1<i>,</i> a transcription factor complex of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway) composed of Jun-related antigen (Jra) and kayak (kay), and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1) following TBI. Interestingly, Pvr is both required and sufficient for AP-1 and Mmp1 upregulation, while knockdown of AP-1 expression in the background of Pvr overexpression in astrocytes rescued Mmp1 upregulation upon TBI, indicating that Pvr acts as the upstream receptor for the downstream AP-1–Mmp1 transduction. Moreover, dynamin-associated endocytosis was found to be an important regulatory step in downregulating Pvr signaling. Our results identify a new Pvr–AP-1–Mmp1 signaling pathway in astrocytes in response to TBI, providing potential targets for developing new therapeutic strategies for TBI.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95852">PUFA stabilizes a conductive state of the selectivity filter in IKs channels</a></h4>

              
                In cardiomyocytes, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs), pivotal during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites, one in the voltage sensor domain – which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages – and the other in the pore domain – which increases the maximal conductance of the channels (Gmax). However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood. In addition, it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability, and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99858">Structural basis for molecular assembly of fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins in a diatom photosystem I supercomplex</a></h4>

              
                Photosynthetic organisms exhibit remarkable diversity in their light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). LHCs are associated with photosystem I (PSI), forming a PSI-LHCI supercomplex. The number of LHCI subunits, along with their protein sequences and pigment compositions, has been found to differ greatly among the PSI-LHCI structures. However, the mechanisms by which LHCIs recognize their specific binding sites within the PSI core remain unclear. In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a PSI supercomplex incorporating fucoxanthin chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>c</i>-binding proteins (FCPs), designated as PSI-FCPI, isolated from the diatom <i>Thalassiosira pseudonana</i> CCMP1335. Structural analysis of PSI-FCPI revealed five FCPI subunits associated with a PSI monomer; these subunits were identified as RedCAP, Lhcr3, Lhcq10, Lhcf10, and Lhcq8. Through structural and sequence analyses, we identified specific protein–protein interactions at the interfaces between FCPI and PSI subunits, as well as among FCPI subunits themselves. Comparative structural analyses of PSI-FCPI supercomplexes, combined with phylogenetic analysis of FCPs from <i>T. pseudonana</i> and the diatom <i>Chaetoceros gracilis</i>, underscore the evolutionary conservation of protein motifs crucial for the selective binding of individual FCPI subunits. These findings provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and selective binding of FCPIs in diatoms.

	<p>The stability&amp;amp;ndash;plasticity dilemma remains a critical challenge in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of continuous learning. This perspective paper presents a novel approach by drawing inspiration from the mammalian hippocampus&amp;amp;ndash;cortex system. We elucidate how this biological system&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to balance rapid learning with long-term memory retention can inspire novel AI architectures. Our analysis focuses on key mechanisms, including complementary learning systems and memory consolidation, with emphasis on recent discoveries about sharp-wave ripples and barrages of action potentials. We propose innovative AI designs incorporating dual learning rates, offline consolidation, and dynamic plasticity modulation. This interdisciplinary approach offers a framework for more adaptive AI systems while providing insights into biological learning. We present testable predictions and discuss potential implementations and implications of these biologically inspired principles. By bridging neuroscience and AI, our perspective aims to catalyze advancements in both fields, potentially revolutionizing AI capabilities while deepening our understanding of neural processes.</p>

	<p>Substance use disorder (SUD) significantly impacts public health, economics, and legal systems worldwide. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) was initially developed in the late 1980s as a therapeutic approach for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), using bilateral stimulation to integrate traumatic memories with calming physiological responses. However, the effectiveness of EMDR in treating SUD remains unclear. This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of EMDR therapy on craving reduction in individuals with SUD. The search was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Web of Science, focusing on studies that measured craving and employed EMDR interventions. Both random and fixed effects models were used to pool effect sizes, utilizing an R software meta-package (R-4.4.1). The study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The results indicated a significant reduction in cravings among patients undergoing EMDR therapy. Specifically, under the fixed effect model, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was &amp;amp;minus;0.866 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from &amp;amp;minus;1.121 to &amp;amp;minus;0.611 (z = &amp;amp;minus;6.66, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). These findings may demonstrate the significant efficacy of EMDR therapy in decreasing cravings in people with SUD.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) can indicate affective states&amp;amp;mdash;including psychosocial stress&amp;amp;mdash;in mice and rats. However, stress-induced USV changes could be confounded by laboratory experimental variables such as the type of behavioral stress paradigm, the elicitation method, rodent strain, etc. We sought to provide a review of the current literature to delineate how psychosocial stress-altered rodent USVs may be affected by factors of age, sex, strain, species, elicitation paradigm, and stressor. Methods: We used PubMed, Scopus (Elsevier), PsycINFO (EBSCO), and the following Web of Science (Clarivate) databases: Biological Abstracts, CAB Abstracts, Science Citation Index-Expanded, and Emerging Sources Citation Index. The studies identified by our search strategy were independently screened by two authors with the following inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed, in English, reported original data, and described USV in response to stress in rats or mice. The data extracted included USV acoustic parameters (mean peak frequency and mean amplitude (loudness)), details of the stress and USV elicitation paradigms, rodent species, age, and sex variables. Results: The following screening of 5309 titles/abstracts and 687 full-text articles revealed 148 articles. Footshock (20%), cold exposure (14%), and maternal separation (23.5%) were the most commonly used stress paradigms (duration and type of stressor varied across studies), with the total number of USV calls being the most commonly reported acoustic outcome. In rats, 121 articles described stress-altered USVs, while 25 studies reported the same in mice, and two reported multiple rodent species (rats and mice, alongside other rodent species such as gerbils). With respect to stress-altered USV changes with age, mice and rats increase USV rates after birth, with a peak around 6 to 10 days, and decrease USVs until weanling age. Of the five studies that reported sex-related differences in stress-induced USVs, females had an increased number of calls and lower average peak frequency in response to stress when compared to males. Only two to four studies reported strain-related differences in stress-induced vocalizations in rats and mice, respectively. Conclusions: The data from this review lay the groundwork for better understanding rodent USVs in response to psychosocial stress with effects of elicitation paradigm, stressor, age, and sex.</p>

	<p>Background: When integrating visual and somatosensory processing into the subjective postural vertical using the Romberg test, patients with hemiplegic can be sorted into either post-stroke or pushers with unilateral spatial neglect (USN). This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of the integrated processing of the integrated subjective postural vertical (ISPV) with open or closed eyes in patients with hemiplegic and/or pusher with USN. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 91 patients with hemiplegic and 45 with pusher and USN. The outcomes included the ratio and sum of SPV with the eyes closed and open. Statistical analyses were performed using the parametric and/or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U test, or chi-square test after the Shapiro&amp;amp;ndash;Wilk test. Results: The outcomes in the 91 patients with hemiplegic were as follows: moderate-to-severe ISPV with ratio, 1.64&amp;amp;deg;; ISPV sum (ISPVS), 9.41&amp;amp;deg;. The outcomes in the 45 patients with pusher and USN were as follows: moderate-to-severe, ISPV: 1.35&amp;amp;deg;, and ISPVS: 13.96&amp;amp;deg;. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of demographic data or ISPV. However, the number of patients with pusher syndrome was significantly higher in the ISPVS group than in stroke patients with hemiplegic. Conclusions: Adaptation occurs by integrating sensory modalities, and the pusher behavior in patients with USN is characterized by the specific pathophysiology of a two-modality disorder with visual and somatosensory deficits. This study provides key insights into the pathophysiological characteristics of patients with pusher syndrome and USN.</p>

                Background Two-wheeled vehicles are the major mode of transportation in India. Such vehicles are exposed to excessive vibration on the road when compared to four-wheeled vehicles. However, the research on the reduction of whole body vibration in the case of two-wheelers is not explored in detail. The present study predicts rider comfort in the case of an electric two-wheeler as per ISO 2631-1, by obtaining the finding the weighted acceleration at the strategic locations of vibration at the test rig. Methods An electric two-wheeler test rig is used in the study. The values of acceleration from the test rig in running conditions are obtained by using NI LabVIEW 2019. The drive cycle of the electric vehicle (EV) test rig is controlled by Sync sols’ EV lab software. Obtaining the weighted root mean square (RMS) acceleration from running the test setup, it is compared with the ISO 2631-1 standard to obtain the rider comfort. Results Loading area, traction motor, base mount, and suspension were found to be the strategic points of vibration. Frequency weighted RMS acceleration of 0.3 to 0.4 m/s2 obtained at these points are prone to cause discomfort for the rider. Vehicle speed, road profile, and duration of exposure were found to be important parameters affecting the rider’s comfort. A maximum of 4.6 m/s2 amplitude was observed. The loading area, which corresponds to a rider’s seat in actual vehicle, is important and reduction of these vibrations make the ride comfortable for the rider. Suspension and base mount of the test rig are found to be uncomfortable observing the weighted RMS acceleration. Conclusions A suitable damping technique design is very much essential in reducing these vibrations and improve the rider comfort, as many more non-deterministic vibrations are prone to cause dis-comfort in case of actual on road riding conditions.

                Background The emergence of antifungal resistance in fungal pathogens highlights the need for local epidemiological data to guide empirical therapy in clinical settings. Fungal research and anti-fungal drug resistance studies are limited in developing countries; hence, there is a need for burden estimation in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to determine the spectrum of fungal pathogens and the anti-fungal resistance profile of fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urinary tracts of prison inmates in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in which sputum and urine samples were obtained from inmates presenting with symptoms of respiratory and urogenital infections at a prison outpatient clinic. One hundred and sixty-two samples were collected and subjected to fungal investigation using standard protocols. Susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole was assessed using standard broth microdilution. Clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Results From the 162, 94 samples were positive for fungal pathogens, with an overall prevalence of 58%. Seventeen (18%) of the isolated fungi were Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Histoplasma. There was a statistically significant difference between fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urogenital tracts in both sexes (p<0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing against itraconazole showed 2 of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus were resistant. Conclusion Mycological agents are significant causes of respiratory and UTI infections among prison inmates, which could be attributed to prison conditions and misdiagnosis as bacterial infections. This highlights the need for specific control measures to reduce exposure to fungal infections in prisons and in the general population.

                <p>Experimental evidence showed that an increase in intracellular chloride concentration <f></f> caused by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) input can promote epileptic firing activity, but the actual mechanisms remain elusive. Here in this theoretical work, we show that influx of chloride and concomitant bicarbonate ion <f></f> efflux upon GABA receptor activation can induce epileptic firing activity by transition of GABA from inhibition to excitation. We analyzed the intrinsic property of neuron firing states as a function of <f></f>. We found that as <f></f> increases, the system exhibits a saddle&ndash;node bifurcation, above which the neuron exhibits a spectrum of intensive firing, periodic bursting interrupted by depolarization block (DB) state, and eventually a stable DB through a Hopf bifurcation. We demonstrate that only GABA stimuli together with <f></f> efflux can switch GABA's effect to excitation which leads to a series of seizure-like events (SLEs). Exposure to a low <f></f> can drive neurons with high concentrations of <f></f> downward to lower levels of <f></f>, during which it could also trigger SLEs depending on the exchange rate with the bath. Our analysis and simulation results show how the competition between GABA stimuli-induced accumulation of <f></f> and <f></f> application-induced decrease of <f></f> regulates the neuron firing activity, which helps to understand the fundamental ionic dynamics of SLE.</p>

                <p>Aggression involves both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic actions. How the brain implements these two types of actions is poorly understood. We found that in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, a set of neurons, which we call CL062, previously shown to mediate male aggression also mediate female aggression. These neurons elicit aggression acutely and without the presence of a target. Although the same set of actions is elicited in males and females, the overall behavior is sexually dimorphic. The CL062 neurons do not express <I>fruitless</I>, a gene required for sexual dimorphism in flies, and expressed by most other neurons important for controlling fly aggression. Connectomic analysis in a female electron microscopy dataset suggests that these neurons have limited connections with <I>fruitless</I> expressing neurons that have been shown to be important for aggression and signal to different descending neurons. Thus, CL062 is part of a monomorphic circuit for aggression that functions parallel to the known dimorphic circuits.</p>

                <p>Odor information arrives first in the main olfactory bulb and is then broadcasted to the olfactory cortices and striatum. Downstream regions have unique cellular and connectivity architectures that may generate different coding patterns to the same odors. To reveal region-specific response features, tuning and decoding of single-unit populations, we recorded responses to the same odors under the same conditions across regions, namely, the main olfactory bulb (MOB), the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the anterior piriform cortex (aPC), and the olfactory tubercle of the ventral striatum (OT), of awake male mice. We focused on chemically closely related aldehydes that still create distinct percepts. The MOB had the highest decoding accuracy for aldehydes and was the only region encoding chemical similarity. The MOB had the highest fraction of inhibited responses and narrowly tuned odor-excited responses in terms of timing and odor selectivity. Downstream, the interconnected AON and aPC differed in their response patterns to the same stimuli. While odor-excited responses dominated the AON, the aPC had a comparably high fraction of odor-inhibited responses. Both cortices share a main output target that is the MOB. This prompted us to test if the two regions convey also different net outputs. Aldehydes activated AON terminals in the MOB as a bulk signal but inhibited those from the aPC. The differential cortical projection responses generalized to complex odors. In summary, olfactory regions reveal specialized features in their encoding with AON and aPC differing in their local computations, thereby generating inverse net centrifugal and intercortical outputs.</p>

                <p>Harmonics are an integral part of music, speech, and vocalizations of animals. Since the rest of the auditory environment is primarily made up of nonharmonic sounds, the auditory system needs to perceptually separate the above two kinds of sounds. In mice, harmonics, generally with two-tone components (two-tone harmonic complexes, TTHCs), form an important component of vocal communication. Communication by pups during isolation from the mother and by adult males during courtship elicits typical behaviors in female mice&mdash;dams and adult courting females, respectively. Our study shows that the processing of TTHC is specialized in mice providing neural basis for perceptual differences between tones and TTHCs and also nonharmonic sounds. Investigation of responses in the primary auditory cortex (Au1) from in vivo extracellular recordings and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to TTHCs exhibit enhancement, suppression, or no-effect with respect to tones. Irrespective of neuron type, harmonic enhancement is maximized, and suppression is minimized when the fundamental frequencies (<I>F</I><SUB>0</SUB>) match the neuron's best fundamental frequency (BF<SUB>0</SUB>). Sex-specific processing of TTHC is evident from differences in the distributions of neurons&rsquo; best frequency (BF) and best fundamental frequency (BF<SUB>0</SUB>) in single units, differences in harmonic suppressed cases re-BF<SUB>0</SUB>, independent of neuron types, and from pairwise noise correlations among excitatory and parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons. Furthermore, TTHCs elicit a higher response compared with two-tone nonharmonics in females, but not in males. Thus, our study shows specialized neural processing of TTHCs over tones and nonharmonics, highlighting local network specialization among different neuronal types.</p>

                <p>It is well established that holding information in working memory (WM) elicits sustained stimulus-specific patterns of neural activity. Nevertheless, here we provide evidence for a distinct class of neural activity that tracks the number of individuated items in working memory, independent of the type of visual features stored. We present two EEG studies of young adults of both sexes that provide robust evidence for a signal tracking the number of individuated representations in working memory, regardless of the specific feature values stored. In Study 1, subjects maintained either colors or orientations across separate blocks in a single session. We found near-perfect generalization of the load signal between these two conditions, despite being able to simultaneously decode which feature had been voluntarily stored. In Study 2, participants attended to two features with very distinct cortical representations: color and motion coherence. We again found evidence for a neural load signal that robustly generalized across these distinct visual features, even though cortically disparate regions process color and motion coherence. Moreover, representational similarity analysis provided converging evidence for a content-independent load signal, while simultaneously showing that unique variance in EEG activity tracked the specific features that were stored. We posit that this load signal reflects a content-independent "pointer" operation that binds objects to the current context while parallel but distinct neural signals represent the features that are stored for each item in memory.</p>

                <p>In demanding listening situations, a listener's motivational state may affect their cognitive investment. Here, we aim to delineate how domain-specific sensory processing, domain-general neural alpha power, and pupil size as a proxy for cognitive investment encode influences of motivational state under demanding listening. Participants (male and female) performed an auditory gap-detection task while the pupil size and the magnetoencephalogram were simultaneously recorded. Task demand and a listener's motivational state were orthogonally manipulated through changes in gap duration and monetary-reward prospect, respectively. Whereas task difficulty impaired performance, reward prospect enhanced it. The pupil size reliably indicated the modulatory impact of an individual's motivational state. At the neural level, the motivational state did not affect auditory sensory processing directly but impacted attentional postprocessing of an auditory event as reflected in the late evoked-response field and alpha-power change. Both pregap pupil dilation and higher parietal alpha power predicted better performance at the single-trial level. The current data support a framework wherein the motivational state acts as an attentional top&ndash;down neural means of postprocessing the auditory input in challenging listening situations.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus receives a direct projection from retinal ganglion cells. In primates, it remains unknown if the same ganglion cells also supply the lateral geniculate nucleus. To address this issue, a double-label experiment was performed in two male macaques. The animals fixated a target while injection sites were scouted in the superior colliculus by recording and stimulating with a tetrode. Once suitable sites were identified, cholera toxin subunit B-Alexa Fluor 488 was injected via an adjacent micropipette. In a subsequent acute experiment, cholera toxin subunit B-Alexa Fluor 555 was injected into the lateral geniculate nucleus at matching retinotopic locations. After a brief survival period, ganglion cells were examined in retinal flatmounts. The percentage of double-labeled cells varied locally, depending on the relative efficiency of retrograde transport by each tracer and the precision of retinotopic overlap of injection sites in each target nucleus. In counting boxes with extensive overlap, 76&ndash;98% of ganglion cells projecting to the superior colliculus were double labeled. Cells projecting to the superior colliculus constituted 4.0&ndash;6.7% of the labeled ganglion cell population. In one particularly large zone, there were 5,746 cells labeled only by CTB-AF555, 561cells double labeled by CTB-AF555 and CTB-AF488, but no cell labeled only by CTB-AF488. These data indicate that retinal input to the macaque superior colliculus arises from a collateral axonal branch supplied by ~5% of the ganglion cells that project to the lateral geniculate nucleus. Surprisingly, there exist no ganglion cells that project exclusively to the SC.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/44/e1194232024?rss=1">Dopamine and Norepinephrine Differentially Mediate the Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) have been repeatedly implicated in neuropsychiatric vulnerability, in part via their roles in mediating the decision-making processes. Although two neuromodulators share a synthesis pathway and are coactivated under states of arousal, they engage in distinct circuits and modulatory roles. However, the specific role of each neuromodulator in decision-making, in particular the exploration&ndash;exploitation tradeoff, remains unclear. Revealing how each neuromodulator contributes to exploration&ndash;exploitation tradeoff is important in guiding mechanistic hypotheses emerging from computational psychiatric approaches. To understand the differences and overlaps of the roles of these two catecholamine systems in regulating exploration, a direct comparison using the same dynamic decision-making task is needed. Here, we ran male and female mice in a restless two-armed bandit task, which encourages both exploration and exploitation. We systemically administered a nonselective DA antagonist (flupenthixol), a nonselective DA agonist (apomorphine), a NE beta-receptor antagonist (propranolol), and a NE beta-receptor agonist (isoproterenol) and examined changes in exploration within subjects across sessions. We found a bidirectional modulatory effect of dopamine on exploration. Increasing dopamine activity decreased exploration and decreasing dopamine activity increased exploration. The modulatory effect of beta-noradrenergic receptor activity on exploration was mediated by sex. Reinforcement learning model parameters suggested that dopamine modulation affected exploration via decision noise and norepinephrine modulation affected exploration via sensitivity to outcome. Together, these findings suggested that the mechanisms that govern the exploration&ndash;exploitation transition are sensitive to changes in both catecholamine functions and revealed differential roles for NE and DA in mediating exploration.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/44/e1583242024?rss=1">The Critical Thing about the Ear's Sensory Hair Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>The capabilities of the human ear are remarkable. We can normally detect acoustic stimuli down to a threshold sound-pressure level of 0&nbsp;dB (decibels) at the entrance to the external ear, which elicits eardrum vibrations in the picometer range. From this threshold up to the onset of pain, 120&nbsp;dB, our ears can encompass sounds that differ in power by a trillionfold. The comprehension of speech and enjoyment of music result from our ability to distinguish between tones that differ in frequency by only 0.2%. All these capabilities vanish upon damage to the ear's receptors, the mechanoreceptive sensory hair cells. Each cochlea, the auditory organ of the inner ear, contains some 16,000 such cells that are frequency-tuned between ~20&nbsp;Hz (cycles per second) and 20,000&nbsp;Hz. Remarkably enough, hair cells do not simply capture sound energy: they can also exhibit an active process whereby sound signals are amplified, tuned, and scaled. This article describes the active process in detail and offers evidence that its striking features emerge from the operation of hair cells on the brink of an oscillatory instability&mdash;one example of the critical phenomena that are widespread in physics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/44/e1822232024?rss=1">A miR-383-5p Signaling Hub Coordinates the Axon Regeneration Response to Inflammation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroinflammation can positively influence axon regeneration following injury in the central nervous system. Inflammation promotes the release of neurotrophic molecules and stimulates intrinsic proregenerative molecular machinery in neurons, but the detailed mechanisms driving this effect are not fully understood. We evaluated how microRNAs are regulated in retinal neurons in response to intraocular inflammation to identify their potential role in axon regeneration. We found that miR-383-5p is downregulated in retinal ganglion cells in response to zymosan-induced intraocular inflammation. MiR-383-5p downregulation in neurons is sufficient to promote axon growth in vitro, and the intravitreal injection of a miR-383-5p inhibitor into the eye promotes axon regeneration following optic nerve crush. MiR-383-5p directly targets ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor components, and miR-383-5p inhibition sensitizes adult retinal neurons to the outgrowth-promoting effects of CNTF. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that CNTF treatment is sufficient to reduce miR-383-5p levels in neurons, constituting a positive-feedback module, whereby initial CNTF treatment reduces miR-383-5p levels, which then disinhibits CNTF receptor components to sensitize neurons to the ligand. Additionally, miR-383-5p inhibition derepresses the mitochondrial antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin-3 (PRDX3) which was required for the proregenerative effects associated with miR-383-5p loss-of-function in vitro. We have thus identified a positive-feedback mechanism that facilitates neuronal CNTF sensitivity in neurons and a new molecular signaling module that promotes inflammation-induced axon regeneration.</p>
