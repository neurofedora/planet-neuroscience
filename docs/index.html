              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting the principal components of cortical morphological variables</a></h4>

              
                The generating mechanism for the gyrification of the mammalian cerebral cortex remains a central open question in neuroscience. Although many models have been proposed over the years, very few were able to provide empirically testable predictions. In this paper, we assume a model in which the cortex folds for all species of mammals according to a simple mechanism of effective free energy minimization of a growing self-avoiding surface subjected to inhomogeneous bulk stresses to derive a new set of morphological variables to express cortical morphology. In terms of these new variables, we seek to understand the variance present in two morphometric datasets: a human MRI harmonized multi-site dataset comprised by 3324 healthy controls (CTL) from 4 to 96 years old and a collection of different mammalian cortices with morphological measurements extracted manually. This is done using a standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the cortical morphometric space. We prove there is a remarkable coincidence (typically less than 8 degrees) between the resulting principal components vectors in each datasets and the directions corresponding to the new variables. This shows that the new, theoretically-derived variables are a set of natural and independent morphometrics with which to express cortical shape and size.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the efficacy of prototype antiseizure drugs using a preclinical pharmacokinetic approach</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Pharmacokinetics (PK) of a drug drive its exposure, efficacy, and tolerability. A thorough preclinical PK assessment of antiseizure medications (ASMs) is therefore essential to evaluate the clinical potential. We tested protection against evoked seizures of prototype ASMs in conjunction with analysis of plasma and brain PK as a proof-of-principle study to enhance our understanding of drug efficacy and duration of action using rodent seizure models. Methods: In vivo seizure protection assays were performed in adult male CF-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Clobazam (CLB), N-desmethylclobzam (NCLB), carbamazepine (CBZ), carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE), valproic acid (VPA), and levetiracetam (LEV) concentrations were quantified in plasma and brain using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Mean concentrations of each analyte were calculated and used to determine PK parameters via non-compartmental analysis in Phoenix WinNonLin. Results: NCLB concentrations were approximately 10-fold greater than CLB in mice. The antiseizure profile of CLB was partially sustained by NCLB in mice. CLB concentrations were lower in rats than in mice. CBZE plasma exposures were approximately 70% of CBZ in both mice and rats, likely contributing to the antiseizure effect of CBZ. VPA showed a relatively short half-life in both mice and rats, which correlated with a sharp decline in efficacy. LEV had a prolonged brain and plasma half-life, associated with a prolonged duration of action in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An ERP investigation of accented isolated single word processing</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies show that there are differences in native and non-native speech processing (Lev-Ari, 2018). However, less is known about the differences between processing native and dialectal accents. Is dialectal processing more similar to foreign or native speech? To address this, two theories have been proposed. The Perceptual Distance Hypothesis states that the mechanisms underlying dialectal accent processing are attenuated versions of those of foreign (Clarke & Garrett, 2004). Conversely, the Different Processes Hypothesis argues that the mechanisms of foreign and dialectal accent processing are qualitatively different (Floccia et al, 2006). The present study addresses these hypotheses. Electroencephalographic data was recorded from 25 participants who listened to 40 isolated words in different accents. Event-Related Potential mean amplitudes were extracted: P2 [150-250 ms], PMN [250-400 ms] and N400 [400-600 ms]. Support for the Different Processes Hypothesis was found in different time windows. Results show that early processing mechanisms distinguish only between native and non-native speech, with a reduced P2 amplitude for foreign accent processing, supporting the Different Processes Hypothesis. Furthermore, later processing mechanisms show a similar binary difference in the processing of the accents, with a larger PMN negativity elicited in the foreign accent than the others, further supporting the Different Processes Hypothesis. Results contribute to the understanding of single word processing, in which it is uniquely difficult to extract acoustic characteristics from foreign accent, and in which foreign accented speech is associated with the largest cost, as compared to native and dialectal speech, of phonological matching between representations and acoustic input.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Subregion of Insular Cortex Is Required for Rapid Taste-Visceral Integration and Consequent Conditioned Taste Aversion and Avoidance Expression in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Postingestive signals are important for shaping appetitive and consummatory responses, but the brain mechanisms required to assimilate interoceptive events with those at the frontlines of ingestion (taste-guided) are poorly understood. Here, we investigated whether an insular cortex (IC) region, which receives viscerosensory input, including gustatory, is required to modify taste-elicited consummatory reactions in response to a real-time interoceptive change using a serial taste reactivity (TR) test where the rats&rsquo; oromotor and somatic reactions to intraoral (IO) infusions of sucrose were periodically assessed over 45 min following lithium chloride (LiCl) administration. Results showed that neurally-intact rats shifted from an ingestive repertoire to an aversive one as LiCl took effect. Overall, this hedonic shift was delayed in rats with bilateral neurotoxic IC lesions. Rats with greater neuronal loss in posterior gustatory IC displayed fewer aversive reactions to sucrose following this initial LiCl injection. We further assessed whether the failure to integrate interoceptive feedback with ongoing taste-guided behavior impaired acquisition and/or expression of conditioned aversion and/or avoidance in these same rats. Although, as a group, LiCl-injected rats with IC lesions subsequently avoided the sugar in a 48-h two-bottle test, their preference for sucrose was significantly greater than that of the LiCl-injected neurally-intact rats. Overall lesion size, as well as proportion of the posterior gustatory and/or anterior visceral IC were each associated with impaired avoidance. These findings reveal new roles for the posterior gustatory and anterior visceral ICs in multisensory integrative function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Peruvian children toothbrushing during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Toothbrushing is a convenient, inexpensive, widespread and culturally accepted method, resulting in an ideal public health outcome. This study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on toothbrushing in Peruvian children. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted using a database of children aged 0 to 11 years, with a final sample of 39,124 participants, 15,974 in 2019 (62.03%) and 7088 in 2020 (55.54%). General toothbrushing, daily toothbrushing and minimum frequency of two times a day were dependent variables; the year was considered as the independent variable. In addition, other covariates such as geographical landscape, area of residence, place of residence, altitude, wealth index, health insurance cover, sex and age. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied. Results: General toothbrushing was 96.19% (n=51 013), daily toothbrushing was 87.47% (n=42 246) and minimum toothbrushing two times a day was 84.53% (n=33 957). In multivariate form, the year presented a negative association with daily toothbrushing (RPa: 0.97; CI95%: 0.96-0.98; p<0.001) and minimum toothbrushing two times a day (RPa: 0.97; CI95%: 0.95-0.98; p<0.001), adjusted for the previously associated co-variables. Conclusions: The year 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted daily toothbrushing and minimum twice-daily toothbrushing of Peruvian children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">MRI data harmonization across sites using ComBat enhances classification of meningioma and glioma brain-tumors in dogs: a case study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in clinical patients is often evaluated for diagnostic purposes. However, to develop a disease classifier, imaging data can be “noisy”, as in being heterogeneous (e.g., obtained from multiple sites), having significant crossover between normal and pathological processes, being highly imbalanced for the outcome variable (i.e., unequal numbers of cases and controls), or due to a lack of accurate quantitative analysis tools that are transferable, easily usable, and accurate to generate the final image variables for machine learning analyses. Methods: In this article, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ComBat harmonization of heterogeneous MRI data on dogs’ brains, collected across multiple sites, prior to using them in the random forest (RF) classifier to attempt to differentiate the meningioma and the glioma tumor-types. We consider three image variables generated from each of the brain scans and three clinical covariates – age, sex, and breedtype – for each subject. The scans are generated either at Colorado State University (CSU) or outside CSU. We compare the RF classifier performance in identifying the two tumor types, with and without preprocessing the data with ComBat site-specific harmonization. Results: The post-ComBat disease classification accuracy measures – sensitivity, specificity, and total accuracy – indicate an overall significant edge in the RF performance compared to their without-ComBat counterparts across different scenarios. Moreover, incorporating both the image variables and the clinical covariates in the RF model results in the highest total accuracy. Conclusions: Use of MRI data in combination with clinical covariates is more informative than using only clinical covariates in classifying meningioma and glioma brain-tumors in dogs. Moreover, as a preprocessing step for MRI data, we recommend adjusting for the site-specific variability using ComBat harmonization prior to performing downstream analyses, such as disease classification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Estimated number of deaths directly avoided because of COVID-19 vaccination among older adults in Colombia in 2021: an ecological, longitudinal observational study [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Colombia’s national COVID-19 vaccination plan began in February of 2021. It gave priority to older adults, who constituted 77.7% of deaths from this illness in the year 2020. The main goal of the plan is to decrease specific mortality and the number of serious COVID-19 cases, however, the number of deaths avoided by this strategy is unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of avoided deaths in Colombia by fully vaccinating older adults against COVID-19, during the first year of the implementation of the national vaccination plan. Methods: This study took on the design of an ecological, longitudinal study. Full vaccination coverage for older adults was calculated for each epidemiological week and age group from March to December 2021, based on which the number of avoided COVID-19 deaths was estimated. A sensitivity analysis was performed taking into account variations in the vaccines’ effectiveness by age group. Results: In Colombia, over 5.3 million adults 60 years of age and older received full COVID-19 vaccinations between March and December 2021. During that same period, nearly 46,000 deaths of older adults from this cause were registered. We estimated that vaccination has avoided around 22,000 more older adults from dying from COVID-19 in Colombia, that is, 32.4% of expected deaths in 2021. According to the sensitivity analysis, the number of lives saved ranged from 19,597 to 36,507. Conclusions: Colombia’s strategy to vaccinate older adults against COVID-19 has avoided mortality for this age group from being 48.0% higher than what was observed during the study period. Even more lives have been saved when taking into account the parameters that were defined and the omission of the contribution from partial vaccinations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mitochondrial haplogroup association with fasting glucose response in African Americans treated with a thiazide diuretic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hypertensive African Americans have a ~50% response rate to thiazide diuretic treatment. This contributes to a high prevalence of uncontrolled high blood pressure. Here, we examined the role of the mitochondrial genome on thiazide diuretic treatment response in hypertensive African Americans enrolled in a clinical trial. Methods: Participants from the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT, n= 4279) were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium Multi-Ethnic Beadchip. Haplotype groups were called using HaploGrep. We used a linear regression analysis to examine the association between mitochondrial haplogroups (L, M, and N) and changes in blood pressure and fasting glucose over six months and two years, respectively. Results: The analysis revealed a null association between mitochondrial haplogroups M and N versus L for each of the outcomes. In subgroup analysis, the L subclades L1, L2, and L3/L4 (versus L0) were each inversely associated with fasting glucose response (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This discovery analysis suggests the mitochondrial genome has a small effect on fasting glucose response, but not that of blood pressure, to thiazide diuretic treatment in African Americans.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A scoping review protocol on food handlers’ knowledge, attitude, and practices towards food hygiene and safety in low and middle-income countries [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Food safety and hygiene has emerged as the foremost cause of concern in recent time, especially post-pandemic and has changed the eating out behaviour of the consumers. Consumers often consider food safety and hygiene as one of the most prominent factors and hence it is important for food handlers to have adequate knowledge and the right attitude towards food safety and food hygiene. The review will summarise the evidence on food handlers’ behaviours towards food safety and hygiene and associated factors that inhibit positive behaviour towards following food safety protocols and standards. Methods:  This scoping review protocol is guided by updated methodology from Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). The search will be conducted on Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science. Google Scholar will be used to locate pertinent grey literature. A citation search will also be employed for identifying additional relevant studies. Quantitative and qualitative studies published from 2011- present will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen and extract the data. A third reviewer will be involved in resolving disagreements between reviewers. A two-stage screening including title/abstract and full-text will be conducted. Data extraction will be done using a pilot-tested data extraction form. The data extracted from included studies will be organised and presented using narrative synthesis. The review will also attempt to identify the unaddressed gaps in the literature with the available evidence. Ethics and dissemination: An ethical clearance is not required for this scoping review as findings from existing published literature will be summarised. The review findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and journal publications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Edge computing for Vehicle to Everything: a short review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Vehicle to Everything (V2X) communications and services have sparked considerable interest as a potential component of future Intelligent Transportation Systems. V2X serves to organise communication and interaction between vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle to pedestrians (V2P), and vehicle to networks (V2N). However, having multiple communication channels can generate a vast amount of data for processing and distribution. In addition, V2X services may be subject to performance requirements relating to dynamic handover and low latency communication channels. Good throughput, lower delay, and reliable packet delivery are the core requirements for V2X services.  Edge Computing (EC) may be a feasible option to address the challenge of dynamic handover and low latency to allow V2X information to be transmitted across vehicles. Currently, existing comparative studies do not cover the applicability of EC for V2X. This review explores EC approaches to determine the relevance for V2X communication and services. EC allows devices to carry out part or all of the data processing at the point where data is collected. The emphasis of this review is on several methods identified in the literature for implementing effective EC. We describe each method individually and compare them according to their applicability. The findings of this work indicate that most methods can simulate the EC positioning under predefined scenarios. These include the use of Mobile Edge Computing, Cloudlet, and Fog Computing. However, since most studies are carried out using simulation tools, there is a potential limitation in that crucial data in the search for EC positioning may be overlooked and ignored for bandwidth reduction. The EC approaches considered in this work are limited to the literature on the successful implementation of V2X communication and services. The outcome of this work could considerably help other researchers better characterise EC applicability for V2X communications and services.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multi-scale model suggests the trade-off between protein and ATP demand as a driver of metabolic changes during yeast replicative ageing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Barbara Schnitzer, Linnea Österberg, Iro Skopa, Marija Cvijovic</p>

The accumulation of protein damage is one of the major drivers of replicative ageing, describing a cell’s reduced ability to reproduce over time even under optimal conditions. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are precursors of protein damage and therefore tightly linked to ageing. At the same time, they are an inevitable by-product of the cell’s metabolism. Cells are able to sense high levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and can subsequently adapt their metabolism through gene regulation to slow down damage accumulation. However, the older or damaged a cell is the less flexibility it has to allocate enzymes across the metabolic network, forcing further adaptions in the metabolism. To investigate changes in the metabolism during replicative ageing, we developed an multi-scale mathematical model using budding yeast as a model organism. The model consists of three interconnected modules: a Boolean model of the signalling network, an enzyme-constrained flux balance model of the central carbon metabolism and a dynamic model of growth and protein damage accumulation with discrete cell divisions. The model can explain known features of replicative ageing, like average lifespan and increase in generation time during successive division, in yeast wildtype cells by a decreasing pool of functional enzymes and an increasing energy demand for maintenance. We further used the model to identify three consecutive metabolic phases, that a cell can undergo during its life, and their influence on the replicative potential, and proposed an intervention span for lifespan control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inverse folding based pre-training for the reliable identification of intrinsic transcription terminators</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vivian B. Brandenburg, Franz Narberhaus, Axel Mosig</p>

It is well-established that neural networks can predict or identify structural motifs of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Yet, the neural network based identification of RNA structural motifs is limited by the availability of training data that are often insufficient for learning features of specific ncRNA families or structural motifs. Aiming to reliably identify intrinsic transcription terminators in bacteria, we introduce a novel pre-training approach that uses inverse folding to generate training data for predicting or identifying a specific family or structural motif of ncRNA. We assess the ability of neural networks to identify secondary structure by systematic <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis experiments. In a study to identify intrinsic transcription terminators as functionally well-understood RNA structural motifs, our inverse folding based pre-training approach significantly boosts the performance of neural network topologies, which outperform previous approaches to identify intrinsic transcription terminators. Inverse-folding based pre-training provides a simple, yet highly effective way to integrate the well-established thermodynamic energy model into deep neural networks for identifying ncRNA families or motifs. The pre-training technique is broadly applicable to a range of network topologies as well as different types of ncRNA families and motifs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Trial-by-trial predictions of subjective time from human brain activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maxine T. Sherman, Zafeirios Fountas, Anil K. Seth, Warrick Roseboom</p>

Human experience of time exhibits systematic, context-dependent deviations from clock time; for example, time is experienced differently at work than on holiday. Here we test the proposal that differences from clock time in subjective experience of time arise because time estimates are constructed by accumulating the same quantity that guides perception: salient events. Healthy human participants watched naturalistic, silent videos of up to 24 seconds in duration and estimated their duration while fMRI was acquired. We were able to reconstruct trial-by-trial biases in participants’ duration reports, which reflect subjective experience of duration, purely from salient events in their visual cortex BOLD activity. By contrast, salient events in neither of two control regions–auditory and somatosensory cortex–were predictive of duration biases. These results held despite being able to (trivially) predict clock time from all three brain areas. Our results reveal that the information arising during perceptual processing of a dynamic environment provides a sufficient basis for reconstructing human subjective time duration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Sticky Pi is a high-frequency smart trap that enables the study of insect circadian activity under natural conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quentin Geissmann, Paul K. Abram, Di Wu, Cara H. Haney, Juli Carrillo</p>

In the face of severe environmental crises that threaten insect biodiversity, new technologies are imperative to monitor both the identity and ecology of insect species. Traditionally, insect surveys rely on manual collection of traps, which provide abundance data but mask the large intra- and interday variations in insect activity, an important facet of their ecology. Although laboratory studies have shown that circadian processes are central to insects’ biological functions, from feeding to reproduction, we lack the high-frequency monitoring tools to study insect circadian biology in the field. To address these issues, we developed the Sticky Pi, a novel, autonomous, open-source, insect trap that acquires images of sticky cards every 20 minutes. Using custom deep learning algorithms, we automatically and accurately scored where, when, and which insects were captured. First, we validated our device in controlled laboratory conditions with a classic chronobiological model organism, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Then, we deployed an array of Sticky Pis to the field to characterise the daily activity of an agricultural pest, <i>Drosophila suzukii</i>, and its parasitoid wasps. Finally, we demonstrate the wide scope of our smart trap by describing the sympatric arrangement of insect temporal niches in a community, without targeting particular taxa a priori. Together, the automatic identification and high sampling rate of our tool provide biologists with unique data that impacts research far beyond chronobiology, with applications to biodiversity monitoring and pest control as well as fundamental implications for phenology, behavioural ecology, and ecophysiology. We released the Sticky Pi project as an open community resource on https://doc.sticky-pi.com.

Early career researchers (ECRs) are important stakeholders leading efforts to catalyze systemic change in research culture and practice. Here, we summarize the outputs from a virtual unconventional conference (unconference), which brought together 54 invited experts from 20 countries with extensive experience in ECR initiatives designed to improve the culture and practice of science. Together, we drafted 2 sets of recommendations for (1) ECRs directly involved in initiatives or activities to change research culture and practice; and (2) stakeholders who wish to support ECRs in these efforts. Importantly, these points apply to ECRs working to promote change on a systemic level, not only those improving aspects of their own work. In both sets of recommendations, we underline the importance of incentivizing and providing time and resources for systems-level science improvement activities, including ECRs in organizational decision-making processes, and working to dismantle structural barriers to participation for marginalized groups. We further highlight obstacles that ECRs face when working to promote reform, as well as proposed solutions and examples of current best practices. The abstract and recommendations for stakeholders are available in Dutch, German, Greek (abstract only), Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Serbian.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pediatric malaria incidence and risk mapping in Sussundenga Municipality, Mozambique [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malaria is a parasitic borne disease that affects red blood cells. The disease is preventable, detectable and treatable and more common in poor resource settings. Malaria is undoubtedly one of the main public health concerns impacting families and the economy in Mozambique. Age category plays a significant important role in malaria occurrence and can affect the course and progression of the disease and correct treatment. Very few studies on pediatric malaria exists in Mozambique and the existing ones use a simplistic and coarse grouping. The knowledge of malaria pediatric incidence and, the need to evaluate the local heterogeneity by generating malaria risk maps can improve the understanding of pediatric malaria being the objective of this study.  Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using existing malaria positive data from 2018 to 2019 at Rural Sussundenga Hospital (RSH) in Sussundenga municipality. Attributable factors of the disease and incidence were calculated. Proportion of gender, age category and location were tested using G test. For malaria risk mapping, ten malaria factors (anthropic, sociodemographic, climatic and clinic) were used to produce two maps: one using malaria incidence and other without. Bioclimatic, Diva GIS 7.4.0 and, Landsat 8 image were used to produce the map.  Results: The findings revealed that of the 42,248 patients who visited the local hospital f, 51.2% tested positive for malaria with an incidence of 45.7 per 100 persons. There is a difference between residential areas in malaria incidence, with both maps showing malaria risk in Nhamazara, Nhamarenza and Unidade communities.   Conclusions: This implies that malaria high risk areas seem to be located in high populated areas and areas close to water bodies. Relevant information is provided for effective planning in malaria intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Decreased Frontal Gamma Activity in Alzheimer Disease Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In Alzheimer disease (AD) animal models, synaptic dysfunction has recently been linked to a disorder of high-frequency neuronal activity. In patients, a clear relation between AD and oscillatory activity remains elusive. Here, we attempt to shed light on this relation by using a novel approach combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to probe oscillatory activity in specific hubs of the frontoparietal network in a sample of 60 mild-to-moderate AD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sixty mild-to-moderate AD patients and 21 age-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) underwent 3 TMS-EEG sessions to assess cortical oscillations over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the left posterior parietal cortex. To investigate the relations between oscillatory activity, cortical plasticity, and cognitive decline, AD patients underwent a TMS-based neurophysiological characterization and a cognitive evaluation at baseline. The latter was repeated after 24 weeks to monitor clinical evolution.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AD patients showed a significant reduction of frontal gamma activity as compared to age-matched HVs. In addition, AD patients with a more prominent decrease of frontal gamma activity showed a stronger impairment of long-term potentiation–like plasticity and a more pronounced cognitive decline at subsequent follow-up evaluation at 24 weeks.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data provide novel evidence that frontal lobe gamma activity is dampened in AD patients. The current results point to the TMS-EEG approach as a promising technique to measure individual frontal gamma activity in patients with AD. This index could represent a useful biomarker to predict disease progression and to evaluate response to novel pharmacological therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance of Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient-Generated Global Subjective Assessment in screening for cancer-related malnutrition in Nairobi, Kenya [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malnutrition is a common feature among oncology patients. It is responsible for poor response and tolerance to anticancer therapy, increased morbidity, and mortality. More than half of malnourished cancer patients remain undetected owing to lack of effective screening. Body mass index is the main indicator for assessing malnutrition in Kenyan public hospitals. However, it underestimates weight loss in patients with chronic illnesses. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment have been widely used in research and clinical practice and have both reported good validity and reliability. However, their diagnostic evaluation has not been performed in Kenya. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 138 and 76 cancer outpatients from Kenyatta National Hospital and Texas cancer treatment centres, respectively. Participants had a confirmed disease, stage 1-4 cancer, and aged 18 years and above. They were screened for malnutrition using both Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment. A separate study questionnaire was utilized to gather participant’s socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. A Bayesian latent class modelling framework was employed to infer the tests’ estimates based on participants ‘cumulative scores from the two tests. Results: The cut-off value of ≥ 1 and ≥ 4 gave the best combination of sensitivity and specificity of Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment. Both tests yielded statistically similar sensitivities and specificities. Predictive values were comparable between the tests and across the two populations. The posterior median true prevalences of malnutrition were high (˃ 54%) and numerically similar between the studied populations. Conclusions: The performance of both tests among patients with cancer is similar. Healthcare workers are therefore at liberty to use either of them to inform treatment. Given the high true prevalence of cancer-related malnutrition, routine screening is critical and should be included as part of cancer care.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Intravenous Thrombolysis with Tenecteplase for the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with tenecteplase has been associated with better clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with confirmed large vessel occlusions compared to IVT with alteplase. However, the utility of tenecteplase for the treatment of all AIS patients eligible for IVT has not been established.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase versus alteplase in AIS patients by analyzing propensity score matched data from 20 centers participating in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke–International Stroke Thrombolysis Register. Patients receiving IVT with tenecteplase were matched with up to 3 patients receiving alteplase from the same center. The primary outcome of interest was the distribution of 3-month functional outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the rates of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) in the first 24 hours, excellent (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score = 0–1) or good (mRS score = 0–2) functional outcome, and all-cause mortality at 3 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 331 tenecteplase-treated AIS patients were matched to 797 patients treated with alteplase (median age = 70 years, 43.9% women, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score = 11, interquartile range = 6–17). Patients treated with tenecteplase had better 3-month functional outcomes (common odds ratio [OR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18–2.00) with higher odds of good functional outcome (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.45–2.77) and a lower likelihood of all-cause mortality (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.27–0.67) at 3 months, compared to alteplase-treated patients. No difference was found in the likelihood of the 3-month excellent functional outcomes (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.96–1.78) and 24-hour SICH (1.0% vs 1.3%, OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.20–2.64).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IVT with tenecteplase was associated with better 3-month clinical outcomes compared to IVT with alteplase in AIS patients, with no increased risk of symptomatic intracranial bleeding. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                It has long been proposed that the thalamus serves as a dynamic gate for control of sensory signaling to cortex through switching between tonic and burst firing modes. Using optogenetic manipulation in the awake mouse, Borden et al. demonstrate a thalamic burst-driven, timing-based gating of sensory signaling to the cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">The generation of stem cell-like memory cells early after BNT162b2 vaccination is associated with the durability of memory CD8+ T-cell responses</a></h4>

              
                The longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells elicited by BNT162b2 has yet to be fully understood. Jung et al. demonstrate that early generation of TSCM cells after vaccination determines the durability of spike-specific memory CD8+ T cells. This early generation of TSCM cells negatively correlates with age.

                <p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 07 July 2022; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01117-2">doi:10.1038/s41593-022-01117-2</a></p>A new study shows that infra-slow cortical norepinephrine oscillations shape the micro-structure of sleep and transitions to micro-arousals, wakefulness or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Prolonged descending phases of these oscillations promote the occurrence of spindle-rich intermediate sleep, which is involved in memory consolidation.

                Analysis of the content of medical journals enables us to frame the shifting scientific, material, ethical, and epistemic underpinnings of medicine over time, including today. Leveraging a dataset comprised of nearly half-a-million articles published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> (<i>JAMA</i>) and the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> (<i>NEJM</i>) over the past 200 years, we (a) highlight the evolution of medical language, and its manifestations in shifts of usage and meaning, (b) examine traces of the medical profession’s changing self-identity over time, reflected in its shifting ethical and epistemic underpinnings, (c) analyze medicine’s material underpinnings and how we describe where medicine is practiced, (d) demonstrate how the occurrence of specific disease terms within the journals reflects the changing burden of disease itself over time and the interests and perspectives of authors and editors, and (e) showcase how this dataset can allow us to explore the evolution of modern medical ideas and further our understanding of how modern disease concepts came to be, and of the retained legacies of prior embedded values.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The relative binding position of Nck and Grb2 adaptors impacts actin-based motility of Vaccinia virus</a></h4>

              
                Phosphotyrosine (pTyr) motifs in unstructured polypeptides orchestrate important cellular processes by engaging SH2-containing adaptors to assemble complex signalling networks. The concept of phase separation has recently changed our appreciation of multivalent networks, however, the role of pTyr motif positioning in their function remains to be explored. We have now investigated this parameter in the operation of the signalling cascade driving actin-based motility and spread of Vaccinia virus. This network involves two pTyr motifs in the viral protein A36 that recruit the adaptors Nck and Grb2 upstream of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization. Manipulating the position of pTyr motifs in A36 and the unrelated p14 from Orthoreovirus, we find that only specific spatial arrangements of Nck and Grb2 binding sites result in robust N-WASP recruitment, Arp2/3 complex driven actin polymerization and viral spread. This suggests that the relative position of pTyr adaptor binding sites is optimised for signal output. This finding may explain why the relative positions of pTyr motifs are frequently conserved in proteins from widely different species. It also has important implications for regulation of physiological networks, including those undergoing phase transitions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The influence of biological, epidemiological, and treatment factors on the establishment and spread of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum</a></h4>

              
                The effectiveness of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to treat <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria is threatened by resistance. The complex interplay between sources of selective pressure—treatment properties, biological factors, transmission intensity, and access to treatment—obscures understanding how, when, and why resistance establishes and spreads across different locations. We developed a disease modelling approach with emulator-based global sensitivity analysis to systematically quantify which of these factors drive establishment and spread of drug resistance. Drug resistance was more likely to evolve in low transmission settings due to the lower levels of (i) immunity and (ii) within-host competition between genotypes. Spread of parasites resistant to artemisinin partner drugs depended on the period of low drug concentration (known as the selection window). Spread of partial artemisinin resistance was slowed with prolonged parasite exposure to artemisinin derivatives and accelerated when the parasite was also resistant to the partner drug. Thus, to slow the spread of partial artemisinin resistance, molecular surveillance should be supported to detect resistance to partner drugs and to change ACTs accordingly. Furthermore, implementing more sustainable artemisinin-based therapies will require extending parasite exposure to artemisinin derivatives, and mitigating the selection windows of partner drugs, which could be achieved by including an additional long-acting drug.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The E3 ligase Thin controls homeostatic plasticity through neurotransmitter release repression</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic proteins and synaptic transmission are under homeostatic control, but the relationship between these two processes remains enigmatic. Here, we systematically investigated the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases, key regulators of protein degradation-mediated proteostasis, in presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP). An electrophysiology-based genetic screen of 157 E3 ligase-encoding genes at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction identified <i>thin</i>, an ortholog of human <i>tripartite motif-containing 32</i> (<i>TRIM32</i>), a gene implicated in several neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. We demonstrate that <i>thin</i> functions presynaptically during rapid and sustained PHP. Presynaptic <i>thin</i> negatively regulates neurotransmitter release under baseline conditions by limiting the number of release-ready vesicles, largely independent of gross morphological defects. We provide genetic evidence that <i>thin</i> controls release through <i>dysbindin</i>, a schizophrenia-susceptibility gene required for PHP. Thin and Dysbindin localize in proximity within presynaptic boutons, and Thin degrades Dysbindin <i>in vitro</i>. Thus, the E3 ligase Thin links protein degradation-dependent proteostasis of Dysbindin to homeostatic regulation of neurotransmitter release.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adding a One Health approach to a research framework for minority health and health disparities</a></h4>

              
                The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) has developed a framework to guide and orient research into health disparities and minority health. The framework depicts different domains of influence (such as biological and behavioral) and different levels of influence (such as individual and interpersonal). Here, influenced by the “One Health” approach, we propose adding two new levels of influence – interspecies and planetary <i>–</i> to this framework to reflect the interconnected nature of human, animal, and environmental health. Extending the framework in this way will help researchers to create new avenues of inquiry and encourage multidisciplinary collaborations. We then use the One Health approach to discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health disparities, and show how the expanded framework can be applied to research into health disparities related to antimicrobial resistance and obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An entropic safety catch controls Hepatitis C virus entry and antibody resistance</a></h4>

              
                E1 and E2 (E1E2), the fusion proteins of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), are unlike that of any other virus yet described, and the detailed molecular mechanisms of HCV entry/fusion remain unknown. Hypervariable region-1 (HVR-1) of E2 is a putative intrinsically disordered protein tail. Here, we demonstrate that HVR-1 has an autoinhibitory function that suppresses the activity of E1E2 on free virions; this is dependent on its conformational entropy. Thus, HVR-1 is akin to a safety catch that prevents premature triggering of E1E2 activity. Crucially, this mechanism is turned off by host receptor interactions at the cell surface to allow entry. Mutations that reduce conformational entropy in HVR-1, or genetic deletion of HVR-1, turn off the safety catch to generate hyper-reactive HCV that exhibits enhanced virus entry but is thermally unstable and acutely sensitive to neutralising antibodies. Therefore, the HVR-1 safety catch controls the efficiency of virus entry and maintains resistance to neutralising antibodies. This discovery provides an explanation for the ability of HCV to persist in the face of continual immune assault and represents a novel regulatory mechanism that is likely to be found in other viral fusion machinery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Predictions and experimental tests of a new biophysical model of the mammalian respiratory oscillator</a></h4>

              
                Previously our computational modeling studies (Phillips et al., 2019) proposed that neuronal persistent sodium current (I<sub>NaP</sub>) and calcium-activated non-selective cation current (I<sub>CAN</sub>) are key biophysical factors that, respectively, generate inspiratory rhythm and burst pattern in the mammalian preBötzinger complex (preBötC) respiratory oscillator isolated in vitro. Here, we experimentally tested and confirmed three predictions of the model from new simulations concerning the roles of I<sub>NaP</sub> and I<sub>CAN</sub>: (1) I<sub>NaP</sub> and I<sub>CAN</sub> blockade have opposite effects on the relationship between network excitability and preBötC rhythmic activity; (2) I<sub>NaP</sub> is essential for preBötC rhythmogenesis; and (3) I<sub>CAN</sub> is essential for generating the amplitude of rhythmic output but not rhythm generation. These predictions were confirmed via optogenetic manipulations of preBötC network excitability during graded I<sub>NaP</sub> or I<sub>CAN</sub> blockade by pharmacological manipulations in slices in vitro containing the rhythmically active preBötC from the medulla oblongata of neonatal mice. Our results support and advance the hypothesis that I<sub>NaP</sub> and I<sub>CAN</sub> mechanistically underlie rhythm and inspiratory burst pattern generation, respectively, in the isolated preBötC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatially bivariate EEG-neurofeedback can manipulate interhemispheric inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Human behavior requires interregional crosstalk to employ the sensorimotor processes in the brain. Although external neuromodulation techniques have been used to manipulate interhemispheric sensorimotor activity, a central controversy concerns whether this activity can be volitionally controlled. Experimental tools lack the power to up- or down-regulate the state of the targeted hemisphere over a large dynamic range and, therefore, cannot evaluate the possible volitional control of the activity. We addressed this difficulty by using the recently developed method of spatially bivariate electroencephalography (EEG)-neurofeedback to systematically enable the participants to modulate their bilateral sensorimotor activities. Herein, we report that participants learn to up- and down-regulate the ipsilateral excitability to the imagined hand while maintaining constant the contralateral excitability; this modulates the magnitude of interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) assessed by the paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) paradigm. Further physiological analyses revealed that the manipulation capability of IHI magnitude reflected interhemispheric connectivity in EEG and TMS, which was accompanied by intrinsic bilateral cortical oscillatory activities. Our results show an interesting approach for neuromodulation, which might identify new treatment opportunities, for example, in patients suffering from a stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The giant staphylococcal protein Embp facilitates colonization of surfaces through Velcro-like attachment to fibrillated fibronectin</a></h4>

              
                <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> causes some of the most hard-to-treat clinical infections by forming biofilms: Multicellular communities of bacteria encased in a protective matrix, supporting immune evasion and tolerance against antibiotics. Biofilms occur most commonly on medical implants, and a key event in implant colonization is the robust adherence to the surface, facilitated by interactions between bacterial surface proteins and host matrix components. <i>S. epidermidis</i> is equipped with a giant adhesive protein, Embp, which facilitates bacterial interactions with surface-deposited, but not soluble fibronectin. The structural basis behind this selective binding process has remained obscure. Using a suite of single-cell and single-molecule analysis techniques, we show that <i>S. epidermidis</i> is capable of such distinction because Embp binds specifically to fibrillated fibronectin on surfaces, while ignoring globular fibronectin in solution. <i>S. epidermidis</i> adherence is critically dependent on multi-valent interactions involving 50 fibronectin-binding repeats of Embp. This unusual, Velcro-like interaction proved critical for colonization of surfaces under high flow, making this newly identified attachment mechanism particularly relevant for colonization of intravascular devices, such as prosthetic heart valves or vascular grafts. Other biofilm-forming pathogens, such as <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, express homologs of Embp and likely deploy the same mechanism for surface colonization. Our results may open for a novel direction in efforts to combat devastating, biofilm-associated infections, as the development of implant materials that steer the conformation of adsorbed proteins is a much more manageable task than avoiding protein adsorption altogether.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Regionally distinct trophoblast regulate barrier function and invasion in the human placenta</a></h4>

              
                The human placenta contains two specialized regions: the villous chorion where gases and nutrients are exchanged between maternal and fetal blood, and the smooth chorion which surrounds more than 70% of the developing fetus but whose cellular composition and function is poorly understood. Here, we use single cell RNA sequencing to compare the cell types and molecular programs between these two regions in the second trimester human placenta. Each region consists of progenitor cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) with similar gene expression programs. While CTBs in the villous chorion differentiate into syncytiotrophoblasts, they take an alternative trajectory in the smooth chorion producing a previously unknown CTB population which we term smooth-chorion-specific CTBs (SC-CTBs). Marked by expression of region-specific cytokeratins, the SC-CTBs form a stratified epithelium above a basal layer of progenitor CTBs. They express epidermal and metabolic transcriptional programs consistent with a primary role in defense against physical stress and pathogens. Additionally, we show that SC-CTBs closely associate with EVTs and secrete factors that inhibit the migration of the EVTs. This restriction of EVT migration is in striking contrast to the villous region where EVTs migrate away from the chorion and invade deeply into the decidua. Together, these findings greatly expand our understanding of CTB differentiation in these distinct regions of the human placenta. This knowledge has broad implications for studies of the development, functions, and diseases of the human placenta.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Morphogenetic forces planar polarize LGN/Pins in the embryonic head during Drosophila gastrulation</a></h4>

              
                Spindle orientation is often achieved by a complex of Partner of Inscuteable (Pins)/LGN, Mushroom Body Defect (Mud)/Nuclear Mitotic Apparatus (NuMa), Gαi, and Dynein, which interacts with astral microtubules to rotate the spindle. Cortical Pins/LGN recruitment serves as a critical step in this process. Here, we identify Pins-mediated planar cell polarized divisions in several of the mitotic domains of the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. We found that neither planar cell polarity pathways nor planar polarized myosin localization determined division orientation; instead, our findings strongly suggest that Pins planar polarity and force generated from mesoderm invagination are important. Disrupting Pins polarity via overexpression of a myristoylated version of Pins caused randomized division angles. We found that disrupting forces through chemical inhibitors, depletion of an adherens junction protein, or blocking mesoderm invagination disrupted Pins planar polarity and spindle orientation. Furthermore, directional ablations that separated mesoderm from mitotic domains disrupted spindle orientation, suggesting that forces transmitted from mesoderm to mitotic domains can polarize Pins and orient division during gastrulation. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo example where mechanical force has been shown to polarize Pins to mediate division orientation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A multi-pronged human microglia response to Alzheimer's disease Aβ pathology</a></h4>

              
                Microglial activation and neuroinflammation are initial steps in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, studies in mouse models and human postmortem samples have yielded divergent results regarding microglia cell states relevant to AD. Here, we investigate 127,000 single cell expression profiles of human microglia isolated freshly from a xenotransplantation model for early AD. While human microglia adopt a disease-associated (DAM) profile, they display a much more pronounced HLA-cell state related to antigen presentation in response to amyloid plaques. In parallel, a distinctive pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine CRM response is mounted against oligomeric amyloid-{beta}. TREM2 and, to a lesser extent, APOE polymorphisms, modulate the response of microglia to amyloid-b plaques, in contrast with the response to oligomeric A{beta}. Specific polygenic risk genes are enriched in each branch of these multi-pronged response of human microglia to amyloid pathology (ARM). ARM responses can be captured in post-mortem studies when reanalyzed in light of this novel, comprehensive data set. In conclusion, therapeutic strategies targeting microglia in AD need to carefully assess how they affect the different cell states, as the overall balance between distinct microglial profiles might determine a protective or damaging outcome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamics of a sleep homeostat observed in glia during behavior</a></h4>

              
                An animal's need to sleep grows with time spent awake and decays again during sleep. In the brain, a homeostatic process or signal has been proposed to represent sleep need, steadily increasing during wakefulness and gradually decreasing during sleep. However, such dynamics of a sleep homeostat, capturing the changing need to sleep in real time depending on behavior, has so far not been observed in identified cells. Here, using a system that we developed for monitoring calcium activity over multiple days in head-fixed, walking fruit flies, we find that a class of glia in the fly brain, called ensheathing glia, shows dynamics expected of a sleep homeostat. Calcium levels in these cells - monitored in a central brain area important for memory, navigation and sleep - integrate activity during wakefulness, reset during sleep, and saturate under sleep deprivation. Optogenetic activation of ensheathing glia induces sleep consistent with charging of the homeostat. The dynamics of the sleep homeostat, observed in glia of different brain compartments with similar but distinct dynamics, agree with conceptual model expectations. Ensheathing glia therefore act as a system for sleep control distributed across brain areas. The structural arrangement of these glia suggests that sleep homeostasis differentially impacts large ensembles of cells at the same time.

                Neuronal rhythmogenesis in the spinal cord is correlated with variations in extracellular K+ levels ([K+]e). Astrocytes play important role in[K+]e homeostasis and compute neuronal information. Yet it is unclear how neuronal oscillations are regulated by astrocytic K+ homeostasis. Here we identify the astrocytic inward-rectifying K+ channel Kir4.1 (a.k.a. Kcnj10) as a key molecular player for neuronal rhythmicity in the spinal central pattern generator (CPG). By combining two-photon calcium imaging with electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry and genetic tools, we report that astrocytes display Ca2+ transients before and during oscillations of neighbouring neurons. Inhibition of astrocytic Ca2+ transients with BAPTA decreases the barium-sensitive Kir4.1 current responsible of K+ clearance. Finally, we show in mice that Kir4.1 knockdown in astrocytes progressively prevents neuronal oscillations and alters the locomotor pattern resulting in lower motor performances in challenging tasks. These data identify astroglial Kir4.1 channels as key regulators of neuronal rhythmogenesis in the CPG driving locomotion.

                The human brain extracts statistical regularities from the surrounding environment in a process referred to as statistical learning. Recent behavioural evidence suggests that developmental dyslexia affects statistical learning. However, surprisingly few neurophysiological studies have assessed how developmental dyslexia affects the neural processing underlying statistical learning. In this study, we used electroencephalography to explore the neural correlates of an important aspect of statistical learning, sensitivity to transitional probabilities, in individuals with developmental dyslexia. Adults diagnosed with developmental dyslexia (n = 17) and controls (n = 19) were exposed to a continuous stream of sound triplets in which a few triplet endings were location deviants (i.e., were presented from an unexpected speaker direction) or statistical deviants (i.e., had a low transitional probability given the triplet's first two sounds). Location deviants elicited a large location mismatch negativity (MMN), which was larger in controls than dyslexics. Statistical deviants elicited a small, yet significant statistical MMN (sMMN) in controls, whereas the dyslexic individuals did not exhibit a statistical MMN. These results suggest that the neural mechanisms underlying statistical learning are impaired in developmental dyslexia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Asymmetric voltage attenuation in dendrites enables hierarchical heterosynaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Long-term synaptic plasticity has been shown to be mediated via calcium concentration ([Ca2+]). Using a synaptic model which implements calcium-based long-term plasticity via two sources of Ca2+, NMDA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), we show in dendritic cable simulations that the interplay between these two calcium sources can result in a diverse array of heterosynaptic effects. When spatially clustered synaptic input produces an NMDA spike, the resulting dendritic depolarization can activate VGCCs at other spines, resulting in heterosynaptic plasticity. Importantly, NMDA spike activation at a given dendritic location will tend to depolarize dendritic regions that are located distally to the input site more than dendritic sites that are proximal to it. This dendritic asymmetry results in a hierarchical heterosynaptic plasticity effect in branching dendrites, where clustered inputs to a proximal branch induce heterosynaptic plasticity primarily at branches that are distal to it. We also explore how simultaneously activated synaptic clusters located at different dendritic locations synergistically affect each other as well as the heterosynaptic plasticity of an inactive synapse "sandwiched" between them. We conclude that dendrites enable a sophisticated form of plastic supervision wherein NMDA spike induction can be spatially targeted to produce plasticity at specific dendritic regions.

                The human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) is highly connected to integrate visual perceptual inputs with feedback from cognitive and emotional networks. In this study, we used electrical brain stimulation to understand how different inputs from multiple brain regions drive unique electrophysiological responses in the VTC. We recorded intracranial EEG data in 6 patients implanted with intracranial electrodes for epilepsy surgery evaluation. Pairs of electrodes were stimulated with single pulse electrical stimulation, and corticocortical evoked potential (CCEP) responses were measured at electrodes in the collateral sulcus and lateral occipitotemporal sulcus of the VTC. Using a novel unsupervised machine learning method, we uncovered 2 to 4 distinct response shapes, termed basis profile curves (BPCs), at each recording electrode in the 11 to 500 ms post-stimulation interval. CCEPs of unique shape and high amplitude were elicited following stimulation of several regions and classified into a set of four consensus BPCs across subjects. One of the consensus BPCs was primarily elicited by stimulation of the hippocampus; another by stimulation of the amygdala; a third by stimulation of lateral cortical sites, such as the middle temporal gyrus; and the final one by stimulation of multiple distributed sites. Stimulation also produced sustained high frequency power decreases and low frequency power increases that spanned multiple BPC categories. Characterizing distinct shapes in stimulation responses provides a novel description of connectivity to the VTC and reveals significant differences in input from cortical and limbic structures.

                Natural fluctuations in cardiac activity influence brain activity associated with sensory stimuli and affect perceptual decisions about low magnitude, near-threshold stimuli. However, little is known about the impact of fluctuations in heart activity on other internal representations. Here we investigate cardiac influences on learning-related internal representations: the absolute and signed prediction errors. By combining machine learning techniques with electroencephalography (EEG) and both simple, direct indices of task performance and computational model-derived indices of learning, we demonstrate that just as people are more sensitive to low magnitude, near threshold sensory stimuli in certain cardiac phases, so are they more sensitive to low magnitude absolute prediction errors in the same cycles. Importantly, however, this occurs even when the low magnitude prediction errors are associated with clearly suprathreshold sensory events. In addition, participants exhibiting stronger difference in their prediction errors representations between cardiac cycles exhibited higher learning rates and greater task accuracy.

                Ca2+-triggered exocytosis is a crucial aspect of neuronal and neuroendocrine cell function, yet many of the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate these processes are unknown. Here, we contrast the biophysical properties of two prominent neuronal Ca2+ sensors, synaptotagmin (syt) 1 and syt7. In both proteins, four Ca2+-binding loops partially penetrate bilayers that harbor anionic phospholipids, and mutagenesis studies suggest that these interactions are important for function. However, these mutations also alter the interaction of syts with the SNARE proteins that directly catalyze membrane fusion. To directly assess the role of syt membrane penetration, we took a different approach and found that Ca2+-syt1-membrane interactions are strongly influenced by membrane order; tight lateral packing of phosphatidylserine abrogates syt1 binding to lipid bilayers due to impaired membrane penetration. Function could be restored by making the membrane penetration loops more hydrophobic, or by inclusion of cholesterol. In sharp contrast, syt7 unexpectedly exhibited robust membrane binding and penetration activity, regardless of the lipid acyl chain structure. Thus, syt7 is a 'super-penetrator'. We exploited these observations to specifically isolate and examine the role of membrane penetration in syt function. By altering bilayer composition, rather than protein structure, we disentangled the roles of syt-membrane versus syt-SNARE interactions. Using nanodisc-black lipid membrane electrophysiology, we demonstrate that membrane penetration underlies the ability of syts to directly regulate reconstituted, exocytic fusion pores in response to Ca2+.

                Trauma, vascular events or neurodegenerative processes can lead to axonal injury and eventually transection (axotomy). Excessive water entry into injured neurons poses a particular threat since it may result in cytotoxic swelling and death. Neurons can survive axotomy, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Using in vitro and in vivo neurotrauma model systems based on laser transection we demonstrated that axotomy triggers actomyosin contraction coupled with calpain activity. As a consequence, neurons shrink acutely to force water through aquaporin channels preventing swelling and burst. Inhibiting shrinkage increases the probability of death of injured neurons by about three fold. This study reveales a first-line cytoprotective response mechanism to neurotrauma and offers a fresh perspective on pathophysiological processes in the nervous system.

                The posterodorsal subnucleus of the medial amygdala (MePD) is an upstream modulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes. Inhibition of MePD urocortin-3 (Ucn3) neurons prevents psychological stress-induced suppression of LH pulsatility while blocking the stress-induced elevations in corticosterone (CORT) secretion in female mice. We explore the neurotransmission and neural circuitry suppressing the GnRH pulse generator by MePD Ucn3 neurons and we further investigate whether MePD Ucn3 efferent projections to the PVN control CORT secretion and LH pulsatility. Ucn3-cre-tdTomato female ovariectomised (OVX) mice were unilaterally injected with AAV-ChR2 and implanted with optofluid cannulae targeting the MePD. We optically activated Ucn3 neurons in the MePD with blue light at 10Hz and monitored the effect on LH pulses. Next, we combined optogenetic stimulation of MePD Ucn3 neurons with pharmacological antagonism of GABAA or GABAB receptors with bicuculline or CGP, respectively, as well as a combination of NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists, AP5 and CNQX respectively, and observed the effect on pulsatile LH secretion. A separate group of Ucn3-cre-tdTomato OVX mice with oestradiol replacement were unilaterally injected with AAV-ChR2 in the MePD and implanted with fibreoptic cannulae targeting the PVN. We optically stimulated MePD Ucn3 neuron terminals with blue light at 20Hz and monitored the effect on CORT secretion and LH pulses. We reveal for the first time that activation of Ucn3 neurons in the MePD inhibits GnRH pulse generator frequency via GABA and glutamate signalling within the MePD, while MePD Ucn3 projections to the PVN modulate the HPG and HPA axes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conjunctive and complementary CA1 hippocampal cell populations relate sensory events to immobility and locomotion</a></h4>

              
                The way in which the brain decodes signals from sensory activity related to ongoing behavior has revolutionized the understanding of the function of neocortical areas and provides a blueprint to address allocortical regions such as the hippocampus. Here two-photon calcium imaging of somal activity in hippocampal CA1 neuron populations was done in head fixed mice given air or light stimulation when at rest or when moving on a conveyor belt. Air stimulation was also used to induce running for a fixed distance on the conveyor belt by releasing a conveyor belt brake. Overall, 99% of 2083 cells were active across 20 sensorimotor events with a larger proportion of cells active during locomotion. Nevertheless, for any sensorimotor event, only about 17% cells were active comprising of conjunctive (C [isin] A and B) cells shared among events and complementary (C [isin] A not B or C [isin] B not A) cells active in individual events. Conjunctive cells identified similar sensorimotor events representing stable representations of familiar experiences and complementary cells suggested recruitment of new cells for encoding novel experiences. The moment-to-moment recruitment of complementary and conjunctive cells with changing sensorimotor events signifies the involvement of hippocampus in functional networks integrating sensory information with ongoing movement. This role of hippocampus is well suited for movement guidance, spatial behavior, episodic learning and memory, context representation and scene construction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meditators probably show increased behaviour-monitoring related neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Mindfulness meditation is associated with better attention function. Performance monitoring and error-processing are important aspects of attention. We investigated whether experienced meditators showed different neural activity related to performance monitoring and error-processing. Previous research has produced inconsistent results. This study used more rigorous analyses and a larger sample to resolve the inconsistencies. Methods: We used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) following correct and incorrect responses to a Go/Nogo task from 27 experienced meditators and 27 non-meditators. Results: No differences were found in the ERN (all p > 0.05). Meditators showed larger global field potentials (GFP) in the Pe after both correct responses and errors, indicating stronger neural responses (p = 0.0190, FDR-p = 0.152, np2 = 0.0951, BFincl = 2.691). This effect did not pass multiple comparison controls. However, single electrode analysis of the Pe did pass multiple comparison controls (p = 0.002, FDR-p = 0.016, np2 = 0.133, BFincl = 220.659). Meditators also showed a significantly larger Pe GFP for errors only, which would have passed multiple comparison controls, but was not a primary analysis (p = 0.0028, np2 = 0.1493, BF10 = 9.999). Conclusions: Meditation may strengthen neural responses related to performance monitoring (measured by the Pe), but not specifically to error monitoring (although measurements of the Pe after errors may be more sensitive to group differences). However, only the single electrode analysis passed multiple comparison controls, while analysis including all electrodes did not, so this conclusion remains tentative.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An amino-terminal fragment of apolipoprotein E4 leads to behavioral deficits, increased PHF-1 immunoreactivity, and mortality in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Although the increased risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with the inheritance of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele is well characterized, the molecular underpinnings of how ApoE4 imparts risk remains unknown. Enhanced proteolysis of the ApoE4 protein with a toxic-gain of function has been suggested and a 17 kDa amino-terminal ApoE4 fragment (nApoE41-151) has been identified in post-mortem human AD frontal cortex sections. Recently, we demonstrated in vitro, exogenous treatment of nApoE41-151 in BV2 microglial cells leads to uptake, trafficking to the nucleus and increased expression of genes associated with cell toxicity and inflammation. In the present study, we extend these findings to zebrafish (Danio rerio), which is an emerging in vivo model system to study AD. Exogenous treatment of nApoE41-151 to 24-hour post-fertilization for 24 hours resulted in significant mortality. In addition, developmental abnormalities were observed following treatment with nApoE41-151 including improper folding of the hindbrain, delay in ear development, deformed yolk sac, enlarged cardiac cavity, and significantly lower heart rates. Decreased presence of pigmentation was noted for nApoE41-151 treated fish compared with controls. Behaviorally, touch-evoked responses to stimulus were negatively impacted by treatment with nApoE41-151. A similar nApoE31-151 fragment that differs by a single amino acid change (C>R) at position 112 had no effects on these parameters under identical treatment conditions. Additionally, triple-labeling confocal microscopy not only confirmed the nuclear localization of the nApoE41-151 fragment within neuronal populations following exogenous treatment, but also identified the presence of tau pathology, one of the hallmark features of AD. Collectively, these in vivo data demonstrating toxicity as well as sublethal effects on organ and tissue development support a novel pathophysiological function of this AD associated-risk factor.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Highly fucosylated N-glycans at the synaptic vesicle and neuronal plasma membrane</a></h4>

              
                At neuronal synapses, synaptic vesicles (SVs) require glycoproteins for normal trafficking, and N-linked glycosylation is required for delivery of the major SV glycoproteins synaptophysin and SV2A to SVs. The molecular compositions of SV N-glycans, which may drive important neurobiological processes, are largely unknown. In this study, we combined organelle isolation techniques, fluorescence detection of N-glycans, and high-resolution mass spectrometry to characterize N-glycosylation at synapses and SVs from mouse brain. Detecting over 2,500 unique glycopeptides from over 550 glycoproteins, we found that abundant SV proteins harbor N-glycans with fucose on their complex antennae, and we identify a highly fucosylated N-glycan enriched in SVs as compared to synaptosomes. Antennary fucosylation was also characteristic of plasma membrane proteins and cell adhesion molecules with established roles in synaptic function and development. Our results represent the first defined N-glycoproteome of a neuronal organelle and raise new questions in the glycobiology of synaptic pruning and neuroinflammation.

                Sensory neurons of the vagus nerve monitor distention and stretch in the gastrointestinal tract. Major efforts are underway to assign physiological functions to the many distinct subtypes of vagal sensory neurons. Here, we used genetically guided anatomical tracing, optogenetics and electrophysiology to identify and characterize three vagal sensory neuronal subtypes expressing Prox2 and Runx3. We show that these neuronal subtypes innervate the esophagus and stomach where they display regionalized innervation patterns. Their electrophysiological analysis showed that they are all low threshold mechanoreceptors, but possess different adaptation properties. Lastly, genetic ablation of Prox2+ and Runx3+ neurons demonstrated their essential roles for esophageal peristalsis and swallowing in freely behaving animals. Our work reveals the identity and function of the vagal neurons that provide mechanosensory feedback from the esophagus to the brain, and could lead to better understanding and treatment of esophageal motility disorders.

                Using high resolution quantitative mass spectrometry we have generated in-depth proteome maps of human and mouse ex vivo and in vitro microglia. We reveal a tenfold difference in protein content of ex vivo and in vitro cells and fundamental differences in protein expression related to protein synthesis, metabolism, microglia markers and environmental sensors. While human and mouse microglia are different in their proteomes, the species differences are smaller than the changes induced by cell culture. Remarkably, xenografting human microglia derived from human stem cells into mouse brain restores the in vivo-like microglia proteomic signature including reduction in the total amount of protein, energy demand and protein synthesis, and re-expression of homeostatic microglia markers. We identify more than 9000 microglia proteins and discuss how they relate to microglia function. This data provides a vital proteomic resource for understanding in vitro and ex vivo microglia phenotypes.

                Detecting that someone has said your name is one of the most famous examples for incidental processing of supposedly-unattended speech. However, empirical investigation of this so-called "cocktail party effect" has yielded conflicting results. We present a novel empirical approach for revisiting this effect under highly ecological conditions, by immersing participants in a multisensory virtual cafe environment and using realistic stimuli and tasks. Participants listened to conversational speech from a character sitting across from them, while a barista in the back of the cafe called out food orders. Unbeknownst to them, the barista sometimes called orders containing their own name or semantic violations. We used combined measurements of brain activity (EEG), eye-gaze and galvanic skin response to assess the response-profile to these two probes in the task-irrelevant barista-stream. Both probes elicited unique neural and physiological responses relative to control stimuli, indicating that the system indeed processed these words and detected their unique status, despite being task-irrelevant. Interestingly, these responses were covert in nature and were not accompanied by gaze-shifts towards the barista character. This pattern demonstrates that under these highly ecological conditions, listeners incidentally pick up information from task-irrelevant speech, emphasizing the dynamic and non-binary nature of attention in real-life environments.

                Phasic variations in dopamine levels are interpreted as a teaching signal reinforcing rewarded behaviors. However, behavior also depends on the online, neuromodulatory effect of phasic dopamine signaling. Here, we unravel a new neurodynamical principle that reconciles these roles. In a biophysical recurrent network-based decision architecture, we showed that dopamine-mediated synaptic plasticity stabilized neural assemblies representing rewarded locations as latent, local attractors. Dopamine-modulated synaptic excitability activated these attractors online, and they became accessible as internal goals, even from remote animal positions. We experimentally validated these predictions in mice, using optogenetics, by demonstrating that online dopamine signaling specifically attracts animals toward rewarded locations, without off-target motor effects. We therefore propose that online dopamine signaling reveals potential goals by widening and deepening the basin of dopamine-built attractors representing rewards.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How to entrain a selected neuronal rhythm but not others: open-loop dithered brain stimulation for selective entrainment</a></h4>

              
                While brain stimulation therapies such as deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease can be effective, they have yet to reach their full potential across neurological disorders. Entraining neuronal rhythms using rhythmic brain stimulation has been suggested as a new therapeutic mechanism to restore neurotypical behavior in conditions such as chronic pain, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. However, theoretical and experimental evidence indicate that brain stimulation can also entrain neuronal rhythms at sub- and super-harmonics, far from the stimulation frequency. Crucially, these counterintuitive effects can be harmful to patients, for example by triggering debilitating involuntary movements in Parkinson's disease. We therefore propose a principled approach to selectively promote rhythms close to the stimulation frequency, while avoiding potential harmful effects by preventing entrainment at sub- and super-harmonics. Our open-loop approach to selective entrainment, dithered stimulation, consists in adding white noise to the stimulation period. We theoretically establish the ability of dithered stimulation to selectively entrain a given brain rhythm, and verify its efficacy in simulations of uncoupled neural oscillators, and networks of coupled neural oscillators. Furthermore, we show that dithered stimulation can be implemented in neurostimulators with limited capabilities by toggling within a finite set of stimulation frequencies. Likely implementable across a variety of existing brain stimulation devices, dithering-based selective entrainment has potential to enable new brain stimulation therapies, as well as new neuroscientific research exploiting its ability to modulate higher-order entrainment.

                Botulinum neurotoxin A1 (BoNT/A1) is the most potent serotype in humans with the highest clinical duration. BoNT/A1 interacts with synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) and gangliosides to be taken up by neurons. In this study, we present three molecular dynamics simulations in which BoNT/A1 is in complex with singly or doubly glycosylated SV2C or singly glycosylated SV2A, in a ganglioside rich (lipid raft) context. Our computational data suggest that the N-glycan at position 480 (N480g) in the luminal domain of SV2C (LD-SV2C) indirectly enhanced the contacts of the neurotoxin surface with the second N-glycan at position 559 (N559g) by acting as a shield to prevent N559g to interact with residues of LD-SV2C. The N-glycosylation at the position N573 (N573g) in the luminal domain of SV2A has a slightly lower affinity for the surface of BoNT/A1 compared to 559g because of possible intermolecular contacts between N573g and residues of the luminal domain of SV2A (LD-SV2A). In addition to the ganglioside binding site (GBS) conserved across serotypes B, E, F and G, the lipid-raft associated GT1b interacted with a structure we coined the ganglioside binding loop (GBL) which is homologous to the lipid binding loop (LBL) in serotypes B, C, D, D/C and G. Finally, we proposed a global model in which BoNT/A1 interacts with its glycosylated protein receptor, one molecule of GT1b interacting in the GBS and five molecules of GT1b interacting with the GBL and residue Y1133.

                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a popular method for non-invasive neuromodulation in human research and therapy. However, what constitutes an effective dose in tACS applications is still a matter of investigation and debate. Here, we examined available literature data regarding the effects of alternating current (AC)-induced electric fields on cellular-level neural activity. The literature search identified 17 relevant experimental reports that utilized brain slices, anesthetized rodents, and awake/behaving animal models. We implemented a probabilistic meta-analysis to estimate the minimum effective dose (MED) required for inducing detectable significant neural changes with AC stimulation. The results showed that AC stimulation at 0.3 mV/mm in awake/behaving mammals leads to an 80% probability of inducing minimum neural effects. A similar level of effectiveness in brain slices and anesthetized mammals required 0.7 mV/mm. In conclusion, (transcranial) alternating current stimulation is significantly more effective in awake than in anesthetized brains. The proposed dose targets can serve as a practical guideline for tACS in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diversity and task-dependence of task representations in V1 during freely-moving decisions</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in primary visual cortex (area V1) are strongly driven by both sensory stimuli and non-sensory events. However, although the representation of sensory stimuli has been well characterized, much less is known about the representation of non-sensory events. Here, we characterize the specificity and organization of non-sensory representations in rat V1 during a freely-moving visual decision task. We find that single neurons encode diverse combinations of task features simultaneously and across task epochs. Despite heterogeneity at the level of single neuron response patterns, both visual and non-visual task variables could be reliably decoded from small neural populations (5-40 units) throughout a trial. Interestingly, in animals trained to make an auditory decision following passive observation of a visual stimulus, some but not all task features could also be decoded from V1 activity. Our results support the view that even in V1 - the earliest stage of the cortical hierarchy - bottom-up sensory information is combined with top-down non-sensory information in a task-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The temporal organization of corticostriatal communications</a></h4>

              
                Cortical activation of the striatum requires temporally synchronized communications from numerous afferents. However, the systems-level temporal organization of corticostriatal circuitry remains poorly understood. Applying recent advances in temporally unwrapping "edge" functional connectivity data, we identify communities of corticostriatal node-pairs with preferentially synchronized communication patterns. Strikingly, these communities are spatially orthogonal to classic gradients of corticostriatal structural and static functional connectivity. This spatiotemporal "blending" - wherein striatal nodes connected to similar areas of cortex may nonetheless communicate with these areas at different times, and vice versa - may increase the repertoire of striatal responses to frontal input and facilitate functional integration in the temporal dimension. We provide evidence that this decoupling of spatial and temporal communication patterns may stem from spatially variable modulation of striatal responsivity to cortical input by intra-striatal connections. Findings provide a framework to investigate how different corticostriatal connections coordinate in the temporal dimension to produce complex behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reproducibility of neuroimaging studies of brain disorders with hundreds -not thousands- of participants</a></h4>

              
                Finding reliable and reproducible effects is crucial for the progress of any scientific field. Key determinants in this pursuit are the quality of the methodology, the number of participants in a study (i.e., sample size), and the magnitude of the studied effects (i.e., effect size). In a recent publication, Marek et al. provide important insights into the magnitude of effect sizes in neuroimaging MRI research and related sample sizes: brain-wide association studies (BWAS) linking neuroimaging features with behavioural phenotypes in the general population are characterised by (very) weak effects. Consequently, large sample sizes of over 3,000 participants are required to lead to reproducible effects. The largest effect sizes reported by Marek et al. concern correlations |r| as small as 0.06 to 0.16 across multiple imaging modalities and behavioural measures tested. Besides examining brain correlates of normative behaviour, another central goal in neuroimaging is to study brain structure and function under disease conditions, with the aim to shed light on pathophysiological mechanisms and identify potential markers of clinically relevant features. Brain patterns related to disease conditions are likely more pronounced than general brain-behaviour associations; other factors remaining equal, smaller samples should be sufficient in these situations to obtain reliable and reproducible findings. This is important because clinical neuroimaging studies must balance reproducibility with cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Here, we show by means of power calculations and empirical analysis that neuroimaging studies in clinical populations need hundreds -and not necessarily thousands- of participants to lead to reproducible findings.

	<p>Salvia moorcroftiana is medicinally used in various parts of the world to treat a number of diseases. In the literature, the antiamnesic activity of this plant has not yet been reported. Therefore, the current study was aimed at evaluating the in vivo antiamnesic (scopolamine-induced) potential of Salvia moorcroftiana. The major phytochemical groups such as total phenolic (TPC), total tannin (TTC), and total flavonoid content (TFC) in methanolic extract (SlMo-Crd) and subsequent fractions of Salvia moorcroftiana were quantified using standard methods. The in vitro anticholinesterase (against butyryl cholinesterase; BChE and acetylcholinesterase; AChE) and antioxidant (against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl; DPPH and 2,2&amp;amp;prime;-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid); ABTS free radicals) potentials of crude (SIMO-Crd) extract and fractions (hexane; SlMo-Hex, chloroform; SlMo-Chl, ethyl acetate; SlMo-Et) were also determined. The SlMo-Crd at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight compared to fractions of 75 and 150 mg/kg body weight (which were 1/10th of the highest dose tested in acute toxicity tests) were evaluated for their memory enhancement and learning behavior in normal and scopolamine-induced mental dysfunction in mice using behavioral memory tests such as the Y-maze test and novel object recognition test (NORT). Moreover, the samples were further evaluated for acetylcholine contents and biochemical markers such as MDA (malondialdehyde), SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and GSH (glutathione peroxidase) levels. The maximum TPC with a value of 114.81 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.15 mg GAE/g, TTC with a value of 106.79 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.07 mg GAE/g, and TFC with a value of 194.29 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.83 mg RE/g were recorded for the SlMo-Chl fraction. Against the DPPH free radical, the methanolic extract exhibited an IC50 value of 95.29 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.06 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL whereas, among the fractions, the best activity was observed for the SlMo-Chl fraction with an IC50 of 75.02 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.91 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL, followed by SlMoS-Et with an IC50 value of 88.71 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.87 &amp;amp;micro;g/mL. Among the extracts, the SlMo-Chl and SlMo-Et fractions inverted the amnesic effects of scopolamine in mice effectively. Additionally, the SlMo-Chl and SIMO-Et fractions considerably enhanced the percent spontaneous alteration performance in the Y-maze test with values of 65.18 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.61/69.51 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.71 and 54.92 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.49/60.41 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.69, respectively, for the tested doses. The discrimination index (DI) in experimental mice was considerably enhanced by the SlMo-Chl in the NORT with values of 59.81 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.21/61.22 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.31% DI correspondingly for the tested doses, as mentioned above, followed by the SlMo-Et extract. The selected plant in the form of extracts ameliorated the effects of amnesia in mice and could, therefore, be used as a therapy for amnesia; however, this is subject to further exploration in other animal models and the isolation of the responsible compounds.</p>

	<p>Glioblastoma is the most aggressive brain cancer and is highly infiltrated with cells of myeloid lineage (TIM) that support tumor growth and invasion. Tumor resection is the primary treatment for glioblastoma; however, the activation state of TIM at the site of tumor resection and its impact on glioma regrowth are poorly understood. Using the C57BL/6/GL261 mouse glioma implantation model, we investigated the state of TIM in the tumor resection area during the post-surgical period. TIM isolated from brain tissue at the resection site were analyzed at 0, 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21 days after tumor resection. An increase in expression of CD86 during the first 7 days after surgical resection and then upregulation of arginase 1 from the 14th to 21st days after resection were detected. Cytokine expression analysis combined with qRT-PCR revealed sustained upregulation of IL4, IL5, IL10, IL12, IL17, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1/CCL2) in TIM purified from regrown tumors compared with primary implanted tumors. Flow cytometry analysis revealed increased CD86+/CD206+ population in regrown tumors compared with primary implanted tumors. Overall, we found that TIM in primary implanted tumors and tumors regrown after resection exhibited different phenotypes and cytokine expression patterns.</p>

	<p>Understanding the patterns of brain glucose metabolism and connectivity in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness (DOC) may be of positive significance to the accurate assessment of consciousness and the optimization of neuromodulation strategy. We retrospectively analyzed the brain glucose metabolism pattern and its correlation with clinical Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score in six HIE patients with prolonged DOC who had undergone 18F-deoxyglucose brain positron emission tomography scanning (FDG-PET). We also compared the differences in global metabolic connectivity patterns and the characteristics of several brain networks between HIE patients and healthy controls (HC). The metabolism of multiple brain regions decreased significantly in HIE patients, and the degree of local metabolic preservation was correlated with CRS-R score. The internal metabolic connectivity of occipital lobe and limbic system in HIE patients decreased, and their metabolic connectivity with frontal lobe, parietal lobe and temporal lobe also decreased. The metabolic connectivity patterns of default mode network, dorsal attention network, salience network, executive control network and subcortex network of HIE also changed compared with HC. The present study suggested that pattern of cerebral glucose metabolism and network connectivity of HIE patients with prolonged DOC were significantly different from those of healthy people.</p>

	<p>Antipsychotics are a class of psychotropic drugs that improve psychotic symptoms and reduce relapse risk. However, they may cause side effects (SE) that impact patients’ quality of life and psychosocial functioning. Therefore, there is a need for practical tools to identify them and possibly intervene. The objective of the present study was to translate into Italian the Glasgow Antipsychotic Side Effect Scale (GASS), which is suggested as the questionnaire of choice to collect SE reported by patients treated with antipsychotics. We administered the GASS and the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersøgelser (UKU) SE scale—which is considered the gold standard—to 100 stable patients with schizophrenia and bipolar spectrum disorders. We measured the structural validity, internal consistency, concurrent criterion validity, construct validity, and clinical feasibility. GASS was characterized by modest structural validity and good internal consistency. The binary correlations concerning the presence of specific symptoms investigated with the GASS and the UKU were strong or relatively strong for only half of them. The GASS total scale score was inversely related to patients’ quality of life and psychosocial functioning. The GASS is useful to briefly assess the burden of antipsychotic SE (~5 min) but is not optimal in identifying them.</p>

	<p>The noradrenergic and cholinergic modulation of functionally distinct regions of the brain has become one of the primary organizational principles behind understanding the contribution of each system to the diversity of neural computation in the central nervous system. Decades of work has shown that a diverse family of receptors, stratified across different brain regions, and circuit-specific afferent and efferent projections play a critical role in helping such widespread neuromodulatory systems obtain substantial heterogeneity in neural information processing. This review briefly discusses the anatomical layout of both the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems, as well as the types and distributions of relevant receptors for each system. Previous work characterizing the direct and indirect interaction between these two systems is discussed, especially in the context of higher order cognitive functions such as attention, learning, and the decision-making process. Though a substantial amount of work has been done to characterize the role of each neuromodulator, a cohesive understanding of the region-specific cooperation of these two systems is not yet fully realized. For the field to progress, new experiments will need to be conducted that capitalize on the modular subdivisions of the brain and systematically explore the role of norepinephrine and acetylcholine in each of these subunits and across the full range of receptors expressed in different cell types in these regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Correlates of Hyperalgesia and Somatic Signs of Heroin Withdrawal in Male and Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opioid withdrawal involves the manifestation of motivational and somatic symptoms. However, the brain structures that are involved in the expression of different opioid withdrawal signs remain unclear. We induced opioid dependence by repeatedly injecting escalating heroin doses in male and female C57BL/6J mice. We assessed hyperalgesia during spontaneous heroin withdrawal and somatic signs of withdrawal that was precipitated by the preferential &mu;-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Heroin-treated mice exhibited significantly higher hyperalgesia and somatic signs than saline-treated mice. Following behavioral assessment, we measured regional changes in brain activity by automated the counting of c-Fos expression (a marker of cellular activity). Using Principal Component Analysis, we determined the association between behavior (hyperalgesia and somatic signs of withdrawal) and c-Fos expression in different brain regions. Hyperalgesia was associated with c-Fos expression in the lateral hypothalamus, central nucleus of the amygdala, ventral tegmental area, parabrachial nucleus, dorsal raphe (DR), and locus coeruleus (LC). Somatic withdrawal was associated with c-Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, lateral habenula, DR, and LC. Thus, hyperalgesia and somatic withdrawal signs were each associated with c-Fos expression in unique sets of brain areas. The expression of c-Fos in the DR and LC was associated with both hyperalgesia and somatic withdrawal. Understanding common neurobiological mechanisms of acute and protracted opioid withdrawal may help identify new targets for treating this salient aspect of opioid use disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Microglial mTOR Activation Upregulates Trem2 and Enhances {beta}-Amyloid Plaque Clearance in the 5XFAD Alzheimer's Disease Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a major role in key cellular processes including metabolism and differentiation; however, the role of mTOR in microglia and its importance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have remained largely uncharacterized. We report that selective loss of <I>Tsc1</I>, a negative regulator of mTOR, in microglia in mice of both sexes, caused mTOR activation and upregulation of Trem2 with enhanced &beta;-Amyloid (A&beta;) clearance, reduced spine loss, and improved cognitive function in the <I>5XFAD</I> AD mouse model. Combined loss of <I>Tsc1</I> and <I>Trem2</I> in microglia led to reduced A&beta; clearance and increased A&beta; plaque burden revealing that Trem2 functions downstream of mTOR. <I>Tsc1</I> mutant microglia showed increased phagocytosis with upregulation of CD68 and Lamp1 lysosomal proteins. <I>In vitro</I> studies using <I>Tsc1</I>-deficient microglia revealed enhanced endocytosis of the lysosomal tracker indicator Green DND-26 suggesting increased lysosomal activity. Incubation of <I>Tsc1</I>-deficient microglia with fluorescent-labeled A&beta; revealed enhanced A&beta; uptake and clearance, which was blunted by rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. <I>In vivo</I> treatment of mice of relevant genotypes in the <I>5XFAD</I> background with rapamycin, affected microglial activity, decreased Trem2 expression and reduced A&beta; clearance causing an increase in A&beta; plaque burden. Prolonged treatment with rapamycin caused even further reduction of mTOR activity, reduction in Trem2 expression, and increase in A&beta; levels. Together, our findings reveal that mTOR signaling in microglia is critically linked to Trem2 regulation and lysosomal biogenesis, and that the upregulation of Trem2 in microglia through mTOR activation could be exploited toward better therapeutic avenues to A&beta;-related AD pathologies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a key regulator for major cellular metabolic processes. However, the link between mTOR signaling and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not well understood. In this study, we provide compelling <I>in vivo</I> evidence that mTOR activation in microglia would benefit &beta;-Amyloid (A&beta;)-related AD pathologies, as it upregulates Trem2, a key receptor for A&beta; plaque uptake. Inhibition of mTOR pathway with rapamycin, a well-established immunosuppressant, downregulated Trem2 in microglia and reduced A&beta; plaque clearance indicating that mTOR inactivation may be detrimental in A&beta;-associated AD patients. This finding will have a significant public health impact and benefit, regarding the usage of rapamycin in AD patients, which we believe will aggravate the A&beta;-related AD pathologies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Activities in the Rostral Ventromedial Medulla Associated with Experimental Occlusal Interference-Induced Orofacial Hyperalgesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>The imbalanced conditions of pronociceptive ON-cells and antinociceptive OFF-cells in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) alter nociceptive transmission and play an important role in the development of chronic pain. This study aimed to explore the neuroplastic mechanisms of the RVM ON-cells and OFF-cells in a male rat model of experimental occlusal interference (EOI)-induced nociceptive behavior reflecting orofacial hyperalgesia and in modified models involving EOI removal at early and later stages. We recorded the mechanical head withdrawal thresholds, orofacial operant behaviors, and the activity of identified RVM ON-cells and OFF-cells in these rats. EOI-induced orofacial hyperalgesia could be relieved by EOI removal around postoperative day 3; this effect could be inhibited by intra-RVM microinjection of the -opioid receptor agonist U-69593. EOI removal around postoperative day 8 did not relieve the orofacial hyperalgesia, which could, however, be reversed by intra-RVM microinjection of the NK-1 (neurokinin-1) receptor antagonist L-733060. The activity of ON-cells and OFF-cells did not change during both the initial 3 and 6 d of EOI. When EOI was removed on postoperative day 3, OFF-cell responses decreased, contributing to the reversal of hyperalgesia. When EOI lasted for 8 d or was removed on postoperative day 8, spontaneous activity and stimulus-evoked responses of ON-cell increased, contributing to the maintained hyperalgesia. In contrast, when the EOI lasted for 14 d, OFF-cell responses decreased, possibly participating in the maintenance of hyperalgesia with persistent EOI. Our results reveal that adaptive changes in the RVM were associated with orofacial pain following EOI placement and removal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A considerable proportion of patients experience chronic orofacial pain throughout life despite the therapies given or removal of potential etiologic factors. However, current therapies lack effectiveness because of limited knowledge of the chronicity mechanisms. Using electrophysiological recording, combined with a behavioral test, we found that the prevailing descending facilitation in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) participates in the maintenance of orofacial hyperalgesia following late removal of nociceptive stimuli, while the prevailing descending inhibition from the RVM may contribute to the reversal of orofacial hyperalgesia following early removal of nociceptive stimuli. Thus, variable clinical outcomes of orofacial pain may be associated with descending modulation, and an optimal window of time may exist in the management of chronic orofacial pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Role of Sleep in Formation of Relational Associative Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Relational memory, the ability to make and remember associations between objects, is an essential component of mammalian reasoning. In relational memory tasks, it has been shown that periods of offline processing, such as sleep, are critical to making indirect associations. To understand biophysical mechanisms behind the role of sleep in improving relational memory, we developed a model of the thalamocortical network to test how slow-wave sleep affects performance on an unordered relational memory task. First, the model was trained in the awake state on a paired associate inference task, in which the model learned to recall direct associations. After a period of subsequent slow-wave sleep, the model developed the ability to recall indirect associations. We found that replay, during sleep, of memory patterns learned in awake increased synaptic connectivity between neurons representing the item that was overlapping between tasks and neurons representing the unlinked items of the different tasks; this forms an attractor that enables indirect memory recall. Our study predicts that overlapping items between indirectly associated tasks are essential for relational memory, and sleep can reactivate pathways to and from overlapping items to the unlinked objects to strengthen these pathways and form new relational memories.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Experimental studies have shown that some types of associative memory, such as transitive inference and relational memory, can improve after sleep. Still, it remains unknown what specific mechanisms are responsible for these sleep-related changes. In this new work, we addressed this problem by building a thalamocortical network model that can learn relational memory tasks and that can be simulated in awake or sleep states. We found that memory traces learned in awake were replayed during slow waves of NREM sleep and revealed that replay increased connections to and from overlapping memory items to form new relational memories. Our work discovered specific mechanisms behind the role of sleep in associative memory and made testable predictions about how sleep augments associative learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Egr1-Dependent Neuronal Ensembles Negatively Regulate Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor skills learning is classically associated with brain regions including cerebral and cerebellar cortices and basal ganglia nuclei. Less is known about the role of the hippocampus in the acquisition and storage of motor skills. Here, we show that mice receiving a long-term training in the accelerating rotarod display marked hippocampal transcriptional changes and reduced pyramidal neurons activity in the CA1 region when compared with naive mice. Then, we use mice in which neural ensembles are permanently labeled in an <I>Egr1</I> activity-dependent fashion. Using these mice, we identify a subpopulation of <I>Egr1</I>-expressing pyramidal neurons in CA1 activated in short-term (STT) and long-term (LTT) trained mice in the rotarod task. When <I>Egr1</I> is downregulated in the CA1 or these neuronal ensembles are depleted, motor learning is improved whereas their chemogenetic stimulation impairs motor learning performance. Thus, <I>Egr1</I> organizes specific CA1 neuronal ensembles during the accelerating rotarod task that limit motor learning. These evidences highlight the role of the hippocampus in the control of this type of learning and we provide a possible underlying mechanism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is a major topic in neurosciences the deciphering of the specific circuits underlying memory systems during the encoding of new information. However, the potential role of the hippocampus in the control of motor learning and the underlying mechanisms has been poorly addressed. In the present work we show how the hippocampus responds to motor learning and how the <I>Egr1</I> molecule is one of the major responsible for such phenomenon controlling the rate of motor coordination performances.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Inhibitory Circuit Dysfunction after Chronic Frontal Lobe Contusion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurologic disability; the most common deficits affect prefrontal cortex-dependent functions such as attention, working memory, social behavior, and mental flexibility. Despite this prevalence, little is known about the pathophysiology that develops in frontal cortical microcircuits after TBI. We investigated whether alterations in subtype-specific inhibitory circuits are associated with cognitive inflexibility in a mouse model of frontal lobe contusion in both male and female mice that recapitulates aberrant mental flexibility as measured by deficits in rule reversal learning. Using patch-clamp recordings and optogenetic stimulation, we identified selective vulnerability in the non-fast-spiking and somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) subtypes of inhibitory neurons in layer V of the orbitofrontal cortex 2 months after injury. These subtypes exhibited reduced intrinsic excitability and a decrease in their synaptic output onto pyramidal neurons, respectively. By contrast, the fast-spiking and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons did not show changes in intrinsic excitability or synaptic output, respectively. Impairments in non-fast-spiking/SOM+ inhibitory circuit function were also associated with network hyperexcitability. These findings provide evidence for selective disruptions within specific inhibitory microcircuits that may guide the development of novel therapeutics for TBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> TBI frequently leads to chronic deficits in cognitive and behavioral functions that involve the prefrontal cortex, yet the maladaptive changes that occur in these cortical microcircuits are unknown. Our data indicate that alterations in subtype-specific inhibitory circuits, specifically vulnerability in the non-fast-spiking/somatostatin-expressing interneurons, occurs in the orbitofrontal cortex in the context of chronic deficits in reversal learning. These neurons exhibit reduced excitability and synaptic output, whereas the other prominent inhibitory population in layer V, the fast-spiking/parvalbumin-expressing interneurons as well as pyramidal neurons are not affected. Our work offers mechanistic insight into the subtype-specific function of neurons that may contribute to mental inflexibility after TBI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">GABAergic CaMKII{alpha}+ Amygdala Output Attenuates Pain and Modulates Emotional-Motivational Behavior via Parabrachial Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pain and emotion are strongly regulated by neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a major output of the limbic system; yet, the neuronal signaling pathways underlying this modulation are incompletely understood. Here, we characterized a subpopulation of CeA neurons that express the CaMKII&alpha; gene (CeA<sup>CAM</sup> neurons) and project to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN), a brainstem region known for its critical role in distributing nociceptive and other aversive signals throughout the brain. In male Sprague Dawley rats, we show that CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN neurons are GABAergic and mostly express somatostatin. In anaesthetized rats, optogenetic stimulation of CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN projections inhibited responses of LPBN neurons evoked by electrical activation of A- and C-fiber primary afferents; this inhibition could be blocked by intra-LPBN application of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonist bicuculline. CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN stimulation also dampened LPBN responses to noxious mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. In behaving rats, optogenetic stimulation of CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN projections attenuated nocifensive responses to mechanical pressure and radiant heat, disrupted the ability of a noxious shock to drive aversive learning, reduced the defensive behaviors of thigmotaxis and freezing, induced place preference, and promoted food consumption in sated rats. Thus, we suggest that CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN projections mediate a form of analgesia that is accompanied by a shift toward the positive-appetitive pole of the emotional-motivational continuum. Since the affective state of pain patients strongly influences their prognosis, we envision that recruitment of this pathway in a clinical setting could potentially promote pain resilience and recovery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pain and emotion interact on multiple levels of the nervous system. Both positive and negative emotion may have analgesic effects. However, while the neuronal mechanisms underlying "stress-induced analgesia" have been the focus of many studies, the neuronal substrates underlying analgesia accompanied by appetitive emotional-motivational states have received far less attention. The current study focuses on a subpopulation of amygdala neurons that form inhibitory synapses within the brainstem lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). We show that activation of these amygdalo-parabrachial projections inhibits pain processing, while also reducing behaviors related to negative affect and enhancing behaviors related to positive affect. We propose that recruitment of this pathway would benefit pain patients, many of whom suffer from psychological comorbidities such as anxiety and depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">NMDA Receptors in the Lateral Preoptic Hypothalamus Are Essential for Sustaining NREM and REM Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lateral preoptic (LPO) hypothalamus is a center for NREM and REM sleep induction and NREM sleep homeostasis. Although LPO is needed for NREM sleep, we found that calcium signals were, surprisingly, highest in REM sleep. Furthermore, and equally surprising, NMDA receptors in LPO were the main drivers of excitation. Deleting the NMDA receptor GluN1 subunit from LPO abolished calcium signals in all cells and produced insomnia. Mice of both sexes had highly fragmented NREM sleep-wake patterns and could not generate conventionally classified REM sleep. The sleep phenotype produced by deleting NMDA receptors depended on where in the hypothalamus the receptors were deleted. Deleting receptors from the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) did not influence sleep-wake states. The sleep fragmentation originated from NMDA receptors on GABA neurons in LPO. Sleep fragmentation could be transiently overcome with sleeping medication (zolpidem) or sedatives (dexmedetomidine; Dex). By contrast, fragmentation persisted under high sleep pressure produced by sleep deprivation (SD), mice had a high propensity to sleep but woke up. By analyzing changes in  power, sleep homeostasis (also referred to as "sleep drive") remained intact after NMDA receptor ablation. We suggest NMDA glutamate receptor activation stabilizes firing of sleep-on neurons and that mechanisms of sleep maintenance differ from that of the sleep drive itself.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Insomnia is a common affliction. Most insomniacs feel that they do not get enough sleep, but in fact, often have good amounts of sleep. Their sleep, however, is fragmented, and sufferers wake up feeling unrefreshed. It is unknown how sleep is maintained once initiated. We find that in mice, NMDA-type glutamate receptors in the hypothalamus are the main drivers of excitation and are required for a range of sleep properties: they are, in fact, needed for both sustained NREM sleep periods, and REM sleep generation. When NMDA receptors are selectively reduced from inhibitory preoptic (PO) neurons, mice have normal total amounts of sleep but high sleep-wake fragmentation, providing a model for studying intractable insomnia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Model Sharing in the Human Medial Temporal Lobe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Effective planning involves knowing where different actions take us. However, natural environments are rich and complex, leading to an exponential increase in memory demand as a plan grows in depth. One potential solution is to filter out features of the environment irrelevant to the task at hand. This enables a shared model of transition dynamics to be used for planning over a range of different input features. Here, we asked human participants (13 male, 16 female) to perform a sequential decision-making task, designed so that knowledge should be integrated independently of the input features (visual cues) present in one case but not in another. Participants efficiently switched between using a low-dimensional (cue independent) and a high-dimensional (cue specific) representation of state transitions. fMRI data identified the medial temporal lobe as a locus for learning state transitions. Within this region, multivariate patterns of BOLD responses were less correlated between trials with differing input features but similar state associations in the high dimensional than in the low dimensional case, suggesting that these patterns switched between separable (specific to input features) and shared (invariant to input features) transition models. Finally, we show that transition models are updated more strongly following the receipt of positive compared with negative outcomes, a finding that challenges conventional theories of planning. Together, these findings propose a computational and neural account of how information relevant for planning can be shared and segmented in response to the vast array of contextual features we encounter in our world.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Effective planning involves maintaining an accurate model of which actions take us to which locations. But in a world awash with information, mapping actions to states with the right level of complexity is critical. Using a new decision-making "heist task" in conjunction with computational modeling and fMRI, we show that patterns of BOLD responses in the medial temporal lobe&mdash;a brain region key for prospective planning&mdash;become less sensitive to the presence of visual features when these are irrelevant to the task at hand. By flexibly adapting the complexity of task-state representations in this way, state-action mappings learned under one set of features can be used to plan in the presence of others.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pupil-Linked Arousal Response Reveals Aberrant Attention Regulation among Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that is characterized by difficulties with social interaction and interpersonal communication. It has been argued that abnormal attentional function to exogenous stimuli precedes and contributes to the core ASD symptoms. Notably, the locus ceruleus (LC) and its noradrenergic projections throughout the brain modulate attentional function, but the extent to which this locus ceruleus&ndash;norepinephrine (LC&ndash;NE) system influences attention in individuals with ASD, who frequently exhibit dysregulated alerting and attention orienting, is unknown. We examined dynamic attention control in girls and boys with ASD at rest using the pupil dilation response (PDR) as a noninvasive measure of LC&ndash;NE activity. When gender- and age-matched neurotypical participants were passively exposed to an auditory stream, their PDR decreased for recurrent stimuli but remained sensitive to surprising deviant stimuli. In contrast, children with ASD showed less habituation to recurrent stimuli as well as a diminished phasic response to deviants, particularly those containing social information. Their tonic habituation impairment predicts their phasic orienting impairment, and both impairments correlated with the severity of ASD symptom. Because of the fact that these pupil-linked responses are observed when individuals passively listen without any task engagement, our findings imply that the intricate and dynamic attention allocation mechanism, mediated by the subcortical LC&ndash;NE system, is impaired in ASD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autistic individuals show attentional abnormalities to even simple sensory inputs, which emerge even before formal diagnosis. One possible mechanism behind these abnormalities is a malfunctioning pacemaker of their attention system, the locus ceruleus&ndash;norepinephrine pathway. Here we found, according to the pupillary response (a noradrenergic activity proxy), autistic children are hypersensitive to repeated sounds but hyposensitive to surprising deviant sounds when compared with age-matched controls. Importantly, hypersensitivity to repetitions predicts hyposensitivity to deviant sounds, and both abnormalities positively correlate to the severity of autistic symptoms. This provides strong evidence that autistic children have faulty noradrenergic regulation, which might underly the attentional atypicalities previously evidenced in various cortical responses in autistic individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Spatiotemporal Map of Reading Aloud</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reading words aloud is a fundamental aspect of literacy. The rapid rate at which multiple distributed neural substrates are engaged in this process can only be probed via techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution. We probed this with direct intracranial recordings covering most of the left hemisphere in 46 humans (26 male, 20 female) as they read aloud regular, exception and pseudo-words. We used this to create a spatiotemporal map of word processing and to derive how broadband  activity varies with multiple word attributes critical to reading speed: lexicality, word frequency, and orthographic neighborhood. We found that lexicality is encoded earliest in mid-fusiform (mFus) cortex, and precentral sulcus, and is represented reliably enough to allow single-trial lexicality decoding. Word frequency is first represented in mFus and later in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), while orthographic neighborhood sensitivity resides solely in IPS. We thus isolate the neural correlates of the distributed reading network involving mFus, IFG, IPS, precentral sulcus, and motor cortex and provide direct evidence for parallel processes via the lexical route from mFus to IFG, and the sublexical route from IPS and precentral sulcus to anterior IFG.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reading aloud depends on multiple complex cerebral computations: mapping from a written letter string on a page to a sequence of spoken sound representations. Here, we used direct intracranial recordings in a large cohort while they read aloud known and novel words, to track, across space and time, the progression of neural representations of behaviorally relevant factors that govern reading speed. We find, concordant with cognitive models of reading, that known and novel words are differentially processed through a lexical route, sensitive to frequency of occurrence of known words in natural language, and a sublexical route, performing letter-by-letter construction of novel words.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensory Evidence Accumulation Using Optic Flow in a Naturalistic Navigation Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory evidence accumulation is considered a hallmark of decision-making in noisy environments. Integration of sensory inputs has been traditionally studied using passive stimuli, segregating perception from action. Lessons learned from this approach, however, may not generalize to ethological behaviors like navigation, where there is an active interplay between perception and action. We designed a sensory-based sequential decision task in virtual reality in which humans and monkeys navigated to a memorized location by integrating optic flow generated by their own joystick movements. A major challenge in such closed-loop tasks is that subjects' actions will determine future sensory input, causing ambiguity about whether they rely on sensory input rather than expectations based solely on a learned model of the dynamics. To test whether subjects integrated optic flow over time, we used three independent experimental manipulations, unpredictable optic flow perturbations, which pushed subjects off their trajectory; gain manipulation of the joystick controller, which changed the consequences of actions; and manipulation of the optic flow density, which changed the information borne by sensory evidence. Our results suggest that both macaques (male) and humans (female/male) relied heavily on optic flow, thereby demonstrating a critical role for sensory evidence accumulation during naturalistic action-perception closed-loop tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The temporal integration of evidence is a fundamental component of mammalian intelligence. Yet, it has traditionally been studied using experimental paradigms that fail to capture the closed-loop interaction between actions and sensations inherent in real-world continuous behaviors. These conventional paradigms use binary decision tasks and passive stimuli with statistics that remain stationary over time. Instead, we developed a naturalistic visuomotor visual navigation paradigm that mimics the causal structure of real-world sensorimotor interactions and probed the extent to which participants integrate sensory evidence by adding task manipulations that reveal complementary aspects of the computation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Makes Complex Contributions to Pain-Related Hyperactivity of Nociceptors after Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropathic pain is a major, inadequately treated challenge for people with spinal cord injury (SCI). While SCI pain mechanisms are often assumed to be in the CNS, rodent studies have revealed mechanistic contributions from primary nociceptors. These neurons become chronically hyperexcitable after SCI, generating ongoing electrical activity that promotes ongoing pain. A major question is whether extrinsic chemical signals help to drive ongoing electrical activity after SCI. People living with SCI exhibit acute and chronic elevation of circulating levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a cytokine implicated in preclinical pain models. Probable nociceptors isolated from male rats and exposed to an MIF concentration reported in human plasma (1 ng/ml) showed hyperactivity similar to that induced by SCI, although, surprisingly, a 10-fold higher concentration failed to increase excitability. Conditioned behavioral aversion to a chamber associated with peripheral MIF injection suggested that MIF stimulates affective pain. A MIF inhibitor, Iso-1, reversed SCI-induced hyperexcitability. Unlike chronic SCI-induced hyperexcitability, acute MIF-induced hyperexcitability was only partially abrogated by inhibiting ERK signaling. Unexpectedly, MIF concentrations that induced hyperactivity in nociceptors from naive animals, after SCI induced a long-lasting conversion from a highly excitable nonaccommodating type to a rapidly accommodating, hypoexcitable type, possibly as a homeostatic response to prolonged depolarization. Treatment with conditioned medium from cultures of DRG cells obtained after SCI was sufficient to induce MIF-dependent hyperactivity in neurons from naive rats. Thus, changes in systemic and DRG levels of MIF may help to maintain SCI-induced nociceptor hyperactivity that persistently promotes pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic neuropathic pain is a major challenge for people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Pain can drastically impair quality of life, and produces substantial economic and social burdens. Available treatments, including opioids, remain inadequate. This study shows that the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) can induce pain-like behavior and plays an important role in driving persistent ongoing electrical activity in injury-detecting sensory neurons (nociceptors) in a rat SCI model. The results indicate that SCI produces an increase in MIF release within sensory ganglia. Low MIF levels potently excite nociceptors, but higher levels trigger a long-lasting hypoexcitable state. These findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of MIF in neuropathic pain states may reduce pain and sensory dysfunction by curbing nociceptor hyperactivity.</p>

                Background: SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been reported to be associated with close contact with infected individuals. However, the mechanistic pathway for transmission in close contact settings is unclear. Our objective was to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies assessing the role of close contact in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, PubMed and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on the QUADAS-2 criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We included 278 studies: 258 primary studies and 20 systematic reviews. The settings for primary studies were predominantly in home/quarantine facilities (39.5%) and acute care hospitals (12%). The overall reporting quality of the studies was low-to-moderate. There was significant heterogeneity in design and methodology. The frequency of attack rates (PCR testing) varied between 2.1-75%; attack rates were highest in prison and wedding venues, and in households. The frequency of secondary attack rates was 0.3-100% with rates highest in home/quarantine settings. Three studies showed no transmission if the index case was a recurrent infection. Viral culture was performed in four studies of which three found replication-competent virus; culture results were negative where index cases had recurrent infections. Eighteen studies performed genomic sequencing with phylogenetic analysis – the completeness of genomic similarity ranged from 77-100%. Findings from systematic reviews showed that children were significantly less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 and household contact was associated with a significantly increased risk of infection. Conclusions: The evidence from published studies demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in close contact settings. The risk of transmission is greater in household contacts. There was a wide variation in methodology. Standardized guidelines for reporting transmission in close contact settings should be developed.

                Background: Conventional multi-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CMLC) has become the current ‘gold standard’ technique in gallbladder disease. Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has gained attention due to its benefits in improving patient cosmetic results and pain reduction. We aim to assess the latest evidence on the feasibility, safety and surgical outcomes of SILC and CMLC. Methods: We conducted searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and Europe PMC between December 2011 and 2021. The latest search was conducted in January 2022. We analyzed several outcomes, including perioperative complications, estimated blood loss, operation time, conversion to open surgery, hospital stay, pain score, cosmesis, and days of return to work. Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0 tool was used to evaluate quality of studies. Mantel-Haenszel's formula and Inverse Variance method were conducted to synthesize results. This study was accomplished in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Results: A total of 37 studies were eligible, with a total of 2,129 and 2,392 patients who underwent SILC and CMLC. Our study demonstrated a superiority of SILC for the visual analog score (VAS) at six hours post-operation [mean difference (MD) -0.58 (95% CI -1.11, -0.05), p=0.03], cosmesis one-month post-operation [standard MD 2.12 (95% CI 1.10, 3.13), p<0.0001], and cosmesis six months post-operation [standard MD 0.53 (95% CI 0.06, 0.99), p<0.0001]. Meanwhile, SILC showed a longer operation time [MD 10.45 (95% CI 6.74, 14.17), p<0.00001]. In terms of VAS at four time points (4, 8, 12, and 24 hours), perioperative complications, estimated blood loss, conversion to open surgery, hospital stay and days to return to work, SILC did not differ from CMLC. Conclusions: SILC is a safe, feasible and favorable procedure in terms of pain reduction and cosmetic results. The option between both procedures is based on surgeon preferences. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022306532; 23 February 2022).

                Background: Despite the advances in the prognostic determinants in patients with COVID-19, it is not well known which hospitalized patients may course with an adverse outcome. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers at hospital admission associated with increased risk of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: Prospective study in patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hospital and followed until discharge or death. All patients underwent clinical evaluation and laboratory tests on the first day of admission. Results: 100 patients were included, with a mean age of 57 years and 19 died. The variables associated with higher mortality were age), platelet count, D-dimer and troponin. Platelet count was independently associated with mortality, with area under the curve: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.62 - 0.86; p = 0.001]. The area under the curve of D-dimer for death was 0.74 [95% CI: 0.62 - 0.86; p= 0.001]. Considering the Kaplan Meier curves for survival in the hospitalization, there was a significant difference in the curves for D-dimer cutoff point above or below 1.1 mg/L (Log-Rank, p=0.03). Conclusion: The levels of D-dimer and platelet count have good accuracy in the detection of increased risk of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

                Background: Sexually transmitted diseases are known to pose a significant public health threat. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a viral infection with high prevalence in Sudan, particularly among pregnant women. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of HSV-2 among pregnant women as well as their associated potential risk factors in Wad Madani-Sudan. Methods: In total, 92 pregnant women who attended the Maternity Hospital and Dr. Altigani Sedeeg Fertility Center at Wad Madani, AL-Gezira State, between April and August 2018 were included in this study. HSV-2 Immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) were assayed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Results: The seroprevalence of HSV-2 IgM and IgG were 35(38%) and 90(97.8%), respectively. A Higher prevalence of HSV-2 IgG 45(48.9%) and 13(14.1%) for IgM was detected in pregnant women aged 15-24 years old with a significant association between HSV-2 IgM and age distribution group (p-value=0.001).  HSV-2 IgM and IgG seropositivity were highest in the first trimester; 26(34.2%), and 75(81.5%), respectively. The highest rate of HSV-2 IgM was detected in 19 (20.7%) women with a history of abortion, while the highest rate of HSV-2 IgG was seen in 50 (54.3%) women without a history of abortion. The statistical analysis results did not reveal significant differences between gestational stages and history of abortion with the presence of HSV-2 antibodies. Conclusion: The prevalence of HSV-2 was significant among pregnant women in Wad Madani- Sudan. There was a strong association between HSV-2 IgM seropositivity and the age of pregnant women.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Returning to work at school during the COVID -19 pandemic, is it stressful for schoolteachers? Assessment of immediate psychological effects: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The adoption of remote classes for students has been in vogue since the onset of the pandemic. Schools reopened in a phased manner after the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India. Reverting to the regular face-to-face teaching for students became a challenge to the teachers and students, especially at times when there was an impending third wave on the way. The study aimed to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers who attended reopened schools in the scenario of face-to-face classes. In addition, we studied the association of psychological symptoms with teachers' age groups, gender, school boards, and school institution type. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October to December 2021 after schools had reopened. Data was collected using Google Form questionnaires in 124 schoolteachers. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire assessed the psychological symptoms. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers, 108(87.1%) were female, 112 (90.3%) were from private institutions, and 70(56.5%) were from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) school boards. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers was 30.6%, 45.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. Nearly 80% of the female teachers expressed depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Amongst all the age groups, symptoms were higher in 40-49 group. We found anxiety to be statistically significant when compared with gender (p-0.042). We found no statistically significant differences concerning age groups, school boards, or school institutions with any psychological symptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of psychological symptoms was high among schoolteachers after schools reopened for regular face-to-face teaching. Gender was associated with anxiety in teachers. We agree that identifying teachers' symptoms and providing adequate psychological counseling/support would improve their mental health status and thereby the quality of teaching to students.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Gaze-dependent evidence accumulation predicts multi-alternative risky choice behaviour</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Felix Molter, Armin W. Thomas, Scott A. Huettel, Hauke R. Heekeren, Peter N. C. Mohr</p>

Choices are influenced by gaze allocation during deliberation, so that fixating an alternative longer leads to increased probability of choosing it. Gaze-dependent evidence accumulation provides a parsimonious account of choices, response times and gaze-behaviour in many simple decision scenarios. Here, we test whether this framework can also predict more complex context-dependent patterns of choice in a three-alternative risky choice task, where choices and eye movements were subject to attraction and compromise effects. Choices were best described by a gaze-dependent evidence accumulation model, where subjective values of alternatives are discounted while not fixated. Finally, we performed a systematic search over a large model space, allowing us to evaluate the relative contribution of different forms of gaze-dependence and additional mechanisms previously not considered by gaze-dependent accumulation models. Gaze-dependence remained the most important mechanism, but participants with strong attraction effects employed an additional similarity-dependent inhibition mechanism found in other models of multi-alternative multi-attribute choice.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A Bayesian method for identifying associations between response variables and bacterial community composition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adrian Verster, Nicholas Petronella, Judy Green, Fernando Matias, Stephen P. J. Brooks</p>

Determining associations between intestinal bacteria and continuously measured physiological outcomes is important for understanding the bacteria-host relationship but is not straightforward since abundance data (compositional data) are not normally distributed. To address this issue, we developed a fully Bayesian linear regression model (BRACoD; Bayesian Regression Analysis of Compositional Data) with physiological measurements (continuous data) as a function of a matrix of relative bacterial abundances. Bacteria can be classified as operational taxonomic units or by taxonomy (genus, family, etc.). Bacteria associated with the physiological measurement were identified using a Bayesian variable selection method: Stochastic Search Variable Selection. The output is a list of inclusion probabilities (p^) and coefficients that indicate the strength of the association (β^included) for each bacterial taxa. Tests with simulated communities showed that adopting a cut point value of p^ ≥ 0.3 for identifying included bacteria optimized the true positive rate (TPR) while maintaining a false positive rate (FPR) of ≤ 5%. At this point, the chances of identifying non-contributing bacteria were low and all well-established contributors were included. Comparison with other methods showed that BRACoD (at p^ ≥ 0.3) had higher precision and a higher TPR than a commonly used center log transformed LASSO procedure (clr-LASSO) as well as higher TPR than an off-the-shelf Spike and Slab method after center log transformation (clr-SS). BRACoD was also less likely to include non-contributing bacteria that merely correlate with contributing bacteria. Analysis of a rat microbiome experiment identified 47 operational taxonomic units that contributed to fecal butyrate levels. Of these, 31 were positively and 16 negatively associated with butyrate. Consistent with their known role in butyrate metabolism, most of these fell within the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. We conclude that BRACoD provides a more precise and accurate method for determining bacteria associated with a continuous physiological outcome compared to clr-LASSO. It is more sensitive than a generalized clr-SS algorithm, although it has a higher FPR. Its ability to distinguish genuine contributors from correlated bacteria makes it better suited to discriminating bacteria that directly contribute to an outcome. The algorithm corrects for the distortions arising from compositional data making it appropriate for analysis of microbiome data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Differential activation of a frontoparietal network explains population-level differences in statistical learning from speech</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joan Orpella, M. Florencia Assaneo, Pablo Ripollés, Laura Noejovich, Diana López-Barroso, Ruth de Diego-Balaguer, David Poeppel</p>

People of all ages display the ability to detect and learn from patterns in seemingly random stimuli. Referred to as statistical learning (SL), this process is particularly critical when learning a spoken language, helping in the identification of discrete words within a spoken phrase. Here, by considering individual differences in speech auditory–motor synchronization, we demonstrate that recruitment of a specific neural network supports behavioral differences in SL from speech. While independent component analysis (ICA) of fMRI data revealed that a network of auditory and superior pre/motor regions is universally activated in the process of learning, a frontoparietal network is additionally and selectively engaged by only some individuals (high auditory–motor synchronizers). Importantly, activation of this frontoparietal network is related to a boost in learning performance, and interference with this network via articulatory suppression (AS; i.e., producing irrelevant speech during learning) normalizes performance across the entire sample. Our work provides novel insights on SL from speech and reconciles previous contrasting findings. These findings also highlight a more general need to factor in fundamental individual differences for a precise characterization of cognitive phenomena.

                <p>by Pedro Brites, Monica M. Sousa</p>

In this issue of PLOS Biology, Kreher and colleagues show in a mouse model that in vivo, neurons and not only myelinating glia are primary effectors of disease progression in Krabbe disease. The neuron-specific model generated allows the unprecedented capacity to investigate the neuronal autonomous component of this disorder.

This Primer explores the implications of a PLOS Biology showing that in vivo, neurons (not only myelinating glia) are primary effectors of disease progression in Krabbe disease; the neuron-specific animal model described allows an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the neuronal-autonomous component of this disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lower serum BDNF as a predictor of post-stroke cognitive impairment in acute ischemic stroke patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Reduced level of serum BDNF in acute stroke patients is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to identify the role of serum BDNF level as a predictor for post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Methods: This was a prospective study. We recruited acute ischemic stroke patients in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Yogyakarta, Indonesia followed them up for 90 days (3 months). Serum BDNF was collected at day 5 and day 30 of stroke onset and measured by ELISA. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to measure the cognitive function at 90 days of follow up. ROC curve was conducted to measure the cut-off point of the BDNF level. Factors independently associated with PSCI were analyzed by using stepwise regression. Results: Among 89 patients recruited, 60 patients (67.41%) developed PSCI. The mean age of PSCI and non-PSCI patients was 62.7 ± 9.5 and 57.5 ± 8.7, respectively (p = 0.01). Patients with dyslipidemia were less likely to develop PSCI (OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.06–0.56, p < 0.05). In addition, patients with day 5-serum BDNF level < 23.29 ng/mL were five times more likely to develop PSCI compared with their counterparts (OR 5.02, 95%CI 1.67–15.04, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Among acute ischemic stroke patients, those with serum BDNF <23.29 ng/mL had a higher risk of developing PSCI, while those with dyslipidemia had a lower risk of PSCI. This study suggests that BDNF could be a predictor of PSCI, allowing for earlier detection and better preventive strategies.

                Characterizing the somatic mutation landscape of a cohort of patients has become a routine task in cancer research in recent years. Such studies are often highly interdisciplinary, requiring iterative analysis that must be evaluated at each step by many researchers. Therefore, there is a growing need for reporting tools that can easily generate interactive reports for sharing data and results with collaborators. Here we present an R package, MAFDash, that tries to simplify summarization and visualization of mutation data from Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) files. The output HTML dashboard is a self-contained report that can be used for downstream analysis and sharing results. MAFDash is freely available on Github (https://github.com/CCBR/MAFDash).

                Background: Dengue virus (DENV) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) are two viral illnesses that require very distinct management protocols. Missed diagnosis and under reporting of DENV is predicted due to COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnancy is associated with increased fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality due to both illnesses. Co-infection need to be reported and studied to optimize the outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective study on pregnant patients with COVID-19 and DENV co-infection conducted from the medical records from 1st of April 2021 to 1st of September 2021. Results: In this series four patients are described. Patient 1 is a diagnosed patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura who was in remission. She developed DENV infection during recovery of SARS-CoV-2. She received intensive care unit (ICU) care during the leaking phase. Patient 2 had an uncomplicated miscarriage during the co-infection. Patient 3 was a patient with advanced maternal age with multiple co-morbidities. She did not progress into the leaking phase. Diagnosis of DENV was missed in patient 4 and she had a fetal death. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 and DENV co-infection in pregnancy can be life threatening to the mother and can lead to adverse fatal outcomes. Timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary management are essential for better outcomes. Continuous data collection and reporting is advisable till the guidance is formed.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Cognition through the lens of a body–brain dynamic system</a></h4>

              
                Continuous interactions between physiological body–brain rhythms influence how individuals act, perceive, and evaluate their environment. Despite increasing interest, the intricate interface between breathing, cardiac, neural rhythms, and cognitive function remains poorly understood. By evaluating current theoretical and empirical implications, we derive an integrative framework of a ‘body–brain dynamic system’ that combines a hidden hierarchical structure with dynamical state transitions. We propose that body–brain signals can interchangeably drive state- and task-specific coupling mechanisms which influence cognitive functions.

                In neuroscience, the term ‘causality’ is used to refer to different concepts, leading to confusion. Here we illustrate some of those variations, and we suggest names for them. We then introduce four ways to enhance clarity around causality in neuroscience.

                Neuronal wiring is facilitated by diverse synaptic adhesion proteins and their repertoire of alternatively spliced isoforms. In this issue of Neuron, Hauser et al. (2022) uncovered the role of a GPI-anchored neurexin 3 splice variant in inhibitory synapse development and dendritic inhibition.

                The drive to sleep is strongly influenced by time of day, with temporal information conveyed through the circadian clock. In pursuit of the neural mechanisms underlying this process, in this issue of Neuron, Sun et al. identify a novel circuit that links circadian output neurons to sleep-promoting neurons within the mushroom bodies.

                Corticostriatal circuits represent value and choice during value-guided decision making. In this issue of Neuron, Balewski et al.

                My father was raised on a dairy and maple syrup farm in Northern Québec, Canada, in a small village, St. Cyrille de L’Islet. He was the eldest of seven children, now survived by his brother and five sisters. The day after my father died, I spoke with my father’s brother Luc. I asked, “Mon Oncle, qu’est que tu as fait aujourd’hui?” (Uncle, what did you do today?) He replied, “Biens, j’etais dans le bois.” (Well, I was in the forest.) This was answered with a tone of such obviousness that I knew immediately it had been foolish for me to ask the question.
