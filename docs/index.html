              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22050">Integrative characterization of the topography of V4 neural codes using deep learning approaches</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.22050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Area V4 is a mid-level stage of the macaque ventral visual stream, known to encode intermediate visual features such as color, curvature, corners, texture, three-dimensional (3D) solids, and local form. Classical neurophysiological studies have typically examined these dimensions in isolation, contrasting V4 selectivity for shape versus texture, 3D solid surfaces versus two-dimensional (2D) flat patterns, or object form versus texture. Yet how these tunings relate to one another within individual neurons, and how they are jointly organized across the cortical surface, remain unknown. For instance, does a neuron selective for 2D contour-defined shape prefer 3D solid surfaces or 2D flat surfaces? How are preferences for such heterogeneous attributes arranged in a common topographic map? To address these questions, we leverage V4 "digital twins" -- deep neural network models fitted to large-scale, wide-field calcium imaging data comprising tens of thousands of natural images. These digital twins allow us to systematically probe not only the stimulus dimensions explored in earlier studies, but also new, multidimensional stimulus sets that reveal additional aspects of the V4 code. In this study, we find that neural pixels preferring 2D contour-defined shapes also tend to prefer 3D surface shape defined by shading or texture gradients and by object form. In contrast, pixels preferring 2D texture tend to prefer flat surfaces defined by uniform texture or reflectance. We propose that this division of labor suggests that V4 may decompose the encoding of geometrical shape and surface appearance of visual stimuli into distinct populations of neurons, organized as interleaved clusters in the V4 topographic map.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22848">Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.22848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.

                arXiv:2511.21848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain has evolved to effectively control the body, and in order to understand the relationship we need to model the sensorimotor transformations underlying embodied control. As part of a coordinated effort, we are developing a general-purpose platform for behavior-driven simulation modeling high fidelity behavioral dynamics, biomechanics, and neural circuit architectures underlying embodied control. We present a pipeline for taking kinematics data from the neuroscience lab and creating a pipeline for recapitulating those natural movements in a biomechanical model. We implement a imitation learning framework to perform a dexterous forelimb reaching task with a musculoskeletal model in a simulated physics environment. The mouse arm model is currently training at faster than 1 million training steps per second due to GPU acceleration with JAX and Mujoco-MJX. We present results that indicate that adding naturalistic constraints on energy and velocity lead to simulated musculoskeletal activity that better predict real EMG signals. This work provides evidence to suggest that energy and control constraints are critical to modeling musculoskeletal motor control.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21940">Deep Learning Architectures for Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials Detection</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.21940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (C-VEPs) require highly robust decoding methods to address temporal variability and session-dependent noise in EEG signals. This study proposes and evaluates several deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 63-bit m-sequence reconstruction and classification, and Siamese networks for similarity-based decoding, alongside canonical correlation analysis (CCA) baselines. EEG data were recorded from 13 healthy adults under single-target flicker stimulation. The proposed deep models significantly outperformed traditional approaches, with distance-based decoding using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and constrained EMD showing greater robustness to latency variations than Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics. Temporal data augmentation with small shifts further improved generalization across sessions. Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22828">Fast dynamical similarity analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.22828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22870">Scalable Diffusion Transformer for Conditional 4D fMRI Synthesis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.22870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating whole-brain 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks remains challenging due to the high-dimensional, heterogeneous BOLD dynamics across subjects/acquisitions and the lack of neuroscience-grounded validation. We introduce the first diffusion transformer for voxelwise 4D fMRI conditional generation, combining 3D VQ-GAN latent compression with a CNN-Transformer backbone and strong task conditioning via AdaLN-Zero and cross-attention. On HCP task fMRI, our model reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves the inter-task representational structure observed in real data (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with canonical hemodynamic responses. Performance improves predictably with scale, reaching task-evoked map correlation of 0.83 and RSA of 0.98, consistently surpassing a U-Net baseline on all metrics. By coupling latent diffusion with a scalable backbone and strong conditioning, this work establishes a practical path to conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, paving the way for future applications such as virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and principled augmentation for downstream neuroimaging models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15477">Observing hidden neuronal states in experiments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2308.15477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we demonstrate a general protocol for constructing systematically experimental steady-state bifurcation diagrams for electrophysiologically active cells. We perform our experiments on entorhinal cortex neurons, both excitatory (pyramidal neurons) and inhibitiory (interneurons). A slowly ramped voltage-clamp electrophysiology protocol serves as closed-loop feedback controlled experiment for the subsequent current-clamp open-loop protocol on the same cell. In this way, the voltage-clamped experiment determines dynamically stable and unstable (hidden) steady states of the current-clamp experiment. The transitions between observable steady states and observable spiking states in the current-clamp experiment provide partial evidence for stability and bifurcations of the steady states. This technique for completing steady-state bifurcation diagrams in a model-independent way expands support for model validation to otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase space. Overlaying the voltage-clamp and current-clamp protocols leads to an experimental validation of the classical slow-fast dissection method introduced by J. Rinzel in the 1980s and routinely applied ever since in order to analyse slow-fast neuronal models. Our approach opens doors to observing further complex hidden states with more advanced control strategies, allowing to control real cells beyond pharmacological manipulations.

                arXiv:2503.02636v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resting-state EEG offers a non-invasive view of spontaneous brain activity, yet the extraction of meaningful patterns is often constrained by limited availability of high-quality data, and heavy reliance on manually engineered EEG features. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer not only a means to synthesize and augment neural signals, but also a promising way for learning meaningful representations directly from raw data, a dual capability that remains largely unexplored in EEG research. In this study, we introduce a scalable GAN-based framework for resting-state EEG that serves this dual role: 1) synthesis and 2) unsupervised feature extraction. The generated time series closely replicate key statistical and spectral properties of real EEG, as validated through both visual and quantitative evaluations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the model's learned representations can be repurposed for a downstream gender classification task, achieving higher out-of-sample accuracy than models trained directly on EEG signals and performing comparably to recent EEG foundation models, while using significantly less data and computational resources. These findings highlight the potential of generative models to serve as both neural signal generators and unsupervised feature extractors, paving the way for more data-efficient, architecture-driven approaches to EEG analysis with reduced reliance on manual feature engineering. The implementation code for this study is available at: https://github.com/Yeganehfrh/YARE-GAN.

                arXiv:2509.10650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective analysis in neuroscience benefits significantly from robust conceptual frameworks. Traditional metrics of interbrain synchrony in social neuroscience typically depend on fixed, correlation-based approaches, restricting their explanatory capacity to descriptive observations. Inspired by the successful integration of geometric insights in network science, we propose leveraging discrete geometry to examine the dynamic reconfigurations in neural interactions during social exchanges. Unlike conventional synchrony approaches, our method interprets inter-brain connectivity changes through the evolving geometric structures of neural networks. This geometric framework is realized through a pipeline that identifies critical transitions in network connectivity using entropy metrics derived from curvature distributions. By doing so, we significantly enhance the capacity of hyperscanning methodologies to uncover underlying neural mechanisms in interactive social behavior.

Abstract: Complex systems produce high-dimensional signals that lack macroscopic variables analogous to entropy, temperature, or free energy. This work introduces a thermoinformational formulation that derives entropy, internal energy, temperature, and Helmholtz free energy directly from empirical microstate distributions of arbitrary datasets. The approach provides a data-driven description of how a system reorganizes, exchanges information, and moves between stable and unstable states. Applied to dual-EEG recordings from mother-infant dyads performing the A-not-B task, the formulation captures increases in informational heat during switches and errors, and reveals that correct choices arise from more stable, low-temperature states. In an independent optogenetic dam-pup experiment, the same variables separate stimulation conditions and trace coherent trajectories in thermodynamic state space. Across both human and rodent systems, this thermoinformational formulation yields compact and physically interpretable macroscopic variables that generalize across species, modalities, and experimental paradigms.

                arXiv:2505.22563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding whether large language models (LLMs) and the human brain converge on similar computational principles remains a fundamental and important question in cognitive neuroscience and AI. Do the brain-like patterns observed in LLMs emerge simply from scaling, or do they reflect deeper alignment with the architecture of human language processing? This study focuses on the sentence-level neural mechanisms of language models, systematically investigating how hierarchical representations in LLMs align with the dynamic neural responses during human sentence comprehension. By comparing hierarchical embeddings from 14 publicly available LLMs with fMRI data collected from participants, who were exposed to a naturalistic narrative story, we constructed sentence-level neural prediction models to precisely identify the model layers most significantly correlated with brain region activations. Results show that improvements in model performance drive the evolution of representational architectures toward brain-like hierarchies, particularly achieving stronger functional and anatomical correspondence at higher semantic abstraction levels.

                arXiv:2511.22554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fall detection for elderly care using non-invasive vision-based systems remains an important yet unsolved problem. Driven by strict privacy requirements, inference must run at the edge of the vision sensor, demanding robust, real-time, and always-on perception under tight hardware constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a neuromorphic fall detection system that integrates the Sony IMX636 event-based vision sensor with the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic processor via a dedicated FPGA-based interface, leveraging the sparsity of event data together with near-memory asynchronous processing. Using a newly recorded dataset under diverse environmental conditions, we explore the design space of sparse neural networks deployable on a single Loihi 2 chip and analyze the tradeoffs between detection F1 score and computational cost. Notably, on the Pareto front, our LIF-based convolutional SNN with graded spikes achieves the highest computational efficiency, reaching a 55x synaptic operations sparsity for an F1 score of 58%. The LIF with graded spikes shows a gain of 6% in F1 score with 5x less operations compared to binary spikes. Furthermore, our MCUNet feature extractor with patched inference, combined with the S4D state space model, achieves the highest F1 score of 84% with a synaptic operations sparsity of 2x and a total power consumption of 90 mW on Loihi 2. Overall, our smart security camera proof-of-concept highlights the potential of integrating neuromorphic sensing and processing for edge AI applications where latency, energy consumption, and privacy are critical.

                arXiv:2511.23354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Program synthesis is the process of generating a computer program following a set of specifications, such as a set of input-output examples. It can be modeled as a search problem in which the search space is the set of all valid programs. As the search space is vast, brute force is usually not feasible, and search heuristics, such as genetic programming, also have difficulty navigating it without guidance. This text presents 2 novel GP algorithms that synthesize pure, typed, and functional programs: HOTGP and Origami. HOTGP uses strong types and a functional grammar, synthesizing Haskell code, with support for higher-order functions, $\lambda$-functions, and parametric polymorphism. Experimental results show that HOTGP is competitive with the state of the art. Additionally, Origami is an algorithm that tackles the challenge of effectively handling loops and recursion by exploring Recursion Schemes, in which the programs are composed of well-defined templates with only a few parts that need to be synthesized. The first implementation of Origami can synthesize solutions in several Recursion Schemes and data structures, being competitive with other GP methods in the literature, as well as LLMs. The latest version of Origami employs a novel procedure, called AC/DC, designed to improve the search-space exploration. It achieves considerable improvement over its previous version by raising success rates on every problem. Compared to similar methods in the literature, it has the highest count of problems solved with success rates of $100\%$, $\geq 75\%$, and $\geq 25\%$ across all benchmarks. In $18\%$ of all benchmark problems, it stands as the only method to reach $100\%$ success rate, being the first known approach to achieve it on any problem in PSB2. It also demonstrates competitive performance to LLMs, achieving the highest overall win-rate against Copilot among all GP methods.

                arXiv:2511.22024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We liberate Equilibrium Propagation (EP) from the limit of infinitesimal perturbations by establishing a finite-nudge foundation for local credit assignment. By modeling network states as Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions rather than deterministic points, we prove that the gradient of the difference in Helmholtz free energy between a nudged and free phase is exactly the difference in expected local energy derivatives. This validates the classic Contrastive Hebbian Learning update as an exact gradient estimator for arbitrary finite nudging, requiring neither infinitesimal approximations nor convexity. Furthermore, we derive a generalized EP algorithm based on the path integral of loss-energy covariances, enabling learning with strong error signals that standard infinitesimal approximations cannot support.

                arXiv:2511.22059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a powerful framework for predicting nonlinear dynamical systems, yet the role of reservoir topology$-$particularly symmetry in connectivity and weights$-$remains not adequately understood. This work investigates how the structure of the network influences the performance of RC in four systems of increasing complexity: the Mackey-Glass system with delayed-feedback, two low-dimensional thermal convection models, and a three-dimensional shear flow model exhibiting transition to turbulence. Using five reservoir topologies in which connectivity patterns and edge weights are controlled independently, we evaluate both direct- and cross-prediction tasks. The results show that symmetric reservoir networks substantially improve prediction accuracy for the convection-based systems, especially when the input dimension is smaller than the number of degrees of freedom. In contrast, the shear-flow model displays almost no sensitivity to topological symmetry due to its strongly chaotic high-dimensional dynamics. These findings reveal how structural properties of reservoir networks affect their ability to learn complex dynamics and provide guidance for designing more effective RC architectures.

                arXiv:2511.22813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit remarkable intelligence: they maintain internal states, communicate selectively with other neurons, and self-organize into complex graphs rather than rigid hierarchical layers. What if artificial intelligence could emerge from similarly intelligent computational units? We introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN), a paradigm shift where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers.
  Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals), enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions. On the standard Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. Crucially, a parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (>3.4 BPC) under the same training protocol, demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability. Ablation studies confirm this: removing inter-neuron communication degrades performance or leads to instability, proving the value of learned neural routing.
  This work demonstrates that neuron-centric design with graph organization is not merely bio-inspired -- it is computationally effective, opening new directions for modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures.

Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a "Ridge of Optimization" characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to "Spectral Concentration," its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the "Edge of Stability," a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.

                arXiv:2408.10488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a core task in the field of AI-assisted disability. Traditional SLT methods are typically based on visible light videos, which are easily affected by factors such as lighting variations, rapid hand movements, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes the use of bio-inspired event cameras to alleviate the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we introduce a new high-definition event-based sign language dataset, termed Event-CSL, which effectively addresses the data scarcity in this research area. The dataset comprises 14,827 videos, 14,821 glosses, and 2,544 Chinese words in the text vocabulary. These samples are collected across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, covering multiple viewpoints, lighting conditions, and camera motions. We have also benchmarked existing mainstream SLT methods on this dataset to facilitate fair comparisons in future research.Furthermore, we propose a novel event-based sign language translation framework, termed EvSLT. The framework first segments continuous video features into clips and employs a Mamba-based memory aggregation module to compress and aggregate spatial detail features at the clip level. Subsequently, these spatial features, along with temporal representations obtained from temporal convolution, are then fused by a graph-guided spatiotemporal fusion module. Extensive experiments on Event-CSL, as well as other publicly available datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenESL

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01218">Quantitative Attractor Analysis of High-Capacity Kernel Hopfield Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01218v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods such as Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) can substantially increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, but the principles governing their performance and stability remain largely uncharacterized. This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the attractor landscape in KLR-trained networks to establish a solid foundation for their design and application. Through extensive, statistically validated simulations, we address critical questions of generality, scalability, and robustness. Our comparative analysis shows that KLR and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) exhibit similarly high storage capacities and clean attractor landscapes under typical operating conditions, suggesting that this behavior is a general property of kernel regression methods, although KRR is computationally much faster. We identify a non-trivial, scale-dependent law for the kernel width $\gamma$, demonstrating that optimal capacity requires $\gamma$ to be scaled such that $\gamma N$ increases with network size $N$. This finding implies that larger networks require more localized kernels, in which each pattern's influence is more spatially confined, to mitigate inter-pattern interference. Under this optimized scaling, we provide clear evidence that storage capacity scales linearly with network size~($P \propto N$). Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis shows that performance is remarkably robust with respect to the choice of the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Collectively, these findings provide a concise set of empirical principles for designing high-capacity and robust associative memories and clarify the mechanisms that enable kernel methods to overcome the classical limitations of Hopfield-type models.

                arXiv:2505.13124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation. However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings. Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023; Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". By analysing the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and depths. Our results serve as a first step towards scaling PC to more complex architectures and have implications for other local algorithms. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for PCNs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08653">Accelerating Training of Recursive Reasoning Models with Curriculum Guided Adaptive Recursion</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.08653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13053">Self-Organization and Spectral Mechanism of Attractor Landscapes in High-Capacity Kernel Hopfield Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.13053v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods can dramatically increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, yet the dynamical mechanism behind this enhancement remains poorly understood. We address this gap by unifying the geometric analysis of the attractor landscape with the spectral theory of kernel machines. Using a novel metric, "Pinnacle Sharpness," we first uncover a rich phase diagram of attractor stability, identifying a "Ridge of Optimization" where the network achieves maximal robustness under high-load conditions. Phenomenologically, this ridge is characterized by a "Force Antagonism," where a strong driving force is balanced by a collective feedback force. Theoretically, we reveal that this phenomenon arises from a specific reorganization of the weight spectrum, which we term \textit{Spectral Concentration}. Unlike a simple rank-1 collapse, our analysis shows that the network on the ridge self-organizes into a critical state: the leading eigenvalue is amplified to maximize global stability (Direct Force), while the trailing eigenvalues are preserved to maintain high memory capacity (Indirect Force). These findings provide a complete physical picture of how high-capacity associative memories are formed, demonstrating that optimal performance is achieved by tuning the system to a spectral "Goldilocks zone" between rank collapse and diffusion.

">Neurochemically-evoked activity in slice preparations of the octopus arm nerve cord</a></h4>

              
                Octopus arms contain circuits that support local sensorimotor integration and autonomy, responsible for fast and flexible behaviors, but their population dynamics remain unknown. The axial nerve cord (ANC) is a series of sucker-associated ganglia whose cortex layer houses multiple classes of intermingled neurons. Here we use calcium imaging in ex vivo slices from arms of Octopus bocki, to visualize how these networks respond to controlled application of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Glutamate and dopamine are dominant excitatory drivers that activate most neurons in the ANC cortex, with a substantial overlapping populations and smaller transmitter-specific subsets. Glutamate continues to excite additional neurons at higher concentration, whereas dopamine responses saturate. Serotonin alone evokes mixed responses but, when applied first, consistently reduces glutamate- and dopamine-driven activation, revealing a state-dependent modulatory role. GABA and octopamine yield weak heterologous effects, and high-dose acetylcholine sharply suppresses global ANC neuronal activity while inducing muscular contraction, consistent with inhibitory cholinergic receptors in arm ganglia. Across conditions, responsive neurons show no evidence of spatial structure, with no clear anatomical segregation by transmitter response profiles. These results provide the first link between neurochemical architecture and real-time firing dynamics in a semi-autonomous circuit.

">Structure and function of the nervous system in the stem of the siphonophore Nanomia septata: its role in swimming coordination.</a></h4>

              
                The multiple swimming bells, or nectophores, of the colonial hydrozoan Nanomia septata are capable of coordinated avoidance swims in both forward and reverse directions. Individual nectophores also contribute to slower forms of swimming during foraging. Communication between a nectophore and the rest of the colony is at cone-shaped structures in the colony stem. The stem provides an attachment point for the nectophores and houses the simple nervous system responsible for their coordination. The stem nervous system, revealed by immunocytochemistry, has three main components: two giant axons, a distributed, polygonal nerve network and a set of FMRFamide-immunoreactive nerve tracts. Whereas the nerve network is distributed throughout the stem, the nerve tracts link specific contra-lateral nectophores. Action potentials in the giant axons spread excitation rapidly along the stem, but their connection with individual nectophores is by way of the nerve network. Anatomical evidence is provided for the location of two connecting pathways between the nerve network and the nectophore; one excites an epithelial impulse and leads to reverse swimming; the other provides excitation for forward swimming by feeding into a ganglion-like cluster of nerve cells. Excitation passes to the swimming muscle epithelium by way of a single nerve axon and a nerve ring at the nectophore margin. The work presents physiological evidence for mechanisms, such as facilitation and summation, operating within a multifunctional, bidirectional nerve network, responsible for coordinating epithelial and neural signals in an early-evolved nervous system containing both condensed and distributed units.

">Reverse Spatiotemporal Hierarchy during Cross-modal Memory Recall and Imagery</a></h4>

              
                Recalling past events is often accompanied by mental imagery of those experiences. Based on previous research, this process engages memory- and sensory-related brain areas. However, the underlying spatiotemporal dynamics remain poorly investigated. Here, we used naturalistic videos of audiovisual events and recorded fMRI data during the tasks in which human participants recalled visual contents when hearing associated sounds and recalled sounds when watching silent videos, after they had well memorized the video contents. With time-resolved fMRI multivariate pattern analyses, we observed reverse spatiotemporal hierarchy during the visual memory recall and imagery: the neural activity in primary visual cortex was delayed compared with high-order visual areas. A similar pattern was found during auditory memory recall and imagery, where the bottom-up progression from the mid-level planum temporale to the high-level superior temporal gyrus observed during auditory perception was absent. However, the primary auditory area was not involved, suggesting modality differences in the role of primary sensory areas in corresponding memory recall. We also observed the activity of the hippocampus, the parahippocampal cortex, the retrosplenial cortex, and the precuneus and examined their temporal dynamics. Overall, our study provided both spatial and temporal accounts of neural activity during the cross-modal memory recall and imagery.

">Domain-specific decoupling of co-chaperone and ligase functions in STUB1 underlies biochemical and clinical heterogeneity in SCA48</a></h4>

              
                The carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP, encoded by STUB1) integrates co-chaperone and E3 ubiquitin ligase activities to maintain proteostasis. Heterozygous STUB1 mutations cause the dominant cerebellar ataxia SCA48 through incompletely understood mechanisms. We characterized 13 SCA48-associated variants in the TPR and U-box domains using recombinant protein and cellular assays. TPR mutations retained intrinsic ligase activity but lost HSC70 binding, substrate ubiquitination efficiency, and protein stability. Conversely, U-box mutations abolished ligase function, induced aberrant high-molecular-weight oligomerization, and frequently elevated steady-state CHIP levels while only partially impairing co-chaperone activity. Many variants exhibited temperature-sensitive defects and stress-induced nuclear mislocalization. Principal component analysis revealed robust domain-specific biochemical clustering. RNA-seq following STUB1 knockdown demonstrated preserved HSF1-dependent transactivation but a loss of CHIP-dependent amplification of ubiquitination, chaperone, and transcriptional pathways under heat stress. Meta-analysis of 87 SCA48 patients linked TPR-like biochemical profiles to upper motor neuron involvement and U-box profiles to prominent dysarthria. Collectively, SCA48 mutations decouple CHIPs dual functions in a domain-dependent manner, exerting dominant-negative or gain-of-toxic effects that drive the observed clinical heterogeneity. These findings establish a direct biochemical-clinical correlation in SCA48 and provide a framework for domain-targeted therapeutic strategies exploiting residual ligase or chaperone activity.

                TDP-43 nuclear depletion in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) causes de-repression of cryptic exons (CEs) in multiple transcripts, including UNC13A and STMN2, disrupting synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth. We developed a therapeutic U7 snRNA (tU7) approach that suppresses TDP-43-dependent mis-splicing, restores target gene expression, rescues neuronal functions in human iPSC-derived neurons, and shows target engagement in vivo, positioning tU7-mediated splicing correction as a promising therapeutic strategy for ALS.

">Preclinical Evaluation of a Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent for Intracranial Application: A 30-Day GLP Canine Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Zotarolimus-Eluting Stents (ZES) are increasingly used off-label for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). However, foundational, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) compliant preclinical safety data specific to the cerebral vasculature is lacking. Therefore, we conducted the first systematic evaluation of the technical feasibility, anatomic features, and 30-day clinical safety profile of the Onyx Frontier ZES (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) in a GLP-compliant canine intracranial model. Methods: In a prospective GLP study, a 2.0 x 8.0 mm Onyx Frontier ZES was implanted in the basilar artery of twelve healthy mongrel canines pre-treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. Vertebral artery tortuosity was assessed via angiography and graded as Type I (non-tortuous/straight), Type II (moderately tortuous/S-shaped), or Type III (severely tortuous/coiled). The primary endpoints were procedural success and 30-day safety, assessed via angiography, serial neurological examinations, and comprehensive clinical monitoring. Results: Technical success was achieved in 100% of animals (12/12). The cohort exhibited challenging anatomy, with a mean basilar artery diameter of 1.39 {+/-} 0.10 mm. Tortuosity analysis revealed that 33.3% of animals were Type I (mild), 58.3% were Type II (moderate), and 8.3% were Type III (severe). Post-procedure, mild vasospasm was observed in all cases, with only one canine requiring intra-arterial verapamil. A single case (8.3%) of self-limiting contrast extravasation occurred without clinical sequelae. At 30 days, there was no mortality, and no animals suffered a neurological adverse event. Minor clinical events were unrelated to the device, and comprehensive clinical pathology panels revealed no evidence of systemic toxicity or a significant inflammatory response. Conclusion: This first-of-its-kind preclinical study demonstrates that implantation of the Onyx Frontier ZES is technically feasible with a 100% success rate in a sub-2mm vessel model with significant tortuosity and has an excellent 30-day safety profile with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity. These findings provide foundational preclinical data supporting further investigation of this technology for treating ICAD in human subjects.

     alt="Serum miR-598-3p as a Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker for Traumatic Brain Injury: Involvement in Modulating Microglial Inflammation"/>
<p>Serum miR-598-3p, a multifunctional biomarker in TBI, is elevated in patients, with potential for diagnosis, severity stratification, and prognostic prediction. In vitro, its inhibition reduces microglial inflammatory cytokine release, indicating a role in neuroinflammation modulation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results from external mechanical forces causing brain dysfunction. Dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in TBI pathophysiology, but the role of miR-598-3p remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR-598-3p in TBI and explore its regulatory effects on inflammation in an LPS-induced microglial injury model. Serum miR-598-3p levels were measured via RT-qPCR in 137 TBI patients and 120 controls. ROC curves assessed its diagnostic and prognostic utility. TBI severity was classified by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, and outcomes were evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). In vitro, LPS-treated BV2 microglia were transfected with a miR-598-3p inhibitor to analyze inflammatory cytokine levels. miR-598-3p expression was significantly elevated in TBI patients versus controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and increased progressively with injury severity. ROC analysis demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing TBI severity (AUC = 0.892/0.905) and predicting poor prognosis (AUC = 0.891, sensitivity = 83.33%, specificity = 90.36%). High miR-598-3p expression correlated with elevated Marshall grades, neural injury markers (S100B, GFAP), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-<i>α</i>). Multivariate analysis identified miR-598-3p as an independent risk factor for poor outcomes (OR = 5.03, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). miR-598-3p inhibition attenuated LPS-induced IL-6/TNF-<i>α</i> secretion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Serum miR-598-3p demonstrates clinical utility as a biomarker for TBI diagnosis, severity grading, and prognostic evaluation. Its observed association with amplified microglial inflammatory responses suggests a potential mechanism involving regulation of neuroinflammation pathways.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is increasingly used for pediatric large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke, however, its role in isolated M2 occlusions remains underexplored. This study compared clinical outcomes in children with isolated M2 occlusion treated with EVT versus best medical therapy (BMT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter cohort study pooled data from 4 pediatric stroke registries (Save ChildS, KidClot, Pediatric LVO Study, and Save ChildS Pro). Children ages 28 days–17 years with isolated M2 occlusion presenting within 24 hours of last seen well were included. Primary outcome was the pediatric modified Rankin scale (ped-mRS) at 3 to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (PedNIHSS), Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM), and safety endpoints.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty patients were included, of whom 20 were treated with EVT (median age, 12 years; interquartile range [IQR], 6–15; 40% female) and 20 with BMT only (10 years; IQR, 5–14; 50% female). Baseline demographics were similar. EVT patients showed superior outcomes: median ped-mRS at 3 to 6 months was 1 versus 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.015). EVT resulted in greater PedNIHSS reduction from admission to day 7 (−9 vs −1, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and lower PSOM at 3 to 6 months (0.5 vs 2.5, <i>p</i> = 0.009). This benefit persisted at 24 months with a median ped-mRS of 1 (IQR, 0–2) in the EVT group and 2 (IQR, 1–3) in the BMT group (<i>p</i> = 0.012). One symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in the BMT group, and no deaths or access-site complications were reported.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In children with isolated M2 occlusion, EVT was associated with better functional outcomes and neurological recovery than medical therapy alone, with an acceptable safety profile. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this population-based study, we described the epidemiology of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) in northern Italy and compared the clinical characteristics of patients with PLS to those with predominant upper motor neuron (PUMN) involvement and classic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients from the PARALS registry diagnosed with probable or definite PLS between 2007 and 2021 were included. Crude annual incidence rates were calculated, along with age- and sex-specific rates. A survival analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors at diagnosis. Covariates included sex, age at onset, site of onset, diagnostic delay, forced vital capacity (FVC), change in ALS Functional Rating Scale (ΔFRS), and change in body mass index (ΔBMI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 57 PLS patients (2.7%) were included, with a crude incidence rate of 0.084 per 100,000 person-years. Compared to PUMN and classic ALS, PLS patients were younger (median onset age 63.5 years, interquartile range [IQR] 54.9–70.4) and predominantly female (male-to-female ratio 0.58). Bulbar onset occurred in 11 cases (19.3%), all of whom later developed spinal symptoms. At censoring, 38 patients (66.7%) were still alive (median survival 8.3 years, IQR 5.7–12.3), corresponding to a point prevalence of 0.89 per 100,000. Survival was significantly associated with age at onset (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05–1.33, <i>p</i> = 0.001), male sex (HR 4.41, 95% CI: 1.24–15.6, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and FVC at diagnosis (HR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.93–0.98, <i>p</i> = 0.006).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PLS was confirmed to be rarer than other ALS phenotypes. Patients had a higher age at onset than previously reported and a female predominance. Sex, age at onset, and respiratory function were key prognostic factors. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background Efficient inventory management is a critical internal capability for ensuring the financial sustainability of micro and small enterprises, especially in emerging economies affected by post-pandemic disruptions. In Bagua, Peru, MSMEs often lack digitised control systems, leading to frequent stock imbalances, rushed purchases at high prices, and lower profitability; a deeper understanding of inventory practices that drive financial performance can contribute to more informed and strategic decision-making. Method This quantitative, descriptive, and explanatory study examined the effects of four components of inventory management—control, valuation methods, control records, and measurement—on profitability; a convenience sample of 83 MSMEs yielded 200 valid responses from key personnel involved in inventory decisions; A 21-item Likert scale validated by experts was applied, and the data were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression in SPSS v27. Profitability indicators included return on assets (ROA), gross margin (GM), and return on equity (ROE). Results All dimensions of the inventory showed moderate levels of implementation (means: 2.37–2.62 on a five-point scale). The regression model demonstrated satisfactory predictive power (R2 = 0.402; F = 32.81; p < 0.001). Inventory measurement was the strongest and only highly significant predictor of profitability (β = 0.383; p < 0.001), followed by inventory control, with a smaller but significant contribution (β = 0.257; p = 0.013). Inventory valuation methods and control records did not show statistically significant direct effects (p > 0.40). Conclusion The findings highlight that decision-oriented measurement practices, supported by systematic control, are essential factors for the financial performance of micro and small enterprises; investment in digital monitoring tools, replenishment based on key performance indicators, and staff training could improve operational and financial efficiency; due to its cross-sectional design and localised context, future studies should incorporate longitudinal data and broader geographical comparisons to strengthen generalisation and explore possible mediation pathways between accounting-oriented practices and profitability.

                Background Cerebral computed tomography angiography (CTA) is widely used to assess neurovascular disorders, but venous contamination often obscures arteries. Optimizing bolus-tracking thresholds is crucial, yet patient factors influencing contrast dynamics and the value of radiation dose indices in head CTA remain unclear. Objectives To optimize bolus-tracking thresholds in cerebral CTA by examining patient-related influences on enhancement and radiation metrics. Methods 126 adults undergoing cerebral CTA were evaluated in this prospective study. Demographics, physiologic parameters, peak enhancement time (PET), peak enhancement attenuation (PEA), and dose indices (CTDIvol, SSDE) were recorded. Linear regression identified predictors of enhancement. Two blinded radiologists graded venous contamination. ROC analysis, including age subgroups, determined the optimal HU threshold. Results Median age was 55.5 years; 70% were male. PET rose with age (+0.086 s/year, p < 0.001) and was shorter in females (–2.39 s, p = 0.003). PEA increased with threshold (+1.03 HU/unit, p < 0.001). Arterial enhancement was higher in females (+40.7 HU, p < 0.001) and patients ≥60 years (+70 HU, p < 0.001). Venous enhancement correlated with PET (p = 0.023) and systolic pressure (p = 0.002). ROC analysis showed an optimal threshold of 105 ± 5 HU (AUC = 0.634; sensitivity 88.4%, specificity 77.1%). CTDIvol, but not SSDE, correlated with weight (p = 0.015). Conclusion Intrinsic (age, gender) and extrinsic (threshold) factors shape CTA enhancement. A 105 ± 5 HU threshold reduces venous contamination, especially in younger patients. CTDIvol remains the preferred dose index. Findings support individualized, resource-efficient CTA protocols aligned with UN SDGs 3, 9, and 12.

                Atakkatan et al. identify a distinct subset of C3+IL-33+ adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) that drives allergic inflammation by maintaining ILC2 responses. In turn, ILC2-derived IL-13 supports AF function, thus engaging in a pro-allergic dialogue that promotes type 2 immunity.

">Predicting functional topography of the human visual cortex from cortical anatomy at scale</a></h4>

              
                Topographic organization is a fundamental principle of the brain, whereby adjacent cortical locations represent adjacent features in sensory or cognitive space. Current methodologies for obtaining individual-specific topographic maps either require resource-intensive functional neuroimaging data or, when using population atlases, lack precision for individual-level inference, limiting large-scale studies of individual differences. Here, we developed deepRetinotopy toolbox, a deep learning-based application for predicting topographic organization of the human visual cortex from cortical anatomy. We show that our toolbox accurately predicts retinotopic organization using only standard structural MRI scans acquired under diverse conditions, including varying imaging sites and scanner types. We then demonstrate that predicted maps can be leveraged to automatically generate individual-specific visual area boundaries, overcoming common biases in manual annotations. Finally, we estimate age-related changes in visual cortex organization by retrospectively applying our method to 11,060 anatomical scans, revealing that group differences in primary visual cortex organization are predictable from cortical anatomy.

">Top-down feedback can explain the existence of working memory traces in early visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The temporary storage of visual memories is known to engage early visual cortex (EVC), where mnemonic content is presumed to be stored in weak or latent states. Two mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this storage: Top-down feedback from anterior cortical sites, and short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) traces laid down by previous sensory inputs. Here, we tested if these mechanisms can account for two hallmarks of working memory, namely, the flexible selection of information from working memory, and the robustness of working memory against distraction. Simulating firing rates in a neural network model of working memory, we show that STSP cannot easily account for selection of information from within the working memory store, and is not robust to visual distraction. Rather, any input that passes through the visual system is briefly remembered, irrespective of its relevance. In contrast, top-down feedback can establish durable mnemonic signals in EVC that reflect currently task-relevant working memory contents and are robust to distraction. We argue that feedback is a parsimonious explanation for the existence of mnemonic signals in EVC, given that the storage of working memories is distributed across a hierarchy of cortical sites, which are known to have widespread feedback projections to visual cortex.

">High-Frequency Activity Encodes the Temporal Dynamics of Hierarchical Prediction Errors in Humans: An Electrocorticography Study</a></h4>

              
                Prediction error refers to the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory input. Its hierarchical organization has been demonstrated through decomposed brain responses in the local-global paradigm, where temporal regularities are established locally at individual stimulus transitions and globally across multi-tone sequence structures. In macaques and marmosets, local and global prediction-error signals have both been found in high-frequency oscillations (60-150 Hz) recorded with ECoG. In humans, however, these signals have primarily been observed in a lower frequency range (30-100 Hz) using EEG. Here, we recorded human ECoG to achieve higher signal fidelity, enabling examination of neural oscillations above 100 Hz (high-frequency activity, HFA), which are believed to be closely linked to local spiking activity. Eight participants listened to auditory sequences that either followed their local and global regularities (local and global standards) or violated them (local and global deviants). Robust HFA responses were observed for the local deviants, but these responses were reduced when the deviants were expected based on the global regularity, indicating both levels of prediction-error processes contribute to the observed activity. Importantly, these HFA responses could be decomposed into two subcomponents: an early component reflecting local prediction-error signals localized to lateral auditory regions, and a late component reflecting global prediction-error signals prominent in both lateral auditory and frontal cortices. Together, these findings demonstrate that neural oscillations above 100 Hz encode hierarchical prediction errors not only in non-human primates but also in humans.

">Flexible selection of working memory representations to reduce cognitive cost</a></h4>

              
                Across psychology, economics, and decision science, it is well established that choosing a good internal representation can make complex problems easier to solve. This idea, central to theories of bounded rationality and heuristics, suggests that intelligent behavior depends not only on what is stored in working memory, but on the format in which it is stored. Whether non-human animals flexibly select internal formats, and how such choices are implemented in neural circuits, has remained unclear. Here we show that rats adjust the format of working memory to reduce cognitive load. When a task encourages an action-based code, rats maintain the relevant information as a stable motor plan supported by frontal cortex. When the same task is reformulated to make this code costly, they instead store a sensory trace in auditory cortex. These strategy shifts are rapid and reliable, revealing that rats can switch between distinct neural circuits to store information in the most economical internal format. These results demonstrate that flexible representational selection is not unique to humans but is present in rodents and reflected in circuit-level reallocation of working memory. This establishes a neural basis for classic theories linking problem representation to computational efficiency and provides a path toward a neural circuit-level description of selecting internal formats to reduce cognitive costs.

">Alternative Anastrozole Target CYP4V2 Impairs Neurons in Preclinical Models of Inherited Tauopathy</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies, including Alzheimer disease, are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the pathological aggregation of the microtubule associated protein Tau (MAPT). This study explores the neuroprotective properties of anastrozole, a clinical Aromatase inhibitor, in both a Drosophila tauopathy model expressing human MAPTR406W and isogenic pairs of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons expressing MAPT mutations. The Aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, initially identified in a Drosophila MAPTR406W drug screen, reduced oxidative stress and Tau phosphorylation in cultured cortical neurons. Its protective effects were not mediated by Aromatase activity or cholesterol metabolism: screening in Drosophila identified CYP4V2 as a potential off-target. Knockdown of CYP4V2 in MAPTR406W neurons recapitulated protection against oxidative stress-induced cell death. These findings position anastrozole and its off-target CYP4V2 as novel therapeutic avenues for primary tauopathies and potentially Alzheimer disease and related dementias by reducing Tau phosphorylation and susceptibility to oxidative stress.

">AAV-mediated regeneration of neurons in injury-induced and inherited retinal degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Loss of retinal neurons is a leading cause of irreversible vision impairment, yet adult mammalian retinas lack the ability to regenerate these cells. In this study, we developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based strategy to reprogram endogenous Muller glia into retinal neurons. Using stringent genetic lineage tracing, immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology and single-cell multiomic profiling, we show that AAV delivery of a stabilized, phospho-insensitive Neurogenin2 variant (Neurog2-9SA) efficiently converts Muller glia into multiple types of retinal neurons, including bipolar, starburst amacrine, and a small population of photoreceptor-like cells, in both injury-induced and inherited retinal degeneration models. The generated neurons exhibit electrical properties of retinal neurons, light-evoked responses and integrate into existing retinal circuitry. Single-cell multiomics analysis reveal that Neurog2-9SA induces reprogramming by remodeling chromatin accessibility, activating neurogenic transcriptional networks, and represses glial identity programs. Inhibiting Notch signaling markedly enhances reprogramming efficiency. Together, these findings establish Neurog2-9SA as a potent and clinically relevant factor for AAV-mediated reprogramming and provide a foundation for approaches to regenerate neuronal cells and restore function in retinal diseases.

">Efficient in vivo mammalian neuron editing using peptide-mediated CRISPR enzyme delivery</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR-mediated genome editing of the central nervous system (CNS) has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD). However, the development of CRISPR therapeutics for the CNS has been hindered by challenges associated with delivery, specifically the lack of a clinically compatible, non-viral delivery technology facilitating genome editing of neurons in vivo. For most indications, two key obstacles must be overcome before therapeutic genome editing of the brain is feasible: non-toxic intracellular delivery of CRISPR cargo into neurons and establishment of strategies enabling targeted brain regions to be edited efficiently. While viral vectors have shown promise in pre-clinical models, non-viral approaches present distinct advantages: ease of manufacture as well as the transient presence of CRISPR machinery, which tempers risks of genotoxicity and immunogenicity. Peptide-enabled ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery of CRISPR (PERC) has emerged as a promising non-viral delivery strategy for CRISPR enzymes with initial use in primary human immune cells. In this study, we report the development of Neuro-PERC, a streamlined and optimized approach for in vivo editing of mammalian neurons. Administration of Neuro-PERC reagents via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) mediated efficient and well-tolerated neuronal genome editing. Neuro-PERC enabled robust neuronal editing in the brain of both small and large animal reporter models, and increased survival in a severe murine model of Huntington's disease. These results establish CED-administered Neuro-PERC as a candidate delivery technology to hasten clinical translation of CRISPR-based therapies for diseases of the CNS.

">PKU tags, novel genetically encoded shape tags for cell labeling in light and electron microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Distinguishing among neuronal cell types is crucial for deciphering complex neural networks and brain functions. However, the current repertoire of cell-labeling tools compatible with light microscopy (LM) and/or electron microscopy (EM) is limited compared to the vast number of cell types in the brain. Here, we introduce PKU (polymer king-size unit) tags, genetically encoded shape tags that leverage the polymerization of self-assembling proteins, spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins and, optionally, a nuclear targeting sequence to generate a series of multi-shaped (spherical or filamentous), multi-colored (blue, green, red, near-infrared) and multi-localized (cytosolic or nuclear) tags. By co-expressing multiple PKU tags within the same cell, a combinatorial strategy further expands the repertoire, which can theoretically yield hundreds of unique labeling patterns. Expressing PKU tags in vivo provides multi-cell-type labeling and neuronal circuit tracing, without altering the animal's behavior or transcriptomic profiles. Moreover, when fused to the peroxidase APEX2, PKU tags maintain their shape-specific features, providing shape barcoding using EM. Thus, PKU tags represent a versatile and efficient toolkit for studying connectomics using both LM and EM.

">Oligodendrocytes show enriched expression of amyloid precursor protein and GABA B receptor isoform 1a</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes proteolytic processing to generate amyloid-{beta}, the main component of amyloid plaques found in brains with Alzheimer's disease. The proteolytic processing of APP also generates soluble APP alpha (sAPPa) which can modulate synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth through the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR). Whether GABABR mediates functions of sAPPa; in other neural cell types such as glia remains unknown. sAPPa; binds the R1a subunit isoform of GABABR1 which contains two sushi domains absent in R1b. It is unclear whether both GABABR1 isoforms are expressed equally across brain cell types. We determined relative RNA levels of the GABABR1a and 1b isoforms in oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons in adult mice using two approaches. We developed a GABABR1 isoform-specific RNAseq analysis workflow to probe a publicly available dataset generated by Zhang et al. (2014). We also isolated five cell types from a single mouse brain and performed RT-qPCR. We show that the GABABR1a and 1b isoforms are differentially expressed among cell types. GABABR1a expression was highest in oligodendrocytes and GABABR1b expression was highest in astrocytes, suggesting that sAPPa-mediated GABABR signaling may be most prominent in oligodendrocytes. We also confirmed that APP is expressed in all five cell types and showed that APP RNA levels are highest in oligodendrocytes. Together, our findings uncover cell type-specific expression of GABABR isoforms and highlight oligodendrocytes as a principal cell type for GABABR1a-mediated APP signaling, providing a foundation for future mechanistic studies.

">Neuronal APOE4 alone is sufficient to drive tau pathology, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), exacerbates tau tangles, amyloid plaques, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation -- the pathological hallmarks of AD. While astrocytes are the primary producers of APOE in the CNS, neurons increase APOE expression under stress and aging. Prior work established that neuronal APOE4 is essential for AD pathogenesis, but whether it is sufficient to drive disease remained unknown. We generated a PS19 tauopathy mouse model selectively expressing APOE4 in neurons. Neuronal APOE4 alone proved sufficient to promote pathological tau accumulation and propagation, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation to levels comparable to a tauopathy model with human APOE4 knocked-in globally. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing further revealed similar transcriptomic changes in neurons and glia of both models. Together, these findings demonstrate that neuronal APOE4 alone can initiate and propagate AD pathologies, underscoring its pivotal role in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

">The Dominant Hand-Area Network: Task-Signal Mismatch and the Decoupling of BCI Skill from Global Efficiency in Postural Motor Imagery</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: The neurophysiological basis of motor imagery (MI) is foundational to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development. While BCI decoding relies on local sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), MI itself is a large-scale network process. It is an open, and clinically critical question whether an individual's BCI decoding skill is related to global network integration. This is complicated when the instructed task (e.g., postural imagery) differs from the underlying neurophysiological signal (e.g., hand-area SMRs). This study investigates the network dynamics of this task-signal mismatch and its relation to BCI performance. Methods: We analyzed a 64-channel EEG dataset of 32 healthy participants (from the OpenNeuro dataset ds005342 cohort) performing a cued motor imagery task (e.g., "sit-to-stand") contrasted against an idle state. BCI decoding performance was quantified using a Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) pipeline with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers. We then constructed functional brain networks from the beta (13-30 Hz) band using Phase-Locking Value (PLV) and spectral Granger Causality (GC). Graph theory was employed to analyze network topology, and we correlated individual BCI accuracy with global network efficiency in both sensor and source space. Results: BCI performance was robustly high (LDA (Mean: 82.10% {+/-} 8.80% SD)), 95% CI [78.92%, 85.28%], p < 10-20), confirming a high-fidelity local SMR signal. Strikingly, CSP analysis revealed this signal originated not from the expected leg-area (Cz), but from the hand-area sensorimotor cortex (C3/C4) (See Figure 4). Despite this local-signal fidelity, this decoding skill was critically decoupled from whole-brain network integration, showing no correlation of BCI accuracy with global efficiency, in either sensor space (r (30) = 0.189, p = 0.299) or, more critically, in source space (r (30) = -0.054, p = 0.769, 95% CI [-0.395, 0.300]). Our network analysis, centered on this C3/C4-dominant signal, revealed a novel, hypothetical M1-centric model: the motor cortex (C3/C4) acted as the primary information broadcaster (via GC), driving activity in prefrontal coordinating hubs (F3/Fz). Furthermore, the MI state was characterized by a dynamic reconfiguration, increasing the information-gating centrality of the premotor (FC1) node while suppressing the parietal (P3) node. Conclusion: BCI decoding skill reflects a local process driven by SMR signal fidelity from the dominant hand area--even during non-hand tasks--rather than a global process relying on whole-brain efficiency. We propose a hypothetical "Broadcasting Motor Cortex" model in which the MI network is not a simple PFC-M1 hierarchy but a dynamic, M1-centered system that re-routes information through premotor and parietal gateways. Within this framework, baseline network properties may influence skill, but task-evoked global integration does not emerge as a strong correlate of performance. Given that our study was powered only to detect large correlations (r > 0.48), the absence of such effects suggests that baseline network states (16, 17), rather than active global integration, are more likely to predict individual BCI ability.

">Local homeostatic scaling supports stable rate propagation under noise and heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                The brain maintains stable information transmission despite substantial heterogeneity in neuronal properties and noise. Signals must travel across multiple regions with high fidelity without interruption or distortion. Previous studies achieve reliable firing-rate propagation in feedforward circuits only with finely tuned synaptic weights; otherwise, firing rate activity either decays or explodes. How neural circuits self-organize to achieve stable rate propagation without external fine-tuning remains unclear. Here, we introduce a simple, local homeostatic synaptic scaling rule in which each neuron rescales its excitatory inputs based on the mismatch between mean excitatory presynaptic and postsynaptic firing rate. We show both analytically and numerically that this local learning rule enables noisy feedforward networks to spontaneously organize stable rate propagation across layers when driven by external inputs, without the need for global supervision or precise weight initialization. This rule compensates for intrinsic neuronal properties by adjusting synaptic strengths to maintain consistent firing rate transmission, which allows heterogeneous feedforward networks to self-organize to support stable rate propagation. Finally, we show that when combined with homeostatic inhibitory synaptic plasticity, the rule stabilizes attractor firing rate in recurrent networks, preserving an asynchronous-irregular activity under perturbations. Our findings reveal how local plasticity rules support robust neural circuits capable of signal propagation without external fine-tuning, providing mechanistic insights into neurobiological self-organization and principles for designing resilient spiking networks.

">Closed-loop anti-phase tACS over preSMA reduced oscillatory beta synchronization and modulated motor inhibition performance</a></h4>

              
                Motor control depends on flexible modulation of beta-band oscillations (15-30 Hz) within cortical-basal ganglia circuits. In Parkinson's disease (PD), beta synchronization becomes pathologically elevated, contributing to motor slowing and rigidity and motivating the need for non-invasive strategies that can suppress excessive beta activity. Transcranial alternating stimulation (tACS) provides a non-invasive approach to modify endogenous oscillatory activity, yet conventional open-loop tACS typically reinforces, rather than disrupts, endogenous synchrony. Here, we developed an online adaptive EEG-guided closed-loop system that continuously tracked the instantaneous beta phase and delivered stimulation either aligned (in-phase) or 180 degrees opposed (anti-phase) to the ongoing beta rhythm. Thirty-eight right-handed healthy participants performed a stop-signal task while receiving 4x1 HD-tACS over pre-supplementary motor cortex (preSMA) in three conditions: in-phase, anti-phase, and sham. Anti-phase tACS produced a robust suppression of beta relative to both in-phase and sham stimulation, consistent with destructive interference of the endogenous rhythm. Behaviorally, anti-phase tACS slowed the stopping process, whereas in-phase stimulation reduced peak force rate during go trials and decreased variability of the go response, consistent with increased inhibitory tone and stabilization of ongoing motor states. These results provide converging behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for destructive interference of anti-phase tACS and establish a mechanistic framework for phase-specific closed-loop neuromodulation, paving the way to implement a noninvasive therapeutic strategy aimed at desynchronizing pathological beta in Parkinson's disease.

">Dual Activation of MC3R and MC4R Drives Weight Loss and Reduces Food Intake in Obese Primates</a></h4>

              
                The melanocortin system plays a central role in regulating hunger and satiety, making it an attractive target for treating metabolic disease. However, the limited clinical success of selective melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonists prompted the investigation of whether concurrent melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) and MC4R activation is key to unlocking the melanocortin system for the treatment of general obesity. To test this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized novel peptides to probe the distinct and combined roles of MC3R and MC4R in nonhuman primates (NHPs). We show that selectively agonizing MC3R modulates food intake in a state-dependent manner. Moreover, co-agonism of MC3R and MC4R results in more substantial metabolic effects than selective MC4R agonism, highlighting both a non-redundant and a cooperative role of MC3R. To leverage these discoveries, we developed 710GO, an orally-available MC3R/MC4R dual agonist peptide that induces significant weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) NHPs. Oral 710GO treatment demonstrates limited weight rebound, has additive effects in combination with GLP-1s, and exhibits a clean safety profile. These results reestablish the melanocortin system, specifically concerted MC3R/MC4R agonism, as a viable mechanism for next-generation obesity therapeutics.

">Chromatin Disruption After Prenatal Hypoxia Predicts Lasting Neuron Deficits</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal exposure to transient hypoxia can result in various developmental disabilities presumably by disrupting normal neurodevelopmental processes, even in milder injuries without detectable cell death or structural damage1,2. Emerging evidence suggests that disruption of the epigenome may be one of the most critical consequences of prenatal brain exposure to hypoxia3-8. However, the cell-type-selective effects of hypoxia on the developing brains transcriptome and epigenome remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that immediately after hypoxia, transcriptional and chromatin disruptions occur in all cell types, consistent with the energy deficit dynamics caused by prenatal hypoxia. Unexpectedly, we identify a selective dissociation of transcriptional and chromatin regulation in glutamatergic neurons after hypoxia. Genes neighboring sites of differential chromatin accessibility, but not differential gene expression, correlate with structural and functional deficits in glutamatergic neurons one month after the injury. Our approach reveals novel, shared, and cell-type-specific changes that reflect potential short- and long-term consequences of the hypoxic response. Together, these data provide insight into the mechanisms that lead to lasting changes in the epigenome following an injury to the developing brain, resulting in long-term functional deficits.

">Non-invasive modulation of brain activity and behavior by transcranial radio frequency stimulation</a></h4>

              
                STRUCTURED ABSTRACTO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSAchieving non-invasive, targeted modulation of deep brain tissue remains a major challenge in neurotechnology. Current non-invasive brain stimulation methods--such as transcranial electrical (TES), magnetic (TMS), and focused ultrasound (TFUS) stimulation--suffer from limitations in spatial focality, penetration depth, or skull-related distortions. Radio frequency (RF) energy, which penetrates biological tissue effectively, offers an alternative avenue for neural modulation. This study introduces Transcranial Radio Frequency Stimulation (TRFS) as a novel, contactless neuromodulation technique that leverages RF-induced thermal effects to modulate neural activity in vivo.

MethodsWe developed a custom RF stimulation system using 945 MHz stub antennas optimized for localized brain heating in mice. Using our unique experimental setup, we developed and tested two operational modes of TRFS:

Pristine mode: RF stimulation applied to intact brain tissue.

RF-genetics mode: RF stimulation applied to brain regions virally transduced to overexpress the thermosensitive TRPV1 ion channel.

Neural activity was recorded using metal-free one-photon fiber photometry with GCaMP calcium indicators. Behavioral effects were assessed through a rotational test in freely moving mice after MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion. Local temperature changes were monitored by optical thermometry.

ResultsIn pristine mode, RF exposure induced temperature rises leading to dose-dependent suppression of cortical parvalbumin (PV) interneuron activity. This neural suppression translated behaviorally into a unilateral rotational bias ipsilateral to the stimulated hemisphere in hyperlocomotive freely moving mice.

In RF-genetics mode, RF stimulation of TRPV1-overexpressing regions produced temperature-dependent excitation of neural activity once local change in temperatures exceeded {Delta}T {approx} 1.5 {degrees}C. Behaviorally, this excitation reversed the direction of rotation in hyperlocomotive freely moving mice, yielding a contralateral bias.

ConclusionsTRFS represents a conceptual advance in neuromodulation, uniting the inherent capability of RF energy to target deep brain tissue with the biophysical reliability of thermal modulation. TRFS applications are bimodal, capable of influencing the pristine brain by suppressing the activity of specific neuronal populations in targeted regions, or of exciting selectively transfected neural ensembles expressing thermosensitive TRPV1 ion channels. The latter modality, first introduced here, represents a novel concept termed "RF-genetics." TRFS represents a promising platform for next-generation non-invasive brain stimulation with potential translational applications in treating various neurological and psychiatric disorders.

">Cross-Species Cortical Geometry Reveals Conserved Gradients Across Primates and Human-Specific Expansion</a></h4>

              
                The primate cerebral cortex, characterized by its complex structural geometry, underlies advanced cognitive functions and represents a defining feature distinguishing primates from other mammals. However, cross-species patterns of cortical geometry and the links between human cortical geometry and transcriptional architecture remain poorly understood. We developed a geometry-based cross-species cortical alignment framework to systematically investigate the similarities and differences in structural connectivity and cortical expansion characteristics among macaques, chimpanzees, and humans, and additionally explored the transcriptional underpinnings of human cortical geometry. Our analysis revealed conserved spatial patterns of cortical geometric features across species, providing the foundation for constructing a cross-species structural common space to support the alignment framework. We found that primary sensory, somatomotor, and face-selective regions exhibited high structural connectivity similarity across species, whereas prefrontal and parietal association cortices displayed significant divergence. We also identified disproportionate cortical expansion in the default mode network, with a consistent expansion trend across different evolutionary lineages in primates. Furthermore, neuroimage-transcription analysis indicated that cortical geometric features were correlated with transcriptional profiles enriched in neurodevelopmental and connectivity-related pathways. These results highlight a conserved yet hierarchically differentiated organization of the cerebral cortex in primates, providing new insights into the biological basis of human brain evolution.

">Prenatal maternal stress is associated with increased sensitivity to neuropathic pain and sex-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic dynamics in the prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal maternal stress (PNS) is a common early-life adversity. PNS has been linked to greater vulnerability to chronic pain in the offspring. PNS results in increased hypersensitivity after Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, a common rodent model for chronic neuropathic pain. These behavioral effects are accompanied by altered levels of enzymes that regulate DNA methylation in the frontal cortex. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group onto cytosine bases of cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites in the genome, is an epigenetic mechanism by which life experiences can reprogram gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify differentially methylated regions that might contribute to the increased pain sensitivity following nerve injury in adulthood. Prior studies indicate widespread, sex-specific transcriptomic changes and numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the frontal cortex following PNS and nerve injury. Here we performed genome wide DNA methylation and transcriptome-wide RNAseq analysis in the frontal cortex of male and female mice that underwent PNS, CCI or both. Our analysis revealed sex-dependent changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression, including in pathways related to neuronal and brain development, axonogenesis and synaptic regulation. The effect of DNA methylation on mRNA expression was tested in a subset of target genes. These studies suggest a role for DNA methylation in embedding increased risk for chronic pain in adulthood associated with early-life adversity.

                Background Outdoor play has long been recognized as a crucial aspect of childhood development, with potential implications for physical health and cognitive abilities. Objective To examine the impact of outdoor play on the physical health and cognitive development of school-aged children (6-12 years), highlighting its vital role during these formative years. Design A scoping-type search across major databases reviewed observational and systematic reviews, as well as meta-analyses, extracting data on exposure factors such as duration, frequency, setting, and outcomes related to cardiovascular fitness, body composition, obesity risk, attention, executive function, creativity, problem-solving, and emotional well-being. Results Findings indicate regular outdoor play improves fitness and body composition, enhances cognitive function and mood, and is shaped by access to safe green spaces and school policies, with barriers including safety concerns, weather, urban design, and socioeconomic factors. Conclusion Proposed mechanisms involve increased physical activity in diverse settings, engagement with natural stimuli, and social interactions that support learning and resilience. Families, schools, urban planners, and policymakers must ensure that outdoor access is safe and equitable. The implications of this call for action include integrating outdoor play into routines and policymaking, standardizing exposure and outcome measures, and prioritizing longitudinal, diverse-population research to clarify causality.

                Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can result in severe complications such as heart attacks and strokes. Hypertension doubles the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, renal failure, and peripheral arterial disease. Although the exact cause of primary hypertension remains unclear, many risk factors are strongly and independently associated with its development. In contrast, risk factors for secondary hypertension can overlap with those for primary hypertension, presenting significant challenges in maintaining proper blood pressure control. Most individuals with hypertension do not exhibit any symptoms. However, extremely high blood pressure can cause headaches, blurred vision, chest pain, and other symptoms. Multiple studies have shown that physical activity lowers blood pressure regardless of weight loss, benefiting both individuals with normal blood pressure and those with hypertension. The exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of physical activity on blood pressure remain largely unknown, likely due to the complex and multifaceted nature of blood pressure regulation, involving neuro-hormonal, hemodynamic, and metabolic factors. Clinicians should incorporate practical strategies into exercise prescriptions, such as working out with friends, joining community groups, and tracking physical activity duration or counts.

                Background Preserving health outcomes in vulnerable and crisis-prone environments remains a significant challenge due to systemic weaknesses, limited resources, and recurrent emergencies. This study evaluates the ReBUILD for Resilience program in Sierra Leone, an intervention aimed at strengthening health systems and fostering community engagement through co-created radio discussions. Methods The intervention was implemented in the Moyamba and Kailahun districts, focusing on improving health literacy, empowering communities, and addressing local health priorities. Stakeholders, including community members, health workers, and local authorities, collaboratively developed and disseminated culturally relevant radio content. Data were collected through qualitative methods, including interviews and focus group discussions, and analysed to identify key themes related to stakeholder involvement, implementation processes, and perceived impacts. Results Four main themes were identified: stakeholder motivations, perceived objectives, planning and implementation processes, and program impacts. Stakeholders were driven by a sense of community responsibility and the need to bridge health knowledge gaps. The radio discussions were perceived as effective in raising awareness and facilitating communication between communities and health authorities. Successful implementation was attributed to collaborative planning and the use of local languages. While stakeholders noted perceived benefits such as improved health literacy and behaviour changes, these outcomes were not directly assessed in the study. Challenges included logistical and financial constraints, highlighting the need for sustainable funding strategies. Conclusions The ReBUILD for Resilience program demonstrates the transformative potential of co-produced health interventions in fragile and shock-prone settings. Community ownership, cultural relevance, and stakeholder participation were critical to its success. This study contributes to the growing evidence on participatory approaches to strengthening health systems and underscores the need for innovative strategies to ensure the sustainability of such interventions in resource-constrained environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1330/v1?src=rss">Optimizing inventory management in the automotive industry: A comparative study of crisp and fuzzy systems [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Inventory management is essential to ensure cost efficiency and operational continuity in the automotive sector. Traditional (crisp) inventory systems assume fixed values for the input parameters, which may not reflect real-world variability. This study compares the performance of crisp and fuzzy inventory models in managing uncertainty in demand and costs, using Tesla as a case context. Methods Inventory models were developed under crisp and fuzzy frameworks, incorporating a quadratic time-dependent demand function, holding costs, deterioration, production, and setup costs. In the fuzzy model, the key parameters were represented using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and the centroid method was applied for defuzzification. Mathematica 14.0, was used to compute the optimal cycle time and total cost for both systems. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of variations in each parameter. Results The fuzzy inventory model produced a lower total cost ($57.06) compared to the crisp model ($143.33), reflecting an 86.11% reduction. The fuzzy system also demonstrated improved robustness to changes in production rate, setup cost, and deterioration rate. Both models produced similar economic order quantities, but were more economical and flexible to parameter variations. Sensitivity analysis proved that the system was more sensitive to minor changes in input values for the crisp model, raising the overall cost higher than that of the fuzzy model. Conclusions Fuzzy inventory systems can address demand uncertainty and cost variability in the automotive industry. It can be noted that applying inventory planning within fuzzy logic can save costs and aid in reacting better to fluctuations in the market. Such applications can be applied to companies considering the high demand and production variability. Subsequent studies can further develop multi-item models and combine stochastic lead times or dynamic prices.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Assess the performance of serum phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in predicting risk of cognitive impairment or phenoconversion to dementia in individuals with iRBD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured serum p-tau217 and NfL levels by electrochemiluminescence across 4 polysomnographically confirmed iRBD cohorts (n = 300), including individuals who phenoconverted to Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 51), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n = 22), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n = 5).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Serum p-tau217 levels were increased in individuals with iRBD and cognitive impairment (CI) on testing defined as Montreal Cognitive Assessment &lt;26 or subthreshold parkinsonism. p-Tau217 differentiated individuals with iRBD who developed PD with CI (PD-CI) or DLB from PD phenoconverters with normal cognition (area under curve [AUC] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.93) and from iRBD non-phenoconverters with normal cognition (AUC = 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.89). NfL levels did not correlate with cognitive or motor scores and marginally improved p-tau217 performance (AUC = 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–0.92), but were notably elevated in iRBD individuals who phenoconverted to MSA. Individuals with p-tau217 in the top quartile were 8 times more likely to phenoconvert to PD-CI or DLB compared to the bottom quartile (hazard ratio = 8.30; 95% confidence interval, 2.49–27.65).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Serum p-tau217, but not NfL, is a useful biomarker of cognitive impairment in iRBD that could be integrated into a multimodal prognostic indicator when stratifying risk of phenoconversion. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

     alt="A Morphological Comparison of the Caudal Rami of the Superior Temporal Sulcus in Humans, Chimpanzees, and Other Great Apes"/>
<p>This study provides the first quantitative comparison of the caudal rami of the superior temporal sulcus among humans, chimpanzees, and other great apes, revealing conserved sulcal patterns, as well as species-specific differences. These findings highlight evolutionary pressures shaping the morphology of the caudal temporoparietal cortex underlying different aspects of cognition.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>For centuries, anatomists have charted the folding patterns of the sulci of the cerebral cortex in primates. Improvements in neuroimaging technologies over the past decades have led to advancements in the understanding of the sulcal organization of the human cerebral cortex, yet comparisons to chimpanzees, one of humans’ closest extant phylogenetic relatives, remain to be performed in many regions, such as the caudal temporoparietal region (cTPR). For example, while several posterior branches, or rami, of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) have been identified within the cTPR in great apes since the late 1800s, no study has yet comprehensively identified and quantitatively compared these rami across species. To fill this gap in knowledge, in the present study, we defined the three caudal branches of the STS (cSTS) in 72 human and 29 chimpanzee brains (202 total hemispheres) and then extracted and compared the morphological (depth and surface area) properties of these sulci. We report three main findings. First, modern methods replicate classic findings that three rami of the posterior STS are unique to the hominid lineage (i.e., humans and great apes). Second, normalizing for brain size, the cSTS rami were relatively deeper in chimpanzees compared to humans. Third, the cSTS branches were relatively larger in surface area in humans compared to chimpanzees. Finally, we share probabilistic predictions of the cSTS to guide the identification of these sulci in future studies. Altogether, these findings bridge the gap between historic qualitative observations and modern quantitative measurements in a part of the brain that has expanded substantially throughout evolution and that is involved in human-specific aspects of cognition.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Antiseizure medication (ASM) use during pregnancy has increased over the past decade. However, evidence linking prenatal ASM exposure to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in offspring remains inconsistent. This study evaluated whether prenatal ASM exposure increases the risk of NDDs in children.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed data from 5 population-based cohorts of live-born children in Canada (Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec; the Canadian Mother-Child Cohort [CAMCCO] cohorts) and the United States (AM-PREGNANT cohort). ASM exposure was defined as maternal prescription fills overlapping the 60 days before birth. NDDs were identified using validated algorithm based on the International Classification of Disease-9/10 codes from inpatient and outpatient records. Within each cohort, Cox proportional hazards models were applied, with adjustment performed separately using (1) covariates and (2) propensity scores. Pooled estimates were obtained using random-effects meta-analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 2,910,206 children, 0.47% were exposed to ASMs in the 60 days before birth. Prenatal ASM exposure was associated with a 29% increased risk of NDDs (pooled-adjusted hazard ratio [p-aHR], 1.29; 95% CI: 1.22–1.37; 1,805 exposed cases). In the Canadian cohorts, risks of combined NDDs varied by medication: carbamazepine (p-aHR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.20–1.87; 262 exposed cases), clonazepam (p-aHR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.12–1.33; 585 exposed cases), topiramate (p-aHR 1.56; 95% CI: 1.04–2.34; 69 exposed cases), and valproic acid (p-aHR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.16–1.65; 134 exposed cases). Although point estimates were higher for polytherapy than monotherapy, the difference was not statistically significant.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Prenatal exposure to certain ASMs was consistently associated with increased risks of NDDs in offspring. These findings support careful, individualized decision-making regarding prenatal ASM use to minimize neurodevelopmental risks. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-99/v2?src=rss">Predicting determinants of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age women in Ethiopia using machine learning algorithms: Evidence from the Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Survey 2019 dataset [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 ap</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Globally, around 40% of women report unintended pregnancies, with approximately 214 million women in developing countries wanting to avoid pregnancy but not using any contraception. Modern contraceptives (MCs) are effective tools for preventing unintended pregnancies, controlling rapid population growth, and reducing fertility and maternal mortality rates, particularly in developing countries. This study aimed to identify the determinants of modern contraceptive use among Ethiopian women of reproductive age using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methodology The study utilized secondary data from the 2019 Performance Monitoring and Accountability (PMA) Ethiopia survey, analyzing 8,837 samples. Preprocessing steps included data cleaning, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and splitting the data, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing the algorithms. Six supervised ML algorithms were employed and assessed using confusion matrices, with information gain applied to identify critical attributes for predicting MC use. Results Only 24% of participants used modern contraceptives [95% CI (23.1%, 24.9%)]. Extreme gradient boosting (XGB) demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy (81.97%, 95% CI {79.06%, 82.7%}) and area under the ROC curve (76.63%), followed by logistic regression (80.52%) and support vector machines (80.41%). Key determinants of MC use included starting family planning at age 20 or older, being single, having partner approval, being the wife of the household head, being between 36 and 49 years old, advice from healthcare providers, concerns about side effects, and having a household size of five or more. Conclusion and Recommendations The use of modern contraceptives among Ethiopian women remains low. Extreme gradient boosting proved most effective in predicting determinants of MC use. Based on the results of predictive associations, improved counseling during antenatal and postnatal care visits, promoting partner discussions on family planning, and addressing concerns about family size and contraceptive use are recommended strategies to enhance MC uptake.

                In cases where vaginal delivery is not feasible and the mother’s or the child’s health is in danger, a Caesarean section (CS) is medically warranted. The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that between 10% and 15% of all births will have medically justifiable CS rates. Globally, WHO estimates that 6.2 million CSs are performed each year without medical justification. The determination to proceed with or forgo a CS can be understood as the result of weighing three key categories of influence: demand-side factors, supply-side factors, and clinical factors. Each of these categories contributes uniquely to the ultimate decision of whether to perform a CS, highlighting the multifaceted nature of this healthcare challenge. Within each input, there is also, often, a complex interplay. For example, there is a local narrative of mothers seeking an elective CS being "too posh to push", inextricably linking household socioeconomic factors and maternal preferences. On the supply side there are issues of the policy within the healthcare facility (private hospitals prefer CSs) and an interplay with time management and maximizing the efficiency of the facility. Bangladesh’s CS has been on the rise; according to the most recent survey, it was 45%, far higher than the WHO recommendation. The private sector interacts with the high rates of CS in Bangladesh; MOH Bangladesh has little control over this sector. To optimize the CS rate, the nation must first recognize that needless CS is an issue and take all necessary action to address it.

Issues of sustainability, cost, and vulnerability to single points of failure cast doubt on whether today’s data will remain Findable and Accessible for future generations. Emerging decentralized storage technologies, like the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and blockchain-based platforms such as Arweave, propose a paradigm shift toward data permanence, integrity, and resilience. This commentary explores the potential of these systems to create a more robust and censorship-resistant scientific record. It evaluates the benefits, including long-term preservation and verifiable data integrity that enhance Reusability, against significant obstacles such as usability, governance, and economic sustainability. While decentralized storage is not a panacea, its principles warrant serious consideration. This commentary advocates for a hybrid model that integrates the strengths of centralized and decentralized systems, ensuring that the scientific record remains FAIR for generations while addressing the challenge of managing the evolution of scientific knowledge within a permanent system.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102714">The Shigella flexneri effector IpaH1.4 facilitates RNF213 degradation and protects cytosolic bacteria against interferon-induced ubiquitylation</a></h4>

              
                A central signal that marshals host defense against many infections is the lymphocyte-derived cytokine interferon-gamma (IFNγ). The IFNγ receptor is expressed on most human cells, and its activation leads to the expression of antimicrobial proteins that execute diverse cell-autonomous immune programs. One such immune program consists of the sequential detection, ubiquitylation, and destruction of intracellular pathogens. Recently, the IFNγ-inducible ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 was identified as a pivotal mediator of such a defense axis. RNF213 provides host protection against viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens. To establish infections, potentially susceptible intracellular pathogens must have evolved mechanisms that subdue RNF213-controlled cell-autonomous immunity. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that a causative agent of bacillary dysentery, <i>Shigella flexneri</i>, uses the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector IpaH1.4 to induce the degradation of RNF213. <i>S. flexneri</i> mutants lacking IpaH1.4 expression are bound and ubiquitylated by RNF213 in the cytosol of IFNγ-primed host cells. Linear (M1-) and lysine-linked ubiquitylation of <i>S. flexneri</i> requires RNF213 but is independent of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC). We find that ubiquitylation of <i>S. flexneri</i> is insufficient to kill intracellular bacteria, suggesting that <i>S. flexneri</i> employs additional virulence factors to escape from host defenses that operate downstream from RNF213-driven ubiquitylation. In brief, this study identified the bacterial IpaH1.4 protein as an inhibitor of mammalian RNF213 and highlights evasion of RNF213-driven immunity as a characteristic of the human-tropic pathogen <i>Shigella</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107301">Center-surround inhibition in expectation and its underlying computational and artificial neural network models</a></h4>

              
                Expectation is beneficial for adaptive behavior through quickly deducing plausible interpretations of information. The profile and underlying neural computations of this process, however, remain unclear. When participants expected a grating with a specific orientation, we found a center-surround inhibition profile in orientation space, which was independent from attentional modulations by task relevance. Using computational modeling, we showed that this center-surround inhibition could be reproduced by either a sharpening of tuning curves of expected orientation or a shift of tuning curves of unexpected orientations. Intriguingly, these two computations were further supported by orientation-adjustment and orientation-discrimination experiments. Finally, the ablation studies in convolutional neural networks revealed that predictive coding feedback played a critical role in the center-surround inhibition in expectation. Altogether, our study reveals for the first time that expectation results in both enhancement and suppression, optimizing plausible interpretations during perception by enhancing expected and attenuating similar but irrelevant and potentially interfering representations.

                Proprioception, the innate ability to perceive body positions and movements, enables us to perform daily activities without thinking about it. In mammals, this process primarily involves the activation of three types of proprioceptive neuron (PN) endings in muscles (Ia and II-PNs) or tendons (Ib-PNs). However, recent research indicates that these cardinal classes exhibit molecular diversity that likely reflects differences in connectivity, morphology, and activity patterns, contributing to the detection of various kinematic parameters. In this review, we summarize the properties and functions of PNs and propose a comprehensive cell-type classification. By systematically mapping functionally relevant molecular markers to specific PN subtypes, we establish a tentative, yet insightful taxonomy based on their functional characteristics. This foundational work lays the groundwork for future research aimed at elucidating the distinct physiological properties of each PN subtype and their interactions within central motor circuits. Understanding these nuances will be critical for advancing our knowledge of sensorimotor circuitry and its role in movement control.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108853">The SAFE Labs Handbook as a tool for improving lab culture</a></h4>

              
                Creating positive and equitable lab environments has become a growing priority for the scientific community and funders of scientific research. Research institutions typically respond to this need by providing mandatory or optional training opportunities for their staff. However, there are limited resources for group leaders to improve the culture in their labs. Here, we introduce the SAFE Labs Handbook: a collection of 30 “commitments” that can be implemented by individual group leaders to improve research culture in the life sciences. The commitments were collaboratively developed by 13 group leaders working in eight different European countries. We also report the results of a survey in which we asked more than 200 researchers, at various career stages, about the commitments. Even though all 30 commitments were rated as significantly important by respondents, implementation rates were notably low (&lt;25%). However, more than 95% of group leaders said they would consider implementing them. The SAFE Labs Handbook therefore represents a unique, community-driven tool with the potential to improve lab culture on a global scale.

                Asymmetric cell division (ACD) is a fundamental process to balance cell proliferation and differentiation during development and in the adult. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a very small but highly malignant population within many human tumors, are able to provide differentiated progeny by ACD that contribute to the intratumoral heterogeneity, as well as to proliferate without control by symmetric, self-renewing divisions. Thus, ACD dysregulation in CSCs could trigger cancer progression. Here, we consistently find low expression levels of <i>RAP2A</i>, the human homolog of the <i>Drosophila</i> ACD regulator <i>Rap2l</i>, in glioblastoma (GBM) patient samples, and observe that scarce levels of <i>RAP2A</i> are associated with poor clinical prognosis in GBM. Additionally, we show that restitution of RAP2A in GBM neurosphere cultures increases the ACD of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), decreasing their proliferation and expression of stem cell markers. Our results support that ACD failures in GSCs increase their spread and ACD amendment could contribute to reduce the expansion of GBM.

">Distinct developmental trajectories of externally- and internally-generated hippocampal sequences and assemblies</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus generates cognitive maps through two distinct mechanisms: external representations anchored to environmental landmarks and internal sequences integrating self-referenced information. In adult CA1, these functions segregate radially, with deep cells processing external cues and superficial cells handling internal representations. This anatomical organization suggests that developmental processes constrain the formation of these functionally distinct circuits. However, the developmental timeline for the emergence of these two types of hippocampal representations remains unknown. Using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice during the third postnatal week, we investigated when internal versus external hippocampal representations emerge. We recorded from deep and superficial CA1 layers while mice ran on treadmills that are bare or enriched with tactile cues, addressing the challenge of tracking cells across sessions. Internal sequences emerge during the mid-fourth postnatal week, following the development of cue-based representations. These sequences initially encode elapsed time before evolving to integrate run distance, arising after rest cell assemblies as spatial coding and functional connectivity networks stabilize. These findings identify the mid fourth postnatal week as a critical developmental milestone marking the establishment of a balanced integration between external landmark-based and internal self-referenced spatial representations. This transition period may constitute a vulnerable developmental window during which disruptions could predispose to disorders characterised by altered cognitive maps.

">Medial Temporal Default Mode Network Selectively Encodes Autobiographical Visual Imagery</a></h4>

              
                The human brain's capacity to imagine visual scenes from memory is thought to rely on the medial temporal subsystem of the default mode network (MT-DMN), yet the neural codes supporting this ability remain poorly understood. We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with vision and language artificial intelligence models to characterize neural codes during autobiographical imagination. Fifty participants imagined reexperiencing twenty natural scenarios while undergoing fMRI, when cued by generic text prompts (e.g., wedding, exercising, driving). Individual scenes were modeled using Stable Diffusion to generate personalized synthetic images from verbal descriptions of the scenarios imagined, collected beforehand. These depictions were then transformed into image-recognition network embeddings. Representational Similarity Analysis revealed that the MT-DMN encoded the participant-specific representational structure of image embeddings, even when controlling for semantic features derived from a large language model. This effect was absent in other networks and during reading without imagination, identifying the MT-DMN as a core substrate for the visual reconstruction of autobiographical experiences.

">Serum Lipidome as an Early Peripheral Indicator in Familial Alzheimers Disease</a></h4>

              
                Protein biomarkers in biofluids are highly sensitive indicators of prodromal cognitive impairment yet remain limited for primary prevention. Lipids, essential to brain structure and function, offer untapped prognostic value. Here, we identify a lipidomic signature in serum from asymptomatic PSEN1-E280A mutation carriers aged 6-40 years, that differentiate carriers from non-carriers with an AUC 80-90%. Similarly, to symptomatic carriers ([&ge;]41 years; 93%) and sporadic AD cases (85%), using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Latent profile analysis revealed lipid-based signatures of dementia risk and resilience, shaped by genotype, sex, and APOE isoform, and supported by SIMOA protein biomarkers. Age-dependent dysregulation in sphingolipid and glycolipid metabolism was validated by enzymatic activity (TLC), glial phenotyping (flow cytometry), and gene expression (snRNAseq) in postmortem brain. Ganglioside clearance deficits emerged by age 6-12, followed by proinflammatory shifts from age 13 and p-tau217 elevation by age 20, with greater burden in females and APOE4 carriers. APOE3Ch individuals showed differential salvage pathways of ceramides and gangliosides. These findings position early lipid pathway dysregulation as a biological contributor to Alzheimers pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for primary prevention.

">GPR37 activation erases spinal pain memory and resolves increased nociception in murine models</a></h4>

              
                Intense nociceptor inputs from injury induce long-term changes in the spinal nociceptive system - referred to as spinal pain memory - that increase pain in magnitude and duration. We investigated whether activation of G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) at the spinal level can erase this memory and resolve long-lasting, enhanced pain using two animal models: the capsaicin model and the hyperalgesic priming model. Without altering normal mechanical and heat nociception, a single intrathecal (i.th.) administration of two GPR37 agonists, TX14A and protectin D1 (PD1), dose-dependently inhibited capsaicin-induced increase in nociception not only acutely but also long-term. In the hyperalgesic priming model, a single i.th. injection of either GPR37 agonist, given after an initial injury-induced priming, dose-dependently prevented increased nociception following a subsequent inflammatory insult, indicating an unpriming effect. Global GPR37 knockout abolished the long-term inhibitory effect and unpriming effect of i.th. TX14A, confirming the receptor at the spinal level as the molecule mediating the effects. Ex vivo Ca{superscript 2} imaging revealed that i.th. TX14A, given in vivo to the capsaicin model a week before imaging, had rescued dorsal horn excitatory and inhibitory interneurons from long-term potentiation and depression of responsiveness to afferent inputs, respectively, suggesting the erasure of capsaicin-induced spinal pain memory. Conditioned place preference tests indicated no obvious abuse liability for centrally-administered GPR37 agonists. These findings suggest that spinally targeted GPR37 agonism represents a promising therapeutic strategy for resolving persistent pain by erasing spinal pain memory.

">Transcriptional response to chronic long-access fentanyl self-administration in rat habenula and amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid associated with overdose. However, little is known about fentanyl-induced molecular adaptations in the habenula and amygdala, two brain regions implicated in opioid use and withdrawal. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing in the rat habenula and amygdala to identify transcriptomic changes associated with fentanyl intake. Rats self-administered intravenous saline or fentanyl over 22-24 days. Ninety minutes following the final session, habenula and amygdala were collected for transcriptomic profiling. In Hb, we identified 453 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between saline and fentanyl rats, with upregulated genes associated with synaptic transmission and ionic conductance. In amygdala, we identified 3,041 fentanyl-associated DEGs with upregulated genes implicated in metabolic and vesicular functions. Downregulated genes in both regions were enriched for extracellular matrix functions. Integration of DEGs with single-cell RNA-sequencing data from rodents and humans revealed that fentanyl DEGs were enriched in specific habenula and amygdala cell type markers. Furthermore, fentanyl downregulated DEGs in amygdala were enriched in genes associated with risk for substance use disorders. Together, we define how fentanyl intake alters transcriptional programs in the habenula and amygdala, and we link these changes to specific human cell types and risk genes for neuropsychiatric disorders and addiction.

">High-resolution MRI Guided Whole Mouse Brain Cell Type Atlas using Deep Learning</a></h4>

              
                Cell types represent groupings of cells defined by shared anatomical and functional properties. Traditional mouse brain cell atlases rely heavily on single-cell sequencing, which provides valuable molecular detail but lacks whole-brain, isotropic resolution. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) offers a complementary approach for probing cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture, with quantitative metrics increasingly used as biomarkers of brain development and neurodegenerative disorders. Although prior work has linked dMRI metrics with gene expression, the capacity of dMRI to directly predict cell types remains unclear. Here, we present a deep learning framework that integrates high-resolution dMRI with three-dimensional light-sheet microscopy (LSM) registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3). We investigated correlations between dMRI and spatial transcriptomics-derived cell types and generated a whole-brain cell type atlas at 10 micrometer isotropic resolution. Together, these results establish an efficient, high-resolution strategy for brain cell atlas generation and underscore the potential of advanced imaging to illuminate cellular mechanisms of the brain.

                Background The emergence of AI technologies has revolutionised dentistry, with intraoral imaging being a key area for innovation. Despite advances and growing interest in applying AI algorithms to intraoral x-rays, the methodological quality, diagnostic validity, and clinical applicability of existing studies remain unclear. Aim To synthesise and critically appraise the current evidence on AI integrated with intraoral digital radiographic imaging for detecting dental caries in adults, focusing on diagnostic accuracy compared with gold-standard methods and examining methodological quality, clinical applicability, and implementation challenges. Methods Following the JBI scoping review framework and PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across the PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases from January 2015 to May 2025. Studies that met the predefined eligibility criteria were included. Thematic analysis, combining inductive and deductive approaches following Braun and Clarke’s framework, identified five themes. The CASP quality appraisal was performed to ensure methodological rigour. Results Ten peer-reviewed studies were included in the final data analysis. AI systems detected a greater number of carious lesions than human clinicians, particularly in early-stage caries, with representative metrics including 88% sensitivity, 91% specificity, and 89% accuracy. Other models reported F1-scores up to 89% and AUC ≈95%. Methodological diversity was notable, with histology-validated designs providing the strongest evidence. Implementation challenges included limited external and real-world validation, clinician oversight, ethical/regulatory considerations, and inadequate model interpretability. Conclusion AI exhibits strong potential to enhance early caries detection on intraoral radiographs and support clinical decision-making in adults. Fully realising AI’s clinical potential requires overcoming implementation and methodological challenges. Standardised validation methods across diverse populations and settings are crucial to ensure AI diagnostic reliability and generalisability. Current AI applications in dentistry are primarily designed to assist clinicians in detecting caries; however, their greatest potential lies in a future where they can independently guide treatment planning decisions.

                The global deployment of over seven billion IoT measuring devices in critical fields like healthcare and industrial safety systems exposes a pressing vulnerability to cyber-attacks, where compromised data integrity can lead to severe financial or life-threatening incidents. Calibration is the fundamental process ensuring measurement uniformity, yet the immense scale of the IoT makes traditional laboratory calibration physically impossible. Consequently, the calibration process must migrate on-site, relying on remote communication with calibration standards—a paradigm known as Calibration as a Service (CaaS). This digital shift, however, introduces significant cybersecurity risks into the very foundation of measurement trust. This paper addresses this critical challenge by presenting a comprehensive Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Secure IoT Measuring System Calibration. The proposed framework establishes the necessary protocols to protect the calibration process within a CaaS infrastructure. We further emphasize that the development and deployment of such secure IoT systems necessitate dedicated collaboration between IT security specialists and domain experts, ensuring that device integrity is prioritized from inception to safeguard end-users in an increasingly connected and vulnerable digital ecosystem.

                This review synthesises literature on how digital financial literacy and technological solutions influence sustainable loan repayment and growth among small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in multicultural contexts. Despite the growing adoption of digital financial tools, significant gaps remain regarding their long-term impact, cross cultural applicability, and integration with behavioural and institutional frameworks. Anchored in Human Capital Theory, the Theory of Planned Behaviour, and the Technology Acceptance Model, the review explores how knowledge, skills, attitudes, and perceived ease of use shape SMEs’ adoption of digital tools and responsible financial behaviour. The study employed a thematic analysis of journals, reports, and dissertations published between 2015 and 2025, sourced from Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, SpringerLink and JSTOR. We examined five thematic areas: digital financial education, data driven financial analytics, virtual inclusive financial literacy platforms, fintech integration, and digital policy and institutional ecosystems. Our findings reveal that mobile based applications, e learning modules, gamified interfaces, AI powered adaptive learning, predictive financial analytics, and fintech solutions such as mobile banking and blockchain enhance SMEs’ financial literacy and repayment behaviour. However, we established that limited internet access, low digital literacy, complex digital interfaces, socio cultural barriers, and weak institutional frameworks hinder effective adoption and long-term engagement. Success stories such as M Pesa’s Pamoja app in Kenya, Alipay’s SME academy in China, and Google’s Primer App illustrate adaptive strategies for sustainable growth. In this review, we conclude that sustainable SME development requires human capital investment, inclusive technology adoption, and supportive institutional policies to inform equitable digital transformation.

                Background Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) vaping has become increasingly prevalent, yet available empirical data on puffing behavior during THC vape use remain limited. This study aimed to characterize the puff duration of people who use THC vapes by analyzing publicly available YouTube videos. Additional observations included device type, liquid composition, and notable user behaviors. Methods YouTube was systematically searched using predefined search terms related to THC vaping. Videos published between 2018 and 2024 were screened for inclusion based on clear visibility of puffing events. A total of 100 videos were included in the analysis. Puff initiation and termination were defined by visible facial muscle contraction and relaxation, respectively. Puff duration was determined using frame-by-frame analysis. Results The mean puff duration obtained from 456 analyzed puffs was 3.68 seconds with no significant differences between cartridge and disposable devices (p =0.1). Behavioral observations included engagement in extended puffing, coughing, and subjective description of aerosol harshness and flavor. Conclusions The observed puff durations during THC vape use closely aligned with those previously reported for electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), suggesting that ENDS puffing regimens may be appropriate for preliminary emissions testing of THC vape products. However, distinct user behaviors reported in this study highlight the need for THC vape specific protocols that reflect real-word use patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1324/v1?src=rss">Integrating Palliative Care into the Indonesia Health System: A Policy Brief to Enhance Accessibility, Quality, and Sustainability [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Indonesia faces a growing double burden of non-communicable diseases, particularly cancer. The latest data from the Global Cancer Observatory (Globocan) indicates over 408,661 new cases and 242,099 cancer-related deaths in 2022, with a projected 63% increase in the case burden between 2025 and 2040 without strategic intervention. Although a new legal framework through Health Law No. 17 of 2023 and the Minister of Health Decree (KMK) No. HK.01.07/MENKES/2180/2023 has mandated palliative care as an integral component of health services, its implementation still faces significant systemic barriers. Policy and Implications This policy brief analyzes the disconnection between the policy mandate and on-the-ground reality, identifying critical gaps in accessibility, healthcare workforce capacity particularly among nursesand financing mechanisms through the National Health Insurance (JKN) program. The failure to effectively integrate palliative care not only causes unnecessary suffering for millions of patients but also burdens the health system with inefficient costs and suboptimal end-of-life care, reflected in the high “financial toxicity” experienced by patients. Recommendations We recommend a four-pillar strategy: (1) Formalize and standardize palliative services within the JKN benefits package with a clear financing model to address regulatory ambiguity; (2) Develop a national competency-based palliative education and training strategy for all health workers, with a focus on empowering nurses in primary care; (3) Implement a decentralized and tiered palliative care delivery model centered on Community Health Centers (Puskesmas) to ensure equitable access; and (4) Launch a national public education campaign to destigmatize palliative care and increase awareness. Conclusion The integration of palliative care is not merely an option but a strategic and ethical imperative for achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Indonesia. It is a cost-effective investment to improve patients’ quality of life, support families, and ensure the sustainability of the national health system in facing future non-communicable disease challenges.

                Microalgae are increasingly recognized as sustainable green cell factories capable of producing a various high-value bioactive compounds. Among them, the red microalga Porphyridium purpureum stands out for its unique ability to secrete sulfated exopolysaccharides (sEPS)—complex macromolecules enriched with sulfate and uronic acid groups that exhibit potent biological activities. These compounds function as natural antioxidants, immunomodulators, and antimicrobial agents, attracting substantial interest from the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and functional food industries. A targeted literature search was conducted across the Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases to identify studies focusing on the extraction, structural characterization, and applications of sulfated exopolysaccharides from Porphyridium purpureum between 2015 and 2025. Recent research has demonstrated rapid advancements in environmentally friendly extraction technologies, including membrane filtration, three-phase partitioning (TPP), ultrasound-assisted TPP (UATPP), and deep eutectic solvents (DES), which collectively enhance the yield, purity, and preserve the biological functionality of sEPS. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in structural and mechanistic elucidation through advanced analytical and imaging techniques such as two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, FTIR, methylation analysis, and transcriptomic profiling. These approaches have clarified how cultivation parameters and environmental stressors influence EPS biosynthesis, sulfation patterns, and biological activity. Overall, this review provides an integrated and forward-looking perspective on the scientific advances and technological challenges surrounding P. purpureum sEPS, outlining future directions toward sustainable bioprocessing and industrial valorization of these high-value biomacromolecules.

                Background The cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor is the primary target of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis sativa (commonly known as “kif” in Morocco). Methods Here, we identified novel CB1 agonists using virtual screening approaches. First, we developed a pharmacophore model based on the known CB1 agonist AM11542 and screened a database of over three million compounds. Molecular docking using AutoDock Vina identified 61 hits with binding affinities of less than -9.00 Kcal/mol. Subsequent ADME-Tox (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) analysis narrowed the selection to 18 promising candidates. Results Among these, three agonists exhibited strong characteristics, including a favorable inhibition constant (Ki) and key hydrogen-bond interactions with critical residues in the CB1 binding pocket: PUBChem157251136 (Ki=2.09 nM), ZINC64438485 (Ki= 0.262 nM) and ZINC64438506 (Ki =0.244 nM). These agonists formed stable hydrogen bonds with CB1 binding pocket residues (Ser383, Ser173, His178 and Thr197). Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns, GROMACS) demonstrated structural stability (RMSD < 1 nm) and low conformational flexibility (RMSF < 1 nm) for all complexes. MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations further confirmed the thermodynamic stability of all complexes, with interaction energies ranging from -30.59 to -49.98 kcal/mol. These comprehensive simulations confirm that all identified agonist complexes maintain stable binding conformations with optimal interaction profiles characteristic of CB1 receptor activation. Conclusion These results could pave the way for researching and developing new quinazolinz-2, 4(1H, 3H)-Dione derivatives as a new class of CB1 receptor agonists.

                The study explores the factors that influence entrepreneurial intention and action among university students in five Latin American countries, integrating correlation analyses, multiple regressions, and visualizations through Raincloud Plots. Although numerous emotional, cognitive, and contextual profile variables were measured, this report presents only those that showed significant differences between countries or were identified as relevant predictors of entrepreneurial intention and action. Key variables such as entrepreneurial attitude, self-efficacy, entrepreneurial action in its discovery phase, university training, and empathy were identified as significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention. Self-awareness, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial attitude explained the discovery phase. In contrast, financial knowledge, emotional well-being, flow at work, self-efficacy, and low cognitive load were determinants in the exploitation phase. The findings highlight the need for an adaptive curriculum that incorporates emotional competencies, training pathways differentiated by entrepreneurial stage, and support strategies that include mentoring, early diagnosis, and well-being management.

                Background Assurance of Learning is a process focused on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of education. It involves implementing practices, policies, and procedures intended to ensure the development of skills, competencies, and knowledge expected in a specific educational program or course. In the subjects Chemistry and General Chemistry I at the Universidad de La Sabana, persistent issues with low academic performance have resulted in rising course repetition rates, lack of motivation, and student dropout. Methods The present study examines targeted didactic strategies for students at risk of academic failure in these subjects, representing an innovation in the field of education and contributing to the domain of learning assurance in Chemistry. It was conducted under a mixed-methods approach with a quasi-experimental and cross-sectional design. A predictive trend analysis was carried out, and strategies were identified, selected, and implemented with consideration for students’ perceptions and assessments. Two samples were analyzed: a characterization sample of 411 students who took the subjects between the second semester of 2020 and the first semester of 2023, and an experimental sample comprising students from the second semester of 2023 and the first semester of 2024. Results The results revealed that participation in the implemented strategies led to improved academic performance, particularly for students with lower Saber 11 scores. Strategy 1 (leveling course) showed the greatest positive impact, with statistically significant differences in performance. Moreover, students reported high satisfaction with the strategies, especially regarding their usefulness, engagement, and relevance. Conclusions These findings suggest that personalized and contextualized didactic strategies are effective in supporting students at risk of academic failure in general chemistry courses.

     alt="Harnessing the Neurobiology of Empathy and Compassion to Alleviate Burnout in Neurology"/>
<p>The neurologist cares for patients with complex chronic conditions that compromise their wellbeing. Many such disorders are poorly understood. Whereas for some, effective symptomatic treatments exist, for most we lack an understanding of the molecular and cellular bases for disease pathogenesis needed for discovering disease-modifying treatments. Recognizing these technical shortcomings, the neurologist and her/his patient are both subject to the emotional toll of uncertainty. An important question is how best to recognize and address the resulting emotional stress and how to mitigate its impact in the therapeutic relationship.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Neurologists regularly care for patients with complex, chronic, and often incurable conditions. These circumstances impose profound emotional burdens on the patient and physician. Whereas empathy is central to therapeutic effectiveness in clinical practice, sustained empathic engagement can contribute to emotional exhaustion and physician burnout, a condition now endemic in neurology. This review synthesizes insights from neuroscience, psychology, and clinical education to propose “skillful empathy” as a trainable capacity that integrates affective resonance with cognitive perspective-taking. We describe how emotional contagion harms clinician well-being and advocate for the integration of empathy training into medical education to support sustainable, compassionate neurological care.

     alt="Hydroxycarboxylic Acid Receptor 2 Mediates β-hydroxybutyrate's Antiseizure Effect in Mice"/>
<p>A
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate regimen, is often used to treat drug-resistant seizures and is being studied for Alzheimer's disease and other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. β-hydroxybutyrate, a primary circulating ketone body produced by the ketogenic diet, may mediate its effects on seizures by binding to a recently identified Gi-coupled receptor: hydrocarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>RNAscope in situ hybridization assay and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to assess HCAR2 expression in the mouse brain. We generated HCAR2<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> using the CRISPR-Cas technique on an S129 mouse background. Whole-cell current-clamp was performed to measure the passive and active membrane properties of hippocampal dentate granule cells. The voltage-clamp was performed to record synaptic currents. Two complementary in vivo mouse models—continuous hippocampal stimulation to induce status epilepticus (SE) and kindling—were used to induce seizures.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>HCAR2 was localized in dentate granule cells and microglia. In mice with HCAR2, β-hydroxybutyrate reduced neuronal excitability by hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential, raising the action potential threshold, and reducing the firing frequency of dentate granule cells. β-hydroxybutyrate suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission. These effects were nullified in HCAR2<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> mice. HCAR2<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> mice showed no cognitive impairment. Moreover, β-hydroxybutyrate did not affect seizures in HCAR2<sup>−</sup>/<sup>−</sup> mice. However, it diminished both the duration and severity of seizures in HCAR2<sup>+</sup>/<sup>+</sup> mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings demonstrate that HCAR2 mediates β-hydroxybutyrate's antiseizure effects by regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. These studies propose a new mechanism for the antiseizure action of the ketogenic diet. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) isoforms are crucial for synaptic function and neurotransmission. Although their precise physiological roles remain unclear, SV2 proteins serve as receptors for several botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) and are also the targets of anticonvulsants. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have greatly advanced our understanding of the structure and function of both SV2 proteins and BoNTs. The findings unveiled the molecular architectures of BoNTs, their receptors SV2A and SV2B, and how anticonvulsants bind to SV2A and how these interactions can be modulated allosterically. Additionally, the studies revealed a conserved binding mode in the interaction between BoNT/A and SV2 proteins, which involves significant conformational changes in the toxin. In this review, we will discuss these findings and their implications.

                The transcription factor FoxP3 binds DNA through two modes: multimerization on TnG repeats to stabilize chromatin loops and head-to-head dimerization on inverted forkhead motifs. Pull-down sequencing reveals relaxed motifs enabling head-to-head binding, which seeds FoxP3 multimerization on adjacent microsatellites. This dual strategy expands FoxP3’s sequence repertoire and chromatin-architectural function.
