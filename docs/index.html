              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Small sensory spinal lesions that affect hand function in monkeys greatly alter primary afferent and motor neuron connections in the cord</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Small sensory spinal injuries induce plasticity across the neuraxis, but little is understood about their effect on segmental connections or motor neuron (MN) function. Here, we begin to address this at two levels. First, we compared afferent input distributions from the skin and muscles of the digits with corresponding MN pools to determine their spatial relationship, in both the normal state and 4–6 months after a unilateral dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL), affecting digits 1–3. Second, we looked at specific changes to MN inputs and membrane properties that likely impact functional recovery. Monkeys received a targeted unilateral DRL/DCL, and 4–6 months later, cholera toxin subunit B (CT-B) was injected bilaterally into either the distal pads of digits 1–3, or related intrinsic hand muscles, to label inputs to the cord, and corresponding MNs. In controls (unlesioned side), cutaneous and proprioceptive afferents from digits 1–3 showed different distribution patterns but similar rostrocaudal spread within the dorsal horn from C1 to T2. In contrast, MNs were distributed across just two segments (C7–8). Following the lesion, sensory inputs were significantly diminished across all 10 segments, though this did not alter MN distributions. Afferent and monoamine inputs, as well as KCC2 cotransporters, were also significantly altered on the cell membrane of CT-B labeled MNs postlesion. In contrast, inhibitory neurotransmission and perineuronal net integrity were not altered at this prechronic timepoint.  Our findings indicate that even a small sensory injury can significantly impact sensory and motor spinal neurons and provide new insight into the complex process of recovery.</p>

	<p>Exendin-4 (Ex-4), better known in its synthetic form and used clinically as exenatide, currently applied in the treatment of diabetes, induces a beneficial impact on nerve cells, and shows promising effects in obstructive lung diseases. At an advanced age, the development of the neurodegenerative process of brain tissue is masked by numerous concomitant diseases. The initial latent phase of neurodegenerative disease results in occurrence of manifestations at an advanced stage. To protect the brain and to simultaneously ensure proper treatment of common coexisting conditions in late life, such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma, a pleiotropic medication should be chosen. Molecular mechanisms of Ex-4 exert neuroprotective effects or lead to secondary neurogenesis. Additionally, Ex-4 plays an important role in anti-inflammatory actions which are necessary both in the case of asthma and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Specific receptors in the lungs also reduce the secretion of surfactants, which decreases the risk of exacerbation in chronic obstructive lung disease. In a great number of patients suffering from diabetes, asthma, or chronic lung disease, there is a great potential for both treatment of the main condition and protection against brain neurodegeneration.</p>

	<p>Objective. To explore the most important predictors of post-operative efficacy in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Methods. From January 2013 to January 2019, 284 patients with DCM were enrolled. They were categorized based on the different surgical methods used: single anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) (n = 80), double ACDF (n = 56), three ACDF (n = 13), anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) (n = 63), anterior cervical hybrid decompression and fusion (ACHDF) (n = 25), laminoplasty (n = 38) and laminectomy and fusion (n = 9). The follow-up time was 2 years. The patients were divided into two groups based on the mJOA recovery rate at the last follow-up: Group A (the excellent improvement group, mJOA recovery rate &amp;amp;gt;50%, n = 213) and Group B (the poor improvement group, mJOA recovery rate &amp;amp;le;50%, n = 71). The evaluated data included age, gender, BMI, duration of symptoms (months), smoking, drinking, number of lesion segments, surgical methods, surgical time, blood loss, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), CCI classification, imaging parameters (CL, T1S, C2-7SVA, CL (F), T1S (F), C2-7SVA (F), CL (E), T1S (E), C2-7SVA (E), CL (ROM), T1S (ROM) and C2-7SVA (ROM)), maximum spinal cord compression (MSCC), maximum canal compromise (MCC), Transverse area (TA), Transverse area ratio (TAR), compression ratio (CR) and the Coefficient compression ratio (CCR). The visual analog score (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) and mJOA recovery rate were used to assess cervical spinal function and quality of life. Results. We found that there was no significant difference in the baseline data among the different surgical groups and that there were only significant differences in the number of lesion segments, C2&amp;amp;ndash;7SVA, T1S (F), T1S (ROM), TA, CR, surgical time and blood loss. Therefore, there was comparability of the post-operative recovery among the different surgical groups, and we found that there were significant differences in age, the duration of symptoms, CL and pre-mJOA between Group A and Group B. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that the duration of the symptoms was an independent risk factor for post-operative efficacy in patients with DCM. Meanwhile, when the duration of symptoms was &amp;amp;ge;6.5 months, the prognosis of patients was more likely to be poor, and the probability of a poor prognosis increased by 0.196 times for each additional month of symptom duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, OR = 1.196). Conclusion. For patients with DCM (regardless of the number of lesion segments and the proposed surgical methods), the duration of symptoms was an independent risk factor for the post-operative efficacy. When the duration of symptoms was &amp;amp;ge;6.5 months, the prognosis of patients was more likely to be poor, and the probability of a poor prognosis increased by 0.196 times for each additional month of symptom duration (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, OR = 1.196).</p>

     alt="Positive effects of running exercise on astrocytes in the medial prefrontal cortex in an animal model of depression"/>
<p>Using immunohistochemical and stereological methods, immunofluorescence assays, RNA sequencing and qRT–PCR techniques, we found that running exercise increased the total number of astrocytes and the density of newborn astrocytes and reversed the changes in the gene expression levels of GFAP, S100b, and the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST in the mPFC of CUS animals. Our results suggested that changes in the astrocyte number and glutamate transporter function may be potential meditators of the effects of running exercise in the treatment of depression.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and seriously affects all aspects of life. Running exercise has been suggested to prevent or alleviate the occurrence and development of depression; however, the underlying mechanisms of these effects remain unclear. Independent studies have indicated that astrocytes play essential roles and that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is an important brain region involved in the pathology underlying depression. However, it is unknown whether running exercise achieves antidepressant effects by affecting the number of astrocytes and glutamate transport function in the mPFC. Here, animal models of depression were established using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), and depression-like behavior was assessed by the sucrose preference test. After successfully establishing the depression model, experimental animals performed running exercise. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP<sup>+</sup>) cell number in the mPFC was precisely quantified using immunohistochemical and stereological methods<span style="text-decoration:underline">,</span> and the densities of bromodeoxyuridine-positive (BrdU<sup>+</sup>) and BrdU<sup>+</sup>/GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells in the mPFC were measured using a semiquantitative immunofluorescence assay. Changes in glutamate transporter gene expression in mPFC astrocytes were detected by mRNA sequencing and qRT–PCR. We found that running exercise reversed CUS-induced decreases in sucrose preference, increased astrocyte number and the density of newborn astrocytes, and reversed decreases in gene expression levels of GFAP, S100b, and the glutamate transporters GLT-1 and GLAST in the mPFC of CUS animals. These results suggested that changes in astrocyte number and glutamate transporter function may be potential meditators of the effects of running exercise in the treatment of depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors associated with health facility delivery in Kitui County: a cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: High maternal mortality rate is a major public health concern in developing countries.  Skilled birth delivery is central to reducing maternal mortality, yet health facility delivery remains low in Kitui County, Kenya. Our study estimated prevalence of unskilled delivery and identified factors associated with health facility delivery in Kitui County. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted December 2017-February 2018. 245 women from five administrative wards were interviewed. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Variables that had p value ≤0.05 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariable regression model to assess for confounders. Variables with a p value of ≤0.05 in multivariate analysis were considered statistically significant at 95% CI.  Results: We interviewed 245 (240 analyzed) women from the five wards; the majority were 16-25 years age group (45.5%; 110/240).  Mean age was 27±6.6 years. Prevalence of health facility delivery was 50.4%. Distance from a health facility, number of children in a household, occupation of the respondent’s partner, number of antenatal clinic (ANC) visits and means of transport were significant factors for not delivering in a health facility. On multivariate analysis, women who lived >5km from health facility were less likely to deliver in a health facility (AOR =0.36; 95% CI 0.15- 0.86). Women who attended ≥ 4 ANC visits were 4 times more likely to deliver in a health facility (95% CI 2.01-8.79). Conclusions: More than half of the respondents delivered in a health facility. A long distance from the health facility is a hindrance to accessing ANC services. Inadequate ANC visits was associated with home delivery. Improving accessibility of health care services and health education on family planning would increase delivery at a health facility. We recommend Kitui County introduce five satellite clinics/ambulatory services for expectant women to access ANC and maternal services.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Single-cell multiomics analyses of spindle-transferred human embryos suggest a mostly normal embryonic development</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shuyue Qi, Wei Wang, Xiaohui Xue, Zhuo Lu, Jia Yan, Yunfei Li, Yu Zhang, Mingming Shu, Chunlan Song, Qihang Wang, Yunhai Chuai, Xinyu Zhai, Shujie Han, Fuchou Tang, Wei Shang</p>

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are often associated with incurable diseases and lead to detectable pathogenic variants in 1 out of 200 babies. Uncoupling of the inheritance of mtDNA and the nuclear genome by spindle transfer (ST) can potentially prevent the transmission of mtDNA mutations from mother to offspring. However, no well-established studies have critically assessed the safety of this technique. Here, using single-cell triple omics sequencing method, we systematically analyzed the genome (copy number variation), DNA methylome, and transcriptome of ST and control blastocysts. The results showed that, compared to that in control embryos, the percentage of aneuploid cells in ST embryos did not significantly change. The epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm (TE) of ST blastocysts presented RNA expression profiles that were comparable to those of control blastocysts. However, the DNA demethylation process in TE cells of ST blastocysts was slightly slower than that in the control blastocysts. Collectively, our results suggest that ST seems generally safe for embryonic development, with a relatively minor delay in the DNA demethylation process at the blastocyst stage.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The EICAT+ framework enables classification of positive impacts of alien taxa on native biodiversity</a></h4>

Probert, Lara Volery, Ruben Bernardo-Madrid, Sandro Bertolino, Vanessa Céspedes, Franz Essl, Thomas Evans, Belinda Gallardo, Laure Gallien, Pablo González-Moreno, Marie Charlotte Grange, Cang Hui, Jonathan M.

Wilson, Sven Bacher</p>

Species introduced through human-related activities beyond their native range, termed alien species, have various impacts worldwide. The IUCN Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) is a global standard to assess negative impacts of alien species on native biodiversity. Alien species can also positively affect biodiversity (for instance, through food and habitat provisioning or dispersal facilitation) but there is currently no standardized and evidence-based system to classify positive impacts. We fill this gap by proposing EICAT+, which uses 5 semiquantitative scenarios to categorize the magnitude of positive impacts, and describes underlying mechanisms. EICAT+ can be applied to all alien taxa at different spatial and organizational scales. The application of EICAT+ expands our understanding of the consequences of biological invasions and can inform conservation decisions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Parents’ perceptions on policies of early childhood care and education programmes in selected states of Malaysia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development proposed global equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all children. The quality of early childhood care and education (ECCE) programs helps shape children’s minds, attitudes and behaviors, and has short and long-term effects on a child, a family and a country. In Malaysia, the government has formulated some policies and laws to protect children’s rights. However, ECCE is facing some challenges. The purpose of this study is to investigate parents’ perceptions of the quality of ECCE programs implemented by Malaysian government. Methods: A mixed method was used to collect data on parents’ perceptions of ECCE policies in selected states in Malaysia. The questionnaires, (P1/POL) from the research project “Development of a Comprehensive and Integrated Model of Quality Malaysian ECCE”, were distributed among 629 respondents who have a child in a preschool, and 22 participants were randomly selected to take part in five focus group interviews Results: The key findings of the study revealed 68% parents were not familiar with ECCE Malaysian government policy, however 84.3% stressed it is important for the government to educate them about ECCE. Thus findings indicated that the majority of parents lack awareness of the ECCE policies and quality of early childhood care and education programs related to the policies remain the issue. While interviewing the focus group ,most of them were not aware of ECCE and pointed out parents are stressing children’s academic learning in particular preschools. Conclusions: It is concluded that parents’ awareness regarding the ECCE program must be part of the policies and needs to improve. It is recommended that the government of Malaysia should supply more information on ECCE policies to parents and focus on policy implementation. Moreover, the quality of ECCE programs should be improved based on the parents’ perceptions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Critical delay factors for construction projects in Central Aceh District, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Construction development in Indonesia is growing rapidly, especially in Central Aceh District. Construction projects have distinctive characteristics and are very complex, so that risk events can have a serious impact on the viability of the project. Project delays can result in cost overruns and project losses. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the factors causing project delays.The purpose of this study was to (1) identify the risk factors that cause delays in construction projects and (2) determine those particular risk factors that have a greater influence on construction projects. The location of this research was Central Aceh District. Methods: The data in this study were primary data in the form of a questionnaire and secondary data obtained from the literature related to this particular type of research. Questionnaires were distributed to respondents, namely contractor companies located in the Central Aceh District. The questionnaires were distributed to determine respondents' opinions about the level of influence of risk factors causing project delays. We used a validity test, reliability test, and descriptive analysis for data processing. Results: Based on the results of the study from 47 respondents, the “very high influence” category (Mode=5) for the tool malfunction factor, cost estimation inaccuracy, increased work costs, implementation of new technologies, details, accuracy and conformity to specifications that are not appropriate, worker quarrels, poor project planning and management, poor condition at locations and accessibility difficulty. Conclusions: Of the 80 risk factors that caused project delays, eight risk factors were found to have a very high influence on the implementation of construction projects in Central Aceh District. Practical implications: The results of this study provide knowledge to contractor companies about the delay factors that have the most influence on project implementation so that they are expected to be able to manage risks to avoid losses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hobotnica: exploring molecular signature quality [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                A Molecular Features Set (MFS), is a result of a vast diversity of bioinformatics pipelines. The lack of a “gold standard” for most experimental data modalities makes it difficult to provide valid estimation for a particular MFS's quality. Yet, this goal can partially be achieved by analyzing inner-sample Distance Matrices (DM) and their power to distinguish between phenotypes. The quality of a DM can be assessed by summarizing its power to quantify the differences of inner-phenotype and outer-phenotype distances. This estimation of the DM quality can be construed as a measure of the MFS's quality.  Here we propose Hobotnica, an approach to estimate MFSs quality by their ability to stratify data, and assign them significance scores, that allow for collating various signatures and comparing their quality for contrasting groups.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Overdose symptoms and positive affect in never-established smokers are moderated by nicotine patch type: A between-subjects experimental investigation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A growing number of studies have assessed the effects of acute nicotine on affect, cognition, and brain activity in never-established smokers in attempts to identify mechanisms by which nicotine promotes progression to dependence. However, these acute administration studies have not adequately addressed the problem of potential adverse side effects due to lack of tolerance, such as nausea, feelings of sickness, lightheadedness, and general negative affect and malaise – a term referred to as nicotine overdose events (NODEs). Thus, we report the first study to carefully characterize the prevalence, intensity, and effects of NODEs in never-established-smokers after acute nicotine administration. Methods: We compared the subjective effects of two different 7 mg nicotine patches that have different pharmacokinetics on never-established smokers (n = 67). One patch produces gradual increases in blood nicotine and the other produces more rapid increases in blood nicotine. Results: The findings suggest that in never-smokers, the lowest dose (7 mg) of rapid blood nicotine-rise patches are associated with a high prevalence of NODEs (45.83%) and decreased positive affect (PA) (54.17%) compared to a placebo patch (8.34% for NODEs and 33.34% for PA). The slow-rise patch did not significantly affect nicotine overdose symptoms or PA. Conclusions: Fast blood-rise nicotine patches may not be an ecologically valid method of nicotine delivery to never-smokers, while slow-rise nicotine patches, lower dose, and self-paced dosing may be more appropriate in this population. Findings also highlight the importance of the careful assessment of NODES in this population.

                It is indisputable that every day it is demonstrated that natural products present diverse therapeutic benefits, which has boosted their incorporation within various products for clinical use. However, this must be accompanied by knowledge of their effect on cell lines to ensure their use is safe. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of two ethanolic extracts based on Peruvian natural products, on three human cell lines. Cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa), human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1 - ATCC CRL-2014) (HGF-1) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured and subsequently treated with preparations of ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEP) and Psidium guajava (EEG) from a concentration of 50 mg/mL to 0.024 mg/mL, by the 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazole bromide reduction assay. At a concentration of 0.24 mg/mL EEG, viability of 99.7±1.24%, 99.8±2.2% and 99.7±2.7% was observed in HeLa, HGF-1 and PBMCs, respectively; >90% cell viability values were observed with EPP at 0.024 mg/mL, with HGF-1 showing the highest viability (96.9±1.15%). A dose-dependent effect was observed for both extracts with a decrease in cell viability as concentrations increased (up to 50 mg/mL). EEP and EEG extracts at low concentrations do not show cytotoxicity in human cell lines, these findings are an advance in the preclinical evaluation on their safety and open a continuity to further studies for their potential applications in dentistry and medicine.

                Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations drive succinate accumulation in tumor microenvironments. Gudgeon et al. observe that succinate suppresses T cell degranulation and cytokine secretion, particularly IFN-γ. This is associated with succinate uptake, inhibited succinyl-CoA synthetase activity, and impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. Consistently, IFN-γ-induced genes are suppressed in SDH-deficient neuroendocrine tumors.

Such a checkpoint preserves cell viability in vitro and sustains tissue regeneration in response to dextran sulfate sodium-mediated intestine injury in living animals.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Temporal control of PDGFRα regulates the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition in wound healing</a></h4>

              
                Yao et al. use lineage-tracing and wound-healing experiments in mice to investigate functions of the PDGFRα signaling pathway in the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. Their analysis indicates an early role for PDGFRα-SRF signaling to support fibroblast proliferation, followed by PDGFRα downregulation and a transition to MRTF-SRF control over myofibroblast differentiation.

                Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent lipid mediator. Using mouse models, Le et al. demonstrate that the sources of extracellular S1P released from Mfsd2b and Spns2 are essential for protection of the vasculature from hemorrhages during development and in anaphylactic shock.

                The cell-of-origin chromatin interactions persist and restrict cell-identity transition during transdifferentiation. Ren et al. characterize the MyoD- and CTCF-mediated chromatin loops and associated genes to uncover the underlying chromatin-based obstacles that hamper myogenic transformation. Perturbing the stable chromatin interactions can improve cell conversion in multiple species.

                Kelley et al. report that, while CRISPR-Cas13d reduces CUGn RNA foci and restores RNA processing in a HeLa model of myotonic dystrophy type 1, Cas13d collateral activity dramatically depletes cellular RNAs and interferes with core processes. They develop a negative autoregulation strategy to enable repeat-targeting therapies by minimizing Cas13d expression.

                Luo et al. report a noncanonical function of ATG9A in regulating Golgi dynamics. Under heat stress, ATG9A is ubiquitinated by MARCH9 and interacts with GRASP55 to impair its Golgi stacking ability, mediating Golgi fragmentation. ATG9A-dependent Golgi fragmentation also occurs in response to Golgi stress and is required for Golgi dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MKK6 deficiency promotes cardiac dysfunction through MKK3-p38γ/δ-mTOR hyperactivation</a></h4>

              
                Stress-activated p38 kinases control a plethora of functions, and their dysregulation has been linked to the development of steatosis, obesity, immune disorders, and cancer. Therefore, they have been identified as potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. There are four p38 family members (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) that are activated by MKK3 and MKK6. Here, we demonstrate that lack of MKK6 reduces the lifespan in mice. Longitudinal study of cardiac function in MKK6 KO mice showed that young mice develop cardiac hypertrophy which progresses to cardiac dilatation and fibrosis with age. Mechanistically, lack of MKK6 blunts p38α activation while causing MKK3-p38γ/δ hyperphosphorylation and increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, resulting in cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy in MKK6 KO mice is reverted by knocking out either p38γ or p38δ or by inhibiting the mTOR pathway with rapamycin. In conclusion, we have identified a key role for the MKK3/6-p38γ/δ pathway in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which has important implications for the clinical use of p38α inhibitors in the long-term treatment since they might result in cardiotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Earliest evidence for fruit consumption and potential seed dispersal by birds</a></h4>

              
                The Early Cretaceous diversification of birds was a major event in the history of terrestrial ecosystems, occurring during the earliest phase of the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution, long before the origin of the bird crown-group. Frugivorous birds play an important role in seed dispersal today. However, evidence of fruit consumption in early birds from outside the crown-group has been lacking. <i>Jeholornis</i> is one of the earliest-diverging birds, only slightly more crownward than <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, but its cranial anatomy has been poorly understood, limiting trophic information which may be gleaned from the skull. Originally hypothesised to be granivorous based on seeds preserved as gut contents, this interpretation has become controversial. We conducted high-resolution synchrotron tomography on an exquisitely preserved new skull of <i>Jeholornis</i>, revealing remarkable cranial plesiomorphies combined with a specialised rostrum. We use this to provide a near-complete cranial reconstruction of <i>Jeholornis</i>, and exclude the possibility that <i>Jeholornis</i> was granivorous, based on morphometric analyses of the mandible (3D) and cranium (2D), and comparisons with the 3D alimentary contents of extant birds. We show that <i>Jeholornis</i> provides the earliest evidence for fruit consumption in birds, and indicates that birds may have been recruited for seed dispersal during the earliest stages of the avian radiation. As mobile seed dispersers, early frugivorous birds could have expanded the scope for biotic dispersal in plants, and might therefore explain, at least in part, the subsequent evolutionary expansion of fruits, indicating a potential role of bird–plant interactions in the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Zika virus causes placental pyroptosis and associated adverse fetal outcomes by activating GSDME</a></h4>

              
                Zika virus (ZIKV) can be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy, causing adverse fetal outcomes. Several studies have indicated that ZIKV can damage the fetal brain directly; however, whether the ZIKV-induced maternal placental injury contributes to adverse fetal outcomes is sparsely defined. Here, we demonstrated that ZIKV causes the pyroptosis of placental cells by activating the executor gasdermin E (GSDME) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TNF-α release is induced upon the recognition of viral genomic RNA by RIG-I, followed by activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 to ultimately escalate the GSDME cleavage. Further analyses revealed that the ablation of GSDME or treatment with TNF-α receptor antagonist in ZIKV-infected pregnant mice attenuates placental pyroptosis, which consequently confers protection against adverse fetal outcomes. In conclusion, our study unveils a novel mechanism of ZIKV-induced adverse fetal outcomes via causing placental cell pyroptosis, which provides new clues for developing therapies for ZIKV-associated diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mutual interaction between visual homeostatic plasticity and sleep in adult humans</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and plasticity are highly interrelated, as sleep slow oscillations and sleep spindles are associated with consolidation of Hebbian-based processes. However, in adult humans, visual cortical plasticity is mainly sustained by homeostatic mechanisms, for which the role of sleep is still largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that non-REM sleep stabilizes homeostatic plasticity of ocular dominance induced in adult humans by short-term monocular deprivation: the counter-intuitive and otherwise transient boost of the deprived eye was preserved at the morning awakening (&gt;6 hours after deprivation). Subjects exhibiting a stronger boost of the deprived eye after sleep had increased sleep spindle density in frontopolar electrodes, suggesting the involvement of distributed processes. Crucially, the individual susceptibility to visual homeostatic plasticity soon after deprivation correlated with the changes in sleep slow oscillations and spindle power in occipital sites, consistent with a modulation in early occipital visual cortex.

                The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is important in descending modulation of spinal nociceptive transmission, but it is unclear if the RVM also modulates spinal pruriceptive transmission. RVM ON cells are activated by noxious algesic and pruritic stimuli and are pronociceptive. Many RVM-spinal projection neurons express the neurokinin-1 receptor (Tacr1), and ON-cells are excited by local administration of substance P (SP). We hypothesized that Tacr1-expressing RVM ON cells exert an inhibitory effect on itch opposite to their pronociceptive action. Intramedullary microinjection of SP significantly potentiated RVM ON cells and reduced pruritogen-evoked scratching while producing mild mechanical sensitization. Chemogenetic activation of RVM Tacr1-expressing RVM neurons also reduced acute pruritogen-evoked scratching. Optotagging experiments confirmed RVM Tacr1-expressing neurons to be ON cells. We conclude that Tacr1-expressing ON cells in RVM play a significant role in the modulation of pruriceptive transmission.

                <i>De novo</i> mutations in voltage- and ligand-gated channels have been associated with an increasing number of cases of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, which often fail to respond to classic antiseizure medications. Here, we examine two knock-in mouse models replicating <i>de novo</i> sequence variations in the <i>HCN1</i> voltage-gated channel gene, p.G391D and p.M153I (<i>Hcn1<sup>G380D/+</sup></i> and <i>Hcn1<sup>M142I/+</sup></i> in mouse), associated with severe drug-resistant neonatal- and childhood-onset epilepsy, respectively. Heterozygous mice from both lines displayed spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Animals replicating the p.G391D variant had an overall more severe phenotype, with pronounced alterations in the levels and distribution of HCN1 protein, including disrupted targeting to the axon terminals of basket cell interneurons. In line with clinical reports from patients with pathogenic <i>HCN1</i> sequence variations, administration of the antiepileptic Na<sup>+</sup> channel antagonists lamotrigine and phenytoin resulted in the paradoxical induction of seizures in both mouse lines, consistent with an effect to further impair inhibitory neuron function. We also show that these variants can render HCN1 channels unresponsive to classic antagonists, indicating the need to screen mutated channels to identify novel compounds with diverse mechanism of action. Our results underscore the necessity of tailoring effective therapies for specific channel gene variants, and how strongly validated animal models may provide an invaluable tool towards reaching this objective.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Separate and shared low-dimensional neural architectures for error-based and reinforcement motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Motor learning is supported by multiple systems adapted to processing different forms of sensory information (e.g., reward versus error feedback), and by higher-order systems supporting strategic processes. Yet, the extent to which these systems recruit shared versus separate neural pathways is poorly understood. To elucidate these pathways, we separately studied error-based (EL) and reinforcement-based (RL) motor learning in two functional MRI experiments in the same human subjects. We find that EL and RL occupy opposite ends of neural axis broadly separating cerebellar and striatal connectivity, respectively, with somatomotor cortex, and that alignment of this axis to each task is related to performance. Further, we identify a separate neural axis that is associated with strategy use during EL, and show that the expression of this same axis during RL predicts better performance. Together, these results offer a macroscale view of the common versus distinct neural architectures supporting different learning systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Concurrent measures of impulsive action and choice are partially related and differentially modulated by dopamine D1- and D2-like receptors in a rat model of impulsivity</a></h4>

              
                Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct, but the relationships between its constructs and their respective underlying dopaminergic underpinnings in the normal population remain unclear. A large cohort of Roman high- (RHA) and low- (RLA) avoidance rats were tested for impulsive action and risky decision-making in the rat gambling task, and then for delay discounting in the delay discounting task to concurrently measure the relationships among the three constructs of impulsivity using a within-subject design. Then, we evaluated the effects of dopaminergic drugs on the three constructs of impulsivity, considering innate differences in impulsive behaviors at baseline. Risky decision-making and delay discounting were positively correlated, indicating that both constructs of impulsive choice are related. Impulsive action positively correlated with risky decision-making but not with delay discounting, suggesting partial overlap between impulsive action and impulsive choice. RHAs showed a more impulsive phenotype in the three constructs of impulsivity compared to RLAs, demonstrating the comorbid nature of impulsivity in a normal population. While amphetamine increased impulsive action and had no effects on risky decision-making regardless of baseline levels of impulsivity, it decreased delay discounting but only in high impulsive RHAs. Conversely, the D1R agonist SKF81297, D3R agonist PD128907 and D2/3R partial agonist aripiprazole decreased impulsive action irrespective of baseline levels of impulsivity, whereas D2/3R agonism with quinpirole decreased it exclusively in high impulsive RHAs. Risky decision-making was increased by SKF81297 and quinpirole but not PD128907 and aripiprazole, with quinpirole producing baseline-dependent effects, increasing risky decision-making only in low impulsive RLAs. Finally, while SKF81297, PD128907 and aripiprazole increased delay discounting irrespective of baseline levels of impulsivity, quinpirole decreased it in low impulsive RLAs only. These findings indicate that the acute effects of dopamine drugs were partially overlapping across dimensions of impulsivity, and that only D2/3R agonism showed baseline-dependent effects on the three constructs of impulsivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Neural Index Reflecting the Amount of Cognitive Resources Available during Memory Encoding: A Model-based Approach</a></h4>

              
                Humans have a limited amount of cognitive resources to process various cognitive operations at a given moment. The Source of Activation Confusion (SAC) model of episodic memory proposes that resources are consumed during each processing and once depleted they need time to recover gradually. This has been supported by a series of behavioral findings in the past. However, the neural substrate of the resources is not known. In the present study, over an existing EEG dataset of a free recall task (Kahana et al., 2022), we provided a neural index reflecting the amount of cognitive resources available for forming new memory traces. Unique to our approach, we obtained the neural index not through correlating neural patterns with behavior outcomes or experimental conditions, but by demonstrating its alignment with a latent quantity of cognitive resources inferred from the SAC model. In addition, we showed that the identified neural index can be used to propose novel hypothesis regarding other long-term memory phenomena. Specifically, we found that according to the neural index, neural encoding patterns for subsequently recalled items correspond to greater available cognitive resources compared with that for subsequently unrecalled items. This provides a mechanistic account for the long-established subsequent memory effects (SMEs, i.e. differential neural encoding patterns between subsequently recalled versus subsequently unrecalled items), which has been previously associated with attention, fatigue and properties of the stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Posteromedial cortical networks encode visuomotor prediction errors.</a></h4>

              
                The purpose of sensory processing in the brain involves guiding animals to appropriate actions by estimating the causes of sensory changes in the environment. Encoding prediction error computed from the mismatch between actual input and predictions based on experience is considered an effective strategy for sensory perception in the brain. However, it remains unknown how predictive computation is implemented in the hierarchy of neural circuits in cortical areas. Here, we monitored dorsal cortex-wide neural activity using a wide-field Ca2+ imaging technique when mice encountered visuomotor mismatches in virtual reality. Posterior medial cortical areas sequentially responded to the visuomotor mismatches. The magnitude of these responses was associated with the predictability of the mismatch events. Granger causality and anatomical analysis demonstrated experience-dependent information flow structure underlying the mismatch signal transmission across the cortex. Our results reveal that the subnetworks in posteromedial cortical areas process the prediction errors in a hierarchical manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The RSK-RPS6 axis controls the preconditioning effect and induces spinal cord regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Unlike immature neurons and neurons from the peripheral nervous system (PNS), mature neurons from the central nervous system (CNS) cannot regenerate after injury. In the past 15 years, huge progress has been made to identify molecules and pathways necessary for neuroprotection and/or regeneration after CNS injury. In most regenerative models, phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-S6) is upregulated in neurons, which is often associated with an activation of the mTOR pathway. However, the exact contribution of post-translational modifications of this ribosomal protein in CNS regeneration remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that RPS6 phosphorylation is essential for PNS and CNS regeneration. We show that this phosphorylation is induced during the preconditioning effect in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and that it is controlled by the p90S6 kinase RSK2. Our results reveal that RSK2 controls the preconditioning effect and that the RSK2-RPS6 axis is key for this process, as well as for PNS regeneration. Finally, we demonstrate that RSK2 promotes CNS regeneration in the dorsal column and allows functional recovery. Our data establish the critical role of RPS6 phosphorylation controlled by RSK2 in CNS regeneration and give new insights into the mechanism related to axon growth and circuit formation after traumatic lesion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical processing underpins competition in tactile perceptual bistability</a></h4>

              
                Ambiguous sensory information can lead to spontaneous alternations between perceptual states, recently shown to extend to tactile perception. The authors recently proposed a simplified form of tactile rivalry which evokes two competing percepts for a fixed difference in input amplitudes across antiphase, pulsatile stimulation of the left and right fingers. This study addresses the need for a tactile rivalry model that captures the dynamics of perceptual alternations and that incorporates the structure of the somatosensory system. The model features hierarchical processing with two stages; a first stage resolves perceptual competition, leading to perceptual alternations; and a second stage encodes perceptual interpretations. The first stage could be located downstream of brainstem nuclei and the second stage could be located within the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b). The model captures dynamical features specific to the tactile rivalry percepts and produces general characteristics of perceptual rivalry: input strength dependence of dominance times (Levelt's proposition II), short-tailed skewness of dominance time distributions and the ratio of distribution moments. The presented modelling work leads to experimentally testable predictions. The same hierarchical model could generalise to account for percept formation, competition and alternations for bistable stimuli that involve pulsatile inputs from the visual and auditory domains.

                Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD) is caused by recessive variants in PLA2G6 and is a lethal pediatric neurodegenerative disorder. Loss of the Drosophila homolog of PLA2G6, leads to ceramide accumulation, lysosome expansion, and mitochondrial defects. Here, we report that ceramide metabolism, the endolysosomal pathway, and mitochondrial morphology are affected in INAD patient-derived neurons. We show that in INAD mouse models the same features are affected and that glucosylceramides are elevated in dopaminergic neurons and Purkinje cells, arguing that the neuropathological mechanisms are evolutionary conserved and that ceramides can be used as biomarkers. We tested 20 drugs that target these pathways and found that Ambroxol, Desipramine, Azoramide, and Genistein alleviate neurodegenerative phenotypes in INAD flies and INAD patient-derived NPCs. We also develop an AAV-based gene therapy approach that delays neurodegeneration and prolongs lifespan in an INAD mouse model.

                The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small arboreal New World primate which has emerged as a promising model in auditory neuroscience. One potentially useful application of this model system is in the study of the neural mechanism underlying spatial hearing in primate species, as the marmoset's visually occluded natural habitat in the forest would make sound localization an essential behavior for survival. However, interpretation of neurophysiological data on sound localization requires an understanding of perceptual abilities, and the sound localization behavior of marmosets has not been well studied. The present experiment measured sound localization acuity using an operant conditioning procedure in which marmosets were trained to discriminate changes in sound location in the horizontal (azimuth) or vertical (elevation) dimension. Our results showed that the minimum audible angle (MAA) for horizontal discrimination was on average 15{degrees} for band-passed Gaussian noise and 13{degrees} for Random Spectral Shape (RSS) stimuli, whereas the MAA for vertical locations was at 17{degrees} and 22{degrees} for band-passed Gaussian noises containing more and less high frequency energy, respectively.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain plasticity and auditory spatial adaptation in patients with unilateral hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Unilateral hearing loss (UHL) alters binaural cues affecting speech comprehension and sound localisation. While many patients with UHL perform poorly on binaural tasks, some are able to adapt to monaural deficit. We aimed to identify patients with UHL who use compensatory strategies and to explore the neural correlates of this adaptation using Mismatch Negativity (MMN). We recruited 21 patients with UHL and we separated them into three groups using cluster analysis based on measures of binaural processing. The resulting groups were referred to as the better, moderate and poorer performers clusters (BPC, MPC and PPC). We measured the MMN elicited by deviant sounds located 10{degrees}, 20{degrees} or 100{degrees} away from a standard sound. We found that the BPC group had a significant MMN for all three deviant sounds, as in a group of normal-hearing controls. In contrast, the PPC group and normal-hearing controls with an earplug did not have a significant MMN for the 10{degrees} and 20{degrees} deviations. For the 100{degrees} deviation, the scalp distribution was found to be maximal over central regions in the BPC group, while the PPC group showed a more frontal distribution. Differences were also found for the N100 evoked by standard sounds, with the BPC group showing a contralateral pattern of activation, as in the controls, and the PPC group showing more symmetrical hemispheric activation. These results indicate that patients with UHL can develop adaptive strategies that are reflected by sound processing differences at the cortical level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sequential involvements of macaque perirhinal cortex and hippocampus in semantic-like memory including spatial component</a></h4>

              
                The standard consolidation theory suggests the critical involvement of the hippocampus (HPC) in acquiring new knowledge, while the perirhinal cortex (PRC) is involved in its long-term storage (i.e., semantic memory). Converging studies have shown exclusive involvement of the PRC in item processing, while the HPC relates the item with a spatial context. These two lines of literature raise the following question; which brain region is involved in semantic recall that includes the spatial components? To solve this question, we applied an item-location associative (ILA) paradigm in a single-unit study using non-human primates. We trained two macaques to associate four visual item pairs with four locations on a background map before the recording sessions. In each trial, one visual item and the map image at a tilt (-90 to 90 degrees) were sequentially presented as the item-cue and the context-cue, respectively. The macaques chose the item-cue location relative to the context-cue by positioning their gaze. Neurons in both PRC and HPC but not area TE exhibited item-cue responses which signaled retrieval of item-location associative memory. This retrieval signal first appeared in the PRC before appearing in the HPC. We examined whether neural representations of the retrieved locations were related to the external space where the macaques viewed. A positive representation similarity was found in the HPC but not PRC, suggesting a contribution of the HPC to relate the retrieved location with a first-person perspective of the subjects. These results suggest their distinct but complementary contributions to semantic recall including spatial components.

                In addition to their cell-autonomous activities, a number of homeoprotein transcription factors transfer between cells and regulate gene expression, protein translation and chromatin organization in a non-cell autonomous way. ENGRAILED-1 is one such homeoprotein and is expressed in spinal V1 interneurons that synapse on -motoneurons. Neutralizing extracellular ENGRAILED-1 by expressing a secreted single chain antibody blocks its capture by spinal motoneurons and induces the loss of neuromuscular strength and of some -motoneurons. A similar but stronger phenotype is observed in the Engrailed-1 heterozygote mouse, confirming that ENGRAILED-1 exerts a non-cell autonomous neurotrophic activity on spinal cord -motoneurons. Intrathecal injection of ENGRAILED-1 leads to its specific internalization by spinal motoneurons and has long-lasting protective effects against neurodegeneration and neuromuscular weakness. Midbrain dopaminergic neurons express Engrailed-1 and, similarly to spinal cord -motoneurons, degenerate in the heterozygote. The identification of genes with modified expression in Engrailed-1 heterozygote versus wild-type midbrain neurons that are also expressed in spinal cord motoneurons and with modified expression in the main familial ALS forms, led us to identify SQTSM1/p62 expression as an age marker in spinal cord motoneurons. The increase of SQTSM1/p62 expression is accelerated in the Engrailed-1 heterozygote and upregulated upon extracellular ENGRAILED-1 neutralization. We propose that ENGRAILED-1 is a regulator of motoneuron ageing with non-cell autonomous neurotrophic activity.

                Predicting actions from nonverbal cues and using them to optimize one's response behavior (i.e., interpersonal predictive coding) is essential in everyday life social interaction. 39 participants watched two agents depicted by moving point-light stimuli while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. One well-recognizable agent performed either a communicative or an individual action. The second agent was either masked by a cloud of noise dots, or absent and replaced by noise dots, which participants had to differentiate. EEG amplitude and coherence analyses for theta, alpha and beta frequency bands revealed a dynamic pattern unfolding over time: Watching communicative actions was associated with enhanced coupling within medial anterior regions involved in social and mentalizing processes and with dorsolateral prefrontal activation indicating a higher deployment of cognitive resources. Trying to detect the masked agent without having seen communicative cues was related to enhanced coupling in posterior regions for social perception and visual processing. Observing an expected outcome was associated with increased motor system activation. Finally, when the masked agent was detected correctly, activation in posterior areas for visual processing and social cognition was increased. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is crucial to consider the temporal dynamics of social interactions and of their neural correlates to better understand interpersonal predictive coding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-resolution eye-tracking via digital imaging of Purkinje reflections</a></h4>

              
                Reliably measuring eye movements and determining where the observer looks are fundamental needs in vision science. A classical approach to achieve high-resolution oculomotor measurements is the so-called Dual-Purkinje-Image (DPI) method, a technique that relies on the relative motion of the reflections generated by two distinct surfaces in the eye, the cornea and the back of the lens. This technique has been traditionally implemented in fragile and difficult to operate analog devices, which have remained exclusive use of specialized oculomotor laboratories. Here we describe progress on the development of a digital DPI, a system that builds on recent advances in digital imaging to enable fast, highly precise eye-tracking without the complications of previous analog devices. This system integrates an optical setup with no moving components with a digital imaging module and dedicated software on a fast processing unit. Data from both artificial and human eyes demonstrate sub-arcminute resolution at 1 Khz. Furthermore, when coupled with previously developed gaze-contingent calibration methods, this system enables localization of the line of sight within a few arcminutes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">L-type calcium channels link oxidative stress to calcium signaling pathway and membrane excitability: Insights from computational modeling of dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine neurons, which are critical in movement, cognition, and reward learning, are vulnerable to oxidative stress during aging, drugs of abuse, and viral infection and can lead to neurodegeneration. Previous work used computational modeling to study dopamine neuron function based on experimental findings from rodent brain slices containing dopamine neurons. Here we show for the first time the feasibility and utility of applying such computational models of DA neurons to the analysis of experimental findings from in-vitro cultured cells. We used DCFH-DA (and DHE) and time-lapse, Fura-2 ratiometric imaging to measure changes in ROS levels and changes in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels, respectively, in two dopaminergic cell models: differentiated SH-SY5Y and differentiated human neural progenitor cells. We investigated how peroxide-dependent changes in the behavior of the L-type channel might alter the excitability of the dopaminergic cell. We found that L-type channels mediated clusters of calcium spikes (or oscillations) and that our model suggested that such increased excitability could be explained by changes in the voltage-dependence of activation of the L-type channels in response to exogenous peroxide. Our findings suggested that L-type channels link oxidative stress responses to modulation of excitability. We conclude that the Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine may help disrupt this link by reducing oxidative stress and preventing channel activation at more hyperpolarized potentials, thus reducing plasma membrane excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Scalable variational inference for low-rank spatio-temporal receptive fields</a></h4>

              
                An important problem in systems neuroscience is to characterize how a neuron integrates sensory inputs across space and time. The linear receptive field provides a mathematical characterization of this weighting function, and is commonly used to quantify neural response properties and classify cell types. However, estimating receptive fields is difficult in settings with limited data and correlated or high-dimensional stimuli. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a hierarchical model designed to flexibly parameterize low-rank receptive fields. The model includes Gaussian process priors over spatial and temporal components of the receptive field, encouraging smoothness in space and time. We also propose a new temporal prior called temporal relevance determination (TRD), which imposes a variable degree of smoothness as a function of time lag. We derive a scalable algorithm for variational Bayesian inference for both spatial and temporal receptive field components and hyperparameters. The resulting estimator scales to high-dimensional settings in which full-rank maximum likelihood or a posteriori estimates are intractable. We evaluate our approach on neural data from rat retina and primate cortex, and show that it substantially out-performs a variety of existing estimators. Our modeling approach will have useful extensions to a variety of other high-dimensional inference problems with smooth or low-rank structure.

	<p>Speakers design communication for their audience, providing more information in both speech and gesture when their listener is na&amp;amp;iuml;ve to the topic. We test whether the hippocampal declarative memory system contributes to multimodal audience design. The hippocampus, while traditionally linked to episodic and relational memory, has also been linked to the ability to imagine the mental states of others and use language flexibly. We examined the speech and gesture use of four patients with hippocampal amnesia when describing how to complete everyday tasks (e.g., how to tie a shoe) to an imagined child listener and an adult listener. Although patients with amnesia did not increase their total number of words and instructional steps for the child listener, they did produce representational gestures at significantly higher rates for the imagined child compared to the adult listener. They also gestured at similar frequencies to neurotypical peers, suggesting that hand gesture can be a meaningful communicative resource, even in the case of severe declarative memory impairment. We discuss the contributions of multiple memory systems to multimodal audience design and the potential of gesture to act as a window into the social cognitive processes of individuals with neurologic disorders.</p>

	<p>Continuous repetition of motor imagery leads to mental fatigue. This study aimed to examine whether fatigue caused by motor imagery training affects improvement in performance and the change in corticospinal excitability. The participants were divided into &amp;amp;ldquo;physical practice training&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;motor imagery training&amp;amp;rdquo; groups, and a visuomotor task (set at 50% of maximal voluntary contraction in participants) was performed to assess the training effect on fatigue. The measurements were recorded before and after training. Corticospinal excitability at rest was measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation according to the Neurophysiological Index. Subjective mental fatigue and muscle fatigue were assessed by using the visual analog scale and by measuring the pinch force, respectively. Additionally, the error area was evaluated and calculated at pre-, mid-, and post-terms after training, using a visuomotor task. After training, muscle fatigue, subjective mental fatigue, and decreased corticospinal excitability were noted in both of the groups. Moreover, the visuomotor task decreased the error area by training; however, there was no difference in the error area between the mid- and post-terms. In conclusion, motor imagery training resulted in central fatigue by continuous repetition, which influenced the improvement in performance in the same manner as physical practice training.</p>

	<p>Tinnitus, a common disease in the clinic, is associated with persistent pain and high costs to society. Several aspects of tinnitus, such as the pathophysiology mechanism, effective treatment, objective detection, etc., have not been elucidated. Any change in the auditory pathway can lead to tinnitus. At present, there is no clear and unified mechanism to explain tinnitus, and the hypotheses regarding its mechanism include auditory plasticity theory, cortical reorganization theory, dorsal cochlear nucleus hypothesis, etc. Current theories on the mechanism of tinnitus mainly focus on the abnormal activity of the central nervous system. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of objective diagnostic methods for tinnitus. Developing a method that can detect tinnitus objectively is crucial, only in this way can we identify whether the patient really suffers from tinnitus in the case of cognitive impairment or medical disputes and the therapeutic effect of tinnitus. Electrophysiological investigations have prompted the development of an objective detection of tinnitus by potentials recorded in the auditory pathway. However, there is no objective indicator with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to diagnose tinnitus at present. Based on recent findings of studies with various methods, possible electrophysiological approaches to detect the presence of tinnitus have been summarized. We analyze the change of neural activity throughout the auditory pathway in tinnitus subjects and in patients with tinnitus of varying severity to find available parameters in these methods, which is helpful to further explore the feasibility of using electrophysiological methods for the objective detection of tinnitus.</p>

	<p>The locus coeruleus (LC) is one of the most commonly studied brainstem nuclei when investigating brain&amp;amp;ndash;behavior associations. The LC serves as a major brainstem relay for both ascending bottom-up and descending top-down projections. Specifically, noradrenergic (NA) LC neurons not only connect globally to higher-order subcortical nuclei and cortex to mediate arousal and attention but also directly project to other brainstem nuclei and to the spinal cord to control autonomic function. Despite the extensive investigation of LC function using electrophysiological recordings and cellular/molecular imaging for both cognitive research and the contribution of LC to different pathological states, the role of neuroimaging to investigate LC function has been restricted. For instance, it remains challenging to identify LC-specific activation with functional MRI (fMRI) in animal models, due to the small size of this nucleus. Here, we discuss the complexity of fMRI applications toward LC activity mapping in mouse brains by highlighting the technological challenges. Further, we introduce a single-vessel fMRI mapping approach to elucidate the vascular specificity of high-resolution fMRI signals coupled to LC activation in the mouse brainstem.</p>

	<p>(1) Objective: To investigate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of a brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (BCI) system with visual and motor feedback in limb and brain function rehabilitation after stroke. (2) Methods: First, we recruited three hemiplegic stroke patients to perform rehabilitation training using a BCI system with visual and motor feedback for two consecutive days (four sessions) to verify the feasibility and safety of the system. Then, we recruited five other hemiplegic stroke patients for rehabilitation training (6 days a week, lasting for 12&amp;amp;ndash;14 days) using the same BCI system to verify the effectiveness. The mean and Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s w were used to compare the changes in limb motor and brain functions before and after training. (3) Results: In the feasibility verification, the continuous motor state switching time (CMSST) of the three patients was 17.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 21.0s, and the motor state percentages (MSPs) in the upper and lower limb training were 52.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 25.7% and 72.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 24.0%, respectively. The effective training revolutions (ETRs) per minute were 25.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.0 for upper limb and 24.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.4 for lower limb. There were no adverse events during the training process. Compared with the baseline, the motor function indices of the five patients were improved, including sitting balance ability, upper limb Fugel&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer assessment (FMA), lower limb FMA, 6 min walking distance, modified Barthel index, and root mean square (RMS) value of triceps surae, which increased by 0.4, 8.0, 5.4, 11.4, 7.0, and 0.9, respectively, and all had large effect sizes (Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s w &amp;amp;ge; 0.5). The brain function indices of the five patients, including the amplitudes of the motor evoked potentials (MEP) on the non-lesion side and lesion side, increased by 3.6 and 3.7, respectively; the latency of MEP on the non-lesion side was shortened by 2.6 ms, and all had large effect sizes (Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s w &amp;amp;ge; 0.5). (4) Conclusions: The BCI system with visual and motor feedback is applicable in active rehabilitation training of stroke patients with hemiplegia, and the pilot results show potential multidimensional benefits after a short course of treatment.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Behaviour test in chronic brain ischemia rats: A bibliometric approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stroke causes severe disability and mortality. Despite the fact that the pathology of acute stroke is well understood, publication on chronic stroke is still limited. Because scarring of glia limits the recovery area of acute stroke and reorganization capacity is reduced, discovering new treatments for chronic stroke poses substantial obstacles. In stroke research, rodent models are commonly utilized, and behavior testing is a crucial tool.  To measure stroke outcomes and translating rodent findings to therapeutic trials, selecting relevant behavioral tests that fit the study purpose is critical. Here, we aimed to look at the last decade’s publications highlighting behaviour tests on chronic stroke rats. Hopefully, we were able to give more information about the behaviour tests to facilitate the researchers’ choice of appropriate test. Methods: By using a bibliometric analysis, we hope to systematically discuss rodent behavior tests in chronic stroke research. Documents were extracted from the Scopus database in April 2022. Excel and VOSviewer 1.6.18 were used to conduct statistical and graphical analysis. Results: Research on "behavioral test in chronic stroke rats" has progressed quickly, although the researchers have yet to collaborate with each other. H. Millani was an active researcher and author who connected numerous researchers, according to documents and citation analysis. “Animals”, “brain ischemia”, “man”, “publication”, and “animal experiment” were all common keywords. The majority of the articles were from the United States and China. The Morris Water Maze test and the cylinder test were the most commonly used behavior tests. Conclusions Clinical applications and therapeutic effectiveness against stroke could be improved with more collaboration amongst authors. When using a behavior test, researchers need to think about which neurological deficiency is being addressed and whether the test covers long-term evaluation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">iPiDA-LTR: Identifying piwi-interacting RNA-disease associations based on Learning to Rank</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wenxiang Zhang, Jialu Hou, Bin Liu</p>

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are regarded as drug targets and biomarkers for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases. However, biological experiments cost substantial time and resources, and the existing computational methods only focus on identifying missing associations between known piRNAs and diseases. With the fast development of biological experiments, more and more piRNAs are detected. Therefore, the identification of piRNA-disease associations of newly detected piRNAs has significant theoretical value and practical significance on pathogenesis of diseases. In this study, the iPiDA-LTR predictor is proposed to identify associations between piRNAs and diseases based on Learning to Rank. The iPiDA-LTR predictor not only identifies the missing associations between known piRNAs and diseases, but also detects diseases associated with newly detected piRNAs. Experimental results demonstrate that iPiDA-LTR effectively predicts piRNA-disease associations outperforming the other related methods.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterizing the variation in chromosome structure ensembles in the context of the nuclear microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Priyojit Das, Tongye Shen, Rachel Patton McCord</p>

Inside the nucleus, chromosomes are subjected to direct physical interaction between different components, active forces, and thermal noise, leading to the formation of an ensemble of three-dimensional structures. However, it is still not well understood to what extent and how the structural ensemble varies from one chromosome region or cell-type to another. We designed a statistical analysis technique and applied it to single-cell chromosome imaging data to reveal the heterogeneity of individual chromosome structures. By analyzing the resulting structural landscape, we find that the largest dynamic variation is the overall radius of gyration of the chromatin region, followed by domain reorganization within the region. By comparing different human cell-lines and experimental perturbation data using this statistical analysis technique and a network-based similarity quantification approach, we identify both cell-type and condition-specific features of the structural landscapes. We identify a relationship between epigenetic state and the properties of chromosome structure fluctuation and validate this relationship through polymer simulations. Overall, our study suggests that the types of variation in a chromosome structure ensemble are cell-type as well as region-specific and can be attributed to constraints placed on the structure by factors such as variation in epigenetic state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Consistent pattern of epidemic slowing across many geographies led to longer, flatter initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michal Ben-Nun, Pete Riley, James Turtle, Steven Riley</p>

To define appropriate planning scenarios for future pandemics of respiratory pathogens, it is important to understand the initial transmission dynamics of COVID-19 during 2020. Here, we fit an age-stratified compartmental model with a flexible underlying transmission term to daily COVID-19 death data from states in the contiguous U.S. and to national and sub-national data from around the world. The daily death data of the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic was qualitatively categorized into one of four main profile types: “spring single-peak”, “summer single-peak”, “spring/summer two-peak” and “broad with shoulder”. We estimated a reproduction number <i>R</i> as a function of calendar time <i>t</i><sub>c</sub> and as a function of time since the first death reported in that population (local pandemic time, <i>t</i><sub>p</sub>). Contrary to the diversity of categories and range of magnitudes in death incidence profiles, the <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>p</sub>) profiles were much more homogeneous. We found that in both the contiguous U.S. and globally, the initial value of both <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>c</sub>) and <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>p</sub>) was substantial: at or above two. However, during the early months, pandemic time <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>p</sub>) decreased exponentially to a value that hovered around one. This decrease was accompanied by a reduction in the variance of <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>p</sub>). For calendar time <i>R</i>(<i>t</i><sub>c</sub>), the decrease in magnitude was slower and non-exponential, with a smaller reduction in variance. Intriguingly, similar trends of exponential decrease and reduced variance were not observed in raw death data. Our findings suggest that the combination of specific government responses and spontaneous changes in behaviour ensured that transmissibility dropped, rather than remaining constant, during the initial phases of a pandemic. Future pandemic planning scenarios should include models that assume similar decreases in transmissibility, which lead to longer epidemics with lower peaks when compared with models based on constant transmissibility.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Regimes and mechanisms of transient amplification in abstract and biological neural networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Georgia Christodoulou, Tim P. Vogels, Everton J. Agnes</p>

Neuronal networks encode information through patterns of activity that define the networks’ function. The neurons’ activity relies on specific connectivity structures, yet the link between structure and function is not fully understood. Here, we tackle this structure-function problem with a new conceptual approach. Instead of manipulating the connectivity directly, we focus on upper triangular matrices, which represent the network dynamics in a given orthonormal basis obtained by the Schur decomposition. This abstraction allows us to independently manipulate the eigenspectrum and feedforward structures of a connectivity matrix. Using this method, we describe a diverse repertoire of non-normal transient amplification, and to complement the analysis of the dynamical regimes, we quantify the geometry of output trajectories through the effective rank of both the eigenvector and the dynamics matrices. Counter-intuitively, we find that shrinking the eigenspectrum’s imaginary distribution leads to highly amplifying regimes in linear and long-lasting dynamics in nonlinear networks. We also find a trade-off between amplification and dimensionality of neuronal dynamics, i.e., trajectories in neuronal state-space. Networks that can amplify a large number of orthogonal initial conditions produce neuronal trajectories that lie in the same subspace of the neuronal state-space. Finally, we examine networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We find that the strength of global inhibition is directly linked with the amplitude of amplification, such that weakening inhibitory weights also decreases amplification, and that the eigenspectrum’s imaginary distribution grows with an increase in the ratio between excitatory-to-inhibitory and excitatory-to-excitatory connectivity strengths. Consequently, the strength of global inhibition reveals itself as a strong signature for amplification and a potential control mechanism to switch dynamical regimes. Our results shed a light on how biological networks, i.e., networks constrained by Dale’s law, may be optimised for specific dynamical regimes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Terminal heterocyst differentiation in the Anabaena patA mutant as a result of post-transcriptional modifications and molecular leakage</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Pau Casanova-Ferrer, Saúl Ares, Javier Muñoz-García</p>

The <i>Anabaena</i> genus is a model organism of filamentous cyanobacteria whose vegetative cells can differentiate under nitrogen-limited conditions into a type of cell called heterocyst. These heterocysts lose the possibility to divide and are necessary for the colony because they can fix and share environmental nitrogen. In order to distribute the nitrogen efficiently, heterocysts are arranged to form a quasi-regular pattern whose features are maintained as the filament grows. Recent efforts have allowed advances in the understanding of the interactions and genetic mechanisms underlying this dynamic pattern. However, the main role of the <i>patA</i> and <i>hetF</i> genes are yet to be clarified; in particular, the <i>patA</i> mutant forms heterocysts almost exclusively in the terminal cells of the filament. In this work, we investigate the function of these genes and provide a theoretical model that explains how they interact within the broader genetic network, reproducing their knock-out phenotypes in several genetic backgrounds, including a nearly uniform concentration of HetR along the filament for the <i>patA</i> mutant. Our results suggest a role of <i>hetF</i> and <i>patA</i> in a post-transcriptional modification of HetR which is essential for its regulatory function. In addition, the existence of molecular leakage out of the filament in its boundary cells is enough to explain the preferential appearance of terminal heterocysts, without any need for a distinct regulatory pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Biased belief priors versus biased belief updating: Differential correlates of depression and anxiety</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher Gagne, Sharon Agai, Christian Ramiro, Peter Dayan, Sonia Bishop</p>

Individuals prone to anxiety and depression often report beliefs and make judgements about themselves that are more negative than those reported by others. We use computational modeling of a richly naturalistic task to disentangle the role of negative priors versus negatively biased belief updating and to investigate their association with different dimensions of Internalizing psychopathology. Undergraduate participants first provided profiles for a hypothetical tech internship. They then viewed pairs of other profiles and selected the individual they would prefer to work alongside out of each pair. In a subsequent phase of the experiment, participants made judgments about their relative popularity as hypothetical internship partners both before any feedback and after each of 20 items of feedback revealing whether or not they had been selected as the preferred teammate from a given pairing. Scores on latent factors of general negative affect, anxiety-specific affect and depression-specific affect were estimated using participants’ self-report scores on standardized measures of anxiety and depression together with factor loadings from a bifactor analysis conducted previously. Higher scores on the depression-specific factor were linked to more negative prior beliefs but were not associated with differences in belief updating. In contrast, higher scores on the anxiety-specific factor were associated with a negative bias in belief updating but no difference in prior beliefs. These findings indicate that, to at least some extent, distinct processes may impact the formation of belief priors and in-the-moment belief updating and that these processes may be differentially disrupted in depression and anxiety. Future directions for enquiry include examination of the possibility that prior beliefs biases in depression might reflect generalization from prior experiences or global schema whereas belief updating biases in anxiety might be more situationally specific.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Apoptosis and tissue thinning contribute to symmetric cell division in the developing mouse epidermis in a nonautonomous way</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arad Soffer, Adnan Mahly, Krishnanand Padmanabhan, Jonathan Cohen, Orit Adir, Eidan Loushi, Yaron Fuchs, Scott E. Williams, Chen Luxenburg</p>

Mitotic spindle orientation (SO) is a conserved mechanism that governs cell fate and tissue morphogenesis. In the developing epidermis, a balance between self-renewing symmetric divisions and differentiative asymmetric divisions is necessary for normal development. While the cellular machinery that executes SO is well characterized, the extrinsic cues that guide it are poorly understood. Here, we identified the basal cell adhesion molecule (BCAM), a β1 integrin coreceptor, as a novel regulator of epidermal morphogenesis. In utero RNAi-mediated depletion of <i>Bcam</i> in the mouse embryo did not hinder β1 integrin distribution or cell adhesion and polarity. However, <i>Bcam</i> depletion promoted apoptosis, thinning of the epidermis, and symmetric cell division, and the defects were reversed by concomitant overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor <i>Xiap</i>. Moreover, in mosaic epidermis, depletion of <i>Bcam</i> or <i>Xiap</i> induced symmetric divisions in neighboring wild-type cells. These results identify apoptosis and epidermal architecture as extrinsic cues that guide SO in the developing epidermis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Shoot-to-root translocated GmNN1/FT2a triggers nodulation and regulates soybean nitrogen nutrition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xinxin Li, Huiwen Zhou, Ling Cheng, Niannian Ma, Baofeng Cui, Wenfei Wang, Yongjia Zhong, Hong Liao</p>

Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) provides sufficient nitrogen (N) to meet most legume nutrition demands. In return, host plants feed symbionts carbohydrates produced in shoots. However, the molecular dialogue between shoots and symbionts remains largely mysterious. Here, we report the map-based cloning and characterization of a natural variation in <i>GmNN1</i>, the ortholog of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT2a</i>) that simultaneously triggers nodulation in soybean and modulates leaf N nutrition. A 43-bp insertion in the promoter region of <i>GmNN1/FT2a</i> significantly decreased its transcription level and yielded N deficiency phenotypes. Manipulating <i>GmNN1</i>/<i>GmFT2a</i> significantly enhanced soybean nodulation, plant growth, and N nutrition. The near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying low mRNA abundance alleles of <i>GmNN1</i>/<i>FT2a</i>, along with stable transgenic soybeans with CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts of <i>GmNN1</i>/<i>FT2a</i>, had yellower leaves, lower N concentrations, and fewer nodules than wild-type control plants. Grafting together with split-root experiments demonstrated that only shoot GmNN1/FT2a was responsible for regulating nodulation and thereby N nutrition through shoot-to-root translocation, and this process depends on rhizobial infection. After translocating into roots, shoot-derived GmNN1/FT2a was found to interact with GmNFYA-C (nuclear factor-Y subunit A-C) to activate symbiotic signaling through the previously reported GmNFYA-C-ENOD40 module. In short, the description of the critical soybean nodulation regulatory pathway outlined herein sheds novel insights into the shoot-to-root signaling required for communications between host plants and root nodulating symbionts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analytical framework to evaluate and optimize the use of imperfect diagnostics to inform outbreak response: Application to the 2017 plague epidemic in Madagascar</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quirine ten Bosch, Voahangy Andrianaivoarimanana, Beza Ramasindrazana, Guillain Mikaty, Rado JL Rakotonanahary, Birgit Nikolay, Soloandry Rahajandraibe, Maxence Feher, Quentin Grassin, Juliette Paireau, Soanandrasana Rahelinirina, Rindra Randremanana, Feno Rakotoarimanana, Marie Melocco, Voahangy Rasolofo, Javier Pizarro-Cerda, Anne-Sophie Le Guern, Eric Bertherat, Maherisoa Ratsitorahina, André Spiegel, Laurence Baril, Minoarisoa Rajerison, Simon Cauchemez</p>

During outbreaks, the lack of diagnostic “gold standard” can mask the true burden of infection in the population and hamper the allocation of resources required for control. Here, we present an analytical framework to evaluate and optimize the use of diagnostics when multiple yet imperfect diagnostic tests are available. We apply it to laboratory results of 2,136 samples, analyzed with 3 diagnostic tests (based on up to 7 diagnostic outcomes), collected during the 2017 pneumonic (PP) and bubonic plague (BP) outbreak in Madagascar, which was unprecedented both in the number of notified cases, clinical presentation, and spatial distribution. The extent of these outbreaks has however remained unclear due to nonoptimal assays. Using latent class methods, we estimate that 7% to 15% of notified cases were <i>Yersinia pestis</i>-infected. Overreporting was highest during the peak of the outbreak and lowest in the rural settings endemic to <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i>. Molecular biology methods offered the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity. The specificity of the rapid diagnostic test was relatively low (PP: 82%, BP: 85%), particularly for use in contexts with large quantities of misclassified cases. Comparison with data from a subsequent seasonal <i>Y</i>. <i>pestis</i> outbreak in 2018 reveal better test performance (BP: specificity 99%, sensitivity: 91%), indicating that factors related to the response to a large, explosive outbreak may well have affected test performance. We used our framework to optimize the case classification and derive consolidated epidemic trends. Our approach may help reduce uncertainties in other outbreaks where diagnostics are imperfect.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association between Human Blood Metabolome and the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative neurological disorder with limited therapeutic options. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore the potential biomarkers implicated in the occurrence and progression of AD prior to clinical testing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We selected 119 unique blood metabolites from 3 metabolome genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with 147,827 European participants. Summary data about AD were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis with 63,926 European individuals from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. MR analyses were performed to assess the associations of blood metabolites with AD, and a phenome-wide MR analysis was further applied to ascertain the potential on-target side effects of metabolite interventions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four metabolites were identified as causal mediators for AD, including epiandrosterone sulfate (odds ratio [OR] per SD increase: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51–0.71; <i>p</i> = 6.14 × 10<sup>−9</sup>), 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate (OR per SD increase: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57–0.84; <i>p</i> = 1.98 × 10<sup>−4</sup>), sphingomyelin (OR per SD increase: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.78–3.59; <i>p</i> = 2.10 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), and glutamine (OR per SD increase: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.77–0.89; <i>p</i> = 2.09 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). Phenome-wide MR analysis showed that epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate and sphingomyelin mediated the risk of multiple diseases, and glutamine had beneficial effects on the risk of 4 diseases.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted increased epiandrosterone sulfate, 5alpha-androstan-3beta-17beta-diol disulfate, and glutamine might be associated with a decreased risk of AD, while sphingomyelin was associated with an increased risk. Side-effect profiles were characterized to help inform drug target prioritization, and glutamine might be a promising target for the prevention and treatment of AD with no predicted detrimental side effects.

                Background: HNP1, LL-37, and HBD1 are antimicrobial against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 at the standard inoculum but less active at higher inocula.   Methods: The virtual colony count (VCC) microbiological assay was adapted for high inocula and the addition of yeast tRNA and bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase).  96-well plates were read for 12 hours in a Tecan Infinite M1000 plate reader and photographed under 10x magnification.    Results: Adding tRNA 1:1 to HNP1 at the standard inoculum almost completely abrogated activity.  Adding RNase 1:1 to HNP1 at the standard inoculum of 5x105 CFU/mL did not enhance activity.  Increasing the inoculum to 6.25x107 CFU/mL almost abrogated HNP1 activity.  However, adding RNase 25:1 to HNP1 enhanced activity.  Adding both tRNA and RNase resulted in enhanced activity, indicating that the enhancement effect of RNase overwhelms the inhibiting effect of tRNA when both are present.  HBD1 activity at the standard inoculum was almost completely abrogated by the addition of tRNA, but LL-37 activity was only slightly inhibited by tRNA.  At the high inoculum, LL-37 activity was enhanced by RNase.  HBD1 activity was not enhanced by RNase.  RNase was not antimicrobial in the absence of antimicrobial peptides.  Cell clumps were observed at the high inoculum in the presence of all three antimicrobial peptides and at the standard inoculum in the presence of HNP1+tRNA.    Conclusions: Antimicrobial peptide-ribonuclease combinations have the potential to be active against high cell concentrations and biofilms, conditions where the antimicrobial agent alone is relatively ineffective.

                Background: E-government is an initiative taken by governments worldwide to align the administration of their countries. Governments have utilized the internet as part of a transition into a globalized economy. This helps reduce red tape and procedures in dealing with people in government agencies. This study aims to develop an e-government model as an anti-corruption strategy by applying the Penta-helix model and religiosity as the moderating variable. Methods: The data was gathered from government officials, representatives in business, media, academia, and NGOs, in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2021. Online questionnaires were distributed to 240 respondents from Indonesia and Malaysia. In addition, SPSS v.25 and SEM AMOS v.25 were used to analyze the data. Results: The findings indicate that the Penta-helix elements and religiosity could help to reduce corruption in Indonesia. Meanwhile, Malaysia must increase its human resource competency and embed the religiosity element as a tool to reduce corruption. Conclusion: Penta-helix and religious factors should be incorporated by organizations in Malaysia and Indonesia as part of their strategy in combating corruption.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Septin‐5 & ‐7‐IgGs: Neurologic, Serologic & Pathophysiologic Characteristics</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Background and objectives</h2>
<p>We sought to determine clinical significance of neuronal septin autoimmunity and evaluate for potential IgG effects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA, mouse tissue and cell based) or western blot. IgG binding to (and internalization of) extracellular septin epitopes were evaluated for by live rat hippocampal neuron assay. The impact of purified patient IgGs on murine cortical neuron function was determined by recording extracellular field potentials in a multielectrode array platform.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs were identified in 23 patients. All 8 patients with septin-5-IgG detected had cerebellar ataxia, 7 with prominent eye movement disorders. One of 2 with coexisting septin-7-IgG had additional psychiatric phenotype (apathy, emotional blunting and poor insight). Fifteen patients had septin-7 autoimmunity, without septin-5-IgG detected. Disorders included encephalopathy (11; 2 with accompanying myelopathy, 2 were relapsing), myelopathy (3) and episodic ataxia (1). Psychiatric symptoms (≥1 of agitation, apathy, catatonia, disorganized thinking, and paranoia) were prominent in 6/11 with encephalopathic symptoms. Eight of 10 with data available (from 23 total) improved after immunotherapy, a further 2 spontaneously. Staining of plasma membranes of live hippocampal neurons produced by patient IgGs (subclasses 1 and 2) colocalized with pre- and post-synaptic markers. Decreased spiking and bursting behavior in mixed cultures of murine glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical neurons produced by patient IgGs were attributable to neither antigenic crosslinking and internalization nor complement activation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Septin-IgGs are predictive of distinct treatment-responsive autoimmune CNS disorders. Live neuron binding and induced electrophysiologic effects by patient IgGs may support septin-specific pathophysiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Optimum differentiation of FTLD from AD achieved with cross‐sectional tau PET</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess cross-sectional and longitudinal [<sup>18</sup>F]-flortaucipir PET uptake in pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and to compare FTLD to cases with high and low levels of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC). <b>Methods</b>: One-hundred forty-three participants who had completed at least one flortaucipir PET and autopsy-confirmed FTLD (n=52) or high (n=58) or low-ADNC (n=33) based on Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages 0-IV versus V-VI, were included. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated for nine regions of interest (ROIs): an FTLD-Meta-ROI, midbrain, globus pallidum, an AD-Meta-ROI, entorhinal, inferior temporal, orbitofrontal, precentral, and medial parietal. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare mean baseline SUVRs and annual rate of change in SUVR, by group. Sensitivity/specificity to distinguish FTLD from high and low-ADNC was calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Baseline uptake in the FTLD-Meta-ROI, midbrain and globus pallidus were greater in FTLD than high and low-ADNC. No region showed a greater rate of flortaucipir accumulation in FTLD. Baseline uptake in the AD related regions, orbitofrontal and precentral cortices were greater in high-ADNC, and all showed greater rates of accumulation compared to FTLD. Baseline differences were superior to longitudinal rates in differentiating FTLD from high and low-ADNC. A simple baseline metric of midbrain/inferior temporal ratio of flortaucipir uptake provided good-excellent differentiation between FTLD and high and low-ADNC (sensitivities/specificities = 94%/95% and 71%/70%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There are cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in flortaucipir uptake between FTLD and high and low-ADNC. However, optimum differentiation between FTLD and ADNC was achieved with baseline uptake, rather than longitudinal rates.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TRPV1 drugs alter core body temperature via central projections of primary afferent sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                TRPV1, a capsaicin- and heat-activated ion channel, is expressed by peripheral nociceptors and has been implicated in various inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions. Although pharmacological modulation of TRPV1 has attracted therapeutic interest, many TRPV1 agonists and antagonists produce thermomodulatory side effects in animal models and human clinical trials, limiting their utility. These on-target effects may result from the perturbation of TRPV1 receptors on nociceptors, which transduce signals to central thermoregulatory circuits and release proinflammatory factors from their peripheral terminals, most notably the potent vasodilative neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Alternatively, these body temperature effects may originate from the modulation of TRPV1 on vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), where channel activation promotes arteriole constriction. Here, we ask which of these pathways is most responsible for the body temperature perturbations elicited by TRPV1 drugs in vivo. We address this question by selectively eliminating TRPV1 expression in sensory neurons or vSMCs and show that only the former abrogates agonist-induced hypothermia and antagonist-induced hyperthermia. Furthermore, lesioning the central projections of TRPV1-positive sensory nerve fibers also abrogates drug-mediated thermomodulation, whereas eliminating CGRP has no effect. Thus, TRPV1 drugs alter core body temperature by modulating sensory input to the central nervous system, rather than through peripheral actions on the vasculature. These findings suggest how mechanistically distinct TRPV1 antagonists may diminish inflammatory pain without affecting core body temperature.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Feedback between a retinoid-related nuclear receptor and the let-7 microRNAs controls the pace and number of molting cycles in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Animal development requires coordination among cyclic processes, sequential cell fate specifications, and once-a-lifetime morphogenic events, but the underlying timing mechanisms are not well understood. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> undergoes four molts at regular 8 to 10 hour intervals. The pace of the cycle is governed by PERIOD/<i>lin-42</i> and other as-yet unknown factors. Cessation of the cycle in young adults is controlled by the <i>let-7</i> family of microRNAs and downstream transcription factors in the heterochronic pathway. Here, we characterize a negative feedback loop between NHR-23, the worm homolog of mammalian <span class="underline">r</span>etinoid-related <span class="underline">o</span>rphan <span class="underline">r</span>eceptors (RORs), and the <i>let-7</i> family of microRNAs that regulates both the frequency and finite number of molts. The molting cycle is decelerated in <i>nhr-23</i> knockdowns and accelerated in <i>let-7(−)</i> mutants, but timed similarly in <i>let-7(−) nhr-23(−)</i> double mutants and wild-type animals. NHR-23 binds response elements (ROREs) in the <i>let-7</i> promoter and activates transcription. In turn, <i>let-</i>7 dampens <i>nhr-23</i> expression across development via a complementary <i>let-7</i>-binding site (LCS) in the <i>nhr-23</i> 3′ UTR. The molecular interactions between NHR-23 and <i>let-7</i> hold true for other <i>let-7</i> family microRNAs. Either derepression of <i>nhr-23</i> transcripts by LCS deletion or high gene dosage of <i>nhr-23</i> leads to protracted behavioral quiescence and extra molts in adults. NHR-23 and <i>let-7</i> also coregulate scores of genes required for execution of the molts, including <i>lin-42</i>. In addition, ROREs and LCSs isolated from mammalian <i>ROR</i> and <i>let-7</i> genes function in <i>C. elegans</i>, suggesting conservation of this feedback mechanism. We propose that this feedback loop unites the molting timer and the heterochronic gene regulatory network, possibly by functioning as a cycle counter.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Understanding implicit sensorimotor adaptation as a process of proprioceptive re-alignment</a></h4>

              
                Multiple learning processes contribute to successful goal-directed actions in the face of changing physiological states, biomechanical constraints, and environmental contexts. Amongst these processes, implicit sensorimotor adaptation is of primary importance, ensuring that movements remain well-calibrated and accurate. A large body of work on reaching movements has emphasized how adaptation centers on an iterative process designed to minimize visual errors. The role of proprioception has been largely neglected, thought to play a passive role in which proprioception is affected by the visual error but does not directly contribute to adaptation. Here, we present an alternative to this visuo-centric framework, outlining a model in which implicit adaptation acts to minimize a proprioceptive error, the distance between the perceived hand position and its intended goal. This proprioceptive re-alignment model (PReMo) is consistent with many phenomena that have previously been interpreted in terms of learning from visual errors, and offers a parsimonious account of numerous unexplained phenomena. Cognizant that the evidence for PReMo rests on correlational studies, we highlight core predictions to be tested in future experiments, as well as note potential challenges for a proprioceptive-based perspective on implicit adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tissue-specific modifier alleles determine Mertk loss-of-function traits</a></h4>

              
                Knockout (KO) mouse models play critical roles in elucidating biological processes behind disease-associated or disease-resistant traits. As a presumed consequence of gene KO, mice display certain phenotypes. Based on insight into the molecular role of said gene in a biological process, it is inferred that the particular biological process causally underlies the trait. This approach has been crucial towards understanding the basis of pathological and/or advantageous traits associated with <i>Mertk</i> KO mice. <i>Mertk</i> KO mice suffer from severe, early-onset retinal degeneration. MERTK, expressed in retinal pigment epithelia, is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a critical role in phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or cellular debris. Therefore, early-onset, severe retinal degeneration was described to be a direct consequence of failed MERTK-mediated phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by retinal pigment epithelia. Here we report that the loss of <i>Mertk</i> alone is not sufficient for retinal degeneration. The widely used <i>Mertk</i> KO mouse carries multiple coincidental changes in its genome that affect the expression of a number of genes, including the <i>Mertk</i> paralog <i>Tyro3</i>. Retinal degeneration manifests only when the function of <i>Tyro3</i> is concomitantly lost. Furthermore, <i>Mertk</i> KO mice display improved anti-tumor immunity. MERTK is expressed in macrophages. Therefore, enhanced anti-tumor immunity was inferred to result from the failure of macrophages to dispose of cancer cell corpses, resulting in a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment. The resistance against two syngeneic mouse tumor models observed in <i>Mertk</i> KO mice is not, however, phenocopied by the loss of <i>Mertk </i>alone. Neither <i>Tyro3</i>, nor macrophage phagocytosis by alternate genetic redundancy, account for the absence of anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, our results indicate that context-dependent epistasis of independent modifier alleles determines <i>Mertk</i> KO traits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptional heterogeneity and cell cycle regulation as central determinants of primitive endoderm priming</a></h4>

              
                During embryonic development cells acquire identity at the same time as they are proliferating, implying that an intrinsic facet of cell fate choice requires coupling lineage decisions to rates of cell division. How is the cell cycle regulated to promote or suppress heterogeneity and differentiation? We explore this question combining time lapse imaging with single cell RNA-seq in the contexts of self-renewal, priming and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) towards the Primitive Endoderm lineage (PrE). Since ESCs are derived from the Inner Cell Mass of the mammalian blastocyst, ESCs in standard culture conditions are transcriptionally heterogeneous containing subfractions that are primed for either of the two ICM lineages, Epiblast and PrE. These subfractions represent dynamic states that can readily interconvert in culture, and the PrE subfraction is functionally primed for endoderm differentiation. Here we find that differential regulation of cell cycle can tip the balance between these primed populations, such that naïve ESC culture conditions promote Epiblast-like expansion and PrE differentiation stimulates the selective survival and proliferation of PrE-primed cells. In endoderm differentiation, we find that this change is accompanied by a counter-intuitive increase in G1 length that also appears replicated <i>in vivo</i>. While FGF/ERK signalling is a known key regulator of ESCs and PrE differentiation, we find it is not just responsible for ESCs heterogeneity, but also cell cycle synchronisation, required for the inheritance of similar cell cycles between sisters and cousins. Taken together, our results point to a tight relationship between transcriptional heterogeneity and cell cycle regulation in the context of lineage priming, with primed cell populations providing a pool of flexible cell types that can be expanded in a lineage-specific fashion while allowing plasticity during early determination.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PLK4 drives centriole amplification and apical surface area expansion in multiciliated cells</a></h4>

              
                Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are terminally differentiated epithelia that assemble multiple motile cilia used to promote fluid flow. To template these cilia, MCCs dramatically expand their centriole content during a process known as centriole amplification. In cycling cells, the master regulator of centriole assembly Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is essential for centriole duplication; however recent work has questioned the role of PLK4 in centriole assembly in MCCs. To address this discrepancy, we created genetically engineered mouse models and demonstrated that both PLK4 protein and kinase activity are critical for centriole amplification in MCCs. Tracheal epithelial cells that fail centriole amplification accumulate large assemblies of centriole proteins and do not undergo apical surface area expansion. These results show that the initial stages of centriole assembly are conserved between cycling cells and MCCs and suggest that centriole amplification and surface area expansion are coordinated events.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structures of topoisomerase V in complex with DNA reveal unusual DNA binding mode and novel relaxation mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Topoisomerase V is a unique topoisomerase that combines DNA repair and topoisomerase activities. The enzyme has an unusual arrangement, with a small topoisomerase domain followed by 12 tandem (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domains, which include three AP lyase repair domains. The uncommon architecture of this enzyme bears no resemblance to any other known topoisomerase. Here we present structures of topoisomerase V in complex with DNA. The structures show that the (HhH)<sub>2</sub> domains wrap around the DNA and in this manner appear to act as a processivity factor. There is a conformational change in the protein to expose the topoisomerase active site. The DNA bends sharply to enter the active site, which melts the DNA and probably facilitates relaxation. The structures show a DNA binding mode not observed before and provide information on the way this atypical topoisomerase relaxes DNA. In common with type IB enzymes, topoisomerase V relaxes DNA using a controlled rotation mechanism, but the structures show that topoisomerase V accomplishes this in different manner. Overall, the structures firmly establish that type IC topoisomerases form a distinct type of topoisomerases, with no similarities to other types at the sequence, structural, or mechanistic level. They represent a completely different solution to DNA relaxation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PH domain-mediated autoinhibition and oncogenic activation of Akt</a></h4>

              
                Akt is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that plays a central role in metabolism and cancer. Regulation of Akt's activity involves an autoinhibitory intramolecular interaction between its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and its kinase domain that can be relieved by C-tail phosphorylation. PH domain mutant E17K Akt is a well-established oncogene. Previously, we reported that the conformation of autoinhibited Akt may be shifted by small molecule allosteric inhibitors limiting the mechanistic insights from existing X-ray structures that have relied on such compounds (Chu, Viennet, et al, 2020). Here we discover unexpectedly that a single mutation R86A Akt exhibits intensified autoinhibitory features with enhanced PH domain-kinase domain affinity. Structural and biochemical analysis uncovers the importance of a key interaction network involving Arg86, Glu17, and Tyr18 that controls Akt conformation and activity. Our studies also shed light on the molecular basis for E17K Akt activation as an oncogenic driver.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Local field potentials reflect cortical population dynamics in a region-specific and frequency-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                The spiking activity of populations of cortical neurons is well described by the dynamics of a small number of population-wide covariance patterns, the 'latent dynamics'. These latent dynamics are largely driven by the same correlated synaptic currents across the circuit that determine the generation of local field potentials (LFP). Yet, the relationship between latent dynamics and LFPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterised this relationship for three different regions of primate sensorimotor cortex during reaching. The correlation between latent dynamics and LFPs was frequency-dependent and varied across regions. However, for any given region, this relationship remained stable throughout the behaviour: in each of primary motor and premotor cortices, the LFP-latent dynamics correlation profile was remarkably similar between movement planning and execution. These robust associations between LFPs and neural population latent dynamics help bridge the wealth of studies reporting neural correlates of behaviour using either type of recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task-dependent optimal representations for cerebellarlearning</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellar granule cell layer has inspired numerous theoretical models of neural representations that support learned behaviors, beginning with the work of Marr and Albus. In these models, granule cells form a sparse, combinatorial encoding of diverse sensorimotor inputs. Such sparse representations are optimal for learning to discriminate random stimuli. However, recent observations of dense, low-dimensional activity across granule cells have called into question the role of sparse coding in these neurons. Here, we generalize theories of cerebellar learning to determine the optimal granule cell representation for tasks beyond random stimulus discrimination, including continuous input-output transformations as required for smooth motor control. We show that for such tasks, the optimal granule cell representation is substantially denser than predicted by classic theories. Our results provide a general theory of learning in cerebellum-like systems and suggest that optimal cerebellar representations are task-dependent.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Dynorphin/Kappa Opioid Receptor mediates adverse immunological and behavioral outcomes induced by repetitive blast trauma in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Adverse pathophysiological and behavioral outcomes related to mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and chronic pain are common following blast exposure and contribute to decreased quality of life, but underlying mechanisms and prophylactic/treatment options remain limited. The dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system helps regulate behavioral and inflammatory responses to stress and injury; however, it has yet to be investigated as a potential mechanism in either humans or animals exposed to blast. We hypothesized that blast-induced KOR activation mediates adverse outcomes related to inflammation and affective behavioral response. Methods: C57Bl/6 adult male mice were singly or repeatedly exposed to either sham (anesthesia only) or blast delivered by a pneumatic shock tube. The selective KOR antagonist norBNI or vehicle (saline) was administered 72 hours prior to repetitive blast or sham exposure. Serum and brain were collected 10 minutes or 4 hours post-exposure for dynorphin and cytokine measurements, respectively. At one-month post-exposure, mice were tested in a series of behavioral assays related to adverse outcomes reported by humans with blast trauma. Results: Repetitive but not single blast exposure resulted in increased brain dynorphin level. norBNI pretreatment blocked or significantly reduced blast-induced increase in serum and brain cytokines, including IL-6, at 4 hours post exposure and aversive/anxiety-like behavioral dysfunction at one month post exposure. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a previously unreported role for the dynorphin/KOR system as a mediator of biochemical and behavioral dysfunction following repetitive blast exposure and highlight this system as a potential prophylactic/therapeutic treatment target.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">D-cycloserine, a mixed NMDAR agonist/antagonist is Not Susceptible to Self-administration, unlike S-ketamine Using an Intravenous Self-administration Model in Naive and Ketamine-habituated Sprague-Dawley Rats</a></h4>

              
                OBJECTIVE: N-methyl D-aspartate Receptor (NMDAR) antagonist antidepressants have known potential for abuse liability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the abuse liability of D-cycloserine (DCS), using a self-administration paradigm in which DCS was tested for its efficacy in substituting for ketamine in ketamine-dependent rats. METHODS: A standard Intravenous self-administration study was conducted in Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats to study the compounds' abuse liability. The potential for self-administration was assessed in ketamine-habituated subjects. Subjects were trained to press a lever to obtain food, prior to connection of the lever to the intravenous drug administration apparatus. DCS was provided for self-infusion by test subjects at doses of 1.5, 5.0, and 15mg/kg per lever press. RESULTS: S-Ketamine was seen to substitute for ketamine and to result in self-administration at the same frequency. DCS was not seen to result in self-administration at any of the test doses. The self-infusion behavior of DCS was the same as that of saline. CONCLUSION: D-cycloserine, a mixed agonist/antagonist of the NMDAR glycine site, which has been shown to have antidepressant and anti-suicidal properties in clinical studies has no apparent potential for abuse liability in a standard rodent self-administration model.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disentangling the Neural Correlates of Agency, Ownership and Multisensory Processing</a></h4>

              
                The experience of the self as an embodied agent in the world is an essential aspect of human consciousness. This experience arises from the feeling of control over one's bodily actions, termed the Sense of Agency (SoA), and the feeling that the body belongs to the self, Body Ownership (BO). Despite long-standing philosophical and scientific interest in the relationship between the body and brain, the neural systems involved in SoA and BO and especially their interactions, are not yet understood. In this preregistered study using the Moving Rubber Hand Illusion inside an MR-scanner, we aimed to uncover the relationship between BO & SoA in the human brain. Importantly, by using both visuomotor and visuotactile stimulations and measuring online trial-by-trial fluctuations in the illusion magnitude, we were able to disentangle brain systems related to objective sensory stimulation and subjective judgments of the bodily-self. Our results indicate that at both the behavioral and neural levels, BO and SoA are strongly interrelated. Multisensory regions in the occipital and fronto-parietal regions encoded convergence of sensory stimulation conditions. However, the subjective judgments of bodily-self were also related to BOLD fluctuations in regions not activated by the sensory conditions such as the insular cortex and precuneus. Our results highlight the convergence of multisensory processing in specific neural systems for both BO and SoA with partially dissociable regions for subjective judgments in regions of the default mode network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context-independent scaling of neural responses to task difficulty in the multiple-demand network</a></h4>

              
                The multiple-demand (MD) network is sensitive to many aspects of cognitive demand, showing increased activation with more difficult tasks. However, it is currently unknown whether the MD network is modulated by the context in which task difficulty is experienced. Using fMRI, we examined MD network responses to low, medium, and high difficulty arithmetic problems within two cued contexts, an easy versus a hard set. The results showed that MD activity varied reliably with the absolute difficulty of a problem, independent of the context in which the problem was presented. Similarly, MD activity during task execution was independent of the difficulty of the previous trial. Representational similarity analysis further supported that representational distances in the MD network were consistent with a context-independent code. Finally, we identified several regions outside the MD network that showed context-dependent coding, including the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, precentral gryus, and large areas of visual cortex. In sum, cognitive effort is processed by the MD network in a context-independent manner. We suggest that this absolute coding of cognitive demand in the MD network reflects the limited range of task difficulty that can be supported by the cognitive apparatus.

                Ciliopathies are characterized by the absence or dysfunction of primary cilia. Despite the fact that cognitive impairments are a common feature of ciliopathies, how cilia dysfunction affects neuronal development has not been characterized in detail. Here, we show that the primary cilium is required cell-autonomously by neurons during neural circuit formation. In particular, the primary cilium is crucial during axonal pathfinding for the switch in responsiveness of axons at a choice point, or intermediate target. Utilizing animal models and in vivo, ex vivo, as well as in vitro experiments, we provide evidence for a critical role of the primary cilium in long-range axon guidance. The primary cilium on the cell body of commissural neurons transduces long-range guidance signals sensed by growth cones navigating an intermediate target. In extension of our finding that Shh is required for the rostral turn of post-crossing commissural axons, we show here that the cilium is required for a transcriptional change of axon guidance receptors, which in turn mediate the repulsive response to floorplate-derived Shh shown by post-crossing commissural axons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible multitask computation in recurrent networks utilizes shared dynamical motifs</a></h4>

              
                Flexible computation is a hallmark of intelligent behavior. Yet, little is known about how neural networks contextually reconfigure for different computations. Humans are able to perform a new task without extensive training, presumably through the composition of elementary processes that were previously learned. Cognitive scientists have long hypothesized the possibility of a compositional neural code, where complex neural computations are made up of constituent components; however, the neural substrate underlying this structure remains elusive in biological and artificial neural networks. Here we identified an algorithmic neural substrate for compositional computation through the study of multitasking artificial recurrent neural networks. Dynamical systems analyses of networks revealed learned computational strategies that mirrored the modular subtask structure of the task-set used for training. Dynamical motifs such as attractors, decision boundaries and rotations were reused across different task computations. For example, tasks that required memory of a continuous circular variable repurposed the same ring attractor. We show that dynamical motifs are implemented by clusters of units and are reused across different contexts, allowing for flexibility and generalization of previously learned computation. Lesioning these clusters resulted in modular effects on network performance: a lesion that destroyed one dynamical motif only minimally perturbed the structure of other dynamical motifs. Finally, modular dynamical motifs could be reconfigured for fast transfer learning. After slow initial learning of dynamical motifs, a subsequent faster stage of learning reconfigured motifs to perform novel tasks. This work contributes to a more fundamental understanding of compositional computation underlying flexible general intelligence in neural systems. We present a conceptual framework that establishes dynamical motifs as a fundamental unit of computation, intermediate between the neuron and the network. As more whole brain imaging studies record neural activity from multiple specialized systems simultaneously, the framework of dynamical motifs will guide questions about specialization and generalization across brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of calcium, Akt and ERK signaling in cadmium-induced hair cell death</a></h4>

              
                Exposure to heavy metals, an environmental toxin, has been shown to cause damage to a variety of different tissues and cell types including hair cells, the sensory cells of our inner ears responsible for hearing and balance. Elevated levels of one such metal, cadmium, has been associated with hearing loss and shown to cause hair cell death in multiple experimental models. While the mechanisms of cadmium-induced cell death have been extensively studied in other cell types they remain relatively unknown in hair cells. We have found that calcium signaling, known to be an important regulator of cadmium toxicity in other cell types, does not appear to play a significant role in cadmium-induced hair cell death. While calmodulin inhibition can partially protect hair cells this may be due to impacts on mechanotransduction activity, and inhibiting CaMKII, the IP3 receptor and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter all failed to protect against cadmium-induced hair cell death. We also found cadmium treatment increased pAkt levels in hair cells and pERK levels in supporting cells. This activation appears to be protective in nature as inhibiting these pathways enhanced cadmium-induced hair cell death rather than protecting cells. Thus cadmium-induced hair cell death appears distinct from cadmium-induced cell death in other cell types where calcium, Akt and ERK signaling pathways all promote cell death.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inactivated voltage-gated sodium channels are preferentially targeted in cinacalcet block of mouse neocortical action potentials</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activation is essential for action potential generation in the brain. Allosteric calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) agonist, cinacalcet, strongly and ubiquitously inhibits VGSC currents in neocortical neurons via an unidentified, G-protein-dependent blocking molecule. The mechanisms by which VGSC characteristics influence cinacalcet-mediated inhibition are not well understood. Here, using whole-cell patch clamp methods, we investigated the voltage-dependence of cinacalcet-mediated inhibition of VGSCs and the channel state preference of cinacalcet. The rate of inhibition of VGSC currents was accelerated at more depolarized holding potentials. Cinacalcet shifted the voltage-dependence of both fast and slow inactivation of VGSCs in the hyperpolarizing direction. Utilizing a simple model, the voltage-dependence of VGSC current inhibition may be explained if the affinity of the blocking molecule to the channel states follows the sequence: fast inactivated > slow inactivated > resting. The state dependence of block contributes to the non-linearity of action potential block by cinacalcet. This dynamic and abundant signaling pathway by which G-proteins regulate VGSC currents provides an important voltage-dependent mechanism for modulating central neuronal excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cognitive and neural correlates of irony</a></h4>

              
                One of the most difficult forms of communication is irony (Wilson & Sperber, 1981), therefore it has been proposed that it can be a useful indicator of communication abilities (Caillies et al., 2014). Irony is a statement that transmits the opposite meaning of its literal counterpart (Grice, 1975). The cognitive process of mentalization, executive functions and holistic processing style may participate in irony detection. The brain areas that have been associated with detection of irony are the medial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the posterior superior temporal gyrus, precuneus, the inferior parietal lobule, among others. The aim of this study was to analyze the cognitive processes involved in irony identification and its neural correlates in a sample of Mexican adults. A total of 45 participants performed an irony identification task during MRI acquisition, while cognitive processes were assessed with a psychometric battery. From the statements evaluated (i.e. ironic, literal, unrelated and white lies), irony was the hardest intention to detect, having the lowest percentage of correct classification and the slowest classification time. The cognitive process that correlated with irony detection were the tasks that evaluated ToM, inhibitory control and verbal abilities. The identification of ironic statements recruited brain areas associated with ToM, language, and inhibitory control networks.

                Reward-seeking requires the coordination of motor programs to achieve goals. Midbrain dopamine neurons are critical for reinforcement and their activation is sufficient for learning about cues, actions, and outcomes. Here we examine in detail the mechanisms underlying the ability of ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) dopamine neurons to support instrumental learning. By exploiting numerous behavioral tasks in combination with time-limited optogenetic manipulations, we reveal that VTA and SNc dopamine neurons generate reinforcement through separable psychological processes. VTA dopamine neurons imbue actions and their associated cues with motivational value that allows flexible and persistent pursuit whereas SNc dopamine neurons support time-limited, precise, action-specific learning that is non-scalable and inflexible. This architecture is reminiscent of actor-critic reinforcement learning models with VTA and SNc instructing the critic and actor, respectively. Our findings indicate that heterogeneous dopamine systems support unique forms of instrumental learning that ultimately result in disparate reward-seeking strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhancement of vestibular motion discrimination by small stochastic whole-body perturbations in young healthy humans</a></h4>

              
                Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation has been shown to improve vestibular perception in healthy subjects. Here, we sought to obtain similar results using more natural stimuli consisting of small-amplitude motion perturbations of the whole body. Thirty participants were asked to report the perceived direction of antero-posterior sinusoidal motion on a MOOG platform. We compared the baseline perceptual thresholds with those obtained by applying small, stochastic perturbations at different power levels along the antero-posterior axis, symmetrically distributed around a zero-mean. At the population level, we found that the thresholds for all but the highest level of noise were significantly lower than the baseline threshold. At the individual level, the threshold was lower with at least one noise level than the threshold without noise in 87% of participants. Thus, small, stochastic oscillations of the whole body can increase the probability of detecting subthreshold vestibular signals, possibly due to stochastic resonance mechanisms. We suggest that, just as the external noise of the present experiments, also the spontaneous random oscillations of the body associated with standing posture are beneficial by enhancing vestibular thresholds with a mechanism similar to stochastic resonance. The results are also relevant from a clinical perspective, since they raise the possibility of improving motion perception in people with elevated thresholds due to aging or vestibulopathy by means of small-amplitude motion perturbations.

                Animal studies of neurodevelopmental plasticity have shown that intrinsic brain activity evolves from high amplitude and globally synchronized to suppressed and sparse as plasticity declines and the cortex matures. Leveraging resting-state functional MRI data from 1033 individuals (8-23 years), we reveal that this stereotyped refinement of intrinsic activity occurs during human development and provides evidence for a cortical gradient of neurodevelopmental plasticity during childhood and adolescence. Specifically, we demonstrate that declines in the amplitude of intrinsic activity are initiated heterochronously across regions, coupled to the maturation of a plasticity-restricting structural feature, and temporally staggered along a hierarchical sensorimotor-association axis from ages 8 to 18. Youth from disadvantaged environments exhibit reduced intrinsic activity in regions further up the sensorimotor-association axis, suggestive of a reduced level of plasticity in late-maturing cortices. Our results uncover a hierarchical axis of neurodevelopment and offer insight into the temporal sequence of protracted neurodevelopmental plasticity in humans.

                Background: Emerging evidence supports the view that brain stimulation might improve essential tremor (ET) by altering brain dynamics and facilitating brain plasticity. Yet, we are still missing a mechanistic explanation of the whole brain dynamics underlying these plasticity-defining changes. Method: In this study, we explored the effect of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) on dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) in patients with ET. Resting-state fMRI (RsfMRI) was acquired before and after a single session of rTMS in 30 patients with ET and compared with RsfMRI of 20 age, gender and education matched healthy controls (HCs). We have measured the effect of brain stimulation using network topological re-organization through whole brain integration and segregation, brain stability and capacity of neural propagation through metastability and intrinsic ignition. Results: Patients with ET had altered DFC measures compared to controls. After a single session rTMS, the connectivity measures approached normality and patients with ET revealed significantly higher integration, lower segregation with higher metastability and increased intrinsic ignition. Conclusion: Brain metastability and intrinsic ignition measures could be valuable tools in appreciating mechanisms of brain stimulation in ET and other neurological diseases.

                Cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) are enigmatic mechano- or chemosensory cells lying along the central canal of the spinal cord. Recent studies in zebrafish larvae and lampreys have shown that CSF-cNs control postures and movements via spinal connections. However, the structures, connectivity, and functions in mammals remain largely unknown. Here we developed a method to genetically target mouse CSF-cNs that highlighted structural connections and functions. We first found that intracerebroventricular injection of adeno-associated virus with a neuron-specific promoter and Pkd2l1-Cre mice specifically labeled CSF-cNs. Single-cell labeling of 71 CSF-cNs revealed rostral axon extensions of over 1800 um in unmyelinated bundles in the ventral funiculus and terminated on CSF-cNs to form a recurrent circuitry, which was further determined by serial electron microscopy and electrophysiology. CSF-cNs were also found to connect with axial motor neurons and premotor interneurons around the central canal and within the axon bundles. Chemogenetic CSF-cNs inactivation reduced speed and step frequency during treadmill locomotion. Our data revealed the basic structures and connections of mouse CSF-cNs to control spinal motor circuits for proper locomotion. The versatile methods developed in this study will contribute to further understanding of CSF-cNs functions in mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Loss of retinogeniculate synaptic function in the DBA/2J mouse model of glaucoma.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons comprise the optic nerve and carry information to the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) that is relayed to the cortex for conscious vision. Glaucoma is a blinding neurodegenerative disease that commonly results from intraocular pressure (IOP)-associated injury leading to RGC axonal pathology, disruption of RGC outputs to the brain, and eventual apoptotic loss of RGC somata. The consequences of elevated IOP and glaucomatous pathology on RGC signaling to the dLGN are largely unknown and likely to be important contributors to visual system dysfunction in glaucoma. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine how glaucoma affects RGC outputs to the dLGN. Methods: We used a combination of anatomical and physiological approaches to study the structure and function of retinogeniculate synapses in male and female DBA/2J mice at multiple ages before and after IOP elevation. These included measures of anterograde axonal transport, immunofluorescence staining of RGC axon terminals, patch-clamp recording retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in living brain slices, Sholl analysis of thalamocortical relay neuron dendrites, measurements of RGC somatic density, and treatment with a topical ophthalmic alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (brimonidine). Results: DBA/2J mice showed progressive loss of anterograde optic tract transport to the dLGN and vGlut2 labeling of RGC axon terminals. Patch-clamp measurements of RG synaptic function showed that the strength of synaptic transmission was lower in 9 and 12-month DBA/2J mice and that this was the result of loss of individual RGC axon contributions. TC neuron dendrites showed a reduction in complexity at 12 months, suggestive of a delayed reorganization following reduced synaptic input. There was no detectable change in RGC soma density in 11-12m DBA/2J retinas indicating that observed effects occurred prior to RGC somatic loss. Finally, treatment with brimonidine eye drops prevented the loss of vGlut2-labeled RGC terminals in the dLGN. Conclusions: These findings identify glaucoma- and IOP-associated functional deficits in an important subcortical RGC projection target. This sheds light on the processes linking IOP to vision loss and will be critical for informing future diagnostic approaches and vision-restoration therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical unimodal processing within the primary somatosensory cortex during a bimodal detection task</a></h4>

              
                Where and how in the brain do neurons process more than one sensory modality? To answer these questions, scientists have generated a wide variety of studies at distinct space-time scales in different animal models, and often shown contradictory conclusions. Some conclude that this process occurs in early sensory cortices, but others that this occurs in areas central to sensory cortices. Here, we sought to determine whether sensory neurons process and encode physical stimulus properties of different modalities (tactile and acoustic). For this, we designed a bimodal detection task where the senses of touch and hearing compete from trial to trial. Two Rhesus monkeys performed this novel task, while neural activity was recorded in areas 3b and 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We analyzed neurons' coding properties and variability, organizing them by their receptive field's position relative to the stimulation zone. Our results indicate that neurons of areas 3b and 1 are unimodal, encoding only the tactile modality, both in the firing rate and variability, but not to the acoustic one. Moreover, we found that neurons of both subareas encode the tactile information differently, revealing a hidden processing-based hierarchy. Finally, using a powerful non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, we show that the activity from areas 3b and 1 can be separated, establishing a clear division in the functionality of these two subareas of S1.

                Facial grimaces are now commonly used to quantify spontaneous pain in mice and other mammalian species, but scoring remains subjective and relies on humans with very different levels of proficiency. Here, we developed a Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) for black-coated (C57BL/6) mice consisting of four facial action units (orbitals, nose, ears, whiskers). We used this scale to generate ground truth data from over 70,000 images of black mice in different settings. With this large data set, we developed a deep neural network and cloud-based software platform called PainFace (http://painface.net) that accurately scores facial grimaces of black mice on a 0-8 scale. PainFace generates over two orders of magnitude more MGS data than humans can realistically achieve, and at superhuman speed. By analyzing the frequency distribution of grimace scores, we found that mice spent >7x more time in a high grimace state following laparotomy surgery relative to sham surgery controls. The analgesic carprofen reduced the amount of time animals spent in this high grimace state after surgery. Specific facial action unit score combinations were overrepresented following laparotomy surgery, suggesting that characteristic facial expressions are associated with a high grimace state. We performed validation experiments in two labs located in different countries to demonstrate reproducibility of the PainFace platform. To further enhance rigor and reproducibility, we will invite pain researchers to beta test PainFace and then incorporate their feedback into the software and manuscript prior to peer review. While this study is focused on mice, PainFace was designed to simplify, standardize, and scale up grimace analyses with many other mammalian species, including humans.

                Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperphagia, obesity, developmental delay and intellectual disability. Studies suggest dysfunctional signaling of the neuropeptide oxytocin as one of the key mechanisms in PWS, and administration of oxytocin via intranasal or systemic routes yielded promising results in both humans and mouse models. However, a detailed assessment of the oxytocin system in mouse models of PWS such as the Magel2-deficient Magel2tm1.Stw mouse, is lacking. In this study, we performed an automated counting of oxytocin cells in the entire paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus of Magel2tm1.Stw and wild-type control mice and found a significant reduction in the caudal part, which represents the parvocellular subdivision. In addition, based on the recent discovery that some astrocytes express the oxytocin receptor (OTR), we performed detailed analysis of astrocyte numbers and morphology in various brain regions, and assessed expression levels of the astrocyte marker GFAP, which was significantly decreased in the hypothalamus, but not other brain regions in Magel2tm1.Stw mice. Finally, we analyzed the number of OTR-expressing astrocytes in various brain regions and found a significant reduction in the nucleus accumbens of Magel2tm1.Stw mice, as well as a sex-specific difference in the lateral septum. This study suggests a role for caudal PVN OT neurons as well as OTR-expressing astrocytes in a mouse model of PWS, provides novel information about sex-specific expression of astrocytic OTRs, and presents several new brain regions containing OTR-expressing astrocytes in the mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Cellular Positioning System to Probe Morphological Heterogeneity Among Mouse CA3 Hippocampal Pyramidal Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus are not homogeneous in their structure or function, yet the structure and function of individual neurons are well-correlated. Despite these well-known facts, few structural studies of pyramidal neuronal dendrites in the hippocampus have controlled for precise cellular position within the hippocampus along its dorsoventral (longitudinal), tangential (proximodistal), or radial axes. We believe this is largely due to technical limitations that limit positional information about the neuron, limit throughput, and limit the control of confounding variables. New method: Here, we present a simple approach to address these limitations effectively in mouse CA3, adapted from our prior work in the mouse cerebral cortex. Our approach tracks the dorsoventral, tangential, and radial positions of neurons within the hippocampus, increases the number of available neurons for analysis, and provides several new controls. Results: We demonstrate how topographic and morphological data are related to one another among mouse CA3 pyramidal neurons, in a pilot data set providing proof-of-concept. Comparison with existing methods: Other common methods of labeling neurons, such as biocytin fills or Golgi-Cox stains, are labor- or time-intensive. Here, we validate the use of the transgenic fluorescent Thy1-GFP-M line, so the labeling step is practically eliminated. Other methods section the hippocampus coronally, which distorts the dorsoventral, tangential, and radial axes. Here, we preserve all three axes. Some existing methods do not collect all sections in order, instead focusing on "more dorsal" or "more ventral" sections, for example. We preserve much more dorsoventral information. Recent work has shown that CA2 is better defined by immunohistochemical rather than neuroanatomical markers. We use that immunohistochemistry here to increase precision in defining tangential position. Other studies have not measured other, critical variables and relationships that could confound the results. Here, we assess many more of these variables and relationships to increase the rigor of our work. Conclusions: We developed a more rigorous method for preserving precise cellular positioning information among reconstructed mouse hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Although we provide several innovations in our method, each innovation identified here could independently improve the rigor and reproducibility of a wide variety of approaches for understanding the morphological heterogeneity of pyramidal neurons in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of Connectivity on Narrative Temporal Processing in Structured Reservoir Computing</a></h4>

              
                Computational models of language are having an increasing impact in understanding the neural bases of language processing in humans. A recent model of cortical dynamics based on reservoir computing was able to account for temporal aspects of human narrative processing as revealed by fMRI. In this context the current research introduces a form of structured reservoir computing, where network dynamics are further constrained by the connectivity architecture in order to begin to explain large scale hierarchical network properties of human cortical activity during narrative comprehension. Cortical processing takes place at different time scales depending on the position in a hierarchy from posterior sensory input areas to higher level associative frontal cortical areas. This phenomena is likely related to the cortical connectivity architecture. Recent studies have identified heterogeneity in this posterior-anterior hierarchy, with certain frontal associative areas displaying a faster narrative integration response than much more posterior areas. We hypothesize that these discontinuities can be due to white matter connectivity that would create shortcuts from fast sensory areas to distant frontal areas. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the white matter connectivity of these areas and discovered clear connectivity patterns in accord with our hypotheses. Based on these observations we performed simulations using reservoir networks with connectivity patterns structured with an exponential distance rule, yielding the sensory-associative hierarchy. We then introduce connectivity short-cuts corresponding to those observed in human anatomy, resulting in frontal areas with unusually fast narrative processing. Using structured reservoir computing we confirmed the hypothesis that topographic position in a cortical hierarchy can be dominated by long distance connections that can bring frontal areas closer to the sensory periphery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Minimum effort simulations of split-belt treadmill walking exploit asymmetry to reduce metabolic energy expenditure</a></h4>

              
                Walking on a split-belt treadmill elicits an adaptation response that changes the baseline step length asymmetry of the walker. The underlying causes of this adaptation, however, are difficult to determine. It has been proposed that effort minimization may drive this adaptation, based on the idea that adopting longer steps on the fast belt, or positive step length asymmetry (SLA), can cause the treadmill to exert net-positive mechanical work on a bipedal walker. However, humans walking on split-belt treadmills have not been observed to reproduce this behavior when allowed to freely adapt. To determine if an energy minimization motor control strategy would result in experimentally observed adaptation patterns, we conducted simulations of walking on different combinations of belt speeds with a human musculoskeletal model which minimized muscle effort. The model adopted increasing amounts of positive step length asymmetry and decreased its net metabolic rate with increasing belt speed asymmetry, up to +25.6% SLA and -14.3% metabolic rate at a 3:1 belt speed ratio, relative to tied-belt walking. These gains were primarily enabled by an increase of braking work and a reduction of propulsion work on the fast belt. The results suggest that a purely energy minimization driven split belt walking strategy would involve substantial positive SLA, and that the lack of this characteristic in human behavior points to additional factors influencing the motor control strategy, such as aversion to excessive joint loads, asymmetry, or instability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Novel Framework for In-vivo Diffusion Tensor Distribution MRI of the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neural tissue microstructure plays an important role in developmental, physiological and pathophysiological processes. Diffusion tensor distribution (DTD) MRI helps probe heterogeneity at the mesoscopic length scale, orders of magnitude smaller than the nominal MRI voxel size, by describing water diffusion within a voxel using an ensemble of non-exchanging compartments characterized by a probability density function of diffusion tensors. In this study, we provide a new framework for acquiring tensor encoded diffusion weighted images (DWIs) and estimating DTD from them for in-vivo human brain imaging. We interfused pulsed field gradients (iPFG) in a single spin echo to generate arbitrary b-tensors of rank one, two, or three without introducing concomitant gradient artifacts. Employing well-defined gradient pulse duration and mixing/diffusion times in our diffusion preparation, we show that iPFG retains salient features of traditional multiple-PFG (mPFG) sequence while overcoming some of its implementation issues thereby extending its applications beyond DTD MRI. We assume DTD is a maximum entropy tensor-variate normal distribution whose tensor random variables are constrained to be positive definite (CNTVD) to ensure their physicality. In each voxel, the second-order mean and fourth-order covariance tensors of the DTD are estimated using a Monte Carlo method that synthesizes micro-diffusion tensors with corresponding size, shape and orientation distributions to best fit the measured DWIs. From these tensors we obtain the mean diffusivity (MD) spectrum, spectrum of diffusion tensor shapes, microscopic orientation distribution function (ODF), and microscopic fractional anisotropy (FA) which disentangle the underlying heterogeneity within a voxel. Using DTD derived ODF, we introduce a new method to perform fiber tractography capable of resolving complex fiber configurations. The results obtained in the live human brain showed microscopic anisotropy in various gray and white matter regions and skewed MD distribution in cerebellar gray matter not observed previously. DTD MRI tractography captured complex white matter fiber organization consistent with known anatomy. DTD MRI also resolved some degeneracies associated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and identified the source of microscopic anisotropy which may help improve the diagnosis of various neurological diseases and disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional organization of mouse auditory cortex in response to stimulus complexity and brain state</a></h4>

              
                The functional organization of sensory cortices is modulated by both extrinsic events and intrinsic states. The present study aimed to assess the mouse auditory cortex (AC) responses under varying conditions of stimulus complexity and brain state. Using wide-field calcium imaging, our results suggest a complete outline of topographic maps of frequency and FM rate as well as highly responsive regions to mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in both awake and anesthetized states. Three new regions responsive to high-frequency tones and four new gradients responsive to frequency modulations (FMs) were identified. These maps are highly replicable across weeks and between animals. In awake versus anesthetized states, cortical responsiveness to pure tones was stronger, and regions that preferentially responded to slow rate FMs were smaller. In both states, fast FM regions showed the greatest contribution to the processing of USVs. Finally, our modeling of how best tone frequency or FM rate changes as a function of distance along a topographic gradient resulted in a sigmoid function. Together, our findings provide a better understanding of mouse AC functional organization and how this organization is modulated by changes in stimulus complexity and brain state. The function of newly identified regions in higher-order auditory/vocal processing and animal behavior should be considered in future research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing Deep Learning Models for Age Prediction Based on the Resting State fMRI Dataset from the "Brain Dock" Service in Japan</a></h4>

              
                In Japan, many hospitals provide the unequaled service of medical check-up called the "Brain Dock"; however, there is a paucity of studies aimed at leveraging functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in hospitals. We obtained the resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scans of about 695 patients who accessed this service for preventive medicine against Alzheimer's Disease. In this study, we created deep learning models for age prediction with the ultimate aim of arriving at standard protocols for introducing rs-fMRI into clinical settings, particularly in Brain Docks. With that view, an assemblage of modeling conditions was attempted, changing multiple parameter values, features based on data extraction methods (region of interest-wise mean blood-oxygen-level-dependent lump-sum time series models or dynamic functional connectivity models), deep learning algorithms (Transformer, Multi-task Transformer, and unidirectional or bidirectional long short-term memory models), and different atlas-dependent brain region segmentation methods (including the Automated Anatomical Labeling and Harvard-Oxford atlases). As a result, a robust and highly significant correlation was obtained between actual and predicted ages from all types of methodologies. In addition, we determined that some conditions had a relatively large impact on prediction performance based on extended comparisons. The accuracy decreased, particularly according to the choice of atlases but with the same modeling conditions. Notwithstanding, we found that atlases based on intrinsic functional connectivity provided significant prediction accuracy even with a small number of regions to a similar extent as networks lowered spatial granularity. Moreover, we found that multi-task learning with other phenotype data (related to gender differences) was possible, but did not improve the prediction accuracy as much as expected. Despite these limitations, our results could provide a hopeful prospect of introducing fMRI into the field of neuro-clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular Mechanisms Underlying Embryonic Retinal Waves</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous activity is a hallmark of developing neural systems. In the retina, spontaneous activity comes in the form of retinal waves, comprised of three stages persisting from embryonic day 16 (E16) to eye opening at postnatal day 14 (P14). Though postnatal retinal waves have been well characterized, little is known about the spatiotemporal properties or the mechanisms mediating embryonic retinal waves, designated Stage 1 waves. Using a custom-built macroscope to record spontaneous calcium transients from whole embryonic retinas, we show that Stage 1 waves are initiated at several locations across the retina and propagate across finite regions of a broad range of areas. A gap junction antagonist, meclofenamic acid, reduced the frequency and size of Stage 1 waves but did not abolish them. The general nAChR antagonist, hexamethonium blocked Stage 1 waves, while they persisted in the presence of 4{beta}2 nAChR antagonist dihydro{beta}-erythroidine, indicating that the spatiotemporal properties of Stage 1 waves are mediated by a complex circuitry involving subtypes of nAChRs and gap junctions. Stage 1 waves in mice lacking the {beta}2 subunit of the nAChRs ({beta}2-nAChR-KO) were reduced, but in contrast to WT mice, they persisted in the hexamethonium and were completely blocked by meclofenamic acid. To assay the impact of Stage 1 waves on retinal development, we compared the spatial distribution of a subtype of retinal ganglion cells, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in WT and {beta}2-nAChR-KO mice. We found that the developmental decrease of ipRGC density is preserved between WT and {beta}2-nAChR-KO mice, indicating that processes regulating ipRGC distribution are not influenced by spontaneous activity.

                Backgrounds: Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the strongest environmental risks for late-life dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the interaction between genetic factors and environmental exposure to mild TBI triggering neurodegenerative processes is still unclear. We used longitudinal imaging to differentiate spatial patterns of progressive brain volume loss in individual patients with and without carrying apolipoprotein E (APOE) {varepsilon}4 carriers. Methods: For 59 patients with acute mild TBI (mTBI, age: 36.92 {+/-} 11.91 years; 14 APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers) and 48 matched healthy controls (HCs, age: 37.92 {+/-} 11.72 years; 10 APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers), longitudinal (6-12 months follow-up) brain structure was assessed using voxel-based morphometry on T1-weighted scans. Longitudinal volume changes in the temporal lobe were characterized by the Jacobian determinant (JD) metric, reflecting spatial warping between the baseline and follow-up scans. JD values were regionally calculated and correlated with neuropsychological measures. Results: MTBI patients lost a mean of 0.27% (SD = 0.43) of GM and 0.27% (SD = 0.50) of WM volume in the temporal lobe over the 6-12 month follow-up. Patients with a high genetic risk for AD (APOE {varepsilon}4 allele carries) were associated with severer atrophy in the left superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus regions than the controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, atrophy in these regions of gray matter could predict the performance change ratio of the language fluency in mTBI APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers ({beta} = 0.570, P < 0.05). While, compared with HC APOE {varepsilon}4 non-carriers, mTBI non-carriers exhibited volume loss in the medial temporal lobe. Conclusions: This prospective study provided evidence that the APOE {varepsilon}4 allele interacting with mTBI increased the risk of AD phenotype development with language dysfunction.

                Material perception is essential in planning interactions with the environment. The visual system relies on diagnostic image features to achieve material perception efficiently. However, discovering the features, especially for translucent materials, has been challenging due to the high variability of material appearances under interactions of shape, lighting, and intrinsic materials. Here, we learn a latent space informative of human translucency perception by developing a deep generative network trained to synthesize images of perceptually persuasive material appearances. Without supervision, human-interpretable scene attributes, including object's shape, material, and body color, spontaneously emerge in the latent space in a scale-specific manner. Critically, the middle-layers of the latent space selectively encode the translucency features correlating with perception, suggesting that translucent impressions are established in the mid-to-low spatial scale features. Our findings illustrate the promising capability of unsupervised learning in finding representative dimensions for materials and discovering perceptually relevant features for visual inference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Localized network hyperconnectivity leads to hyperexcitability after injury</a></h4>

              
                Brain injury increases the risk of the development of epilepsy. Axonal sprouting and synaptogenesis are homeostatically mediated responses by neurons to injury-induced de-afferentation and de-efferentation. Rewiring which occurs due to axonal sprouting and synaptogenesis may alter network excitability and lead to epilepsy. Excitatory and inhibitory connectivity are both subject to homeostatic rewiring. Thus, post-sprouting hyperexcitability cannot be simply explained as result of altered inhibitory/excitatory balance. In this work, we show computationally and experimentally that hyperconnected local networks are created by homeostatic rewiring near the injury site. These local networks are characterized by altered system dynamics despite preservation of excitatory/inhibitory balance. Hyperconnected local networks have a lower threshold for burst initiation, and generate spontaneous bursts, which in turn ignite seizure-like activity in the larger network. Our findings demonstrate a novel network mechanism of hyperexcitability and seizure generation due to maladaptive recovery after injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The spatiotemporal neural dynamics of object recognition for natural images and line drawings</a></h4>

              
                Drawings offer a simple and efficient way to communicate meaning. While line drawings capture only coarsely how objects look in reality, we still perceive them as resembling real-world objects. Previous work has shown that this perceived similarity is mirrored by shared neural representations for drawings and natural images, which suggests that similar mechanisms underlie the recognition of both. However, other work has proposed that representations of drawings and natural images become similar only after substantial processing has taken place, suggesting distinct mechanisms. To arbitrate between those alternatives, we measured brain responses resolved in space and time using fMRI and MEG, respectively, while participants viewed images of objects depicted as photographs, line drawings, or sketch-like drawings. Using multivariate decoding, we demonstrate that object category information emerged similarly fast and across overlapping regions in occipital and ventral-temporal cortex for all types of depiction, yet with smaller effects at higher levels of visual abstraction. In addition, cross-decoding between depiction types revealed strong generalization of object category information from early processing stages on. Finally, by combining fMRI and MEG data using representational similarity analysis, we found that visual information traversed similar processing stages for all types of depiction, yet with an overall stronger representation for photographs. Together our results demonstrate broad commonalities in the neural dynamics of object recognition across types of depiction, thus providing clear evidence for shared neural mechanisms underlying recognition of natural object images and abstract drawings.

	<p>The incidence of stroke and the burden on health care and society are expected to increase significantly in the coming years, due to the increasing aging of the population. Various sensory, motor, cognitive and psychological disorders may remain in the patient after survival from a stroke. In hemiplegic patients with movement disorders, the impairment of upper limb function, especially hand function, dramatically limits the ability of patients to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Therefore, one of the essential goals of post-stroke rehabilitation is to restore hand function. The recovery of motor function is achieved chiefly through compensatory strategies, such as hand rehabilitation robots, which have been available since the end of the last century. This paper reviews the current research status of hand function rehabilitation devices based on various types of hand motion recognition technologies and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages, reviews the application of artificial intelligence in hand rehabilitation robots, and summarizes the current research limitations and discusses future research directions.</p>

	<p>Purpose: To investigate the altered functional connectivity (FC) of the cerebral hemispheres in patients with morbid obesity (MO) with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) by voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Methods: Patients and matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited, and all subjects underwent functional resonance magnetic imaging (fMRI), and VMHC results were processed statistically to assess the differences in FC in different brain regions between the two groups. We further used ROC curves to evaluate the diagnostic value of these differences. We also used Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis to explore the relationship between changes in VMHC values in specific brain regions, visual acuity, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Conclusions: Patients with morbid obesity and MGD had abnormal FC in the cerebral hemispheres in several specific brain areas, which were mainly concentrated in pathways related to vision and perception and may correlate to some extent with the clinical presentations of the patients.</p>

	<p>Stress may serve multiple roles in cerebral functioning, ranging from a highly appropriate behavioral adaptation to a critical risk factor for susceptibility to mood disorder and cognitive impairment. It is well known that E/I (excitation/inhibition) balance is essential for maintaining brain homeostasis. However, it remains largely unknown how GABAergic and Glutamatergic neurons respond to different stressful stimuli and whether the GABAergic-Glutamatergic neuron balance is related to the transition between adaptive and maladaptive behaviors. Here, we subjected 3-month-old mice to chronic mild stress (CMS) for a period of one, two, and four weeks, respectively. The results showed that the two-week CMS procedure produced adaptive effects on behaviors and cognitive performance, with a higher number of GABAergic neuron and VGluT1-positive neurons, increasing the expressions of p-GluN2B, Reelin, and syn-PSD-95 protein in the hippocampus. In contrast, the prolonged behavioral challenge (4 week) imposes a passive coping behavioral strategy and cognitive impairment, decreased the number of GABAergic neuron, hyperactivity of VGluT1-positive neuron, increased the ratio of p-GluN2B, and decreased the expression of Reelin, syn-PSD-95 in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that a moderate duration of stress probably promotes behavioral adaptation and spatial memory by maintaining a GABAergic-Glutamatergic neuron balance and promoting the expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins in the brain.</p>

	<p>In the last decades, it has been proposed that executive functions may be particularly vulnerable to weight-related issues. However, evidence on the matter is mixed, especially when the effects of sociodemographic variables are weighted. Thus, the current study aimed at further examining the relationship between executive functions and obesity. To this aim, we compared treatment-seeking overweight, obese, and morbidly obese patients with normal-weight control participants. We examined general executive functioning (Frontal Assessment Battery&amp;amp;ndash;15) and different executive subdomains (e.g., inhibitory control, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed) in a clinical sample including 208 outpatients with different degrees of BMI (52 overweight, BMI 25&amp;amp;ndash;30, M age = 34.38; 76 obese, BMI 30&amp;amp;ndash;40, M age = 38.00; 80 morbidly obese, BMI &amp;amp;gt; 40, M age = 36.20). Ninety-six normal-weight subjects served as controls. No difference on executive scores was detected when obese patients were compared with over- or normal-weight subjects. Morbidly obese patients reported lower performance on executive scores than obese, overweight, and normal-weight subjects. Between-group difference emerged also when relevant covariates were taken into account. Our results support the view that morbid obesity is associated with lower executive performance, also considering the critical role exerted by sociodemographic (i.e., sex, age, and education) variables. Our results support the view that executive functioning should be accounted into the management of the obese patient because of non-negligible clinical relevance in diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic terms.</p>
