              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-109/v1?src=rss">Evaluating Business Intelligence Success in the Public Sector: Extending the DeLone and McLean Model with Perceived Organizational Support [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The effectiveness of information systems in enhancing user performance is influenced by various factors, including system quality, service quality, and user satisfaction. Perceived Organizational Support (POS) has been proposed as a moderator in this relationship, though its impact remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the moderating role of POS on the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, specifically in the context of Approweb, an information system used by account representatives at the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) in Jakarta. Methods A quantitative research approach with an explanatory design was adopted to examine causal relationships among the variables. The theoretical framework was based on the DeLone and McLean Information System Success Model (2003), with POS incorporated from the socio-technical perspective. Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey from 329 Account Representatives (ARs) using a probability sampling method Results The study found that both system quality and service quality significantly influence user satisfaction and user performance. Moreover, POS was found to significantly moderate the relationship between system quality, service quality, and user performance, enhancing the positive effects of both quality dimensions on performance. These results suggest that organizational support is a key factor in maximizing the benefits of information systems. Conclusions The findings confirm the critical role of system quality, service quality, and POS in improving user performance. POS was shown to amplify the positive effects of both system and service quality, indicating that users are more likely to perform effectively when they perceive strong organizational support. The study contributes to the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model by incorporating POS as a moderating factor and emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to system success that integrates both technical and social dimensions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-108/v1?src=rss">Advancing Diabetic Care Through Non-Invasive Glucose Monitoring Using Optical Sensors and IoT Technologies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus must monitor their Blood Glucose (BG) to continually control their glycemia. They had to undergo a blood test at least twice a day using a finger prick, and must visit a laboratory every three months for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the constitution of Iraqi diabetes patients is 13.9%. An Internet of Things (IoT) based framework for non-invasive BG monitoring was recently developed. The aim is to enhance the Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) device by using IoT technologies. Methods Starting with a review of the latest IoT technologies and some of the CGM commercial devices recommended by ISO 15197 standard. A questionnaire sheet is distributed to determine how much patients in Iraq knew about their health situation and whether they are interested in using new IoT technologies. Women patients are volunteered to check their BG using both finger prick and a CGM device three times a day for comparing. The suggestion is to connect CGM to a personal smart device that has a method controlling alarm messages instead of CGM output. Results The results show how important to educate patients about new technologies. A CGM and finger prick results are checked for similarity using statistical package. Results are presented as (mean ± SD (standard deviation)), the findings demonstrated that, significantly at P < 0.05, there were no differences between the means for tests in both methods based on the standard Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) report. Conclusion This study shows how Iraqi’s patients feel when using a CGM device with new IoT technologies. CGM output is accurate but appeared every 15 min which may be uncomfortable. A method is suggested to transfer CGM output to a smart device to be controlled by algorithms, so that an alarm message is showed every 8h in a normal situation rather than every 15 min. Moreover, GMI% can be calculated every two weeks using data stored in the cloud to estimate a patient’s HbA1c level by using Markov chain. This figure how BG levels are changing in a shorter timeframe, helping in fine-tune diabetes management plans.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15313">Mind the Gap: Why Neural Memory Fails Under Semantic Density</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.15313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain solves a problem that current AI architectures struggle to manage: storing specific episodic facts without corrupting general semantic knowledge. Neuroscience explains this through Complementary Learning Systems theory - a fast hippocampal system for episodic storage using pattern-separated representations, and a slow neocortical system for extracting statistical regularities. Current AI systems lack this separation, attempting both functions through neural weights alone. We identify the 'Stability Gap' in online neural memory: fast-weight mechanisms that write facts into shared continuous parameters collapse to near-random accuracy within tens of semantically related facts. Through semantic density (rho), we show collapse occurs with as few as N=5 facts at high density (rho > 0.6) or N ~ 20-75 at moderate density - a phenomenon we formalise as the Orthogonality Constraint. This failure persists even with perfect attention and unlimited context, arising from write-time interference when storage and retrieval share the same substrate. We also identify schema drift and version ambiguity as primary failure modes in production systems, observing 40-70% schema consistency and 0-100% clean correction rates. Context-based memory incurs 30-300% cost premium over selective retrieval. We propose Knowledge Objects (KOs): discrete, typed memory units with controlled vocabularies and explicit version chains. Paired with neural weights, KOs enable a true complementary learning architecture, suggesting reliable AI memory may require this bicameral design.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15314">Beyond the Einstein-Bohr Debate: Cognitive Complementarity and the Emergence of Quantum Intuition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-precision experimental confirmations of quantum complementarity have revitalized foundational debates about measurement, description, and realism. This article argues that complementarity is most productively interpreted as an epistemic principle--constraining what can be simultaneously accessed and represented--rather than as an ontological claim about quantum reality. Reexamining the Einstein-Bohr debate through this lens reveals a persistent tension between descriptive completeness and contextual meaning, a tension experiments clarify but do not dissolve. Building on this analysis, we introduce cognitive complementarity as a structural principle governing reasoning under non-classical uncertainty, where mutually constraining representations cannot be jointly optimized. Within this framework, we propose quantum intuition as a testable cognitive capacity: the ability to sustain representational plurality, regulate commitment timing, and resolve perspective-incompatibilities in a context-sensitive manner. Formulated as a naturalistic construct grounded in shared informational constraints, quantum intuition offers a principled bridge between quantum measurement theory and cognition. This work reframes the historical debate, extends epistemic lessons from quantum foundations into cognitive science, and outlines empirical pathways for studying decision-making in contexts of irreducible uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15319">Large Language Models as Simulative Agents for Neurodivergent Adult Psychometric Profiles</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.15319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adult neurodivergence, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Cognitive Disengagement Syndrome (CDS), is marked by substantial symptom overlap that limits the discriminant sensitivity of standard psychometric instruments. While recent work suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate human psychometric responses from qualitative data, it remains unclear whether they can accurately and stably model neurodevelopmental traits rather than broad personality characteristics. This study examines whether LLMs can generate psychometric responses that approximate those of real individuals when grounded in a structured qualitative interview, and whether such simulations are sensitive to variations in trait intensity. Twenty-six adults completed a 29-item open-ended interview and four standardized self-report measures (ASRS, BAARS-IV, AQ, RAADS-R). Two LLMs (GPT-4o and Qwen3-235B-A22B) were prompted to infer an individual psychological profile from interview content and then respond to each questionnaire in-role. Accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity were assessed using group-level comparisons, error metrics, exact-match scoring, and a randomized baseline. Both models outperformed random responses across instruments, with GPT-4o showing higher accuracy and reproducibility. Simulated responses closely matched human data for ASRS, BAARS-IV, and RAADS-R, while the AQ revealed subscale-specific limitations, particularly in Attention to Detail. Overall, the findings indicate that interview-grounded LLMs can produce coherent and above-chance simulations of neurodevelopmental traits, supporting their potential use as synthetic participants in early-stage psychometric research, while highlighting clear domain-specific constraints.

                arXiv:2601.15320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical and philosophical framework in which brain function is modeled using sheaf theory over neural state spaces. Local neural or cognitive functions are represented as sections of a sheaf, while global coherence corresponds to the existence of global sections. Brain pathologies are interpreted as obstructions to such global integration and are classified using tools from sheaf cohomology. The framework builds on the neural manifold program in contemporary neuroscience and on standard results in sheaf theory, and is further interpreted through a Leibnizian lens \cite{Churchland2012, Leibniz1714, MacLaneMoerdijk, Perich2025}. This paper is intended as a conceptual and formal proposal rather than a complete empirical theory.

                arXiv:2601.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ventriloquism After-Effect is the phenomenon where sustained exposure to the ventriloquist illusion causes a change in unisensory auditory localization towards the location where the visual stimulus was present. We investigate the recalibration in EEG networks that causes this change and the track the timeline of changes in the auditory processing pathway. Our results obtained using network analysis, non-stationary time series analysis and multivariate pattern classification show that recalibration takes place early in the auditory processing pathway and the after-effect decays with time after exposure to the illusion.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15336">Learning Discrete Successor Transitions in Continuous Attractor Networks: Emergence, Limits, and Topological Constraints</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are a well-established class of models for representing low-dimensional continuous variables such as head direction, spatial position, and phase. In canonical spatial domains, transitions along the attractor manifold are driven by continuous displacement signals, such as angular velocity-provided by sensorimotor systems external to the CAN itself. When such signals are not explicitly provided as dedicated displacement inputs, it remains unclear whether attractor-based circuits can reliably acquire recurrent dynamics that support stable state transitions, or whether alternative predictive strategies dominate.
  In this work, we present an experimental framework for training CANs to perform successor-like transitions between stable attractor states in the absence of externally provided displacement signals. We compare two recurrent topologies, a circular ring and a folded snake manifold, and systematically vary the temporal regime under which stability is evaluated. We find that, under short evaluation windows, networks consistently converge to impulse-driven associative solutions that achieve high apparent accuracy yet lack persistent attractor dynamics. Only when stability is explicitly enforced over extended free-run periods do genuine attractor-based transition dynamics emerge. This suggests that shortcut solutions are the default outcome of local learning in recurrent networks, while attractor dynamics represent a constrained regime rather than a generic result.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that topology strictly limits the capacity for learned transitions. While the continuous ring topology achieves perfect stability over long horizons, the folded snake topology hits a geometric limit characterized by failure at manifold discontinuities, which neither curriculum learning nor basal ganglia-inspired gating can fully overcome.

                arXiv:2601.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision psychiatry aspires to elucidate brain-based biomarkers of psychopathology to bolster disease risk assessment and treatment development. To this end, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has helped triangulate brain circuits whose functional features are correlated with or even predictive of forms of psychopathology. Yet, fMRI biomarkers to date remain largely descriptive identifiers of where, rather than how, neurobiology is aberrant, limiting their utility for guiding treatment. We present a method for decomposing fMRI-based functional connectivity (FC) into constituent biomechanisms - output drive, input responsivity, modulator gating - with clearer alignment to differentiable therapeutic interventions. Neurocircuit mechanism decomposition (NMD) integrates (i) a graph-constrained, lag-aware transformer to estimate directed, pathway-specific routing distributions and drive signals, with (ii) a measurement-aware state-space model (SSM) that models hemodynamic convolution and recovers intrinsic latent dynamics. This dual-head architecture yields interpretable circuit parameters that may provide a more direct bridge from fMRI to treatment strategy selection. We instantiate the model in an anatomically and electrophysiologically well-defined circuit: the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15462">Dynamic Mean Field Theories for Nonlinear Noise in Recurrent Neuronal Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong, correlated noise in recurrent neural circuits often passes through nonlinear transfer functions, complicating dynamical mean-field analyses of complex phenomena such as transients and bifurcations. We introduce a method that replaces nonlinear functions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise with a Gaussian-equivalent process matched in mean and covariance, and combine this with a lognormal moment closure for expansive nonlinearities to derive a closed dynamical mean-field theory for recurrent neuronal networks. The resulting theory captures order-one transients, fixed points, and noise-induced shifts of bifurcation structure, and outperforms standard linearization-based approximations in the strong-fluctuation regime. More broadly, the approach applies whenever dynamics depend smoothly on OU processes via nonlinear transformations, offering a tractable route to noise-dependent phase diagrams in computational neuroscience models.

                arXiv:2601.15689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volitional memory control supports adaptive cognition by enabling intentional Recall of goal-relevant information and Suppression of unwanted memories. While neural mechanisms underlying Recall and Suppression have been studied largely in isolation, less is known about the large-scale brain networks supporting these processes under competing cognitive demands, particularly as a function of subclinical anxiety. Here, we examined control of emotionally valenced memories during directed Recall and Suppression while 47 participants concurrently performed an independent visual working memory task. Cognitive control efficiency was quantified using the Balanced Integration Score (BIS), and seed-to-voxel resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) was used to characterize intrinsic network organization. Dissociable rsFC profiles were associated with memory control efficiency across emotional valences and were selectively moderated by anxiety. More efficient Suppression of positive memories was linked to reduced connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and posterior perceptual-midline regions, as well as diminished hippocampal-frontal pole coupling. In contrast, efficient Suppression of negative memories was associated with increased connectivity between posterior parietal and lateral occipital regions. Anxiety moderated relationships between cognitive efficiency and prefrontal connectivity during Suppression of positive memories and Recall of positive and neutral memories. Direct comparisons further revealed stronger hippocampal-thalamic rsFC during Suppression relative to Recall of positive memories. Together, these findings delineate the functional brain architecture supporting volitional control of emotional memories under cognitive load and demonstrate that anxiety severity selectively shapes these network-level mechanisms across the anxiety continuum.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined as an abnormal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on protein biomarkers via PET or CSF analysis. However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.

                arXiv:2411.15078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stockart et al. (2025) recommend guidelines for best practices in the field of unconscious cognition. However, they condone the repeatedly criticized technique of excluding trials with high visibility ratings or of participants with high sensitivity for the critical stimulus. Based on standard signal detection theory for discrimination judgments, we show that post-hoc trial selection only isolates points of neutral response bias but remains consistent with uncomfortably high levels of sensitivity. We argue that post-hoc selection constitutes a sampling fallacy that capitalizes on chance, generates regression artifacts, and wrongly ascribes unconscious processing to stimulus conditions that may be far from indiscriminable. As an alternative, we advocate the study of functional dissociations, where direct (D) and indirect (I) measures are conceptualized as spanning up a two-dimensional D-I-space and where single, sensitivity, and double dissociations appear as distinct curve patterns. While Stockart et al.'s recommendations cover only a single line of that space where D is close to zero, functional dissociations can utilize the entire space, circumventing requirements like null visibility and exhaustive reliability, and allowing for the planful measurement of theoretically meaningful functional relationships between experimentally controlled variables.

                arXiv:2505.02541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural activity data can be associated with behavioral and physiological variables by analyzing their changes in the temporal domain. However, such relationships are often difficult to quantify and test, requiring advanced computational modeling approaches. Here, we provide a protocol for the statistical analysis of brain dynamics and for testing their associations with behavioral, physiological and other non-imaging variables. The protocol is based on an open-source Python package built on a generalization of the hidden Markov model (HMM) - the Gaussian-linear HMM - and supports multiple experimental modalities, including task-based and resting-state studies, often used to explore a wide range of questions in neuroscience and mental health. Our toolbox is available as both a Python library and a graphical interface, so it can be used by researchers with or without programming experience. Statistical inference is performed by using permutation-based methods and structured Monte Carlo resampling, and the framework can easily handle confounding variables, multiple testing corrections and hierarchical relationships within the data, among other features. The package includes tools developed to facilitate the intuitive visualization of statistical results, along with comprehensive documentation and step-by-step tutorials for data interpretation. Overall, the protocol covers the full workflow for the statistical analysis of functional neural data and their temporal dynamics.

                arXiv:2506.03088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mapping from sound to neural activity that underlies hearing is highly non-linear. The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been modelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more recently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models. Modelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory processing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for training DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken advantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory midbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this model assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore it cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.
  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space of hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory midbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised by only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62% of the explainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68% for hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the art animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to simulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the learned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving crossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more animals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen animals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss compensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing impaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the loop optimisation.

                arXiv:2512.15891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last century, most sensorimotor studies of cortical neurons relied on average firing rates. Rate coding is efficient for fast sensorimotor processing that occurs within a few seconds. Much less is known about long-term working memory with a time scale of hours (Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995). The discovery of millisecond-precision spike initiation in cortical neurons was unexpected (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995). Even more striking was the precision of spiking in vivo, in response to rapidly fluctuating sensory inputs, suggesting that neural circuits could preserve and manipulate sensory information through spike timing. High temporal resolution enables a broader range of neural codes. It could also support spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is triggered by the relative timing of spikes between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in the millisecond range. What spike-timing mechanisms could regulate STDP in vivo? Cortical traveling waves have been observed across many frequency bands with high temporal precision. Traveling waves have wave fronts that could link spike timing to STDP. As a wave front passes through a cortical column, excitatory synapses on the dendrites of both pyramidal and basket cells are stimulated synchronously. Inhibitory basket cells form a calyx on pyramidal cell bodies, and inhibitory rebound following a strong transient hyperpolarization can trigger a backpropagating action potential, which arrives shortly after the excitatory inputs on pyramidal dendrites. STDP activated in this way could persist for hours, creating a second-tier network. This temporary network could support long-term working memory, a cognitive network riding above the long-term sensorimotor network. On their own, traveling waves and STDP have not yet yielded new insights into cortical function. Together, they could be responsible for how we think (Sejnowski, 2025).

                arXiv:2601.10912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.

Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.

                arXiv:2601.15598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising energy-efficient models and powerful framworks of modeling neuron dynamics. However, existing binary spiking neurons exhibit limited biological plausibilities and low information capacity. Recently developed ternary spiking neuron possesses higher consistency with biological principles (i.e. excitation-inhibition balance mechanism). Despite of this, the ternary spiking neuron suffers from defects including iterative information loss, temporal gradient vanishing and irregular distributions of membrane potentials. To address these issues, we propose Complemented Ternary Spiking Neuron (CTSN), a novel ternary spiking neuron model that incorporates an learnable complemental term to store information from historical inputs. CTSN effectively improves the deficiencies of ternary spiking neuron, while the embedded learnable factors enable CTSN to adaptively adjust neuron dynamics, providing strong neural heterogeneity. Furthermore, based on the temporal evolution features of ternary spiking neurons' membrane potential distributions, we propose the Temporal Membrane Potential Regularization (TMPR) training method. TMPR introduces time-varying regularization strategy utilizing membrane potentials, furhter enhancing the training process by creating extra backpropagation paths. We validate our methods through extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating remarkable performance advances.

Existing automated heuristic design methods, particularly genetic programming constrained to fixed terminal symbol sets, struggle to capture and leverage dynamic uncertainties and hierarchical dependency information under transient decision states. This study develops an LLM-assisted Dynamic Rule Design framework (LLM4DRD) that automatically evolves integrated online scheduling rules adapted to scheduling features. Firstly, multi-stage processing and assembly supply decisions are transformed into feasible directed edge orderings based on heterogeneous graph. Then, an elite knowledge guided initialization embeds advanced design expertise into initial rules to enhance initial quality. Additionally, a dual-expert mechanism is introduced in which LLM-A evolutionary code to generate candidate rules and LLM-S conducts scheduling evaluation, while dynamic feature-fitting rule evolution combined with hybrid evaluation enables continuous improvement and extracts adaptive rules with strong generalization capability. A series of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the method. The average tardiness of LLM4DRD is 3.17-12.39% higher than state-of-the-art methods in 20 practical instances used for training and testing, respectively. In 24 scenarios with different resource configurations, order loads, and disturbance levels totaling 480 instances, it achieves 11.10% higher performance than the second best competitor, exhibiting excellent robustness.

                arXiv:2601.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Particle Automata (NPA), a Lagrangian generalization of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) from static lattices to dynamic particle systems. Unlike classical Eulerian NCA where cells are pinned to pixels or voxels, NPA model each cell as a particle with a continuous position and internal state, both updated by a shared, learnable neural rule. This particle-based formulation yields clear individuation of cells, allows heterogeneous dynamics, and concentrates computation only on regions where activity is present. At the same time, particle systems pose challenges: neighborhoods are dynamic, and a naive implementation of local interactions scale quadratically with the number of particles. We address these challenges by replacing grid-based neighborhood perception with differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) operators backed by memory-efficient, CUDA-accelerated kernels, enabling scalable end-to-end training. Across tasks including morphogenesis, point-cloud classification, and particle-based texture synthesis, we show that NPA retain key NCA behaviors such as robustness and self-regeneration, while enabling new behaviors specific to particle systems. Together, these results position NPA as a compact neural model for learning self-organizing particle dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16118">A Case for Hypergraphs to Model and Map SNNs on Neuromorphic Hardware</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Executing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware poses the problem of mapping neurons to cores. SNNs operate by propagating spikes between neurons that form a graph through synapses. Neuromorphic hardware mimics them through a network-on-chip, transmitting spikes, and a mesh of cores, each managing several neurons. Its operational cost is tied to spike movement and active cores. A mapping comprises two tasks: partitioning the SNN's graph to fit inside cores and placement of each partition on the hardware mesh. Both are NP-hard problems, and as SNNs and hardware scale towards billions of neurons, they become increasingly difficult to tackle effectively. In this work, we propose to raise the abstraction of SNNs from graphs to hypergraphs, redesigning mapping techniques accordingly. The resulting model faithfully captures the replication of spikes inside cores by exposing the notion of hyperedge co-membership between neurons. We further show that the overlap and locality of hyperedges strongly correlate with high-quality mappings, making these properties instrumental in devising mapping algorithms. By exploiting them directly, grouping neurons through shared hyperedges, communication traffic and hardware resource usage can be reduced be yond what just contracting individual connections attains. To substantiate this insight, we consider several partitioning and placement algorithms, some newly devised, others adapted from literature, and compare them over progressively larger and bio-plausible SNNs. Our results show that hypergraph based techniques can achieve better mappings than the state-of-the-art at several execution time regimes. Based on these observations, we identify a promising selection of algorithms to achieve effective mappings at any scale.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16485">Online Operator Design in Evolutionary Optimization for Flexible Job Shop Scheduling via Large Language Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.16485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search effectiveness often deteriorates as evolutionary progresses. Dynamic operator configuration approaches attempt to alleviate this issue, but they typically rely on predefined operator structures and localized parameter control, lacking sustained adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for online operator design in Evolutionary Optimization, named LLM4EO, comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, operators are initialized by leveraging LLMs to distill and transfer knowledge from well-established operators. Then, search behaviors and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance with evolutionary features, accompanied by suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, an LLM-driven meta-operator dynamically optimizes gene selection of operators by prompt-guided improvement strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of solutions and operators within a unified optimization framework, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks of flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms tailored EAs.

                Abstract* Background Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) in mathematics education has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, reflecting broader advances in machine learning, learning analytics, and generative AI. However, a comprehensive overview of publication trends, thematic structures, and collaborative patterns specific to mathematics education remains limited. Methods This study employed a bibliometric approach guided by the PRISMA protocol to systematically analyze research on AI and ITS in mathematics education published between 2001 and 2025. A total of 237 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers indexed in Scopus were identified, screened, and included. Bibliographic data were analyzed using the Bibliometrix R package to examine annual publication growth, author productivity, international collaboration networks, and thematic evolution through keyword co-occurrence and thematic mapping techniques. Results The findings indicate that research output grew slowly during the early 2000s but increased markedly after 2019, aligning with the global surge in interest in machine learning, large language models, and generative AI. Author productivity followed a typical long-tail distribution, with a small group of core authors contributing consistently over time. International collaboration was evident but uneven, dominated by a limited number of countries. Thematic analysis revealed two enduring pillars of the field: pedagogical approaches in mathematics education and technology-driven instructional systems. Emerging themes, including federated learning and adversarial machine learning, point to rising attention to privacy, security, and robustness in adaptive learning environments. STEM education and generative AI have also gained prominence in recent years. Conclusions The evolution of research on AI and ITS in mathematics education reflects a clear paradigm shift from traditional instruction toward adaptive, data-driven, and intelligent learning systems. While technological innovation continues to accelerate, the findings highlight the critical role of teachers’ pedagogical readiness in ensuring that AI-enhanced mathematics education remains effective, inclusive, and sustainable.

                This study investigated the relationship between parents perceptions of children’s values in Indonesian families, focusing on economic, social, emotional, and religious dimensions. The investigation was based on background factors, such as gender, location of residence, and education level, as well as correlations and regressions between dimensions of children’s values. The study participants consisted of 255 parents living in various urban and rural areas in Indonesia. Data were collected using the Children’s Values Scale adapted for the Indonesian context. The study findings showed that there were no significant differences in children’s perceptions of values based on gender or education level. However, there were significant differences based on location of residence, especially on economic and religious dimensions. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between social and emotional dimensions, while a negative relationship was found between economic and emotional dimensions in some contexts. The results of multiple linear regression analysis using the Stepwise method showed that economic and religious dimensions had a significant impact on overall family relationship patterns. This study highlights the importance of understanding the factors that influence parents’ perceptions of children’s values to support effective and harmonious parenting in Indonesian families.

                <p>Mirror invariance is the cognitive tendency to perceive mirror-image objects as identical. Mirrored letters, however, are distinct orthographic units and must be identified as different despite having the same shape. Consistent with this phenomenon, a small, localized region in the ventral visual stream, the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), exhibits repetition suppression to both identical and mirror pairs of objects but only to identical, not mirror, pairs of letters (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B42">Pegado et al., 2011</cross-ref>), a phenomenon named mirror invariance "breaking". The ability of congenitally blind individuals to "break" mirror invariance for pairs of mirrored Braille letters has been demonstrated behaviorally (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B21">de Heering et al., 2018</cross-ref>,   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Korczyk et al., 2024</cross-ref>). However, its neural underpinnings have not yet been investigated. Here, in an fMRI repetition suppression paradigm, congenitally blind individuals (8 males and 10 females) recognized pairs of everyday objects and Braille letters in identical ("p" and "p"), mirror ("p" and "q"), and different ("p" and "z") orientations. We found repetition suppression for identical and mirror pairs of everyday objects in the parietal and ventral-lateral occipital cortex, indicating that mirror-invariant object recognition engages the ventral visual stream in tactile modality as well. However, repetition suppression for identical but not mirrored pairs of Braille letters was found not in the VWFA, but in broad areas of the left parietal cortex and the lateral occipital cortex. These results suggest that reading-related orthographic processes in blind individuals depend on different neural computations than those of the sighted.</p>

                <p>by Junhui Peng, Li Zhao</p>

Proteins function through dynamic interactions with other proteins in cells, forming complex networks fundamental to cellular processes. While high-resolution and high-throughput methods have significantly advanced our understanding of how proteins interact with each other, the molecular details of many important protein-protein interactions are still poorly characterized, especially in non-mammalian species, including <i>Drosophila</i>. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have enabled the prediction of molecular details in various cellular pathways at the network level. In this study, we used AlphaFold2 multimer to examine and predict protein-protein interactions from both physical and functional datasets in <i>Drosophila</i>. We found that functional associations contribute significantly to high-confidence predictions. Through detailed structural analysis, we also found the importance of intrinsically disordered regions in the predicted high-confidence interactions. Our study highlights the importance of disordered regions in protein-protein interactions and demonstrates the importance of incorporating functional interactions in predicting physical interactions between proteins. We further compiled an interactive web interface to present the predictions, facilitating functional exploration, comparative analysis, and the generation of mechanistic hypotheses for future studies.

                <p>by Constandina Koki, Alessio V. Inchingolo, Abdullahi Daniyan, Enyu Li, Andrew D. McAinsh, Nigel J. Burroughs</p>

Mitosis is a complex self-organising process that achieves high fidelity separation of duplicated chromosomes into two daughter cells through capture and alignment of chromosomes to the spindle mid-plane. Chromosome movements are driven by kinetochores (KTs), multi-protein machines that attach chromosomes to microtubules (MTs), and through those attachments both control and generate directional forces. Using lattice light sheet microscopy imaging and automated near-complete tracking of kinetochores at fine spatio-temporal resolution, we produce a detailed atlas of kinetochore metaphase-anaphase dynamics in untransformed human cells (RPE1). Such data allows dynamic models to be reverse engineered and biological hypotheses to be addressed. We determined the support from this dataset for 17 models of metaphase dynamics using Bayesian inference, demonstrating (1) substantial sister asymmetry that generates transverse organisation of the metaphase plate (MPP), (2) substantial spatial organisation of KT dynamic properties within the MPP, and (3) significant time dependence of the K-fiber mechanical parameters whereby K-fiber forces tune over the last 5 mins of metaphase towards a set point, referred to as the anaphase ready state. These spatio-temporal trends are robust to perturbation of the spindle assembly pathway (nocodazole washout treatment), suggesting that the underlying processes generating kinetochore heterogeneity are intrinsic to mitosis and possibly play a role in ensuring high-fidelity segregation.

                <p>by Pranav Mahajan, Peter Dayan, Ben Seymour</p>

Injuries are an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life, leading to an evolutionary mandate for powerful homeostatic processes of recovery and recuperation. The physiological responses of the body and the immune system must be coordinated with behaviour to allow protected time for this to happen, and to prevent further damage to the affected bodily parts. Reacting appropriately requires an internal control system that represents the nature and state of the injury and specifies and withholds actions accordingly. We bring the formal uncertainties embodied in this system into the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process. We discuss nociceptive phenomena in light of this analysis, noting particularly the counter-intuitive behaviours associated with injury investigation, and the propensity for transitions from normative, tonic, to pathological, chronic pain states. Importantly, these simulation results provide a quantitative account and enable us to sketch a much needed roadmap for future theoretical and experimental studies on injury, tonic pain, and the transition to chronic pain.

                <p>by Upama Aich, Chloe Tan, Rebecca Bathgate, Khandis R. Blake, Robert C. S. Capp, Jacob C. Kuek, Bob B. M. Wong, Brian S. Mautz, Michael D. Jennions</p>

Why the human penis is unusually large compared to that of other primates is a long-standing evolutionary question. Sexual selection, through female mate choice and male-male competition, is a likely driver, but confirming this is difficult due to natural covariation among traits. The solution is to experimentally manipulate focal traits to identify targets of selection. Using 343 computer-generated male figures that varied in penis size, height and body shape, we experimentally tested how these traits influence perceived attractiveness and fighting ability. Over 800 participants—both male and female—viewed either life-sized (in-person) or scaled (online) animations and rated the figures. Across both settings, selection analyses revealed consistent directional selection favoring taller men with a more V-shaped body and a larger penis. In both surveys, male participants rated rivals with a larger penis as more sexually competitive and physically threatening. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence that males assess rivals’ fighting ability and attractiveness to females based partly on a rival’s penis size. Our findings suggest that female choice and male-male competition have jointly favored larger penis size, greater height, and more V-shaped bodies in men.

Skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating condition that significantly affects patients’ quality of life and prognosis, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Optineurin (OPTN) as an active regulator for maintenance of muscle homeostasis during muscle atrophy. Knockdown (KD) of Optn induces muscle atrophy, while overexpression of Optn alleviated dexamethasone-induced muscle atrophy in mice. Mechanistically, we for the first time identified Junction plakoglobin (JUP) as a novel interacting partner of OPTN. OPTN alleviates muscle atrophy in a JUP-dependent manner, corroborating JUP as the downstream effector of OPTN-mediated muscle atrophy. RNA-seq analysis revealed that PI3K-AKT pathway is markedly downregulated in Optn-KD muscle, and pharmacological activation of PI3K-AKT pathway effectively rescued muscle atrophy in Optn-KD mice. We further show that OPTN coordinates the interaction between JUP and PI3-Kinase p85 in muscle, promoting activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Collectively, our study proposed a conceptual novelty that OPTN-JUP axis mediated activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway during muscle atrophy. These findings offer new insights into the mechanisms of muscle atrophy and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for this condition.

                Purpose This study aims to investigate the potential for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with management accounting techniques and their impact on improving financial reporting, accountability, transparency, and the quality and efficiency of information. It also explores how this integration affects stakeholder trust in banks. Design/Methodology/Approach A structured questionnaire was used to survey 100 employees working in banks such Accountants, bankers, and specialized academics regarding AI and managerial accounting practices, and reporting quality. Quantitative models using structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed to analyze the direct and indirect relationships between the variables. Results The results indicate that integrating AI technologies with management accounting does not necessarily lead to a direct increase in trust in banks. Rather, this is achieved through high-quality financial reporting, which acts as an intermediary between technological advancement and trust building. While banks strive to generate strong internal key performance indicators (KPIs) and functional accuracy, these should be disseminated clearly to gain the trust of customers and investors. Practical Implications The researchers’ findings, which focus on integrating artificial intelligence with management accounting, do not directly increase trust in banks. Rather, this effect is mediated by high-quality financial reporting. Therefore, it is essential for the studied government banks to focus on producing accurate and clear performance indicators and publishing them transparently to enhance their credibility and gain the trust of customers and investors. Originality/Value This study makes a pivotal contribution to academic literature and adds to the limited body of research on the integration of artificial intelligence, management accounting, financial reporting, and trust in banks.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-104/v1?src=rss">Building High-Performing Workforces: The Joint Influence of Digital Experience and Organizational Culture via Employee Engagement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Rapid digital transformation and evolving organizational environments have increased the importance of understanding how workplace technologies and cultural conditions influence employee behavior and performance. Digital Employee Experience (DEX) and Organizational Culture are increasingly recognized as critical organizational resources that shape employees’ psychological states, particularly Employee Engagement, which subsequently drives individual performance. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding how these factors simultaneously interact within highly regulated and operationally complex industries such as aviation. Methods This study employed a quantitative explanatory design using data collected from 340 employees of PT Garuda Indonesia (Persero) Tbk across five major directorates. A structured questionnaire measured DEX, Organizational Culture, Employee Engagement, and Employee Performance using validated reflective indicators. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test direct and mediating effects. The measurement model demonstrated strong reliability and validity, meeting thresholds for outer loadings, composite reliability, AVE, and discriminant validity. Results The findings indicate that both Digital Employee Experience and Organizational Culture have significant positive effects on Employee Engagement and Employee Performance. Employee Engagement emerged as the strongest predictor of performance and served as a significant mediator linking DEX and Organizational Culture to performance outcomes. The structural model showed substantial explanatory power, indicating that organizational and digital resources influence performance largely through their effects on employee psychological engagement. Conclusions The study provides empirical support for the Job Demands–Resources framework by demonstrating that digital work environments and strong organizational cultures function as key job resources that enhance engagement and, in turn, improve performance. For organizations particularly in the aviation sector investing in high-quality digital systems, strengthening cultural alignment, and fostering employee engagement are essential strategies for sustaining performance in the face of digital transformation. Future research should incorporate longitudinal designs and multi-source data to further validate these findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-103/v1?src=rss">Optimizing Early Compressive Strength of Ultrafine POFA-Based Green HSC: An Experimental and Modeling Approach with Silica Fume and Hybrid Fibers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Recently, studies have focused on producing green, sustainable concrete with improved environmental performance, utilizing recycled waste materials. The early compressive strength of Green High Strength Concrete (GHSC) containing up to 60% ultrafine palm oil fuel ash (UPOFA) has been optimized utilizing hybrid materials, Silica Fume (SF), steel fiber (ST), and Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) fiber. UPOFA was used as a substitute binder for cement in GHSC manufacture at 0%, 30%, and 60% replacement levels. SF was substituted for 0%, 10%, and 20% of the residual cement mass. Steel fiber and PET fiber were included at a rate of 1% of the total binder mass. The mix design parameters were optimized using the Response Surface Method (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD) approach. The experimental results showed that the GHSC containing 30% UPOFA, 20% SF, 1% ST, and 1% PET fiber reached greater strength at 3, 7, and 28 days. The incorporation of 20% SF, 1% ST, and 1% PET fibers enhanced the early ages strength reduction of 60% UPOFA-GHSC by 17%, 25%, and 18% at 3, 7, and 28 days, respectively, relative to the control mix. The constructed models showed significant correlation values (R2) of 0.9697, 0.9546, and 0.9674 for compressive strength at 3, 7, and 28 days, respectively. Hence, RSM may be an efficient technique for improving mix design while lowering environmental impact by limiting waste volume and energy usage in cement manufacture, which contributes to the sustainability of concrete.

                Casto et al. systematically examine language-responsive regions of the cerebellum with precision fMRI. They find one region that closely resembles the neocortical language network in its selectivity for language and response to linguistic manipulations. They also find three mixed-selective regions that respond to language but also to non-linguistic inputs.

                Salvador, Golynker, et al. discuss anatomical and functional principles of intestinal interoception. They explore how environmental factors impact interoceptive signaling, how interoceptive dysfunction contributes to disease pathogenesis, and how molecular enhancement of interoceptive function may restore organismal homeostasis.

                Ning et al. show that macaque prefrontal neurons encode remembered spatial locations along with uncertainty and combine them with cues, such as trial history and arousal, to generate a meta-working-memory signal guiding opt-out decisions. The findings reveal how the prefrontal cortex integrates multiple components for metacognitive judgments of working memory.

                Sun et al. identify a mechanosensitive pathway linking ECM stiffness to neuroblastoma cell migration. Rigid ECM drives NB cell migration by enhancing post-mitotic NPC assembly and transport via the lamin A/C/E2F4/PLK1 axis. Furthermore, clinical data suggest targeting NPC function as a potential therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104719">A titin missense variant drives atrial electrical remodeling and is associated with atrial fibrillation</a></h4>

              
                Rare and common genetic variants contribute to the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). Although ion channels were among the first AF candidate genes identified, rare loss-of-function variants in structural genes, such as <i>TTN</i>, have also been implicated in AF pathogenesis, partly through the development of atrial myopathy; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. While <i>TTN</i> truncating variants (<i>TTN</i>tvs) have been causally linked to arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy syndromes, the role of missense variants (mvs) remains unclear. We show that rare <i>TTNmvs</i> are associated with worse clinical outcomes in a single-center ethnic minority clinical cohort and uncover a pathogenic mechanism by which the T32756I variant drives AF. Modeling the <i>TTN</i>-T32756I variant using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-aCMs) revealed that the mutant cells display aberrant contractility, increased activity of a cardiac potassium channel (KCNQ1, Kv7.1), and dysregulated calcium homeostasis without compromising the sarcomeric integrity of the atrial cardiomyocytes. We also show that a titin-binding protein, the Four-and-a-Half Lim domains 2 (FHL2), has increased binding with KCNQ1 and its modulatory subunit KCNE1 in the <i>TTN-</i>T32756I-iPSC-aCMs, enhancing the slow delayed rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>ks</sub>). Suppression of FHL2 in mutant iPSC-aCMs normalized the <i>I</i><sub>ks</sub>, supporting FHL2 as an <i>I</i><sub>ks</sub> modulator. Our findings demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution in titin not only impairs its function but also remodels ion channels, contributing to AF. These findings underscore the importance of high-throughput screening to assess the pathogenicity of <i>TTN</i>mvs and establish a mechanistic connection between titin, potassium ion channels, and sarcomeric proteins, which may represent a novel therapeutic target.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107053">Feedback of peripheral saccade targets to early foveal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Human vision is characterized by frequent eye movements and constant shifts in visual input, yet our perception of the world remains remarkably stable. Here, we directly demonstrate image-specific foveal feedback to primary visual cortex in the context of saccadic eye movements. To this end, we used a gaze-contingent fMRI paradigm, in which peripheral saccade targets disappeared before they could be fixated. Despite no direct foveal stimulation, we were able to decode peripheral saccade targets from foveal retinotopic areas, demonstrating that image-specific feedback during saccade preparation may underlie this effect. Decoding was sensitive to shape but not semantic category of natural images, indicating feedback of only low-to-mid-level information. Cross-decoding to a control condition with foveal stimulus presentation indicates a shared representational format between foveal feedback and direct stimulation. Moreover, eccentricity-dependent analyses showed a U-shaped decoding curve, confirming that these results are not explained by spillover of peripheral activity or large receptive fields. Finally, fluctuations in foveal decodability covaried with activity in the intraparietal sulcus, thus providing a candidate region for driving foveal feedback. These findings suggest that foveal cortex predicts the features of incoming stimuli through feedback from higher cortical areas, which offers a candidate mechanism underlying stable perception.

">Serial Dependence operates on categorical rather than physical representations: evidence from behavior and EEG</a></h4>

              
                Our environment is constantly changing but our perception is stable. This stability may result from the integration of successive visual images that smooths over spurious variations in input. Such a process manifests in a behavioral phenomenon called Serial Dependence (SD), an attractive bias between successive stimuli. Here we questioned whether SD originates from physical stimulus representations or at a higher level, that of categorical perception. We constructed face morphs from three prototypes of the same face expressing anger, fear and sadness. We measured the perceived similarity between each pair of morphs with an odd-one-out experiment, to build a behavioral representational similarity matrix. Emotional expressions were perceived categorically. Subjects then reproduced the perceived facial expression of successively presented morphs by adjusting a response cue while their cerebral activity was recorded with EEG. We showed attractive serial dependence tuned to perceptual distance rather than physical similarity. We used representational similarity analysis to discover the geometry of the mental representation of faces, to capture both the information represented in a neural signal and its format. EEG representational similarity analyses showed that neural responses encoded emotional ambiguity rather than category membership, with near-prototypical faces eliciting similar patterns across emotions. Models combining feature tuning with categorical structure best accounted for behavioral biases. Neural signals also carried traces of past stimuli. Stimuli for which memory-based representations diverged most from sensory representations showed the strongest attractive serial dependence.

">Unique and overlapping behavioral effects of isoform-specific NRXN1 deletions across development</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the human neurexin 1 (NRXN1) gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. Vertebrate NRXN1 produces three major NRXN1 isoforms, named , {beta}, and {gamma}. Human genetic data suggests that deletions located at the 5' region of the gene disrupting the  isoform associate mostly with clinical behavioral deficits. Yet, 3' deletions that disrupt multiple isoforms have also been identified in clinical cases. Whether deletions that selectively affect specific NRXN1 isoforms result in specific behavioral deficits remains unclear. Here, we show that zebrafish harboring gene deletions that differentially encompass nrxn1a-, -{beta}, and/or -{gamma} display both unique and overlapping locomotion, sensorimotor behavior, and social behavior deficits. Combined, our results strongly support a model by which domain selective nrxn1 deletions predict behavioral phenotypes. Moreover, our results demonstrate compelling relationships between genotype and resulting behavioral phenotypes, providing functional insights into the complexity of NRXN1-associated neuropsychiatric behaviors.

">Comparative effects of inactivation and dopamine receptor agents in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum on performance of action sequences in rats</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: Recent research on habits and skills has produced a wave of new theories regarding the shift in control from medial to lateral regions of the dorsal striatum, and how these regions are implicated in the selected and executed of action sequences. Objectives: To examine the comparative effects of muscimol/baclofen inactivation and dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agents in the dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral (DLS) striatum on the performance of skilled action sequences. Methods: Infusions were made in well-trained rats using the five-step nose poke task to isolate the effects on initiation, execution and termination components of skilled action sequences. Results: DLS inactivation produced sequencing deficits like those observed with pre-training lesions, indicating that the DLS is critical for both the acquisition and performance of sequences. Behaviour was unchanged following DMS inactivation, consistent with models of DMS disengagement following training. Infusions of D1 and D2 antagonists did not alter behaviour, however the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole increased sequence errors at a low dose and reduced sequences at the high dose in the DLS. DLS manipulations impaired sequence initiation and termination as well as reward transitions, while the 'chunking' ballistic response pattern was largely unaltered, indicating that between- but not within-sequence actions rely on the DLS. Conclusions: Skilled action sequencing, including 'chunk' transitions was dependent on DLS and its modulation by D2 receptors, but not on DMS function. Using a novel sequencing task, these results support the dissociable and dopamine-dependent role of the dorsal striatum subregions in performing skilled motor actions.

">Divergent co-transmission by a predictive motor circuit modulates auditory processing.</a></h4>

              
                During behavior, an animals' movements often stimulate its own sensory receptors. For instance, whether during flight or the production of courtship song, when flies beat their wings they cause mechanosensory disturbances that activate primary auditory neurons in the antennae. However, flight and courtship occur under very different behavioral contexts and temporal-scales. As a consequence, the nervous system contains predictive motor circuits that modify sensory processing in anticipation of self-induced (re-afferent) stimulation. However, it is unclear how information about planned movements can be used to effectively tune specialized sensory processing circuits. Here we describe a predictive motor circuit that releases two transmitters to differentially modify auditory neurons that process sound under different behavioral contexts. In Drosophila, two metathoracic ascending histamine neurons (MtAHNs) become active prior to wing movement and project to the primary auditory network. We found that the MtAHNs co-transmit the neuropeptide Dh44 and histamine, and each suppresses the activity of auditory neurons that are integrated into distinct networks that support escape and courtship, respectively. Additionally, Dh44 has a greater impact on male auditory neurons and suppression by Dh44 occurs over a longer time course than histamine. Disrupting either histamine synthesis or neuropeptide release by the MtAHNs reduces courtship success with an increase in cessation during the wing extension step. Consistent with a role in auditory processing of courtship cues, Dh44 cotransmission is present in Drosophila species that have an auditory component to their courtship displays, but is absent in species that use either purely visual courtship or lack apparent courtship behavior. Finally, the projections of the MtAHNs into auditory centers were missing in snow flies, which are wingless. Our results indicate that divergent cotransmission by predictive motor circuits may represent an efficient means to differentially modulate sensory subnetworks impacted by reafferent feedback.

">Deeper neuronal and glial proteomic insights using an optimized pipeline for proximity labeling proteomics</a></h4>

              
                Proximity-based proteomics using TurboID has enabled cell-type specific profiling without the need for cell purification, although major bottlenecks in sample lysis, biotinylated protein enrichment, digestion, and mass spectrometry (MS) parameters have limited depth of proteome coverage. Here, we systematically optimized these variables using TurboID based labeling of BV2 microglia in vitro and brain astrocytes in vivo to define conditions that maximize proteome coverage. In microglia, the optimized protocol using 8 M urea lysis with on-bead S-Trap digestion and data-independent acquisition MS (DIA-MS) identified 4,016 proteins, double the depth of prior studies, and revealed metabolic, ribosomal, lipid-processing, autophagy, and trafficking signatures. Brain astrocyte proteomes were best recovered using SDS lysis with S-Trap digestion and DIA-MS, yielding a proteome of over 3,600 highly enriched proteins, twice the depth of prior astrocyte-TurboID studies. The expanded astrocyte proteomes captured canonical astrocyte markers as well as membrane-associated, vesicular trafficking, and presynaptic protein signatures, consistent with labeling of astrocyte neuron interface regions, including proteins involved in receptor signaling, lipid metabolism, and plasticity at tripartite synapses, and several AD risk proteins. The increased peptide recovery following S-Trap digestion allowed the reduction of starting material to 20 ug protein for DIA-MS, and enabled multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT-MS) proteomics using even smaller samples. When applied to synaptosomes enriched from mouse brains with neuronal TurboID labeling, our pipeline identified a synapse-specific proteome of 2,529 proteins, revealing synaptic, mitochondrial and disease-relevant signatures not detectable in prior studies. By tackling critical bottlenecks from tissue processing to MS, our optimized pipelines enable cell-type and compartment-specific proximity-labeling proteomics to obtain comprehensive biological and disease-relevant insights across various biological fields.

">Human basal radial glia morphotypes are transcriptionally distinct and exhibit different cell fate determination</a></h4>

              
                Basal radial glia (bRG) are key neural progenitors driving human neocortical expansion. They exhibit remarkable morphological heterogeneity, yet the stability and functional significance of their distinct morphotypes remains unclear. Using human cortical brain organoids combined with long-term live imaging and morphology-resolved spatial transcriptomics (CellShape-seq), we show that bRG morphotypes display distinct morphodynamic behaviors, proliferative capacities and transcriptional profiles. While bifurcated bRG remodel extensively during mitosis to produce morphologically diverse progeny, multipolar cells are most morphologically flexible during interphase. Multipolar bRG further show the greatest proliferative capacity and the transcriptional signature related to progenitor state. Bifurcated bRG are least proliferative and are enriched for the multifunctional gene expression regulator YBX1. Pharmacological inhibition of YBX1 depletes bifurcated bRG, reduces neurogenesis, and promotes glial commitment. Our findings link progenitor morphology, gene expression and fate, providing a framework for understanding the cellular logic of human cortical development.

">EEG dynamics in Lewy body diseases is related to clinical fluctuations and degeneration of locus coeruleus</a></h4>

              
                This work investigates aperiodic bursts of neuronal activity, referred to as neuronal avalanches, which are thought to support flexible information processing in Lewy body (LB) disease. We compared avalanche-derived features across LB disease phenotypes (prodromal dementia with LB and Parkinson's disease, PD), with healthy controls (HC). Based on the premise that focal neurodegeneration alters whole-brain dynamics, we examined whether the "richness" of brain dynamics was associated with clinical symptoms and with the microstructural integrity of catecholaminergic nuclei - the right caudal locus coeruleus (rcLC) and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The sample comprised 30 HC, 56 cognitively normal individuals with core clinical features of dementia with LB (CN-CCF), 34 individuals with mild cognitive impairment with LB (MCI-LB), and 30 advanced PD patients. Neuronal avalanches were extracted from source-reconstructed resting-state EEG and described by their count, the number of unique spatial patterns (flexibility), hemispheric symmetry of flexibility, and avalanche transition matrices. LC and SNpc integrity were assessed using neuromelanin-sensitive MRI and free-water diffusion imaging, respectively. Lewy body disease groups exhibited increased flexibility relative to HC, which was, in prodromal groups, associated with cognitive fluctuations and REM sleep behavior disorder symptoms, but not parkinsonism. Flexibility was negatively related to rcLC integrity, which was lowest in MCI-LB. These findings suggest that elevated flexibility reflects dysregulated brain dynamics linked to malignant non-motor features of LB diseases and to the caudal LC involvement.

">Neuronal microscale biophysical instability mediates macroscale network dynamics shaping pathological manifestations</a></h4>

              
                Microscale biophysical alterations in neuronal dynamics can have profound implications for macroscale pathological outcomes in the brain. Despite the critical need to link neuronal perturbations to large-scale disease manifestations, few studies successfully bridge these hierarchical scales. Here, we bridge microscale biophysical variability within neuronal dynamics to macroscale disease-related phenotypes. We find that Drosophila models expressing tauopathy- and epilepsy-associated molecular mutations exhibit increased dynamic instability in the timing of action potential initiation. We show that the microscale biophysical origin of this instability is enhanced variability in voltage-gated sodium channel currents during non-stationary channel inactivation. We also find that treatment with antiepileptic drugs stabilizes neuronal dynamics by modulating this variability in voltage-gated sodium channel currents. Finally, we show that neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy exhibit analogous dynamic instability, which is reversible by administration of antiepileptic medications. Our results highlight how subtle microscale neuronal instabilities propagate and are amplified to produce macroscopic pathological phenotypes, providing new biophysical insights into neurological disorders and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention.

">Opposite Effects of Alpha Oscillations on Mind-Wandering With Eyes Open and Closed</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity underlie mind-wandering, when mental experience sometimes becomes unrelated to what we are currently doing. Mind-wandering research has investigated ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha frequency band (7-14 Hz), thought to reflect changes in arousal and attention. However, studies disagree whether alpha power increases or decreases while mind-wandering compared to focused attention. We hypothesized that these opposite effects arise from differences in eye state across studies, as eye closure increases alpha power and can reverse its relationship to sleepiness, which is itself related to mind-wandering. To test this, we recorded EEG while male and female participants with eyes either open or closed were probed to report whether they were focused on the auditory attention task or mind-wandering, as well as how sleepy they were. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that increased alpha power made both mind-wandering and sleepiness reports more likely in the eyes-open group but less likely in the eyes-closed group. A systematic review of past literature largely replicated these opposite relationships across eye states in different paradigms. We propose that these results reflect an inverted-U relationship between alpha power and mind-wandering, formed by a positive relationship at low alpha power values typical of eyes-open states and a negative relationship at high alpha power values typical of eyes-closed states. By sampling alpha power across eye states in the same paradigm, this work reconciles contradictions in prior literature and clarifies how ongoing neural oscillations reflect the stream of mental experiences.

                Are there individuals who resist episodic memory decline into older age? Analyzing 728,000 memory tests from 80,000 participants with at least 4 assessments, we introduce a simulation-calibrated framework to identify genuine memory stability. Across cohorts and models, ~10% of adults [&ge;]70 years showed stable performance over a decade. In an MRI subgroup (n{approx}2,000), stable performers exhibited lower rates of brain atrophy across widespread regions, anchoring cognitive stability in structural brain maintenance. However, stability was often transient rather than trait-like: many individuals followed trajectories with extended plateaus of stable performance punctuated by episodes of accelerated decline. Accordingly, 54% showed at least one period of observed stability, averaging 10 years, whereas only 0.4% upheld stable performance over 24 years under the strictest definition. These findings are consistent with a complex-systems model of cognitive aging in which decline often reflects critical transitions rather than continuous erosion.

">Signal space beamforming for gain- and geometry-independent interference suppression in wearable MEG</a></h4>

              
                Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) for wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer substantial flexibility compared to cryogenic MEG, but they also introduce new challenges related to environmental noise and movement artefacts. State-of-the-art denoising techniques such as signal space separation require not only dense OPM arrays but also the fine calibration of sensor gain and geometry. This may complicate their use in complex experimental situations involving uncooperative patients or subjects such as newborns or fetuses, where OPM positioning may be unstable or plain unknown. To address this limitation, we introduce signal space beamforming (SSB), a version of beamforming applied to sensor signals and designed to suppress interferences independently of sensor gain and geometry. We show that SSB operates via a trade-off between noise suppression and neural signal preservation that is controlled by a single soft-threshold parameter, which we calibrated using phantom measurements. We then validated the effectiveness of SSB across several datasets. Using interictal OPM-MEG recordings in epileptic patients, SSB successfully cleaned signals while preserving epileptiform discharges. Moving onto cutting-edge early neurodevelopmental OPM-MEG recordings, SSB allowed to recover auditory evoked responses in newborns and fetuses similar to previous findings but with more streamlined preprocessing and higher response amplitude in the case of the fetal data. We contend that SSB provides a pragmatic solution to exploit OPM-MEG data recorded in challenging conditions where geometry-dependent methods cannot be used, opening new frontiers for pioneering clinical and fundamental applications of the OPM technology.

">A HISTORY OF ADOLESCENT OXYCODONE SELF-ADMINISTRATION: NEURAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS</a></h4>

              
                Maturation of the prefrontal cortex and higher-order cognitive processes is ongoing through adolescence and young adulthood; developmental periods associated with the nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Initiation of oxycodone (OXY) self-administration during adolescence induces long-term dose-dependent impairments in neurobehavioral and neurocognitive development. To date, however, the neural mechanisms underlying neurocognitive impairments induced by adolescent prescription opioid use disorder (APOUD) have not been systematically evaluated. A DiOlistic labeling technique, in concert with sophisticated neuronal reconstruction software, revealed a prominent sex- and dose-dependent population shift in the morphological parameters of dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of rodents with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration relative to their control counterparts. Similarly, the biochemical mechanisms underlying dendritic spine dysmorphology, which were investigated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, were dependent upon biological sex. In male rodents, a dose-dependent decrease in mRNA expression of GRIN1, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, was observed in animals with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration relative to controls. In contrast, female rats with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration exhibited increased mRNA expression of cdk5, a protein kinase involved in the regulation of pre- and post-synaptic function; a transcriptional alteration that may result from excessive glutamate accumulation. Fundamentally, transcriptional dysregulation and dendritic spine dysmorphology mechanistically underlie, at least partly, APOUD-induced neurocognitive impairments. Collectively, results support that sex-dependent glutamatergic dysregulation may underlie dendritic spine dysmorphology in the ACC resulting in APOUD-induced neurocognitive impairments. Glutamatergic dysregulation, therefore, may afford a key target for the development of novel therapeutics.

">Clonazepam activates the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) ion channel</a></h4>

              
                Benzodiazepines represent a major class of drugs prescribed as treatments for anxiety, insomnia and seizures. They act by engaging GABAA receptors in the central nervous system to depress neuronal excitability. Here, the polypharmacology of benzodiazepines was explored by studying their engagement of human TRP channels revealing clonazepam acts as a robust and selective activator of the TRPM8 ion channel. Clonazepam-evoked Ca2+ signals were observed in cells expressing human TRPM8 channels, and in mouse trigeminal neurons. These responses were completely blocked by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of TRPM8 function. This discovery likely explains why clonazepam is an effective treatment for the painful oral condition known as burning mouth disorder, where local activation of TRPM8 channels in sensory neurons mitigates the painful symptoms of this disease.

">Structural Brain Indicators of Cognitive Performance in Middle and Late Adulthood: The Human Connectome Project in Aging/Aging Adult Brain Connectome Cohort</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Significant effort has been put towards mapping patterns of atrophy in the cerebral cortex that are related to pathological aging, including the characteristic patterns of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast, brain structural patterns that support preserved or even exceptional cognition throughout the adult age-span and especially in later life are much less known. It is possible that superior cognitive performance in late life is supported by a preservation of brain structures vulnerable to typical aging. Alternatively, elevated performance could be related to preservation of brain regions vulnerable to age-associated pathology. Examination of individuals that exhibit superior cognition throughout the adult lifespan may provide unique insights into neural mechanisms that support cognitive resilience in late life. Methods: We examined cross-sectional associations between cortical brain structure and cognitive performance across three stages of adulthood: midlife (36-59), young-old (60-79), and older adults (80+) in typically aging individuals enrolled as part of the Human Connectome Project Lifespan-Aging (HCP-A)/Aging Adult Brain Connectome (AABC) studies. Participants were considered generally healthy and excluded for significant and/or atypical health conditions for their demographic category, including a clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment or dementia. Domain-specific cognitive factor scores representing memory, fluid intelligence, and crystalized intelligence were sex-stratified and residualized relative to age, and participants were classified as high, middle, or low performers based on their unique performance relative to the study sample. Results: In the full sample, high performers demonstrated greater cortical thickness in regions of somatomotor, visual, and auditory cortices, as well as cortical areas in the frontal, parietal, and insular cortices (e.g., 5m, LIPv, MBelt). We also found associations between medial temporal and cingulate cortical thickness and cognitive performance, but only for select analyses. Group differences in cortical thickness were greatest when contrasting high and low performers for fluid intelligence compared to the other cognitive factors and were most prominent in the midlife participants compared to the other age strata. These group differences were primarily driven by reduced cortical thickness in the low performing individuals in the younger age bins relative to the 'typically' performing sample. Effects were rather limited when contrasting high and low performers in the 80+ age group. The cortical areas of high statistical significance appeared to show a cross-sectional convergence effect, such that the differences in cortical thickness between high vs. low cognitive performance groups diminished with increasing age. Despite lower statistical power, effect sizes were greatest when contrasting individuals at the extremes of performance (e.g., top 10% vs. bottom 10% performers). These effects were robust to subsample replications using longitudinally defined cognitive classifications. Discussion: Elevated cognitive performance was cross-sectionally associated with increased regional cortical thickness and effects were most prominent in mid-life compared to later ages. Notably, contrary to brain regions that may be expected to support such high-order cognitive performance, a significant portion of primary sensory, motor, and insular cortical areas exhibited group differences between the high- and low-performing groups in this relatively younger age group. Group differences were due to lower thickness in these regions in the low performing group relative to the typical performers. In contrast to the younger portion of the sample, regions typically considered vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (i.e., regions in the medial temporal lobe) were only infrequently implicated. These results suggest that specific patterns of cortical brain structural integrity including preserved thickness of primary motor and sensory cortical regions may be a necessary but not sufficient mechanism supporting superior cognitive abilities in earlier adulthood, while alternate neural mechanisms may support cognitive resilience later in life. These results must be interpreted with caution given the cross-sectional nature of this study. Cognitive capacity can only be estimated from a single timepoint, and several factors contribute to inter-individual variation that will not be accounted for in the models applied here. Longitudinal assessment of cognitive resilience in the HCP-A/AABC cohort will be performed in future work.

">Microstate Dynamics of Focused Attention Meditation</a></h4>

              
                Focused-attention meditation provides a tractable model for examining how large-scale brain dynamics support attention and self-regulation. Using high-density EEG microstate analysis, we investigated how focused-attention meditation on the breath (Anapanasati) modulates intrinsic brain activity in 22 experienced practitioners, compared with baseline rest and deliberate mental imagery. Five canonical microstate classes (A-E) were identified. Meditation produced a robust reduction of Microstate C across coverage, duration, and occurrence, accompanied by increased presence of Microstates D and E (all Microstate x Condition interactions p < 0.0001). Source localization revealed that Microstate C was generated primarily in medial and lateral temporal regions including the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, whereas Microstate D involved posterior midline regions including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and Microstate E engaged frontoparietal and orbitolimbic networks. Together, these results indicate that focused-attention meditation reorganizes the temporal architecture of large-scale brain dynamics by downregulating microstate patterns associated with self-referential and memory-based processing while enhancing neural states supporting attentional stability and internal monitoring.

">Reduced GABAB receptor activation and post activation depression of proprioceptive afferents after spinal cord injury.</a></h4>

              
                Despite a long history of studying presynaptic inhibition of the Ia afferent synapse that produces the monosynaptic EPSP on motoneurons, recent evidence has upset the conventional idea that GABAA receptors mediate this inhibition and instead suggests that there are mainly GABAB receptors at this synapse. However, without targeted access to the GABAergic neurons that activate these receptors, quantifying their functional contribution to presynaptic inhibition has proven difficult. We demonstrate here that focal optogenetic activation of terminals of a subpopulation of GAD2+ GABAergic neurons that exclusively project ventrally to Ia afferent synapses produce long-lasting presynaptic inhibition that is entirely mediated by GABAB receptors and simultaneously produces a characteristic brief GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP on the motoneurons. These ventral GAD2 neurons are recurrently activated by Ia afferents, contributing to post-activation depression with repeated afferent reflex testing, with a similar long time-course to post-activation depression of the H-reflex induced in humans from either repetitive activation of the same Ia afferents or from antagonist nerve conditioning. In contrast, focal activation of dorsally projecting GAD2 neurons does not directly cause presynaptic inhibition or postsynaptic IPSPs but does produce primary afferent depolarization. Following chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), the expression of GABAB receptors on the Ia terminal is halved, and in mice and humans, is associated with a similar decrease of GABAB receptor-mediated post-activation depression of Ia-EPSPs transmission, which is reversed by the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen. In summary, GABAB receptors mediate presynaptic inhibition, but are down regulated with SCI, contributing to reflex hyperexcitability associated with spasticity.

">Time-frequency embedding with contrastive pre-training allows sub-second seizure detection</a></h4>

              
                Rapid and accurate detection of electrographic seizures is critical for both clinical diagnosis and neuroscience research. Although seizure identification is commonly performed in the time domain, analysis in the time-frequency domain provides a more comprehensive representation of seizure characteristics. In this study, we present a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that incorporates a trainable continuous wavelet transform (CWT) layer, enabling adaptive time-frequency feature learning directly from raw EEG. To address common data challenges, we augment the 3D CNN for pre-training with contrastive learning, comparing contrastive predictive coding (CPC) against bidirectional contrastive learning (BiCL). On single-channel and multi-channel data, the standard 3D CNN outperformed both a 2D CNN with pre-computed CWT and a 1D CNN that processes raw signals, achieving >95% accuracy down to 0.5-second segments. Compared to the standard 3D CNN, the 3D CNN with BiCL pre-training showed superior performance in both low-data and class imbalance scenarios. Further experiments involving band-pass filtering and temporal shuffling revealed that classification is driven primarily by low-frequency patterns and statistical features rather than temporal dependencies. The proposed framework also maintained >90% accuracy with moderate noise and downsampling applied to inputs, as well as when cross-subject generalization was evaluated using held-out subjects. We show that a 3D CNN with a trainable CWT layer and BiCL pre-training enables accurate sub-second seizure detection and effectively mitigates data limitations common in clinical settings. This work demonstrates that time-frequency embedding within CNNs, augmented by self-supervised pre-training, offers a promising path toward architectures for sub-second seizure detection in the presence of practical limitations of real-world scenarios.

                Tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau filaments, with disease-specific folds revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we delivered a recombinant human tau carrying the P301L/S320F double mutation into AppNL-G-F/MAPT double knock-in mice using a blood-brain-barrier-permeable AAV (AAV-PHP.eB), enabling rapid induction of tau aggregation in vivo. The mutant tau was systemically administered via retro-orbital injection, providing a minimally invasive approach for widespread neuronal transduction. Phosphorylated tau aggregation, as well as seeding activity, were observed without the need for exogenous seeds. Our cryo-EM analysis resolved a novel filament fold incorporating residues 279-329, in which the P301L and S320F mutations introduced stabilizing interactions that reinforced filament assembly. This conformation was distinct from previously reported folds, including Alzheimer and Pick tau filaments. Moreover, the filaments adopted a more compact architecture than those observed in patient-derived samples or other model mice. This finding demonstrates that P301L/S320F double-mutant tau adopts a structurally unique, highly aggregation-prone fold, and that this system provides a rapid platform for modeling tau filament formation.

">Reinforced Hippocampus-Accumbens pathway marks a shift towards cognitive decline in aging</a></h4>

              
                Aging triggers early functional alterations in brain circuits that precede cognitive impairment, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Spatial navigation and memory, among the earliest affected, depend on hippocampus and downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which integrates spatial and motivational information to guide goal directed behaviors. Here we identify age-related, sex-dependent changes of the dorsal hippocampus - NAc (dHPC - NAc) pathway. Combining optogenetics with electrophysiology, chemogenetics, and behavioral analyses in mice, we show that aging shifts excitation - inhibition balance in dorsal CA1 toward pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability, strengthening hippocampal outputs. This selectively enhances synaptic drive onto D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons and involves a previously unrecognized long-range parvalbumin-expressing glutamatergic projection. Reducing dHPC-NAc excitability improves memory in aged mice. In humans, fMRI reveals heightened posterior hippocampal activity and stronger pHPC-NAc coupling during navigation. Together, we uncover a targetable pathway acting in an intervention-sensitive window of aging to correct negative cognitive trajectories.

">Ventral pallidal perineuronal nets regulate opioid relapse</a></h4>

              
                Opioid use disorder remains a major health challenge worldwide. Neuronal activity in the ventral pallidum (VP) regulates opioid reward and relapse to opioid seeking but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. A sizable population of VP neurons previously linked to drug relapse expresses the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (VPPV). Across the brain parvalbumin neurons are often ensheathed by perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular structures that regulate intrinsic activity and constrain synaptic plasticity onto these neurons. The VP contains high levels of PNNs but the role of these structures in the neurophysiology of VPPV neurons and in relapse to opioid seeking has not been studied. To investigate whether VP PNNs are altered by opioid exposure, male and female mice were trained to self-administer intravenous heroin. We found that heroin increased the density of PNNs in the VP, and that an intracranial microinfusion of the PNN-degrading enzyme, chondroitinase ABC, prevented cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. VP PNN depletion also reduced the intrinsic excitability of VPPV neurons, potentiated inhibitory synaptic inputs onto these cells, and diminished Fos expression in VPPV neurons following reinstatement. The suppressive effect of VP PNN depletion on heroin seeking was rescued by chemogenetic activation of VPPV neurons and mimicked by chemogenetic VPPV neuron inhibition. Taken together, our results identify VPPV neurons and their associated PNNs as critical drivers of opioid seeking. Given the key role of PNNs in regulating neural plasticity and memory processes, targeting PNNs in the VP could provide a useful novel therapeutic avenue for treating persistent craving and relapse in opioid use disorder.

">Eye movements reveal the intuitive understanding of materials and their behavior</a></h4>

              
                Does a metal ball sink or float when dropped into water? Answering this intuitively simple question relies on our understanding of materials and their physics. Knowing materials helps us to recognize objects, estimate their properties, and predict how they will behave when interacting with other objects or materials. This leads to expectations about material behaviors already in young infants, for example, that a metal ball should sink in water. Typically, properties and affordances of materials have been studied with perceptual tasks. But even though explicit perceptual judgments allow us to identify important determinants of material understanding, it is not clear how they relate to dynamic predictions of material behavior - which we need for successful interactions with objects. Here, we tap into material understanding by leveraging anticipatory eye movements, which have been shown to be direct readouts of trajectory predictions and can also reflect expectations about material properties such as elasticity or mass. This allows us to reveal the temporal evolution of dynamic predictions based on material properties. Furthermore, by using novel stimuli that violate intuitive expectations about material behavior, we demonstrate that even though dynamic predictions can be learned over time, there remains a fundamental difference between predictions in line with and against our intuitive expectations.

">Selective impairment of long-term depression in accumbal D1-MSNs involves calcium-permeable AMPARs in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Early neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease emerge before cognitive decline, yet their synaptic basis remains poorly defined. Here we identify an early, cell-type-specific disruption of synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens during pre-plaque stages of disease. In APP/PS1 mice, intracellular amyloid-beta accumulation is associated with a selective loss of mGluR1/5-dependent long-term depression in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons, despite comparable intracellular amyloid-beta levels across neuronal subtypes. This impairment is accompanied by aberrant postsynaptic remodeling characterized by functional accumulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors and increased excitatory drive. These synaptic alterations coincide with reduced dopamine-dependent signaling and selective changes in reward-related behavior, including altered hedonic consumption. Together, these findings identify an early vulnerability of the mesolimbic reward system and suggest that non-cognitive manifestations of Alzheimer's disease arise from circuit-level imbalance before plaque deposition.

">Dying oligodendrocytes persist without mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                Myelin is an insulating, multi-layered membrane that supports axonal integrity and neural communication. Different stressors impair myelinating oligodendrocytes, leading to demyelination, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. The intracellular processes underlying oligodendrocyte degeneration and death are unclear. Here, using optically targeted DNA damage that causes single-cell demyelination, we reveal that injured mature oligodendrocytes lose mitochondria within days and persist without them for weeks to months before cell death. This differs from other oligodendrocyte lineage cells, which exhibit acute mitochondrial changes followed by rapid cell death. Conditional deletion of the mitochondrial-related gene, Fis1, in mature oligodendrocytes, similarly causes acute loss of mitochondria and prolonged cell death. The unique cell death is characterized by nuclear changes, intracellular stress, and markers of disease-associated oligodendrocytes. Thus, mitochondrial loss may be an early marker of oligodendrocyte pathology, and mitochondrial quality control is required for oligodendrocyte and myelin homeostasis.

">Deep Plasma Proteomics Coupled with Functional Genomics Reveals Drivers of Parkinson's Disease Progression and Levodopa Response</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder lacking disease-modifying therapies, and its management is limited by the absence of accessible biomarkers for disease progression and treatment response. We implemented an ultra-deep plasma proteomics workflow integrating Mag-Net extracellular vesicle enrichment with Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometry to profile longitudinal samples from PD patients. This approach quantified 6,481 plasma proteins, an unprecedented depth in PD studies, revealing distinct signatures associated with disease duration and dopaminergic therapy exposure. Candidate biomarkers were validated in an independent cohort using ELISA, demonstrating predictive utility in AI-driven models. To uncover mechanistic drivers, we intersected proteomic data with our new genome-wide overexpression screens for regulators of alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibril uptake, identifying MFN2, PSMD4, and EIF4G1 as major hubs that link systemic proteomic changes to mitochondrial dynamics and proteostasis. Additionally, a meta-analysis of brain transcriptomes responsive to Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment identified 42 candidate genes, including NDUFS4, GNAS, TSC1, and NTS, some of which are targets of approved therapeutics. Finally, an integrative network analysis revealed that key pathological hubs, such as IFNG and PLAT, are targets of approved pharmacological agents. Overall, these findings provide a systems-level resource for PD biomarker discovery and reveal druggable pathways for precision medicine strategies aimed at improving therapeutic outcomes.

">PRISME: A MATLAB Toolbox For Large Data-Driven Multimodal Power Benchmarking</a></h4>

              
                Low statistical power in neuroimaging often undermines research in the field, leading to missed effects, wasted resources, and reduced reproducibility. Performing power analyses during the study design phase is extremely important, but often prohibitively difficult due to a lack of analytical solutions and high computational costs. We present PRISME (Power Resampling Infrastructure for Statistical Method Evaluation), a MATLAB toolbox for neuroimaging power benchmarking. PRISME provides a computational framework for empirical power analysis independent of inference methods, enabling large scale power benchmarking and method comparison.The toolbox supports diverse neuroimaging data types, including both voxel-based activation and functional connectivity analyses, with a non-parametric, flexible algorithm and unified data representations. Furthermore, unlike previous empirical power approaches, PRISME supports multiple test types, such as association and difference tests with behavioral and clinical measures. Finally, PRISME's $25times$ speedup from algorithmic optimizations enables larger-scale power benchmarking, including the first power analysis for the ABCD dataset. Overall, PRISME is the first method- and data-type-agnostic power benchmarking tool for neuroimaging, providing a single solution for power analysis across diverse study designs.

">Multi-modal and multi-region distance model for neuroimaging: Application to ABCD study</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale neuroimaging studies often collect multiple modalities, such as task and resting-state functional MRI, diffusion MRI, and structural MRI. Joint inference across these modalities uses shared variation to improve statistical efficiency, increase replicability, and provide a more integrated view of brain-phenotype associations. In practice, however, such analyses are limited because complex cross-modality covariance cannot be flexibly modeled, which makes the resulting joint effects difficult to interpret. A recent distance-based ANOVA extension allows multimodal analysis and increases power for detecting group differences, but it cannot easily distinguish location from scale effects in distance space, offers only an omnibus pseudo-F test without interpretable parameters, and requires computationally intensive permutation inference. We propose a novel semiparametric, U-statistics-based Generalized Estimating Equation (UGEE) framework that unifies univariate and multivariate distance models. By regressing pairwise dissimilarities on covariates, this method yields interpretable regression coefficients that disentangle location and scale effects and quantify inter-modality differences, while flexibly accounting for correlations among modality distances. The estimator is based on efficient influence functions, ensuring asymptotic efficiency, robustness to misspecification, and computational scalability for large-scale data analysis. We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulations and analyses of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development dataset. Results show that UGEE accurately estimates modality, group, and interaction effects and achieves a 100-fold speed-up compared with permutation-based approaches. This framework provides a general and computationally efficient tool for semiparametric inference on multimodal data, particularly suited for large neuroimaging applications.

">A Gata4-Loxl2 Axis Controls ECM Remodeling to Enable Scar-Free Spinal Cord Regeneration in Zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury in mammals causes permanent loss of sensory and motor function due to scar formation obstructing axon regrowth. In contrast, zebrafish fully regenerate their spinal cord without lasting fibrosis. Here, we identify the transcription factor Gata4 as a key positive regulator of regeneration. After injury, gata4 expression is predominantly upregulated in ependymo-radial glial cells and in glial cells extending processes toward sites of tissue bridging. Gata4 preserves glial identity and orchestrates regenerative extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Gata4 loss biases glial cells toward a fibroblast-like state with upregulated Loxl2b, a collagen cross-linking enzyme, and can also increase Loxl2b in nearby non-glial cells. Excess Loxl2b activity promotes pathological crosslinking and formation of a rigid, fibrotic matrix impairing glial and axonal bridging across the lesion, greatly reducing motor recovery. Pharmacological inhibition of Loxl2b in gata4 mutants substantially rescues ECM organization, tissue bridging, and functional recovery. Injury-induced gata4 expression depends, at least in part, on Hif1 signaling and activation of a short injury responsive enhancer. We identify the Gata4 Loxl2b axis as a central regulator of and potential therapeutic target for scar-free spinal cord repair.

">A genetically defined midbrain-pontine circuit gates vocal communication</a></h4>

              
                Vocal communication is selectively expressed in social and emotional contexts, suggesting the presence of neural substrates that gate the conversion of internal states into vocal motor output. Although the periaqueductal gray (PAG) is known to be essential for vocalization, the genetic identity and circuit logic of the neurons that initiate and shape vocal signals remain unclear. Here, we identify a genetically defined population of somatostatin-expressing neurons in the lateral and ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG SST ) that functions as a premotor gate for ultrasonic vocalizations in mice. In vivo calcium imaging shows that l/vlPAG SST neurons are selectively recruited around vocal onset. Manipulating l/vlPAG SST neuron activity bidirectionally regulates vocal output: activation prolongs call duration by coordinating respiratory, laryngeal, and orofacial motor programs, whereas silencing suppresses courtship vocalizations. Projection specific manipulations further demonstrate that descending glutamatergic, but not neuropeptidergic, output from l/vlPAG SST neurons to the dorsal pontine tegmentum is sufficient to drive vocal production. Together, these findings define a genetically specified midbrain pontine circuit that gates vocal communication and provides prospective access for linking internal conditions to vocal expressions.

">A neuronal pathway for the supraspinal relay of warm and cool sensation</a></h4>

              
                Cutaneous thermosensation is a fundamental sense allowing discrimination of external temperature changes and driving adaptive responses essential for survival and well-being. This sensory process begins with the activation of peripheral thermoreceptors, which encode the quality and intensity of thermal stimuli into neuronal activity that is further integrated by spinal cord circuits and relayed to supraspinal centres through the anterolateral tract (ALT). While classical experiments identified thermal responsive ALT neurons in the superficial spinal dorsal horn, the functional logic of innocuous temperature relay remains poorly understood. We show that, in mice, the majority of Phox2a-lineage lamina I ALT are selectively tuned to innocuous warming or cooling, and receive direct inputs from peripheral thermoreceptors. Their genetic ablation, chemogenetic or optogenetic manipulation impaired temperature discrimination. Our findings contrast with the previous finding that the majority of ALT neurons being mechano- and thermo-nociceptive and provide novel evidence for the existence of a large ensemble of genetically defined warming- and cooling- responsive ALT neurons. The large representation of innocuous temperature in supraspinal-relaying ALT neurons indicates substantial spinal amplification of thermal information and underscores the importance of innocuous thermosensation in the ascending sensory pathway.

">A fast and simple algorithm for accurate spike detection in HD-MEA recordings</a></h4>

              
                Background: High density microelectrode arrays provide a strong platform to study individual neuronal activity and neuronal network dynamics. However, the analysis of high volume and complex data present several challenges. Common spike detection methods based on Root-Mean-Square (RMS) threshold crossing underestimate the number of spikes during neuronal bursting, which frequently occurs in neuronal cultures. In addition, the detection of action potentials by multiple electrodes makes spikes sorting a computationally expensive task. New Method: We optimized a previously described detection method, based on the scaled median of absolute deviations (MED) that is more accurate during high rates of neuronal firing. In addition, we added a step to de-duplicate (DP) spikes recorded on multiple electrodes, which enhanced the accuracy of MED. The combined method of detection and de-duplication (DP-MED) is less computationally expensive and easier to implement than popular sorting alternatives like Kilosort-4. Results and Conclusions: During burst periods, the MED-based method detected over half of spikes that were undetected by the RMS-based method. To evaluate the performance of DP-MED, we simulated data that emulates neuronal activity recorded with HD-MEA. Across increasing firing rates, DP-MED shows more precision than Kilosort-4 but is slightly less accurate. After inducing high firing rate in cortical cultures with pharmacological stimulation, DP-MED detected a similar number of spikes than Kilosort-4, however, the analysis in Kilosort-4 was 40-fold more time-consuming. These results highlight the effectiveness of the DP-MED method in the context of drug screening using HD-MEAs.

Using multi-plex <span style="font-style:italic;">in situ</span> labeling across cortical layers and cell types, we found that layer 6 pyramidal neurons (L6-PNs) are highly enriched in diverse transcripts for nAChR subunits and muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs). <span style="font-style:italic;">In vivo</span> optogenetic activation of BFCN axons revealed persistent modulation of regular spiking units in L2-6 but a rapid phasic activation only in L6. In acute slices, optogenetic activation of BFCN axons elicited fast nAChR-mediated excitatory post-synaptic potentials in L6-PNs, comparable to responses in L1-INs, and slower mAChR-mediated inhibitory responses. These findings identify L1-INs and excitatory L6-PNs as two major hubs for BFCN modulation of cortical circuits. By recruiting distinct receptor mechanisms and circuit motifs in L1 and L6, BFCNs may engage parallel pathways of cholinergic control that couple fast, transient modulation with slower, sustained regulation to shape cortical perception and plasticity.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Theoretical models suggest that loneliness may be linked to abnormal social information processing and reduced emotion regulation capacity; yet these effects have mostly been investigated using self-report methods. Therefore, the current preregistered study examined whether loneliness is associated with objective and subjective markers of bottom-up emotional reactivity and cognitive reappraisal efficiency in a cohort of 150 young adults (18–35 years old) recruited to reflect the distribution of loneliness scores in the Polish population. Participants completed an emotion processing and regulation task with both social and nonsocial stimuli while their electroencephalography activity was recorded. Contrary to the hypotheses, when faced with socio-affective stimuli, lonelier individuals did not exhibit abnormal markers of early sensory processing, late sustained processing, or decreased efficiency in reappraisal use, as indicated by event-related potential markers. Only a weak association between loneliness and an increased P300 response to negative vs. neutral social stimuli was found. This pattern of findings did not align with subjective arousal reports, which suggested a decreased response to negative social stimuli and reduced cognitive reappraisal efficiency in lonelier participants. These results suggest that loneliness is linked to disruptions in emotional self-awareness rather than an abnormal response to socio-affective stimuli.</span>

                <p>The growing therapeutic promise of repeated, low-dose ketamine treatment across various psychopathologies&mdash;including depression and drug addiction&mdash;warrants clarity on its potential addictive properties and their associated mechanisms in both sexes. Accordingly, the present work examined the effects of intermittent low-dose ketamine in male and female rats on behavioral sensitization to the locomotor-activating effects of ketamine, as well as associated molecular profiles in dopamine D1- and D2-receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1- and D2-MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Following intra-NAc infusion of a Cre-inducible RiboTag virus, locomotor activity was measured in adult Drd1a-iCre and Drd2-iCre male and female rats in either diestrus or proestrus following repeated administration of ketamine (0, 10, or 20&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) to evaluate the development of locomotor sensitization. Female&mdash;but not male&mdash;rats developed sensitization to the locomotor-activating effects of ketamine, occurring more rapidly in proestrus than in diestrus females at the lower dose tested. To examine enduring context- and cell-type-specific changes in translating mRNAs associated with sensitization to ketamine, RNA sequencing was performed on polyribosome-bound mRNA of D1- and D2-MSNs isolated from the NAc of sensitized females in a drug-free state. A greater number of differentially expressed genes were observed selectively in D1-MSNs of ketamine-treated proestrus versus diestrus females, which were broadly related to regulation of transcription and epitranscriptional modification. These findings provide novel evidence of cell-type-specific and estrous cycle-dependent molecular profiles responsive to intermittent ketamine treatment in female rats and identify posttranscriptional mechanisms with relevance to ketamine's effects on behavioral plasticity.</p>

<p>Volumetric data reveal a late maturation of areas 36r and 36c compared to areas 35, TF, and TH, as well as a tendency for superficial layers in areas 36r and 36c to mature earlier than the deep layers.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices are two prominent structures of the medial temporal lobe that play essential roles in memory and perceptual processes. In humans, major changes in memory capacities occur within the first 7 years of life, but the neurobiological substrates underlying these changes have long been hypothetical. Previous studies have shown that distinct regions, layers, and cells of the hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex, exhibit different profiles of structural and molecular development. Here, to further understand the postnatal maturation of the medial temporal lobe, we implemented stereological techniques to characterize the structural development of the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in macaque monkeys. We found distinct, age-related differences in volume, neuronal soma size, and neuron number in different layers and subdivisions. Volumetric data indicated a late maturation of areas 36r and 36c compared to areas 35, TF, and TH. There was also an earlier maturation of the superficial layers compared to the deep layers in areas 36r and 36c. We observed a transient increase in neuronal soma size at 6 months of age in several subdivisions. Additionally, we found a decrease in neuron numbers in both the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices, but particularly in area 35 and layer III of area TF between birth and 6 months. These findings are consistent with the differential maturation of the rostral and caudal entorhinal cortex, which are interconnected with the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices, respectively. Altogether, they support the theory that the differential maturation of distinct hippocampal circuits underlies the emergence of specific “hippocampus-dependent” memory processes.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The mushroom bodies (MBs), prominent paired neuropils of the insect brain, are multimodal sensory processing centers. In the MBs of <i>Papilio xuthus</i>, a flower-foraging swallowtail butterfly with sophisticated color vision, the inner zone and the rim of the outer zone of the primary calyx receive prominent visual input. These two visual zones are spatially segregated from the outer zone that receives olfactory input. Sensory information is transmitted to the MB output sites (the lobes) via the pedunculus, but it remains unknown how the concentric modality organization of the calyx is transformed and represented in the spheroidal lobe neuropils in <i>P. xuthus</i>. To address this question, we investigated the architecture of the <i>Papilio</i> MBs in detail. Immunofluorescent staining and tracer injections into the MBs revealed the branching patterns of Kenyon cells (KCs), the MB intrinsic neurons, and several output pathways to other neuropils of the central brain. We newly defined the α/β, α′/β′, and γ lobes of the <i>Papilio</i> MBs following the nomenclature system commonly used in other insects. KCs conveying visual information extend axon-like fibers to the α/β lobe (a large ventral division), while KCs conveying olfactory information send fibers to the α′/β′ lobe located between the α/β and γ lobes. These parallel sensory pathways in the MBs of <i>P. xuthus</i> were summarized as a three-dimensional reconstruction of the MB subdivisions. Our study facilitates future physiological and functional studies of multisensory processing in the swallowtail butterfly brain.</p>

                <p>by Qi Jiang, Longquan Li, Lei Zhang, Lin Wan</p>

The advent of temporal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has enabled in-depth investigation of dynamic processes in heterogeneous multicellular systems. Despite remarkable advancements in computational methods for modeling cellular dynamics, integrating cell-cell interactions (CCIs) into these models remains a major challenge. This is particularly true when dealing with high-dimensional gene expression profiles from large populations of interacting cells, where the intricate interplay between cells can be obscured by data complexity. To address this, we present scIMF, a single-cell deep-generative Interacting Mean Field model that learns collective multicellular dynamics. Leveraging the McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation framework, scIMF provides a mathematical foundation for describing interacting multicellular systems, where each cell’s evolution depends on the population’s empirical distribution. By incorporating a cell-wise attention mechanism, the model efficiently captures nonlocal and asymmetric CCIs, enabling realistic reconstruction of complex intercellular relationships in high-dimensional spaces. Benchmarking across diverse temporal scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scIMF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing gene expression at unobserved time points and in inferring cellular velocities. Furthermore, scIMF uncovers biologically interpretable, non-reciprocal interaction patterns of cells, providing a principled framework for studying complex, particularly non-equilibrium biological systems.

Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled comprehensive analyses of Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) from tissue samples, leveraging high-resolution microscopy and computational capabilities. Despite this progress, available tools for automatic cell type identification perform poorly on skin tissue, e.g. in the classification of non-melanoma tumor cells. This is due to a paucity of labeled training data sets and high morphological similarities between tumor and non-tumor epithelial cells in the skin. Here, we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline designed for the analysis of skin WSIs. To this end we generated two new datasets using WSIs of cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC) samples, a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer, by annotating 47,392 cell nuclei across 5 cell types in 21 WSIs and segmenting tumor regions in 144 WSIs. Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification, as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.907 for tumor region segmentation. From these output, the pipeline can generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. As an exemplary use-case, we deploy Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner predicts patient response with mean area under ROC curve of 0.755 ± 0.091 over cross-validation, and identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology. Importantly, Histo-Miner is designed to allow for its use on other cancer types and on other training datasets. Our tool and datasets are available through our github repository: https://github.com/bozeklab/histo-miner.

                <p>by Esther Li Wen Choo, Kris V. Parag, Jo Yi Chow, Jue Tao Lim</p>

Accurate real-time estimation of the effective reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub>) is critical for infectious disease surveillance and response. In vector-borne diseases like dengue, temperature strongly influences disease transmission by affecting generation times. However, most existing R<sub>t</sub> estimation methods assume a fixed generation interval, leading to biased estimates and unreliable assessments of transmission risk in settings with fluctuating temperatures. In this study, we proposed and evaluated a novel framework to estimate a temperature-dependent reproduction number (td-R<sub>t</sub>) that dynamically updates the generation interval distribution based on observed temperature data. We obtained real-time estimates of td-R<sub>t</sub> through an adapted Bayesian recursive filtering process. Using real and simulated data for a temperature-sensitive disease (dengue), we evaluated the performance of td-R<sub>t</sub> against the typically used temperature-independent reproduction number (ti-R<sub>t</sub>) and angular reproduction number (Ωt), which does not require specification of the generation interval. Simulated data was generated under varying patterns of underlying R<sub>t</sub> and temperature datasets. Performance was evaluated by classification accuracy, defined by the proportion of instances where estimated R<sub>t</sub> correctly identified whether the true R<sub>t</sub> was above or below 1. We found that td-R<sub>t</sub> generally outperformed ti-R<sub>t</sub> and Ωt in classifying periods of epidemic growth. td-R<sub>t</sub> achieved the highest classification accuracy in 54 of 72 simulation scenarios, with accuracy ranging from 37.1%–95.9%. td-R<sub>t</sub> accuracy was highest in scenarios with greater temperature variability, surpassing other methods by up to 20%. With Singapore dengue case data, td-R<sub>t</sub> and Ωt signals showed 75% similarity, highlighting Ωt’s potential as a complementary measure that is less sensitive to model assumptions. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for temperature in real-time transmissibility estimates, as temperature-driven variations in generation time can introduce model misspecification and bias. Incorporating temperature is especially crucial for climate-sensitive diseases like dengue. Future work could extend this framework to other pathogens and additional transmission-relevant covariates.

                <p>by Yun Sok Lee</p>

In obesity, nutrient excess and altered adipocyte secretory profiles reprogram cell-intrinsic metabolism, leading to the activation of immune cells within metabolically active tissues such as adipose tissue. This obesity-associated chronic low-grade metabolic inflammation (often referred to as metaflammation) is a well-established driver of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. However, several lines of emerging evidence suggest that metaflammation is not merely a pathologic process, but may also serve as an adaptive response that supports metabolic homeostasis, particularly at the early stages of obesity. This Essay discusses immunometabolic mechanisms underlying the dual nature of metaflammation in obesity, highlighting how its initially beneficial effects can transition into detrimental outcomes.

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-102/v1?src=rss">Modified New [0, 1] - Right Truncated Exponential Rayleigh Distribution Structure and Application [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In general, truncated distributions provide a flexible framework that allows for more realistic and accurate representation of constrained data compared to using non-truncated distributions, making them a fundamental element in modern statistical models and the analysis of constrained data. Methods Right – truncated [0,1] exponential Rayleigh distribution ([0,1]-RTERD) for lifetime is presented in this paper. The new distribution contains two parameters, one of scale and another for the shape. Statistical functions of the (RTERD), such as cumulative functions (CDF), probability density (PDF), survival, and hazard functions, are presented in terms of mathematical construction and graphics. Besides, discuss the mathematical and statistical properties of the new distribution, including median, moments of the origin, coefficients of skewness and kurtosis, order statistic, moment generating function, the rėnyi entropy, quantile function. Results the parameters of this life expectancy distribution will be estimate using the maximum likelihood estimation method and compare new continuous model with other continuous distributions using statistical information criterion. Finally, apply the ([0,1]-RTERD) to actual datasets to validate the model’s practicality. The ([0,1]-RTERD) frequently produces a better fit and shows more modeling precision when handling lifespan and reliability data, according to comparisons with traditional models. Conclusions The [0,1]-RTERD provides a new framework for more accurately dealing with data restricted to the interval [0,1], where it is characterized by several important properties, including changing the shape, center, and width of the original distribution as a result of the normalization process, which is reflected in the expected value, standard deviation, and other instantaneous properties.

                Background The integration of mathematical competencies and critical thinking in secondary education has become increasingly relevant to equip students with the ability to reason, argue, and solve complex real-world problems. Despite its recognized importance, this integration remains fragmented across curricula and inconsistently applied in classroom practice. Methods A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines to analyze empirical evidence published between 2019 and 2025. Searches were performed in Scopus, Web of Science, SciELO, and Dialnet databases. Inclusion criteria focused on open-access, peer-reviewed studies in English or Spanish addressing the integration of mathematical competencies and critical thinking in secondary education. From 1,457 records initially retrieved, 24 empirical studies were selected for full analysis. Results The studies reviewed indicate that mathematical competencies, defined as the ability to model, interpret, and solve problems through logical reasoning, are reinforced when integrated with critical thinking skills such as evaluation, argumentation, and evidence-based decision-making. Active methodologies, including Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Project-Based Learning (PjBL), STEM, and gamification, were identified as the most effective strategies to foster this integration. However, their implementation is often constrained by structural barriers such as limited teacher training, rigid curricula, and insufficient technological infrastructure. Conclusion Integrative, student-centered approaches supported by active learning methodologies enhance higher-order cognitive development and prepare learners to meet the demands of 21st-century education. Future research should address methodological standardization, teacher preparation, and institutional conditions to ensure the sustainable and equitable implementation of these strategies.

                Background The representation of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is disproportionate to graduates from STEM fields. There is limited research addressing challenges facing women’s retention in STEM in the UAE. Methods A cross-sectional study using a validated questionnaire was conducted. A total of 165 participants were enrolled; 62% males and 35% females. Results More women believed there is gender inequality in STEM (47% versus 28%). 44% of female participants experienced gender inequality in their careers. Men were significantly less likely to experience gender inequality (OR=0.06, 95% CI=0.02-0.16). Women reported lack of organizational emphasis on diversity and inclusion for promotion to leadership (44% versus 60%). Thematic analysis of open-ended responses showed a number of dominant barriers, such as gender bias in hiring and promotion, career impact of motherhood and family responsibilities, and lack of institutional support and flexibility. Conclusion Data confirms gender-based preconceptions and biases in STEM fields. Institutional initiatives and policies to challenge stereotypes and promote gender equality are required. The governmental role is crucial in creating an inclusive environment for women scientists.

                Abstract Background Effective communication between caregivers and elderly individuals with dementia is a central component of quality dementia care, yet it is frequently compromised by progressive cognitive decline affecting verbal and nonverbal interactions. As the global prevalence of dementia continues to increase, there is a growing need to synthesise current evidence on communication barriers, intervention approaches, and contextual factors influencing caregiver–elderly communication across diverse care settings. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2022 and 2025 were identified through comprehensive searches of the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Studies focusing on communication between caregivers and elderly individuals with dementia were included. Following screening and eligibility assessment, 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and analysed using a thematic narrative synthesis to identify key patterns, interventions, and research gaps. Results The findings were synthesised into three overarching themes. The first theme addressed communication challenges and caregiver strategies in dementia care, highlighting the effects of cognitive impairment on interaction and adaptive communication practices. The second theme examined communication tools, technologies, and intervention-based approaches, including structured communication programmes and assistive technologies. The third theme explored ethical, cultural, and system-level influences on communication, emphasising the roles of sociocultural norms, policy frameworks, and organisational support. Across the reviewed studies, tailored communication strategies were associated with improved interaction quality, while systemic and cultural constraints remained persistent barriers. Conclusions This review highlights the complexity of communication in dementia care and underscores the importance of integrated approaches that combine caregiver training, technological support, and culturally sensitive practices. The findings provide a consolidated evidence base to inform future research, policy development, and practice aimed at strengthening communication strategies and improving the quality of life of both caregivers and elderly individuals with dementia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-169/v3?src=rss">Adaptation and Validation of the Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS-24) for Utilization in Multiplayer Virtual Reality Environments [version 3; peer review: 4 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Multiplayer Virtual Reality-Based Simulations (MPVR-based simulations) with immersive 3D environments have become an important tool in interprofessional education (IPE). However, instruments to measure interprofessional socialization in MPVR-based education are limited. The Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS) is a useful tool for evaluating interprofessional socialization. This pilot study aimed to adapt and validate the ISVS-24 for use in interprofessional MPVR-based simulations settings. Methods Seventy-two participants, including anesthesiology residents (at novice, junior, and senior levels), general physicians, and professional nurses, were recruited voluntarily. The ISVS-24 was cross-culturally adapted and reviewed by experts for content validity in the MPVR simulation context. Participants completed the adapted ISVS after undergoing an interprofessional MPVR-based simulation. Structural validity was assessed using factorial analysis through principal component analysis. Content validity was measured using the mean content validity index (CVI). Consistency validity was evaluated with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC), and reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Results The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test indicated sampling adequacy (0.885), and Bartlett’s sphericity test was significant (χ2(42) = 472.725, p < 0.05). A three-section structure was confirmed. The mean CVI was 0.815, with 21 valid items (Aiken’s V ≥ 0.5). Among the 72 respondents, 40 were female (55.6%) and 32 were male (44.4%); 26 were anesthesiology residents (36.1%), 23 were general physicians (31.9%), and 23 were professional nurses (31.9%). The overall Cronbach’s alpha was 0.959. PCC for all items exceeded the r table value (> 0.232) with p < 0.05, showing significant item relationships. Conclusions The adapted version of ISVS for MPVR simulation-based education has good validity and reliability to assess interprofessional socialization in an MPVR-based simulation setting.

                Background This study aimed to evaluate the protective role of piperine and piperine-loaded titanium dioxide nanoparticles on oxidative and biochemical parameters, antioxidant levels, and cytogenetic parameters in the brain. Methods forty rats were randomly divided into four equal groups for 35 days as follow: the control group was administered DW/IP; the G1 group received 40 mg/kg B.W. of piperine orally; The G2 group was given TiO2NPs (50 mg/kg B.W.)/i.p. received; and the G3 group received 75 mg/kg B.W. /I. P. of PIP-TiO2NPs. Results A significant increase in serum TAO-C and a significant decrease in ROS were observed in G1 and G3 compared to G2 and the control groups. A significant reduction in serum neurotransmitter concentration was found in the G2 group compared to the G1, control, and G3 groups, while a significant increase was observed in the G1 group. Gene expression data for cyclooxygenase showed upregulation in the G2 group and was significantly higher than in the G3, G1, and control groups. Histopathological examination showed normal brain layers, hippocampus, and thalamus appearance in G1, G2, G3, and the control groups. The G2 group showed mild vascular congestion, hyperplasia, and mild disruption in the molecular cell layer of the cerebral cortex. The hippocampus of the G3 group showed moderate vacuolation with glial reduction. Conclusions These findings indicate that piperine, combined with TiO2NPs (PIP-TiO2NPs), provides neuroprotection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses induced by TiO2NPs in the rat brain.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-98/v1?src=rss">Why Static Biomarkers Often Fall Short: Circadian Immune Coherence as a Missing Dimension in Immunotherapy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite major advances in cancer immunotherapy, clinical decision-making still relies heavily on static biomarkers derived from single time-point measurements, such as PD-L1 expression or baseline inflammatory indices. While these markers provide partial prognostic and predictive information, they often fail to capture the dynamic and time-dependent nature of host–tumor immune interactions. Growing evidence from circadian biology demonstrates that immune cell trafficking, cytokine release, antigen presentation, and checkpoint pathway activity are subject to robust endogenous rhythmic regulation. Ignoring this temporal dimension may therefore lead to biological misclassification, inconsistent trial results, and suboptimal therapeutic scheduling. In this perspective, we argue that the limitations of static biomarkers arise not merely from technical insufficiency, but from a deeper conceptual gap: the absence of a system-level, time-aware framework capable of integrating longitudinal immune dynamics. We introduce Circadian Immune Coherence (CIC) as a systems-based property describing the alignment, stability, and rhythmic consistency of immune trajectories over time, rather than isolated absolute values. Drawing on circadian immunology, emerging data on immunotherapy timing, and advances in longitudinal analytical methods, we propose that CIC represents a missing conceptual dimension in immunotherapy research. Preliminary applications of this framework to longitudinal real-world clinical data (manuscript under review) support its operational feasibility and suggest the presence of distinct immune coherence phenotypes associated with immunotherapy outcomes. We discuss how time-series and spectral analytical approaches can operationalize CIC by uncovering latent rhythmic patterns in immune data that remain invisible to conventional static methods. Finally, we outline implications for biomarker development and clinical trial design, suggesting that time-aware stratification and adaptive scheduling may help reconcile conflicting results and improve therapeutic precision. We conclude that formally recognizing time as an intrinsic biological variable—and developing frameworks to measure its organization—is essential for moving beyond the limitations of static biomarkers.
