                Background Multiplayer Virtual Reality-Based Simulations (MPVR-based simulations) with immersive 3D environments have become an important tool in interprofessional education (IPE). However, instruments to measure interprofessional socialization in MPVR-based education are limited. The Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (ISVS) is a useful tool for evaluating interprofessional socialization. This pilot study aimed to adapt and validate the ISVS-24 for use in interprofessional MPVR-based simulations settings. Methods Seventy-two participants, including anesthesiology residents (at novice, junior, and senior levels), general physicians, and professional nurses, were recruited voluntarily. The ISVS-24 was cross-culturally adapted and reviewed by experts for content validity in the MPVR simulation context. Participants completed the adapted ISVS after undergoing an interprofessional MPVR-based simulation. Structural validity was assessed using factorial analysis through principal component analysis. Content validity was measured using the mean content validity index (CVI). Consistency validity was evaluated with Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC), and reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Results The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test indicated sampling adequacy (0.885), and Bartlett’s sphericity test was significant (χ2(42) = 472.725, p < 0.05). A three-section structure was confirmed. The mean CVI was 0.815, with 21 valid items (Aiken’s V ≥ 0.5). Among the 72 respondents, 40 were female (55.6%) and 32 were male (44.4%); 26 were anesthesiology residents (36.1%), 23 were general physicians (31.9%), and 23 were professional nurses (31.9%). The overall Cronbach’s alpha was 0.959. PCC for all items exceeded the r table value (> 0.232) with p < 0.05, showing significant item relationships. Conclusions The adapted version of ISVS for MPVR simulation-based education has good validity and reliability to assess interprofessional socialization in an MPVR-based simulation setting.

                Background This study aimed to evaluate the protective role of piperine and piperine-loaded titanium dioxide nanoparticles on oxidative and biochemical parameters, antioxidant levels, and cytogenetic parameters in the brain. Methods forty rats were randomly divided into four equal groups for 35 days as follow: the control group was administered DW/IP; the G1 group received 40 mg/kg B.W. of piperine orally; The G2 group was given TiO2NPs (50 mg/kg B.W.)/i.p. received; and the G3 group received 75 mg/kg B.W. /I. P. of PIP-TiO2NPs. Results A significant increase in serum TAO-C and a significant decrease in ROS were observed in G1 and G3 compared to G2 and the control groups. A significant reduction in serum neurotransmitter concentration was found in the G2 group compared to the G1, control, and G3 groups, while a significant increase was observed in the G1 group. Gene expression data for cyclooxygenase showed upregulation in the G2 group and was significantly higher than in the G3, G1, and control groups. Histopathological examination showed normal brain layers, hippocampus, and thalamus appearance in G1, G2, G3, and the control groups. The G2 group showed mild vascular congestion, hyperplasia, and mild disruption in the molecular cell layer of the cerebral cortex. The hippocampus of the G3 group showed moderate vacuolation with glial reduction. Conclusions These findings indicate that piperine, combined with TiO2NPs (PIP-TiO2NPs), provides neuroprotection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses induced by TiO2NPs in the rat brain.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-98/v1?src=rss">Why Static Biomarkers Often Fall Short: Circadian Immune Coherence as a Missing Dimension in Immunotherapy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Despite major advances in cancer immunotherapy, clinical decision-making still relies heavily on static biomarkers derived from single time-point measurements, such as PD-L1 expression or baseline inflammatory indices. While these markers provide partial prognostic and predictive information, they often fail to capture the dynamic and time-dependent nature of host–tumor immune interactions. Growing evidence from circadian biology demonstrates that immune cell trafficking, cytokine release, antigen presentation, and checkpoint pathway activity are subject to robust endogenous rhythmic regulation. Ignoring this temporal dimension may therefore lead to biological misclassification, inconsistent trial results, and suboptimal therapeutic scheduling. In this perspective, we argue that the limitations of static biomarkers arise not merely from technical insufficiency, but from a deeper conceptual gap: the absence of a system-level, time-aware framework capable of integrating longitudinal immune dynamics. We introduce Circadian Immune Coherence (CIC) as a systems-based property describing the alignment, stability, and rhythmic consistency of immune trajectories over time, rather than isolated absolute values. Drawing on circadian immunology, emerging data on immunotherapy timing, and advances in longitudinal analytical methods, we propose that CIC represents a missing conceptual dimension in immunotherapy research. Preliminary applications of this framework to longitudinal real-world clinical data (manuscript under review) support its operational feasibility and suggest the presence of distinct immune coherence phenotypes associated with immunotherapy outcomes. We discuss how time-series and spectral analytical approaches can operationalize CIC by uncovering latent rhythmic patterns in immune data that remain invisible to conventional static methods. Finally, we outline implications for biomarker development and clinical trial design, suggesting that time-aware stratification and adaptive scheduling may help reconcile conflicting results and improve therapeutic precision. We conclude that formally recognizing time as an intrinsic biological variable—and developing frameworks to measure its organization—is essential for moving beyond the limitations of static biomarkers.

                How do state actors act in regional organizations? For decades, international relations scholars assessing Southeast Asia have examined the agency of middle powers in the region, exerting influence and shaping the introduction of regional norms. However, less has been assessed in the context of smaller states such as Laos, which has displayed some unique traits in its foreign policy. Among the empirical anomalies is Laos’ display of neutrality, despite growing closer to China’s lucrative economic opportunities in the past decades. As a means to understand why Laos’s chairmanship roles have displayed neutrality, this study bridges the relevance of neoclassical realism’s theoretical framework to make sense of foreign policies that are out of the ordinary. Drawing on primary and secondary data on Laos’ ASEAN chairmanships in 2016 and 2024, this study argues that domestic considerations (the growing negative sentiment towards economic ties with China) and external determinants (power relations with China and ASEAN regionalism) affect Laos’ external outlook.

                Background This study analyzes Saudi Arabia’s 2022–2023 reforms to the Commercial Agency Law through legal, economic, and comparative lenses. The pre-reform regime—marked by rigid nationality limits, procedural burdens, and litigation-prone termination rules—constrained market entry and investor confidence. Methods Using a doctrinal approach to statutes and implementing regulations, triangulated with Saudi judicial practice and policy instruments, we benchmark Saudi reforms against the UAE and UK. A Shariah lens clarifies how gharar (uncertainty), fasakh (rescission), and unjust enrichment (akl al-māl bil-bāṭil) shape agency disputes. Results Key changes include more flexible nationality rules, end-to-end digital registration and renewal, clearer termination/compensation standards, and formal recognition of arbitration (including SCCA). Together these measures enhance contractual predictability and lower compliance frictions, with early indications of improved market transparency and investor sentiment. Conclusions The reforms signal a hybrid model—liberalization aligned with global practice while preserving a Shariah-grounded identity. Remaining priorities include consistent judicial application, practitioner training, clearer guidance, and GCC coordination. We propose thematically grouped policy steps to consolidate gains and support Vision 2030’s diversification agenda.

                Abstract* Background Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a prevalent and underdiagnosed disease affecting over 25 million adults worldwide. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) remains the gold standard for great saphenous vein (GSV) insufficiency. However, conventional EVLA performed 1–2 cm distal to the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) often leaves residual tributaries, increasing the risk of recurrence. Zone-zero laser crossectomy, defined as laser crossectomy performed exactly at the 0 cm zone of the SFJ (zone-zero ablation), had been proposed as a minimally invasive alternative technique to eliminate residual stumps and reduce varicose vein recurrence. This case series of zone-zero laser crossectomy aims to share our experiences and outcomes amongst 57 patients in our center. Methods A total of 57 consecutive patients with symptomatic GSV insufficiency (CEAP C2–C6) underwent EVLA using a 1470 nm radial double-ring swift laser with zone-zero ablation at the SFJ. Procedural parameters, complications, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. Patients were followed at 7 days, 4, 8, and 12 weeks with physical and duplex ultrasound examinations. Results The mean age was 61.6 years. No recanalization was observed during the 3-month follow-up, with duplex ultrasound confirming complete obliteration of treated GSVs. Postoperative complications included leg pain in 3 cases (5.26%), EHIT grade I–II in 1 case (1.75%), hyperpigmentation in 1 case (1.75%), and paresthesia in 1 case (1.75%). All complications were mild and managed conservatively. Conclusions Zone-zero laser crossectomy is a safe and effective modification of EVLA for GSV insufficiency, demonstrating high obliteration rates and low complication rates. Larger cohorts with longer follow-up are needed to confirm durability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11653">AI Agents Need Memory Control Over More Context</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in long, multi-turn workflows in both research and enterprise settings. As interactions grow, agent behavior often degrades due to loss of constraint focus, error accumulation, and memory-induced drift. This problem is especially visible in real-world deployments where context evolves, distractions are introduced, and decisions must remain consistent over time. A common practice is to equip agents with persistent memory through transcript replay or retrieval-based mechanisms. While convenient, these approaches introduce unbounded context growth and are vulnerable to noisy recall and memory poisoning, leading to unstable behavior and increased drift. In this work, we introduce the Agent Cognitive Compressor (ACC), a bio-inspired memory controller that replaces transcript replay with a bounded internal state updated online at each turn. ACC separates artifact recall from state commitment, enabling stable conditioning while preventing unverified content from becoming persistent memory. We evaluate ACC using an agent-judge-driven live evaluation framework that measures both task outcomes and memory-driven anomalies across extended interactions. Across scenarios spanning IT operations, cybersecurity response, and healthcare workflows, ACC consistently maintains bounded memory and exhibits more stable multi-turn behavior, with significantly lower hallucination and drift than transcript replay and retrieval-based agents. These results show that cognitive compression provides a practical and effective foundation for reliable memory control in long-horizon AI agents.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12053">A New Strategy for Artificial Intelligence: Training Foundation Models Directly on Human Brain Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.12053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While foundation models have achieved remarkable results across a diversity of domains, they still rely on human-generated data, such as text, as a fundamental source of knowledge. However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions.

                arXiv:2601.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain integrates motor suppression with motivational processes remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. The rostral Pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem structure involved in motor control, has been shown to induce transient motor arrest upon optogenetic or electrical stimulation. However, our current understanding of its potential role in linking motor suppression with motivational or reinforcement-related processes is still insufficient. To further explore the effects induced by PPN stimulations and infer the potential mechanism underlying its role involved in both motor and emotional regulation, we developed a fully automated, low-cost system combining real-time animal tracking with closed-loop optogenetic stimulation, using the OpenMV Cam H7 Plus and embedded neural network models. The system autonomously detects the rat's position and triggers optical stimulation upon entry into a predefined region of interest, enabling unbiased, unsupervised behavioral assays. Optogenetic activation of CaMKIIa-expressing neurons in the rostral PPN reliably induced transient motor arrest. When stimulation was consistently paired with a specific location in a conditioned place preference task. When motor arrest was spatially paired with a defined region of interest, rats developed a robust place preference after limited training. These results suggest that rostral PPN activation can couple motor inhibition with reinforcement-related behavioral circuitry. Together, our work provides both a technical framework for scalable closed-loop neuroscience experiments and preliminary evidence that the rostral PPN may participate in coordinating motor suppression with motivational processes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12258">Modeling Dynamic Computations in the Primate Ventral Visual Stream</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major goal of computational neuroscience has been to explain how the primate ventral visual stream (VVS) transforms visual input into temporally evolving neural representations that support robust visual perception. Historically, most modeling efforts have assumed static conditions: monkeys fixate a dot, images are briefly flashed, and neural responses are analyzed through time-averaged metrics. Feedforward deep networks trained on static object recognition tasks outperform prior work in approximating these static snapshot-driven VVS responses. However, mounting neurophysiological evidence demonstrates that VVS responses are rich dynamical signals shaped not only by the retinal input but also by intrinsic circuit dynamics, recurrent interactions, and widespread top-down modulation. Moreover, real-world vision is inherently dynamic: objects move, the observer moves, and the eyes actively sample the environment. Here, we review recent progress in modeling dynamic responses in the macaque ventral stream across three domains: (1) intrinsic dynamics elicited by static images, (2) dynamics evoked by dynamic visual stimuli, and (3) dynamics generated by active sensing during eye movements. We argue that accurately modeling VVS dynamics will require representational, circuit-level, and behavioral perspectives, including multi-area recurrence, structured E/I interactions, and temporal objectives that better reflect natural behavior. We outline some key missing ingredients and propose a roadmap toward dynamic, multi-timescale models of the primate VVS.

                arXiv:2601.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For 20 years the beautiful structure in the grid cell code has presented an attractive puzzle: what computation do these representations subserve, and why does it manifest so curiously in neurons. The first question quickly attracted an answer: grid cells subserve path-integration, the ability to keep track of one's position as you move about the world. Subsequent work has only solidified this link: bottom-up mechanistic models that perform path-integration match the measured neural responses, while experimental perturbations that selectively disrupt grid cell activity impair performance on path-integration dependent tasks. A more controversial area of work has been top-down normative modelling: why has the brain chosen to compute like this? Floods of ink have been spilt attempting to build a precise link between the population's objective and the measured implementation. The holy grail is a normative link with broad predictive power which generalises to other neural systems. We review this literature and argue that, despite some controversies, the literature largely agrees that grid cells can be explained as a (1) biologically plausible (2) high fidelity, non-linearly decodable code for position that (3) subserves path-integration. As a rare area of neuroscience with mature theoretical and experimental work, this story holds lessons for normative theories of neural computations, and on the risks and rewards of integrating task-optimised neural networks into such theorising.

                arXiv:2601.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress has led to a detailed understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie decision making in primates. However, less is known about why such mechanisms are present in the first place. Theory suggests that primate decision making mechanisms, and their resultant behavioral abilities, emerged to maximize reward in the face of noisy, temporally evolving information. To test this theory, we trained an end-to-end deep recurrent neural network using reinforcement learning on a noisy perceptual discrimination task. Networks learned several key abilities of primate-like decision making including trading off speed for accuracy, and flexibly changing their mind in the face of new information. Internal dynamics of these networks suggest that these abilities were supported by similar decision mechanisms as those observed in primate neurophysiological studies. These results provide experimental support for key pressures that gave rise to the primate ability to make flexible decisions.

                arXiv:2601.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and related fields, dominant models of intelligence typically privilege convergence: uncertainty is reduced, competing explanations are eliminated, and behaviour is governed by the optimisation of a single objective or policy. While this framing has proved powerful in many settings, it sits uneasily with biological and adaptive systems that maintain redundancy, ambiguity, and parallel explanatory processes over extended timescales. Here we propose an alternative perspective, termed polyphonic intelligence, in which coherent behaviour and meaning emerge from the coordination of multiple semi-independent inferential processes operating under shared constraints. Rather than resolving plurality through dominance or collapse, polyphonic systems sustain multiple explanatory trajectories and integrate them through soft alignment, compatibility relations, and bounded influence. We develop this perspective conceptually and formally, introducing a variational framework in which multiple coordinated approximations are maintained without winner-takes-all selection. This formulation makes explicit how plurality can remain stable, tractable, and productive, and clarifies how polyphonic inference differs from ensemble methods, mixture models, and Bayesian model averaging. Through proof-of-principle examples, we demonstrate that non-dominating, pluralistic inference can be implemented in simple computational systems without requiring centralised control or global convergence. We conclude by discussing implications for neuroscience, psychiatry, and artificial intelligence, and by arguing that intelligence may be more fruitfully understood as coordination without command rather than as the elimination of uncertainty.

                arXiv:2601.13297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the brain represents the multifaceted properties of words in context is essential for explaining the neural architecture of human language. Here, we combine large-scale psycholinguistic modeling with naturalistic fMRI to uncover the latent structure of word properties and their neural representations during narrative comprehension. By analyzing 106 psycholinguistic variables across 13,850 English words, we identified eight interpretable latent dimensions spanning lexical usage, word form, phonology orthography mapping, sublexical regularity, and semantic organization. These factors robustly predicted behavioral performance across lexical decision, naming, recognition, and semantic judgment tasks, demonstrating their cognitive relevance. Parcel-based and multivariate fMRI analyses of narrative listening revealed that these latent dimensions are encoded in overlapping yet functionally differentiated cortical systems. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses further identified four interacting subsystems supporting sensorimotor grounding, controlled semantic retrieval, resolution of lexical competition, and contextual episodic integration. Together, these findings provide a unified neurocognitive framework linking fundamental lexical psycholinguistic dimensions to distributed cortical systems engaged during naturalistic language comprehension.

                arXiv:2601.13866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding visual semantic representations from human brain activity is a significant challenge. While recent zero-shot decoding approaches have improved performance by leveraging aligned image-text datasets, they overlook a fundamental aspect of human cognition: semantic understanding is inherently anchored in the auditory modality of speech, not text. To address this, our study introduces the first comparative framework for evaluating auditory versus textual semantic modalities in zero-shot visual neural decoding. We propose a novel brain-visual-auditory multimodal alignment model that directly utilizes auditory representations to encapsulate semantics, serving as a substitute for traditional textual descriptors. Our experimental results demonstrate that the auditory modality not only surpasses the textual modality in decoding accuracy but also achieves higher computational efficiency. These findings indicate that auditory semantic representations are more closely aligned with neural activity patterns during visual processing. This work reveals the critical and previously underestimated role of auditory semantics in decoding visual cognition and provides new insights for developing brain-computer interfaces that are more congruent with natural human cognitive mechanisms.

                arXiv:2601.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mooney images are high-contrast, two-tone visual stimuli, created by thresholding photographic images. They allow researchers to separate image content from image understanding, making them valuable for studying visual perception. An ideal Mooney image for this purpose achieves a specific balance: it initially appears unrecognizable but becomes fully interpretable to the observer after seeing the original template. Researchers traditionally created these stimuli manually using subjective criteria, which is labor-intensive and can introduce inconsistencies across studies. Automated generation techniques now offer an alternative to this manual approach. Here, we present MooneyMaker, an open-source Python package that automates the generation of ambiguous Mooney images using several complementary approaches. Users can choose between various generation techniques that range from approaches based on image statistics to deep learning models. These models strategically alter edge information to increase initial ambiguity. The package lets users create two-tone images with multiple methods and directly compare the results visually. In an experiment, we validate MooneyMaker by generating Mooney images using different techniques and assess their recognizability for human observers before and after disambiguating them by presenting the template images. Our results reveal that techniques with lower initial recognizability are associated with higher post-template recognition (i.e. a larger disambiguation effect). To help vision scientists build effective databases of Mooney stimuli, we provide practical guidelines for technique selection. By standardizing the generation process, MooneyMaker supports more consistent and reproducible visual perception research.

                arXiv:2601.11614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which pathological changes begin many years before the onset of clinical symptoms, making early detection essential for timely intervention. T1-weighted (T1w) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical practice to identify macroscopic brain alterations, but these changes typically emerge relatively late in the disease course. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), in contrast, is sensitive to earlier microstructural abnormalities by probing water diffusion in brain tissue. dMRI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), provide complementary information about white matter integrity and neurodegeneration. However, dMRI acquisitions are time-consuming and susceptible to motion artifacts, limiting their routine use in clinical populations. To bridge this gap, I propose a 3D TransUNet image synthesis framework that predicts FA and MD maps directly from T1w MRI. My model generates high-fidelity maps, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) exceeding 0.93 and a strong Pearson correlation (>0.94) with ground-truth dMRI. When integrated into a multi-modal diagnostic model, these synthetic features boost AD classification accuracy by 5% (78.75%->83.75%) and, most importantly, improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection by 12.5%. This study demonstrates that high-quality diffusion microstructural information can be inferred from routinely acquired T1w MRI, effectively transferring the benefits of multi-modality imaging to settings where diffusion data are unavailable. By reducing scan time while preserving complementary structural and microstructural information, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of AD diagnosis in clinical practice.

                arXiv:2601.13370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing methods in nanoscale connectomics are at present too slow to map entire mammalian brains. As an emerging approach, expansion microscopy (ExM) has enormous promise, yet it still suffers from throughput limitations. Mapping the human brain and even mapping nonhuman primate brains therefore remain distant goals. While ExM increases effective resolution linearly, it enlarges tissue volume cubically, which dramatically increases imaging time. As a rapid tomographic technique, X-ray microscopy has potential for drastically speeding up large-volume connectomics. But to the best of my knowledge, no group has so far imaged cellular features within expanded tissue using X-ray microscopy. I herein present an early-stage report featuring the first demonstration of X-ray microscopy reconstruction of cell bodies within expanded tissue. This was achieved by combining a modified enzymatic Unclearing technique with a metallic gold stain and imaging using a laboratory X-ray microscope. I emphasize that a great deal of work remains to develop "expansion X-ray microscopy" (ExXRM) to the point where it can be useful for connectomics since the current iteration of ExXRM only resolves cell bodies and not neurites due to extensive off-target staining. Additionally, the current method must be modified to accommodate for the challenges of synchrotron X-ray microscopy, a vastly speedier approach than laboratory X-ray microscopy. Nonetheless, achieving X-ray contrast in expanded tissues represents a significant first step towards realizing ExXRM as a connectomics imaging modality.

                arXiv:2601.13962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, low-latency estimates of the instantaneous phase of oscillations are essential for closed-loop sensing and actuation, including (but not limited to) phase-locked neurostimulation and other real-time applications. The endpoint-corrected Hilbert transform (ecHT) reduces boundary artefacts of the Hilbert transform by applying a causal narrow-band filter to the analytic spectrum. This improves the phase estimate at the most recent sample. Despite its widespread empirical use, the systematic endpoint distortions of ecHT have lacked a principled, closed-form analysis. In this study, we derive the ecHT endpoint operator analytically and demonstrate that its output can be decomposed into a desired positive-frequency term (a deterministic complex gain that induces a calibratable amplitude/phase bias) and a residual leakage term setting an irreducible variance floor. This yields (i) an explicit characterisation and bounds for endpoint phase/amplitude error, (ii) a mean-squared-error-optimal scalar calibration (c-ecHT), and (iii) practical design rules relating window length, bandwidth/order, and centre-frequency mismatch to residual bias via an endpoint group delay.

                arXiv:2401.10922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associative memory models retrieve stored information through content-based addressing, mimicking the neural processes of animal brains. The classical Hopfield network-based models store memories as vectors of discrete values and have good storage capacity but do not consider the role of neuronal synchronization in memory storage and retrieval as observed in brains. This is addressed in phase-oscillator-based models which store memories as time-dependent phase-synchronized states, but suffer from instability and low capacity. The present study addresses these challenges through a novel chaotic oscillator-based associative memory model, by defining a phase relationship in chaotic systems and encoding memory as synchronized states of these phases. The underlying chaos in the network is shown to significantly improve both storage and retrieval and offer insights into the dynamics of memory retrieval.

                arXiv:2409.02684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural activity fluctuates over a wide range of timescales within and across brain areas. Experimental observations suggest that diverse neural timescales reflect information in dynamic environments. However, how timescales are defined and measured from brain recordings vary across the literature. Moreover, these observations do not specify the mechanisms underlying timescale variations, nor whether specific timescales are necessary for neural computation and brain function. Here, we synthesize three directions where computational approaches can distill the broad set of empirical observations into quantitative and testable theories: We review (i) how different data analysis methods quantify timescales across distinct behavioral states and recording modalities, (ii) how biophysical models provide mechanistic explanations for the emergence of diverse timescales, and (iii) how task-performing networks and machine learning models uncover the functional relevance of neural timescales. This integrative computational perspective thus complements experimental investigations, providing a holistic view on how neural timescales reflect the relationship between brain structure, dynamics, and behavior.

                arXiv:2502.11105v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. According to this framework, memory is stored as a statistic-like representation that is repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Summarization of sensory input must be rapid; that of abstract trace might be slower and more deliberative, drawing on elaborative processes some of which might occasionally reach consciousness (as in mind-wandering). Short-term sensory traces are summarized as simple statistics organized into structures such as a time series, graph or dictionary, and longer-term abstract traces as more complex statistic-like structures. Summarization at multiple time scales requires an intensive process of memory curation which might account for the high metabolic consumption of the brain at rest. Summarization may be guided by heuristics to help choose which statistics to apply at each step, so that the trace is useful for a wide range of future needs, the objective being to "represent the past" rather than tune for a specific task. However, the choice of statistics (or of heuristics to guide that choice) is a potential target for learning, possibly over long-term scales of development or evolution. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive empirical and theoretical knowledge of memory and bring us closer to understanding it in functional and mechanistic terms.

Abstract: The brain transforms visual inputs into high-dimensional cortical representations that support diverse cognitive and behavioral goals. Characterizing how this information is organized and routed across the human brain is essential for understanding how we process complex visual scenes. Here, we applied representational similarity analysis to 7T fMRI data collected during natural scene viewing. We quantified representational geometry shared across individuals and compared it to hierarchical features from vision and language neural networks. This analysis revealed two distinct processing routes: a ventromedial pathway specialized for scene layout and environmental context, and a lateral occipitotemporal pathway selective for animate content. Vision models aligned with shared structure in both routes, whereas language models corresponded primarily with the lateral pathway. These findings refine classical visual-stream models by characterizing scene perception as a distributed cortical network with separable representational routes for context and animate content.

Abstract: Creativity is a core cognitive capacity underlying innovation and adaptive problem solving, yet how it is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture is not fully understood. While resting-state fMRI studies have identified large-scale network correlates associated with differences in creativity, EEG provides the temporal resolution for examining oscillatory dynamics contributing to intrinsic network organization. We examined whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with individual differences across multiple creativity-related measures. Thirty healthy young adults completed a multidimensional creativity battery comprising the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), the Divergent Association Task (DAT), the Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and a Self-rating (SR) of creative ability. Graph-theoretical analyses of alpha-band functional connectivity revealed two participant groups, each with distinct patterns of neural activity: Cluster 1 showed reduced global connectivity with relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity; Cluster 0 exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. Notably, Cluster 1 reported higher self-rated creative ability and more frequent engagement in real-world creative activities. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with variation in creative self-efficacy and creative engagement, highlighting characteristic patterns of alpha-band network organization observed at rest.

                arXiv:2512.12802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific theories of consciousness should be falsifiable and non-trivial. Recent research has given us formal tools to analyze these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality for theories of consciousness. Surprisingly, many contemporary theories of consciousness fail to pass this bar, including theories based on causal structure but also (as I demonstrate) theories based on function. Herein, I show these requirements of falsifiability and non-triviality especially constrain the potential consciousness of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) because of their proximity to systems that are equivalent to LLMs in terms of input/output function; yet, for these functionally equivalent systems, there cannot be any falsifiable and non-trivial theory of consciousness that judges them conscious. This forms the basis of a disproof of contemporary LLM consciousness. I then show a positive result, which is that theories of consciousness based on (or requiring) continual learning do satisfy the stringent formal constraints for a theory of consciousness in humans. Intriguingly, this work supports a hypothesis: If continual learning is linked to consciousness in humans, the current limitations of LLMs (which do not continually learn) are intimately tied to their lack of consciousness.

Abstract: Our brain functions as a complex communication network, and studying it from a network perspective offers valuable insights into its organizational principles and links to cognitive functions and brain disorders. However, most current network studies typically use brain regions as nodes, often overlooking the intricate folding patterns of finer-scale anatomical landmarks within these regions. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to integrate the brain's two primary folding patterns - gyri and sulci - into a unified network termed the Gyral-Sulcal-Net (GS-Net), in which three different types of finer-scale landmarks have been successfully identified. We evaluated the proposed GS-Net across multiple datasets, comprising over 1,600 brains, spanning different age groups (from 34 gestational weeks to elderly adults) and cohorts (healthy brains and those with pathological conditions). The experimental results demonstrate that the GS-Net can effectively integrate and represent diverse cortical folding patterns from a network perspective. More importantly, this approach offers a promising way for integrating different folding patterns into a unified anatomical brain network, alongside structural and functional networks, providing a comprehensive framework for studying brain networks.

                arXiv:2504.16342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of excitation patterns in neural fields is an important topic in neuroscience. Neural field equations are mathematical models that describe the excitation dynamics of interacting neurons to perform the theoretical analysis. Although many analyses of neural field equations focus on the effect of neuronal interactions on the flat surface, the geometric constraint of the dynamics is also an attractive topic when modeling organs such as the brain. This paper reports pattern dynamics in a neural field equation defined on spheroids as model curved surfaces. We treat spot solutions as localized patterns and discuss how the geometric properties of the curved surface change their properties. To analyze spot patterns on spheroids with small flattening, we first construct exact stationary spot solutions on the spherical surface and reveal their stability. We then extend the analysis to show the existence and stability of stationary spot solutions in the spheroidal case. One of our theoretical results is the derivation of a stability criterion for stationary spot solutions localized at poles on oblate spheroids. The criterion determines whether a spot solution remains at a pole or moves away. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to discuss the dynamics of spot solutions with the insight of our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the dynamics of spot solutions depend on the curved surface and the coordination of neural interactions.

Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.

Abstract: Cognitive processes are realized across an extraordinary range of natural, artificial, and hybrid systems, yet there is no unified framework for comparing their forms, limits, and unrealized possibilities. Here, we propose a cognition space approach that replaces narrow, substrate-dependent definitions with a comparative representation based on organizational and informational dimensions. Within this framework, cognition is treated as a graded capacity to sense, process, and act upon information, allowing systems as diverse as cells, brains, artificial agents, and human-AI collectives to be analyzed within a common conceptual landscape. We introduce and examine three cognition spaces -- basal aneural, neural, and human-AI hybrid -- and show that their occupation is highly uneven, with clusters of realized systems separated by large unoccupied regions. We argue that these voids are not accidental but reflect evolutionary contingencies, physical constraints, and design limitations. By focusing on the structure of cognition spaces rather than on categorical definitions, this approach clarifies the diversity of existing cognitive systems and highlights hybrid cognition as a promising frontier for exploring novel forms of complexity beyond those produced by biological evolution.

Abstract: Biological neural networks self-organize according to local synaptic modifications to produce stable computations. How modifications at the synaptic level give rise to such computations at the network level remains an open question. Pehlevan et al. [Neur. Comp. 27 (2015), 1461--1495] proposed a model of a self-organizing neural network with Hebbian and anti-Hebbian synaptic updates that implements an algorithm for principal subspace analysis; however, global stability of the nonlinear synaptic dynamics has not been established. Here, for the case that the feedforward and recurrent weights evolve at the same timescale, we prove global stability of the continuum limit of the synaptic dynamics and show that the dynamics evolve in two phases. In the first phase, the synaptic weights converge to an invariant manifold where the `neural filters' are orthonormal. In the second phase, the synaptic dynamics follow the gradient flow of a non-convex potential function whose minima correspond to neural filters that span the principal subspace of the input data.

Abstract: This definitive research memoria presents a comprehensive, mathematically verified paradigm for neural communication with Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), integrating five complementary frameworks: thermodynamic reservoir computing, hierarchical number system theory, algorithmic analysis, network latency optimization, and machine-checked mathematical formalization. We establish that obsolete cryptocurrency mining hardware exhibits emergent computational properties enabling bidirectional information exchange between AI systems and silicon substrates. The research program demonstrates: (1) reservoir computing with NARMA-10 Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.8661; (2) the Thermodynamic Probability Filter (TPF) achieving 92.19% theoretical energy reduction; (3) the Virtual Block Manager achieving +25% effective hashrate; and (4) hardware universality across multiple ASIC families including Antminer S9, Lucky Miner LV06, and Goldshell LB-Box. A significant contribution is the machine-checked mathematical formalization using Lean 4 and Mathlib, providing unambiguous definitions, machine-verified theorems, and reviewer-proof claims. Key theorems proven include: independence implies zero leakage, predictor beats baseline implies non-independence (the logical core of TPF), energy savings theoretical maximum, and Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) distinguishability witnesses. Vladimir Veselov's hierarchical number system theory explains why early-round information contains predictive power. This work establishes a new paradigm: treating ASICs not as passive computational substrates but as active conversational partners whose thermodynamic state encodes exploitable computational information.

                arXiv:2601.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an algorithm titled a statistical firefly algorithm (SFA) for truss topology optimization. In the proposed algorithm, historical results of fireflies' motions are used in hypothesis testing to limit the motions of fireflies that are suggested by current information exchanges between fireflies only to those that are potentially useful. Hypothesis testing is applied to the mechanism of an ordinary firefly algorithm (FA) without changing its structure. As a result, the implementation of the proposed algorithm is simple and straightforward. Limiting the motions of fireflies to those that are potential useful results in reduction of firefly evaluations, and, subsequently, reduction of computational efforts. To test the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm, it is used to solve several truss topology optimization problems, including some benchmark problems. It is found that the added statistical strategy in the SFA significantly enhances the performance of the original FA in terms of computational efforts while still maintains the quality of the obtained results.

                arXiv:2601.12723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization benchmarks play a fundamental role in assessing algorithm performance; however, existing artificial benchmarks often fail to capture the diversity and irregularity of real-world problem structures, while benchmarks derived from real-world problems are costly and difficult to construct. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary automatic benchmark generation framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a generative operator, termed the LLM-driven evolutionary benchmark generator (LLM-EBG). In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\% of trials. Furthermore, exploratory landscape analysis reveals that benchmarks favoring GA are highly sensitive to variable scaling, demonstrating that the proposed framework can generate problems with distinct geometric characteristics that reflect the intrinsic search behaviors of different optimization algorithms.

                arXiv:2601.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Stochastic Local Search (SLS) heuristics into a unique formal model. This model has two key components: a common structure designed to be as large as possible and a parametric structure intended to be as small as possible. Each heuristic is obtained by instantiating the parametric part in a different way. Particular instances for Genetic Algorithms (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are presented. Then, we use our model to prove the Turing-completeness of SLS algorithms in general. The proof uses our framework to construct a GA able to simulate any Turing machine. This Turing-completeness implies that determining any non-trivial property concerning the relationship between the inputs and the computed outputs is undecidable for GA and, by extension, for the general set of SLS methods (although not necessarily for each particular method). Similar proofs are more informally presented for PSO and ACO.

                arXiv:2601.11859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks increasingly relies on network slicing to provide tailored, End-to-End (E2E) logical networks over shared physical infrastructures. A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments.

                arXiv:2601.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of marine operations has intensified the need for intelligent robotic systems to support ocean observation, exploration, and resource management. Underwater swarm robotics offers a promising framework that extends the capabilities of individual autonomous platforms through collective coordination. Inspired by natural systems, such as fish schools and insect colonies, bio-inspired swarm approaches enable distributed decision-making, adaptability, and resilience under challenging marine conditions. Yet research in this field remains fragmented, with limited integration across algorithmic, communication, and hardware design perspectives. This review synthesises bio-inspired coordination mechanisms, communication strategies, and system design considerations for underwater swarm robotics. It examines key marine-specific algorithms, including the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm, Whale Optimisation Algorithm, Coral Reef Optimisation, and Marine Predators Algorithm, highlighting their applications in formation control, task allocation, and environmental interaction. The review also analyses communication constraints unique to the underwater domain and emerging acoustic, optical, and hybrid solutions that support cooperative operation. Additionally, it examines hardware and system design advances that enhance system efficiency and scalability. A multi-dimensional classification framework evaluates existing approaches across communication dependency, environmental adaptability, energy efficiency, and swarm scalability. Through this integrated analysis, the review unifies bio-inspired coordination algorithms, communication modalities, and system design approaches. It also identifies converging trends, key challenges, and future research directions for real-world deployment of underwater swarm systems.

Abstract: This paper argues that interpretability research in Artificial Intelligence is fundamentally ill-posed as existing definitions of interpretability are not *actionable*: they fail to provide formal principles from which concrete modelling and inferential rules can be derived. We posit that for a definition of interpretability to be actionable, it must be given in terms of *symmetries*. We hypothesise that four symmetries suffice to (i) motivate core interpretability properties, (ii) characterize the class of interpretable models, and (iii) derive a unified formulation of interpretable inference (e.g., alignment, interventions, and counterfactuals) as a form of Bayesian inversion.

                arXiv:2601.13079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spike timing offers a combinatorial address space, suggesting that timing-based spiking inference can be executed as lookup and routing rather than as dense multiply--accumulate. Yet most neuromorphic and photonic systems still digitize events into timestamps, bins, or rates and then perform selection in clocked logic. We introduce Polychronous Wave Computing (PWC), a timing-native address-selection primitive that maps relative spike latencies directly to a discrete output route in the wave domain. Spike times are phase-encoded in a rotating frame and processed by a programmable multiport interferometer that evaluates K template correlations in parallel; a driven--dissipative winner-take-all stage then performs a physical argmax, emitting a one-hot output port. We derive the operating envelope imposed by phase wrapping and mutual coherence, and collapse timing jitter, static phase mismatch, and dephasing into a single effective phase-noise budget whose induced winner--runner-up margin predicts boundary-first failures and provides an intensity-only calibration target. Simulations show that nonlinear competition improves routing fidelity compared with noisy linear intensity readout, and that hardware-in-the-loop phase tuning rescues a temporal-order gate from 55.9% to 97.2% accuracy under strong static mismatch. PWC provides a fast routing coprocessor for LUT-style spiking networks and sparse top-1 gates (e.g., mixture-of-experts routing) across polaritonic, photonic, and oscillator platforms.

                arXiv:2601.13518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent automated red-teaming methods show promise for systematically exposing model vulnerabilities, most existing approaches rely on human-specified workflows. This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement). This work highlights automated system design as a powerful paradigm for AI safety evaluation that can keep pace with rapidly evolving models.

Abstract: We introduce the Input-Connected Multilayer Perceptron (IC-MLP), a feedforward neural network architecture in which each hidden neuron receives, in addition to the outputs of the preceding layer, a direct affine connection from the raw input. We first study this architecture in the univariate setting and give an explicit and systematic description of IC-MLPs with an arbitrary finite number of hidden layers, including iterated formulas for the network functions. In this setting, we prove a universal approximation theorem showing that deep IC-MLPs can approximate any continuous function on a closed interval of the real line if and only if the activation function is nonlinear. We then extend the analysis to vector-valued inputs and establish a corresponding universal approximation theorem for continuous functions on compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

                arXiv:2507.05238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to represent formal languages-particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM): a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at precision logarithmically bounded in the input length, enabling SSMs to model a broad class of regular languages out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM and its hybrid variant-interleaved with Mamba-outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.

  We propose a biologically plausible algorithm for shortest-path computation that operates through local spike-based message-passing with realistic processing delays. The algorithm exploits spike-timing coincidences to identify nodes on optimal paths: Neurons that receive inhibitory-excitatory message pairs earlier than predicted reduce their response delays, creating a temporal compression that propagates backwards from target to source. Through analytical proof and simulations on random spatial networks, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges and discovers all shortest paths using purely timing-based mechanisms. By showing how short-term timing dynamics alone can compute shortest paths, this work provides new insights into how biological networks might solve complex computational problems through purely local computation and relative spike-time prediction. These findings open new directions for understanding distributed computation in biological and artificial systems, with possible implications for computational neuroscience, AI, reinforcement learning, and neuromorphic systems.

                arXiv:2512.05837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) serve as powerful black-box optimizers inspired by biological evolution. However, most existing EAs predominantly focus on heuristic operators such as crossover and mutation, while usually overlooking underlying physical interpretability such as statistical mechanics and thermosdynamics. This theoretical void limits the principled understanding of algorithmic dynamics, hindering the systematic design of evolutionary search beyond ad-hoc heuristics. To bridge this gap, we first point out that evolutionary optimization can be conceptually reframed as a physical phase transition process. Building on this perspective, we establish the theoretical grounds by modeling the optimization dynamics as a Wasserstein gradient flow of free energy. Consequently, a robust and interpretable solver named Wasserstein Evolution (WE) is proposed. WE mathematically frames the trade-off between exploration and exploitation as a competition between potential gradient forces and entropic forces. This formulation guarantees convergence to the Boltzmann distribution, thereby minimizing free energy and maximizing entropy, which promotes highly diverse solutions. Extensive experiments on complex multimodal and physical potential functions demonstrate that WE achieves superior diversity and stability compared to established baselines.

                arXiv:2601.10657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent's context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.

                arXiv:2312.10259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The target of Electronic Health Record (EHR) coding is to find the diagnostic codes according to the EHRs. In previous research, researchers have preferred to do multi-classification on the EHR coding task; most of them encode the EHR first and then process it to get the probability of each code based on the EHR representation. However, the question of complicating diseases is neglected among all these methods. In this paper, we propose a novel EHR coding framework, which is the first attempt at detecting complicating diseases, called ComplicaCode. This method refers to the idea of adversarial learning; a Path Generator and a Path Discriminator are designed to more efficiently finish the task of EHR coding. We propose a copy module to detect complicating diseases; by the proposed copy module and the adversarial learning strategy, we identify complicating diseases efficiently. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 57.30\% ratio of complicating diseases in predictions, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among cnn-based baselines, it also surpasses transformer methods in the complication detection task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model. According to the ablation study, the proposed copy mechanism plays a crucial role in detecting complicating diseases.

                arXiv:2405.19650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization can be found in many real-world applications where some conflicting objectives can not be optimized by a single solution. Existing optimization methods often focus on finding a set of Pareto solutions with different optimal trade-offs among the objectives. However, the required number of solutions to well approximate the whole Pareto optimal set could be exponentially large with respect to the number of objectives, which makes these methods unsuitable for handling many optimization objectives. In this work, instead of finding a dense set of Pareto solutions, we propose a novel Tchebycheff set scalarization method to find a few representative solutions (e.g., 5) to cover a large number of objectives (e.g., $>100$) in a collaborative and complementary manner. In this way, each objective can be well addressed by at least one solution in the small solution set. In addition, we further develop a smooth Tchebycheff set scalarization approach for efficient optimization with good theoretical guarantees. Experimental studies on different problems with many optimization objectives demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Fully tensorial theory of hypercomplex neural networks is given. It allows neural networks to use arithmetic based on arbitrary algebras. The key point is to observe that algebra multiplication can be represented as a rank three tensor and use this tensor in every algebraic operation. This approach is attractive for neural network libraries that support effective tensorial operations. It agrees with previous implementations for four-dimensional algebras. The proof of Universal Approximation Theorem for tensor formalism was given.

                arXiv:2505.05527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained momentum due to their high potential in time-series processing combined with minimal energy consumption. However, they still lack a dedicated and efficient training algorithm. The popular backpropagation with surrogate gradients, adapted from stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-derived algorithms, has several drawbacks when used as an optimizer for SNNs. Specifically, the approximation introduced by the use of surrogate gradients leads to numerical imprecision, poor tracking of SNN firing times at training time, and, in turn, poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN training method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our ADMM-based training aims to solve the problem of the SNN step function's non-differentiability by taking an entirely new approach with respect to gradient backpropagation. For the first time, we formulate the SNN training problem as an ADMM-based iterative optimization, derive closed-form updates, and empirically show the optimizer's convergence, its great potential, and discuss future and promising research directions to improve the method to different layer types and deeper architectures.

Abstract: The formal specification and verification of machine learning programs saw remarkable progress in less than a decade, leading to a profusion of tools. However, diversity may lead to fragmentation, resulting in tools that are difficult to compare, except for very specific benchmarks. Furthermore, this progress is heavily geared towards the specification and verification of a certain class of property, that is, local robustness properties. But while provers are becoming more and more efficient at solving local robustness properties, even slightly more complex properties, involving multiple neural networks for example, cannot be expressed in the input languages of winners of the International Competition of Verification of Neural Networks VNN-Comp. In this tool paper, we present CAISAR, an open-source platform dedicated to machine learning specification and verification. We present its specification language, suitable for modelling complex properties on neural networks, support vector machines and boosted trees. We show on concrete use-cases how specifications written in this language are automatically translated to queries to state-of-the-art provers, notably by using automated graph editing techniques, making it possible to use their off-the-shelf versions. The artifact to reproduce the paper claims is available at the following DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15209510

Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance. See www.graphbench.io for further details.

                arXiv:2512.09972v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating the capability-efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs) requires constructing a high-quality Pareto set. However, existing merging techniques remain inadequate: coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise optimization suffers from the curse of dimensionality, especially under tight evaluation budgets where each model candidate is costly to assess. We propose Bayesian Model Merging with Structural Importance Prior (SIP-BMM), an evolutionary loop framework driven by Log-Noisy Expected Hypervolume Improvement ($q$NEHVI) that makes layer-wise Pareto set construction tractable by explicitly modeling which layers matter. Specifically, SIP-BMM derives a \textbf{Structural Importance Prior (SIP)} from layer-wise task-vector differences between base and expert models, and uses this prior to Bayesian Optimization toward a low effective dimensional subspace. Intuitively, SIP steers the optimizer to spend most trials on a small set of influential layers while largely ignoring layers that exhibit minimal task-relevant shifts. This importance-aware search preserves layer-wise control while substantially reducing sample complexity. Experiments show that SIP-BMM discovers a stronger and denser Pareto front than competitive baselines, enabling agile model selection under diverse operational constraints. Code is available at: https://github.com/MiLab-HITSZ/2026-SIPBMM.

                This paper examines the complex interplay between urban land lease policy, state ownership, and neo-patrimonial practices in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. While Ethiopia’s urban land lease policy aims for equitable development, state ownership exacerbates neo-patrimonial dynamics, leading to distorted resource allocation and limited access for marginalized communities. Through key informant interviews and policy analysis, this study reveals how ethnic alignment and political loyalty influence land access, undermining the policy’s stated objectives. The findings highlight a disconnection between formal regulations and the lived experiences of urban residents, particularly those lacking political connections. Despite constitutional guarantees, a centralized decision-making process and limited accountability perpetuate inequality. The study concludes that institutional reforms are needed to decentralize power, enhance transparency, and integrate marginalized voices into land governance to realize equitable and sustainable urban development in Addis Ababa. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the challenges facing urban land management in neo-patrimonial contexts.

                Background Second-order linear boundary value problems arise in many applications of science and engineering and are commonly treated by reducing them to first-order systems, which increases the computational cost. Direct high-order methods that preserve the second-order structure are therefore of interest. Methods This study proposes fixed-step, high-order diagonally implicit Runge–Kutta–Nyström (DIRKN) methods for the direct numerical solution of special second-order linear boundary value problems. Two schemes, DIRKN(3,4) and DIRKN(4,5), are constructed and combined with a linear shooting technique to handle both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions without transforming the problem into a first-order system. Results The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using benchmark test problems and application models, including rod heat conduction and reaction–diffusion equations. Numerical results demonstrate that both schemes achieve high accuracy and good efficiency, with DIRKN(4,5) generally producing smaller errors for a comparable number of function evaluations. A linear stability analysis shows absolute stability intervals of (−1.96, 0) for DIRKN(3,4) and (−7.24, 0) for DIRKN(4,5). Conclusions The proposed DIRKN methods provide accurate and efficient solvers for second-order linear boundary value problems with different types of boundary conditions, while preserving the original problem structure and reducing computational cost.

                Background Cash transfer programmes have emerged as a critical tool for addressing food insecurity and economic vulnerability for poor households in drought-prone regions. However, majority of such programmes rely on standardized, flat-rate payments that fail to account for household-level variation in needs, composition and local context. This paper proposes a context specific model for determining cash transfer values tailored to household’s demographic and economic vulnerability, using minimum expenditure basket and household compositions. Approach Development of the model adopted the conceptual framework approach which helps to ensure that transfers are reasonable and responds to actual household needs, and is based on existing realities. The approach aims to support a more dignified and effective humanitarian response, reduce negative coping strategies and lay the foundation for long-term resilience-building in affected communities. Results A generic description of the model is presented alongside empirical scenarios for different household compositions and adequacy ratios demonstrating how cash values adjust according to household structure and coverage rates. The developed model provides a scalable and flexible framework for determining transfer amounts with the aim of improving targeting efficiency and equity. The developed model is useful to academicians, policy makers and social assistance practitioners. It offers methodological innovations including converting household members into adult equivalent units and incorporating economies of scale in devising equitable cash transfer values in a humanitarian context. However, future research is needed to explore hybrid models that combine needs-based approach with other income gap or geographical based approaches in order to facilitate administrative feasibility.

                Introduction Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma, accounting for over 86% of cases globally. As a major cause of irreversible blindness, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent disease progression. However, POAG is often diagnosed at advanced stages, due to insufficient and inconsistent screening in primary healthcare settings, negatively influencing prognosis and complicating treatment and management. Methods The development and conduct of this scoping review were guided by the 2020 Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines for conducting scoping reviews, following the framework established by Arksey and O’Malley. In alignment with the published protocol, systematic searches were conducted across several databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Web of Science and MEDLINE platforms. These searches focused on peer-reviewed articles published in English from January 2000 to March 2025. Resources were included if they reported on individuals who had been screened and diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) for the first time. Results A total of twenty-one resources were included in this review, with eight sourced from SSA (Sub-Saharan Africa). Of these studies, four focused specifically on screening for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), while the remaining studies concentrated on its diagnosis. Most of the research was conducted at the secondary healthcare level (n=12), and in the majority of these studies, screening was performed by eye specialists. The most commonly used equipment included visual acuity charts, tonometers, slit lamps, ophthalmoscopes, and Humphrey field analysers. Conclusion There is a significant need for screening of POAG at the primary health care level, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This will improve early detection of POAG, and subsequently reduce the prevalence of avoidable blindness.

                Background Hemoglobin A1c is widely recognized as an indicator of long-term glucose control in patients with diabetes. Its measurement, however, can be influenced by several hemoglobin disorders, including the β-thalassemia trait, which is relatively common in the Middle East. Methods This work compared manual HbA1c testing procedures with an automated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique in diabetic patients carrying the β-thalassemia trait. Sixty diagnosed diabetic cases with confirmed β-thalassemia were included from Fallujah Teaching Hospital. HbA1c was analyzed by three procedures: Variant II HPLC, ion-exchange resin, and Turbidimetric immunoassay. Data were processed using ANOVA, t-test, and Pearson correlation in SPSS, considering p < 0.05 significant. Results Differences among the tested methods were clearly evident. Measurements obtained by the automated HPLC system were generally higher mean (9.2%) than those recorded with the Turbidimetric immunoassay (7.58%) and the ion-exchange resin technique (7.96%). The observed gap between automated and manual estimations, reaching 1.5% and 1.15% respectively, was found to be statistically significant. HbA1c values demonstrated a strong positive correlation with HbA values in all three analytical methods (r > 0.82, p < 0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that manual assays would be expected to erroneously underestimate HbA1c levels in β-thalassemia carriers, which could significantly affect its clinical interpretation. The NGSP-standardized HPLC method was the most reliable for the accurate measurement of HbA1c and reflects more precisely glycemic control in patients with variant haemoglobins.

                Objective This follow-up study had two primary aims: (1) to evaluate the sustainability of effects from Adoption-Specific Therapy (ADAPT) on adopted children’s behavioral problems and attachment security, and on adoptive parents’ stress, three months post-intervention; and (2) to investigate the mechanisms underlying these sustained changes through advanced mediation analysis. Method The study presents secondary analysis of three-month follow-up data from a randomized controlled trial. A sample of 25 Iranian adoptive families (12 in the ADAPT group, 13 in waitlist control) completed assessments at pre-test (T1), post-test (T2), and three-month follow-up (T3). Measures included the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), the Kinship Center Attachment Questionnaire (KCAQ), and the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF). Sustainability was tested using Repeated-Measures MANCOVA. To examine mechanisms, nine parallel and serial mediation models were tested using Hayes’ PROCESS macro, with T3 scores as mediators/outcomes, controlling for baseline scores. Results The RM-MANCOVA revealed a significant and large Group × Time interaction (Pillai’s Trace = .777, *p* = .001). Gains in the ADAPT group on all outcomes were maintained at T3 with no significant decay from T2 to T3, while the control group remained stable. Mediation analyses indicated that ADAPT exerted significant direct effects on all three T3 outcomes (behavior, attachment, stress). However, no single, linear mediation pathway (parallel or serial) was statistically significant. The pattern of results supports a reciprocal, systemic model of change, where improvements in child behavior, attachment security, and parental stress mutually reinforce one another to sustain treatment gains. Conclusion The findings confirm that the benefits of ADAPT are sustained three months after treatment. More importantly, they suggest that its efficacy stems not from a simple causal chain but from initiating a positive, reciprocal cycle of change within the adoptive family system. This underscores the value of integrated, family-system interventions in post-adoption support.

                Background Difficult-to-treat (difficult) asthma remains a significant public health challenge, with poor control leading to increased exacerbations, reduced quality of life (QoL), and greater healthcare use. Physical inactivity, obesity, breathing pattern disorders, and psychological distress contribute to symptom burden and exacerbation risk. Exercise training, breathing retraining, dietary intervention, behavioural change and emotional self-management have shown benefits in improving asthma control, fitness, and QoL. However, engagement remains a challenge. This study will evaluate whether a structured, community-based multimodal intervention integrating supervised exercise, breathing retraining, and behaviour change support can improve asthma control and patient outcomes in individuals with difficult asthma. Methods LIBERTY is a single-centre pilot study evaluating the delivery and preliminary impact of a structured, community-based multimodal intervention in patients with difficult asthma. Participants will undertake a 24-week programme incorporating supervised exercise, breathing retraining, dietary intervention, behavioural change and emotional self-management. Participants will be recruited from severe asthma clinics and research databases. The pilot study will assess key process outcomes, including recruitment and retention rates, adherence, safety, and acceptability of the intervention. The primary clinical outcome is change in the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) and will be assessed to inform the design and sample size calculations for a future definitive trial. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, exercise capacity, symptom burden, and emotional wellbeing. Exploratory outcomes include mechanistic biomarker analysis. Participants will be followed up for six months after the intervention, to a total study duration of 12 months. Conclusions The LIBERTY pilot trial will assess whether a structured, multimodal intervention incorporating exercise, breathing retraining, behavioural change, and emotional self-management support, is feasible and accpetable to patients, and can improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes in patients with severe asthma.

                Introduction Ramadan fasting is practiced by millions of people with epilepsy worldwide. However, evidence on seizure outcomes during fasting is sparse in South-East Asia (SEA), where dietary and sleep-wave patterns differ from Middle Eastern cohorts. This multicenter study evaluated seizure frequency changes and associated factors among Indonesian Muslim people with epilepsy (MPWE) who fast during Ramadan. Methods A prospective pre-post multicentered observational cohort study was initiated in March 2023 – May 2024 across five hospitals and three cities in Indonesia. Participants were MPWE aged over 18 years old. Data were collected from the same participants one month before and during Ramadan at outpatient neurology clinics. Demography and clinical characteristics, along with Ramadan observance status, medication adherence, sleep duration, and quality of life, were assessed through medical records and questionnaires. Associations with seizure frequency change were analyzed using bivariate analysis and logistic regression. Results Among 122 participants, 102 (83.6%) fasted during Ramadan; 25.9% reported increased seizures. All individuals who were seizure-free pre-Ramadan remained seizure free. Carbohydrate over consumption at iftar independently predicted seizure increase (OR 3.816;95% CI 1.364-10.675). Sleep duration during Ramadan was not significantly associated to changes of seizure frequency. Conclusion Ramadan fasting appears safe for MPWE with prior seizure freedom. Excessive carbohydrate intake at iftar may elevate seizure risk, representing a modifiable intervention target. This study provides the first multicenter Indonesian evidence to inform culturally tailored clinical guidance for fasting decisions in epilepsy.

                Background Monitoring childhood growth is essential for early identification of nutritional and health-related disparities. Age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES) are key determinants of physical development, yet region-specific data on their combined influence remain limited in South Asia. Thus, this study aimed to assess the impact of age, gender, and SES on anthropometric parameters—weight, height, and body mass index (BMI)—among primary school children in Bangladesh, and to explore disparities in growth patterns across different demographic groups. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 children (150 boys, 150 girls) from grades one to five in six purposively selected schools representing urban, suburban, and rural settings in Dhaka. Anthropometric data were collected using standardized procedures. SES was assessed through a structured questionnaire incorporating household income, parental education, and occupation. Statistical analyses included independent t-tests, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s HSD post hoc tests, and Pearson correlation. Results Anthropometric measures increased progressively with age, with significant differences in BMI across grade levels (F(4, 295) = 17.879, p < 0.001). No statistically significant gender differences were observed in weight, height, or BMI (p > 0.05). SES significantly influenced physical development; children from higher SES backgrounds had greater mean weight and height than those from lower SES groups (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis revealed strong associations between SES and both weight (r ≈ 0.7) and height (r ≈ 0.6), while BMI was moderately associated with weight (r ≈ 0.6) and inversely with height (r ≈ –0.3). The study highlights age-related growth trends and significant SES-based disparities in physical development among Bangladeshi schoolchildren. Conclusion These findings underscore the need for targeted public health policies, nutritional interventions, and school-based monitoring programs to address inequalities in child growth and ensure equitable development opportunities.

                This study aims to examine the influence of networking capabilities and transformational organizational characteristics on digital adoption, as well as its impact on port performance at container ports in Indonesia. This study also analyzes the mediating role of digital adoption in the relationship between organizational capabilities and port performance. The study uses an explanatory design with a quantitative approach through a survey method. Data were collected using structured questionnaires from 103 container ports throughout Indonesia with respondents being decision makers and core port function managers, namely General Managers or Operations Managers or Marketing Manag-ers if the General Manager was not available. Data analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling with a Partial Least Squares approach through SmartPLS. The results of the study indicate that networking and transformational organizational capabilities have a significant effect on digital adoption, and digital adoption has a significant effect on port performance. This study also found that digital adoption significantly mediates the relationship between transformational organization and port performance. However, this study does not prove that digital adoption mediates the influence of net-working capability on port performance.

                <p>by Zhijian Hu, Yuzhen Wu, Tomas Freire, Erida Gjini, Kevin Wood</p>

Drugs play a central role in limiting bacterial population spread, yet laboratory studies typically assume well-mixed environments when assessing microbial drug responses. In contrast, bacteria in the human body often occupy spatially structured habitats where drug concentrations vary. Understanding how this heterogeneity shapes growth and decline is therefore essential for controlling infections and mitigating resistance evolution. Here, we developed a minimal robot-automated system to study how spatial drug heterogeneity affects short-term population dynamics in <i>E. faecalis</i>, a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen. This system was combined with a theoretical framework to interpret and explain the observed outcomes. We first recapitulated the classic critical-patch-size model result: in a spatially homogeneous environment, a population persists in a finite domain only when growth outpaces diffusive losses at the boundaries. In heterogeneous environments, we found certain conditions that population persistence can depend critically on the spatial arrangement of the drug, even when its total amount is fixed. Using theoretical and experimental approaches, we identified the arrangements that produce the strongest growth and the fastest decline, revealing the range of possible outcomes under drug heterogeneity. We further tested this framework in more complex environments, including ring-shaped communities, and observed consistent arrangement-dependent behavior. Overall, our results extend the classical growth-condition framework to general heterogeneous environments and demonstrate that spatial drug arrangement - not only total dose - can strongly influence bacterial population dynamics. These findings highlight the importance of spatially structured dosing strategies and motivate further theoretical and experimental investigation.

                <p>by Ryan Pellow, Josep M. Comeron</p>

Eukaryotes’ genomes are organized within nuclei in three-dimensional space, forming structures such as loops, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromosome territories. This 3D architecture impacts gene regulation and development, stress responses, and disease. However, current methods to infer these 3D structures from genomic data have multiple drawbacks, including varying outcomes depending on the resolution of the analysis and sequencing depth, qualitative outputs that limit statistical comparisons, and insufficient insight into structure frequency within samples. These challenges hinder rigorous comparisons of 3D properties across genomes, conditions, or species. To overcome these issues, we developed WaveTAD, a wavelet transform-based method that provides a resolution-free, probabilistic, and hierarchical description of 3D organization. WaveTAD generates TAD strengths, capturing variable frequency of intrachromosomal interactions within samples, and shows increased accuracy and sensitivity over existing methods. We applied WaveTAD to multiple datasets from <i>Drosophila</i>, mouse, and humans to illustrate new biological insights that our more sensitive and quantitative approach provides, such as the widespread presence of embryonic 3D organization before zygotic genome activation, the effect of multiple CTCF units on the stability of loops and TADs, and the association between gene expression and TAD structures in COVID-19 patients or sex-specific transcription in <i>Drosophila</i>.

                <p>by Shuvadip Dutta, Adarshkrishnan Rajakumar, Ranjith Padinhateeri, Mithun K. Mitra</p>

Protein molecules must efficiently locate specific DNA sequences within the densely packed chromatin of the cell nucleus. We investigate how the spatial organisation of chromatin, specifically into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), fundamentally affects this search process. Using exact analytical theory and simulations of different models of chromatin, we show that target search within compact, highly connected chromatin domains can leverage intersegmental jumps to significantly decrease search times. Further, we show that there exists an optimal degree of polymer compaction that minimizes the search time for proteins to find their targets. We show that for highly folded domains, rather than bulk diffusion, intersegmental transfers – jumping between chromatin segments that are close together in space – drive the optimal search process. Remarkably, when we analyse 8,355 TAD structures across the human genome, we find that their natural connectivity matches with the theoretical optimum predicted by our model. The structural organisation within TADs significantly reduces protein search times far beyond what is achievable through classical facilitated diffusion. In essence, our work suggests that packaging of chromatin inside the nucleus has implications beyond spatial organisation, and is also intricately linked to dynamics of proteins inside the nuclear environment.

                <p>by Adam A. Malik, Cecilia Krona, Soumi Kundu, Philip Gerlee, Sven Nelander</p>

Patient-derived cells (PDC) mouse xenografts are increasingly important tools in glioblastoma (GBM) research, essential to investigate case-specific growth patterns and treatment responses. Despite the central role of xenograft models in the field, few good simulation models are available to probe the dynamics of tumor growth and to support therapy design. We therefore propose a new framework for the patient-specific simulation of GBM in the mouse brain. Unlike existing methods, our simulations leverage a high-resolution map of the mouse brain anatomy to yield patient-specific results that are in good agreement with experimental observations. To facilitate the fitting of our model to histological data, we use Approximate Bayesian Computation. Because our model uses few parameters, reflecting growth, invasion and niche dependencies, it is well suited for case comparisons and for probing treatment effects. We demonstrate how our model can be used to simulate different treatment by perturbing the different model parameters. We expect in silico replicates of mouse xenograft tumors can improve the assessment of therapeutic outcomes and boost the statistical power of preclinical GBM studies.

                <p>by Georgia R. Weatherley, Robyn P. Araujo, Samantha J. Dando, Adrianne L. Jenner</p>

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which misdirected, persistent activity of the immune system degrades the protective myelin sheaths of nerve axons. Historically, treatment of MS has relied on disease-modifying therapies that involve immunosuppression, such as targeting of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to restrict lymphocyte movement. New therapeutic ideas in the development pipeline are instead designed to promote populations of myelin producing cells, oligodendrocytes, by exploiting their innate resilience to the stressors of MS or restoring their numbers. Given the significant advancements made in immunological disease understanding due to mathematical and computational modelling, we sought to develop a platform to (1) interrogate our understanding of the neuroimmunological mechanisms driving MS development and (2) examine the impact of different therapeutic strategies. To this end we propose a novel, open-source, agent-based model of lesion development in the CNS. Our model includes crucial populations of T cells, perivascular macrophages, and oligodendrocytes. We examine the sensitivity of the model to key parameters related to disease targets and conclude that lesion stabilisation can be achieved when targeting the integrated stress response of oligodendrocytes. Most significantly, complete prevention of lesion formation is observed when a combination of approved BBB-permeability targeting therapies and integrated-stress response targeting therapies is administered, suggesting the potential to strike a balance between a patient’s immune inflammation and their reparative capacity. Given that there are many open questions surrounding the etiology and treatment of MS, we hope that this malleable platform serves as a tool for experimentalists and modellers to test and generate further hypotheses regarding this disease.

Collagen damage in articular cartilage plays a key role in post-traumatic osteoarthritis, but the underlying mechanobiological pathways leading to collagen fibril degeneration after injury remain incompletely understood. We hypothesized that mechanical injurious loading induces localized cellular damage in cartilage, which in turn triggers the release of collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and depth-wise collagen loss. To investigate this, we developed a computational mechano-signaling model for injured bovine cartilage, in which injury-induced cell damage is caused by excessive localized shear strains, leading to downstream MMP release, and spatially heterogeneous collagen degradation. The model predictions were compared to <i>ex vivo</i> cartilage explant experiments over 12 days post-injury. By day 12, the simulated bulk and depth-wise collagen loss aligned with our experimental findings quantified via Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy imaging (~30% average loss in the model vs. ~ 35% in the experiment). The results suggest that injury-induced cell damage and the downstream MMP activity can partly explain the depth-wise collagen content loss observed in the early days after cartilage injury. Ultimately, combining the current mechanistic approach with joint-level computational models could enhance the prediction of the onset and progression of cartilage degeneration following joint trauma.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013136">Higher-level spatial prediction in natural vision across mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Micha Heilbron, Floris P. de Lange</p>

Theories of predictive processing propose that sensory systems constantly predict incoming signals, based on spatial and temporal context. However, evidence for prediction in sensory cortex largely comes from artificial experiments using simple, highly predictable stimuli, that arguably encourage prediction. Here, we test for sensory prediction during natural scene perception. Specifically, we use deep generative modelling to quantify the spatial predictability of receptive field (RF) patches in natural images, and compared those predictability estimates to brain responses in the mouse visual cortex—while rigorously accounting for established tuning to a rich set of low-level image features and their local statistical context—in a large scale survey of high-density recordings from the Allen Institute Brain Observatory. This revealed four insights. First, cortical responses across the mouse visual system are shaped by sensory predictability, with more predictable image patches evoking weaker responses. Secondly, visual cortical neurons are primarily sensitive to the predictability of higher-level image features, even in neurons in the primary visual areas that are preferentially tuned to low-level visual features. Third, unpredictability sensitivity is stronger in the superficial layers of primary visual cortex, in line with predictive coding models. Finally, these spatial prediction effects are independent of recent experience, suggesting that they rely on long-term priors about the structure of the visual world. Together, these results suggest visual cortex might predominantly predict sensory information at higher levels of abstraction—a pattern bearing striking similarities to recent, successful techniques from artificial intelligence for predictive self-supervised learning.

                <p>by Rachael Julia Yuenyinn Tan, Yalei Liu, Weixin Chen, Yuteng Liang, Guang Sheng Ling</p>

Immunometabolism, a fundamental biogenic process that supports the function of immune cells, is often disrupted in diseases such as cancer. Tackling metabolic dysregulation at a cellular level has therefore emerged as a focus in drug development. However, as cellular metabolic rewiring takes place in response to both intrinsic factors, which can be targeted pharmacologically, and environmental changes, which cannot, fostering a homeostatic systemic metabolism through diet, exercise, and stress management is essential to support and sustain cellular fitness. This Essay conceptualizes immunometabolism as a process that can be regulated intrinsically and extrinsically and explores the potential for incorporating lifestyle changes and drug therapies that target immunometabolism into treatments for cancer.

Object recognition requires integrated processing that extends beyond the visual cortex, incorporating semantic and memory-related processes. However, it remains unclear how different attributes, such as visual, semantic, and memorability features, are encoded and interact during perception. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography from 5,143 channels while participants viewed natural object images. We systematically characterized the spatiotemporal patterns of neural encoding for visual, semantic, and memorability attributes and showed that memorability was encoded in a distributed manner, which can be dissociated from visual and semantic coding. While the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) was engaged in encoding all three attributes, the representations were dissociable. Interestingly, memorability representations in the prefrontal cortex appeared to arise from integrated visual and semantic signals from the VTC; and memorability influenced early stages of visual and semantic processing. Our results were corroborated by high-resolution 7T fMRI, which revealed continuous encoding across the brain, and further validated using a separate dataset featuring within-category object variability. Lastly, single-neuron recordings confirmed semantic and memorability coding in the medial temporal lobe. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of how visual, semantic, and memorability attributes are dynamically encoded across the brain, highlighting the complex interplay between these attributes that collectively shape object recognition and memory formation.

                <p>by Komal Panchal Suthar, Caitlin Hounsell, Yun Fan, Andreas Bergmann</p>

Caspases, traditionally viewed as mediators of apoptosis and tumor suppressors, have also been shown to promote cell proliferation and to contribute to tumor growth. For example, the initiator caspase Dronc (the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of Caspase-9) can trigger apoptosis-induced proliferation (AiP), a process where apoptotic cells generate mitogenic signals for compensatory proliferation independently of their apoptotic function. AiP is crucial for homeostatic cell turnover, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. Previously, we established that Dronc activates the NADPH oxidase DUOX at the plasma membrane, resulting in the production of extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are required for AiP. However, the mechanism by which Dronc activates DUOX has remained elusive. Here, we identified Dronc-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the cytosol as a significant factor for DUOX activation and AiP. Three cell surface Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels of the TRP family mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in a non-redundant fashion. Additionally, calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from the ER was identified as another source of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> during AiP. Notably, DUOX itself acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> effector in AiP, requiring Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding for its activation. These findings highlight the importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in AiP and provide insights into how similar signaling mechanisms might operate in vertebrates.

                <p>by Petros Skiadas, Melanie N. Mendel, Joyce Elberse, Guido Van den Ackerveken, Ronnie de Jonge, Michael F. Seidl</p>

Filamentous plant pathogens secrete effectors to successfully establish host infections. In resistant crop varieties, plant immunity can be triggered by immune receptors that recognize these effectors. Resistant crop varieties are grown in large-scale monocultures imposing strong selection pressure on pathogens, driving rapid evolution of effector repertoires resulting in the frequent breakdowns of resistance within just a few growing seasons. The oomycete <i>Peronospora effusa</i>, responsible for downy mildew on spinach, is an example of a rapidly adapting pathogen, but it is yet unknown how <i>P. effusa</i> can successfully overcome resistance of spinach by genomic adaptations. To close this knowledge gap, we here generated genome assemblies and constructed a pangenome graph for 19 isolates corresponding to 19 officially denominated resistance-breaking <i>P. effusa</i> races, which can cause disease on a differential set of spinach cultivars. Haplotype-resolved pangenome graph analyses revealed that many isolates emerged from recent sexual recombination, yet others evolved via prolonged asexual reproduction and loss of heterozygosity. By phasing effector candidates to determine their allelic variation, we identified effector candidates associated to resistance breaking of spinach varieties and reconstructed the evolutionary events that led to their diversification. The here developed and applied computational genomics approaches offer invaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms of the rapid evolution of <i>P. effusa</i>, and points to potential targets for future resistance breeding.

Cochlear hair cells are essential for hearing, and their stereocilia bundles are critical for mechanotransduction. However, analyzing the 3D morphology of these bundles can be challenging due to their complex organization and the presence of other cellular structures in the tissue. To address this, we developed VASCilia (Vision Analysis StereoCilia), a Napari plugin suite that automates the analysis of 3D confocal microscopy datasets of phalloidin-stained cochlear hair cell bundles. VASCilia includes five deep learning-based models trained on mouse cochlear datasets that streamline the analysis process, including: (1) Z-Focus Tracker (ZFT) for selecting relevant slices in a 3D image stack; (2) PCPAlignNet (Planar Cell Polarity Alignment Network) for automated orientation of image stacks; (3) a segmentation model for identifying and delineating stereocilia bundles; (4) a tonotopic Position Prediction tool; and (5) a classification tool for identifying hair cell subtypes. In addition, VASCilia provides automated computational tools and measurement capabilities. Using VASCilia, we demonstrate its utility on challenging datasets, including neonatal wild type and <i>Eps8</i> KO 5-day old mice). We further showcase its power by quantifying complex bundle disorganization in <i>Cdh23</i><sup>−/−</sup> cochleae via texture analysis, which revealed systematically more heterogeneous and less regular bundles than littermate controls. These case studies demonstrate the power of VASCilia in facilitating detailed quantitative analysis of stereocilia. VASCilia also provides a user-friendly interface that allows researchers to easily navigate and use the tool, with the added capability to reload all their analyses for review or sharing purposes. We believe that VASCilia will be a valuable resource for researchers studying cochlear hair cell development and function, addressing a longstanding need in the hair cell research community for specialized deep learning-based tools capable of high-throughput image quantitation. We have released our code along with a manually annotated dataset that includes approximately 55 3D stacks featuring instance segmentation (https://github.com/ucsdmanorlab/Napari-VASCilia). This dataset comprises a total of 502 inner and 1,703 outer hair cell bundles annotated in 3D. As the first open-source dataset of its kind, we aim to establish a foundational resource for constructing a comprehensive atlas of cochlea hair cell images. Ultimately, this initiative will support the development of foundational models adaptable to various species, markers, and imaging scales to accelerate advances within the hearing research community.

                <p>by David Alvarez-Ponce, Gabrial Batz, Luis Ramirez Torres</p>

Women are underrepresented in academia—especially in STEMM fields, at top institutions, and in senior positions. This is due, at least in part, to the many obstacles that they face compared to their male counterparts. There has been substantial debate as to whether the peer review system is biased against women. Some studies—mostly based on analyses of thousands of Economics research articles—have shown that manuscripts authored by women experience longer peer review times (defined as the time intervened from submission to acceptance) than comparable manuscripts authored by men. Other studies, however, have found no effect of author’s gender on acceptance delays, raising questions about whether the gender gap is specific to certain fields. Biomedical and life scientists produce 36% of the research articles published annually worldwide; therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how women are treated by the peer review system requires a thorough examination of biomedicine and the life sciences. By analyzing all articles indexed in the PubMed database (>36.5 million articles published in >36,000 biomedical and life sciences journals), we show that the median amount of time spent under review is 7.4%–14.6% longer for female-authored articles than for male-authored articles, and that differences remain significant after controlling for several factors. The gender gap is pervasive, affecting most disciplines, regardless of how well women are represented in each discipline; however, the gap is absent or even reversed in some disciplines. We also show that authors based in low-income countries tend to experience longer review times. Our findings contribute to explaining the gender gap in publication rates and representation.

                <p>by Erika Stewart, Louisa G. Zielke, Antje R. de Boer, Gabrielle Guillaume Boulaire, Sarah D. Power, Tomás J. Ryan</p>

Infantile amnesia, the inability to recall episodic memories formed during early childhood, is a hallmark of postnatal brain development. Yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This work aimed to gain a better mechanistic understanding of infantile amnesia. Microglia, specialized macrophages of the central nervous system, are known to play an important role in synaptic refinement during postnatal development and have recently been implicated in memory-related functions. Using mouse models, we identified microglia as key regulators of memory accessibility in infancy. We profiled dynamic changes in microglial morphology across the postnatal window that paralleled the onset of infantile forgetting. We found that pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity during a specific postnatal window prevents infantile amnesia for a contextual fear memory, implicating microglia as active modulators of infant memory persistence. Using activity-dependent tagging of infant encoded engram cells, we demonstrated that microglial inhibition alters engram size and engram reactivation in the amygdala and results in changes in microglia–engram cell interactions. Furthermore, we characterized a relationship between microglial dysfunction and the lack of infantile amnesia in maternal immune activation offspring. Together, these findings reveal a novel role for microglia in regulating infant memory retrieval in mice and suggest that microglial dysfunction may contribute to altered memory trajectories in neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Introduction University students, faculty, and staff in the UAE represent a diverse and educated community that can play a vital role in promoting awareness and acceptance of organ donation. Assessing their knowledge is essential to addressing misconceptions and fostering a culture supportive of organ donation. Objective The present study aimed to assess knowledge to determine the prevalence of personal or family history of organ donation; examine the association between socio-demographic factors and knowledge of organ donation; and identify predictors of knowledge among university populations in the UAE. Methods A cross-sectional survey using convenience sampling was conducted among university students, faculty, and staff at the three major universities in Ajman, UAE. A validated self-administered questionnaire comprising 11 items with a scoring system was used to assess the knowledge. Participants who scored ≤50% of the total knowledge scores were considered to have poor knowledge. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 29. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis to explore associations and predictors of knowledge. Results A total of 607 participants were included in the study. Among them, 70.8% had adequate knowledge about organ donation. Significant differences were found in the percentage of adequate knowledge across students, faculty, and staff (p<0.017), between the universities <0.001, and between colleges 0.003. Knowledge was significantly associated with a personal or family history of receiving organs (0.012) and with a personal or family history of donating organs (0.002). A higher likelihood of adequate knowledge was found among faculty compared to students (AOR, 2.668,95%CI: 1.095-6.502,p=0.031), participants from University Offering medical programs compared to those from other universities (AOR, 1.767, 95%CI: 1.028-3.038,p=0.039), participants from medical colleges compared to those from other colleges (AOR, 2.246, 95%CI: 1.079-4.674, p=0.031), personal or family history of donating organs (AOR, 0.258, 95%CI: 0.102-0.656, p= 0.004), and attitudes towards organ donation (AOR, 2.122, 95%CI: 1.381-3.259, p= <0.001).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-85/v1?src=rss">Comparative Efficacy of Iontophoresis with APF Gel and Iontophoresis with Commercially Available Toothpastes (Elsenz® and Perfora) in the Management of Dentinal Hypersensitivity - A 3 months Follow-Up randomized Controlled Trial [version 1; peer review: a</a></h4>

              
                Objectives This investigation assessed and comparedthree widely used desensitizing products— Elsenz® toothpaste, Perfora Sensitive Toothpaste, and Fluorotop Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride (APF) gel—each paired with iontophoresis, to determine their effectiveness in alleviating dentinal hypersensitivity among adults. Materials and Methods A randomized, parallel-group clinical trial involved 27 adults aged 18–65 years, each presenting with dentinal hypersensitivity and meeting specific inclusion criteria. Participants were allocated into three treatment arms, each receiving either Elsenz, Perfora, or APF gel in conjunction with iontophoresis. Pain responses to tactile and evaporative stimuli were quantified using a visual analogue scale prior to intervention, immediately after, and at scheduled follow-ups over three months. Retreatment was offered if needed, while all participants used identical oral hygiene tools and practices throughout the study. Results All treatment groups demonstrated meaningful reductions in sensitivity. Perfora Sensitive Toothpaste combined with iontophoresis produced the swiftest and most pronounced decline in reported pain levels, frequently resolving hypersensitivity after the initial use. Elsenz® toothpaste required repeated applications for optimal benefit, while APF gel resulted in less enduring relief compared to the alternatives. Statistical assessments confirmed significant differences favoring the Perfora group for durable symptom management. Conclusion The findings indicate that, among the products tested, Perfora Sensitive Toothpaste delivered with iontophoresis provided the most effective and lasting reduction in dentinal hypersensitivity. This outcome may be linked to its formulation and mode of application, positioning it as a strong candidate for early intervention in hypersensitivity cases. Larger-scale studies with extended observation are encouraged to confirm these promising results. The trial was prospectively registered in the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI) under the registration number CTRI/2025/09/095193. The study was conducted from [03/10/2025 to 3/1/2026].

                Background Migraine is a leading cause of disability worldwide, often complicated by cervical dysfunction and central sensitization. Non-phamacological strategies such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and osteopathic manual therapy show promise, but their combined efficacy remains underexplored. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of combining active tDCS with physiotherapy compared to sham tDCS plus physiotherapy in patients with chronic migraine. Methods A single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at Sri Aurobindo University, India. A total of 160 participants with chronic migraine were randomized into two groups: Experimental Group A (Active tDCS + Cranio-cervical osteopathic therapy) and Control Group B (sham tDCS + Cranio-cervical osteopathic therapy). Interventions were delivered over six weeks (18 sessions). The outcomes were pain intensity measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), headache frequency and duration, pressure pain threshold (PPT), balance (MiniBESTest), quality of life (SF-36), Migraine Disability Assessment Score (MIDAS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Migraine Symptom Severity Score (MSSS). Statistical analyses employed ANCOVA and linear mixed-effects models with false discovery rate correction. Results Compared with controls, GroupA demonstrated significantly greater reduction in VAS (= 2.10, p < 0.001, d = 1.15), headache frequency (∆ = 1.85/week, p < 0.001) and duration (∆ =9.45 minutes/day, p < 0.001). Significant improvements were also observed in trapezius PPT, balance (+4.30 points, p < 0.001), quality of life, dsability and symptom severity. No between-group differences was noted for the sub-occipital PPT, anterior scalene PPT and PSQI. Conclusion Active tDCS combined with physiotherapy provides superior clinical benefits over sham stimulation, reducing migraine intensity, frequency, disability and improving function and qulaity of life. This multimodal approach addresses both central sensitization and peripheral dysfunction, support its role as an effective non-phamacological strategy in migrain management. Trial Registration Enrolled in the International Clinical Trials Registry on December 20, 2021 (CTRI/2021/12/038734). On July 18, 2020, the Sri Aurobindo Institute of Allied Health & Paramedical Sciences’ Research & Ethical Committee gave its approval.

                Abstract Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is a critical technology for enhancing the reliability, flexibility, and efficiency of renewable energy systems. This review paper provides an inclusive study of TES mechanisms like sensible heat storage (SHS), latent heat storage (LHS), thermochemical energy storage (TCES), and hybrid systems, and emphasizing their operating principle, material property, and application context. Key performance indicators such as energy density (50–1200 kJ/kg), efficiency (70–95%), and thermal conductivity (0.2–10 W/m·K) are systematically assessed alongside environmental impacts and recyclability. This paper shows thermal energy storage options by incorporating nano-enhanced phase change materials, reversible thermochemical reactions for seasonal storage, and innovative system designs that improve operational responsiveness and grid integration. Despite substantial advancements in thermal energy storage technologies, several critical challenges continue to hinder their widespread adoption and long-term reliability. Issues of material durability, economic feasibility, and large-scale deployment remain unresolved, especially for high-temperature and long-duration storage applications. Addressing these limitations is essential to unlock the full potential of TES in supporting sustainable energy systems. This paper reviews that to emphasize individual storage mechanisms, synthesizes technological progress, deployment insights, and regional relevance to establish a framework for selecting and advancing TES solutions that support low-carbon energy transitions, industrial decarbonization, and climate-resilient infrastructure.

                Atypical phonological processing is at the core of developmental dyslexia and is linked to aberrant tracking and analysis of auditory information in the cortex. Despite the importance of these mechanisms for speech processing and linguistic development, oral language comprehension in dyslexia remains largely intact. Recent findings suggest that dyslexia-linked atypical cortical processing patterns reflect both underlying deficits and compensatory strategies. This review synthesizes recent evidence linking atypical cortical tracking of auditory information in dyslexia, language development, and neurocognitive mechanisms of adaptive and resilient speech comprehension. We propose hemispheric rebalancing of linguistic analysis as a key compensatory mechanism in dyslexia, supported by interhemispheric connectivity within the distributed bilateral language network and greater reliance on lexico-semantic features during speech processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103332">Identification of a sub-population of synovial mesenchymal stem cells with enhanced treatment efficacy in a rat model of osteoarthritis</a></h4>

              
                Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful, debilitating disease with no cure or treatments that can predictably stop/reverse its progression. Treatment is particularly difficult since articular cartilage lacks intrinsic repair capacity, despite mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) being present in the joint with robust chondrogenic potential. While heterogeneity exists among MSC subtypes within human synovium, it remains unclear which populations can regenerate cartilage or impact OA progression. We clonally isolated MSCs from normal and OA patient synovium using indexed flow cytometry, then characterized them through differentiation assays and quantitative proteomics. MSC clones were transplanted into a xenograft rat OA model and evaluated by histology and immunofluorescence. We identified heterogeneity in putative MSCs within and between patient groups and their repair capacity in the rat model. However, traditional cell surface markers could not distinguish these subtypes, highlighting the need for single-cell level understanding. Using unbiased proteomics, we identified CD47 as a novel MSC marker. CD47<sup>Hi</sup> cells demonstrated robust treatment efficacy in the rat OA model and directly contributed to new articular cartilage formation. Characterizing MSC subtypes is essential for identifying candidates appropriate for clinical investigation and exploiting functional MSCs for cartilage regeneration strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107582">ATAD2 mediates chromatin-bound histone chaperone turnover</a></h4>

              
                ATAD2, a conserved protein which is predominantly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells and spermatogenic cells, emerges as a crucial regulator of chromatin plasticity. Our previous parallel studies conducted in both ES cells and <i>S. pombe</i> highlighted the fundamental role of ATAD2 in facilitating chromatin-bound histone chaperone turnover. Focusing on mouse spermatogenesis, we demonstrate here that ATAD2 regulates the HIRA-dependent localization of H3.3 on the genome and influences H3.3-mediated gene transcription. Moreover, by modulating histone eviction and the assembly of protamines, ATAD2 ensures proper chromatin condensation and genome packaging in mature sperm. Disruption of <i>Atad2</i> function in mice leads to abnormal genome organization in mature spermatozoa. Together, these findings establish a previously overlooked level of chromatin dynamic regulation, governed by ATAD2-controlled histone chaperones binding to chromatin, which defines the balance between histone deposition and removal.

                The function of the neocortex is fundamentally determined by its repeating microcircuit motif, but also by its rich, interregional connectivity. We present a data-driven computational model of the anatomy of non-barrel primary somatosensory cortex of juvenile rat, integrating whole-brain scale data while providing cellular and subcellular specificity. The model consists of 4.2 million morphologically detailed neurons, placed in a digital brain atlas. They are connected by 14.2 billion synapses, comprising local, mid-range and extrinsic connectivity. We delineated the limits of determining connectivity from neuron morphology and placement, finding that it reproduces targeting by Sst+ neurons, but requires additional specificity to reproduce targeting by PV+ and VIP+ interneurons. Globally, connectivity was characterized by local clusters tied together through hub neurons in layer 5, demonstrating how local and interegional connectivity are complicit, inseparable networks. The model is suitable for simulation-based studies, and the model is made openly available to the community.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107161">Single-cell profiling of trabecular meshwork identifies mitochondrial dysfunction in a glaucoma model that is protected by vitamin B3 treatment</a></h4>

              
                Since the trabecular meshwork (TM) is central to intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation and glaucoma, a deeper understanding of its genomic landscape is needed. We present a multimodal, single-cell resolution analysis of mouse limbal cells (includes TM). In total, we sequenced 9,394 wild-type TM cell transcriptomes. We discovered three TM cell subtypes with characteristic signature genes validated by immunofluorescence on tissue sections and whole-mounts. The subtypes are robust, being detected in datasets for two diverse mouse strains and in independent data from two institutions. Results show compartmentalized enrichment of critical pathways in specific TM cell subtypes. Distinctive signatures include increased expression of genes responsible for (1) extracellular matrix structure and metabolism (TM1 subtype), (2) secreted ligand signaling to support Schlemm’s canal cells (TM2), and (3) contractile and mitochondrial/metabolic activity (TM3). ATAC-sequencing data identified active transcription factors in TM cells, including LMX1B. Mutations in <i>LMX1B</i> cause high IOP and glaucoma. LMX1B is emerging as a key transcription factor for normal mitochondrial function, and its expression is much higher in TM3 cells than other limbal cells. To understand the role of LMX1B in TM function and glaucoma, we single-cell sequenced limbal cells from <i>Lmx1b<sup>V265D/+</sup></i> mutant mice (2491 TM cells). In <i>Lmx1b<sup>V265D/+</sup></i> mice, TM3 cells were uniquely affected by pronounced mitochondrial pathway changes. Mitochondria in TM cells of <i>Lmx1b<sup>V265D/+</sup></i> mice are swollen with a reduced cristae area, further supporting a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the initiation of IOP elevation in these mice. Importantly, treatment with vitamin B3 (nicotinamide), which enhances mitochondrial function and metabolic resilience in other contexts, significantly protected <i>Lmx1b</i> mutant mice from IOP elevation.

                Cortical dynamics underlie many cognitive processes and emerge from complex multiscale interactions, which are challenging to study in vivo. Large-scale, biophysically detailed models offer a tool that can complement laboratory approaches. We present a model comprising eight somatosensory cortex subregions, 4.2 million morphological and electrically detailed neurons, and 13.2 billion local and mid-range synapses. In silico tools enabled reproduction and extension of complex laboratory experiments under a single parameterization, providing strong validation. The model reproduced millisecond-precise stimulus-responses, stimulus-encoding under targeted optogenetic activation, and selective propagation of stimulus-evoked activity to downstream areas. The model’s direct correspondence with biology generated predictions about how multiscale organization shapes activity; for example, how cortical activity is shaped by high-dimensional connectivity motifs in local and mid-range connectivity, and spatial targeting rules by inhibitory subpopulations. The latter was facilitated using a rewired connectome that included specific targeting rules observed for different inhibitory neuron types in electron microscopy. The model also predicted the role of inhibitory interneuron types and different layers in stimulus encoding. Simulation tools and a large subvolume of the model are made available to enable further community-driven improvement, validation, and investigation.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>When applying nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), the rank parameter is generally unknown. This rank, called the nonnegative rank, is usually estimated heuristically since computing its exact value is NP-hard. In this work, we propose an approximation method to estimate the rank on the fly while solving NMF. We use the sum-of-norm (SON), a group-lasso structure that encourages pairwise similarity, to reduce the rank of a factor matrix when the initial rank is overestimated. On various data sets, SON-NMF can reveal the correct nonnegative rank of the data without prior knowledge or parameter tuning. SON-NMF is a nonconvex, nonsmooth, nonseparable, and nonproximable problem, making it nontrivial to solve. First, since rank estimation in NMF is NP-hard, the proposed approach does not benefit from lower computational complexity. Using a graph-theoretic argument, we prove that the complexity of SON NMF is essentially irreducible. Second, the per iteration cost of algorithms for SON-NMF can be high. This motivates us to propose a first-order BCD algorithm that approximately solves SON-NMF with low per iteration cost via the proximal average operator. SON-NMF exhibits favorable features for applications. Besides the ability to automatically estimate the rank from data, SON-NMF can handle rank-deficient data matrices and detect weak components with little energy. Furthermore, in hyperspectral imaging, SON-NMF naturally addresses the issue of spectral variability.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The visual system performs a remarkable feat: it takes complex retinal activation patterns and decodes them for object recognition. This operation, termed “representational untangling,” organizes neural representations by clustering similar objects together while separating different categories of objects. While representational untangling is usually associated with higher-order visual areas like the inferior temporal cortex, it remains unclear how the early visual system contributes to this process—whether through highly selective neurons or high-dimensional population codes. This article investigates how a computational model of early vision contributes to representational untangling. Using a computational visual hierarchy and two different data sets consisting of numerals and objects, we demonstrate that simulated complex cells significantly contribute to representational untangling for object recognition. Our findings challenge prior theories by showing that untangling does not depend on skewed, sparse, or high-dimensional representations. Instead, simulated complex cells reformat visual information into a low-dimensional, yet more separable, neural code, striking a balance between representational untangling and computational efficiency.</span>

The idea behind this approach is to learn the behavior of an operator, such that the resulting neural network is an approximate mapping in infinite-dimensional spaces that is capable of (approximately) simulating the solution operator governed by the partial differential equation. In our work, we study some general approximation capabilities for linear differential operators by approximating the corresponding symbol in the Fourier domain. Analogous to the structure of the class of Hörmander symbols, we consider the approximation with respect to a topology that is induced by a sequence of semi-norms. In that sense, we measure the approximation error in terms of a Fréchet metric, and our main result identifies sufficient conditions for achieving a predefined approximation error. We then focus on a natural extension of our main theorem, in which we reduce the assumptions on the sequence of seminorms. Based on existing approximation results for the exponential spectral Barron space, we then present a concrete example of symbols that can be approximated well.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Echo state networks (ESNs) are a class of recurrent neural networks in which only the readout layer is trainable, while the recurrent and input layers are fixed. This architectural constraint enables computationally efficient processing of time-series data. Traditionally, the readout layer in ESNs is trained using supervised learning with target outputs. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), where the readout layer is trained to reconstruct the input time series fed into the ESN. We show that IR can be achieved through unsupervised learning (UL), without access to supervised targets, provided that the ESN parameters are known a priori and satisfy invertibility conditions. This formulation allows applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, to be reformulated within the UL framework via straightforward integration with existing algorithms. Our results suggest that prior knowledge of ESN parameters can reduce reliance on supervision, thereby establishing a new principle—not only by fixing part of the network parameters but also by exploiting their specific values. Furthermore, our UL-based algorithms for input reconstruction and related tasks are suitable for autonomous processing, offering insights into how analogous computational mechanisms might operate in the brain in principle. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations of ESNs and their relevance to models in computational neuroscience.</span>

                Heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) encoding gene GRN cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD), whereas homozygous GRN mutations lead to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). However, the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration due to PGRN deficiency remain unclear. In the aged brains or under neurodegenerative conditions, the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in microglia contributes to cellular dysfunction and pro-inflammatory responses, exacerbating neurodegenerative pathology. Here, we investigated how PGRN deficiency induces LD accumulation in microglia. We found that PGRN ablation significantly upregulated triglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3 (GPAT3), the first and rate-limiting enzyme for triacylglycerol biosynthesis, and increased LD formation in both Grn-/- BV2 microglial cells and Grn-/- mouse brains. Mechanistic study revealed that PGRN deficiency upregulates GPAT3 via stimulating signal transduction and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) signaling. Silencing Gpat3, inhibiting GPAT3 activity with the small molecule inhibitor FSG67, or PGRN restoration reduced LD accumulation and rescued the cytotoxicity of Grn-/- microglia conditional medium (MCM) toward N2a cells. Notably, intraperitoneal administration of FSG67 or AAV-MG1.2-mCx3cr1-mGrn-eGFP-mediated microglia-specific gene therapy reduced microglial LDs and ameliorated behavior phenotypes in Grn-/- mice. Our study elucidates the role of PGRN loss in microglial lipid homeostasis and identifies the STAT3-GPAT3 axis as a potential therapeutic target for LD-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

                Accurate detection of impending collisions is essential for survival. While multiple subcortical pathways have been found in the detection of looming stimuli, the roles of top-down attention and consciousness in this process remains unclear. Using high-resolution fMRI, we investigated how top-down attention and conscious awareness influence the subcortical processing of collision trajectories in healthy participants and hemianopic patients with cortical blindness. In healthy participants, the superior colliculus (SC)-parabigeminal nucleus (PBGN)-amygdala pathway integrated binocular information for accurate detection of collision trajectories in the upper visual field, but only when participants were paying attention to the looming stimuli. On the other hand, for stimuli presented in the blind visual field of hemianopic patients, effective connectivity analyses revealed collision sensitivity in the SC-pulvinar and SC-ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathways, supporting automatic collision detection even in the absence of visual awareness. Together, these findings suggest that distinct subcortical pathways mediate collision detection in the human brain depending on the presence and absence of attention and conscious awareness.

">Seasonal blood-brain barrier plasticity links environmental cues to migratory behavior in monarch butterflies</a></h4>

              
                Seasonal migration requires animals to reversibly switch behavioral states in response to environmental cues, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these transitions remain poorly understood. Monarch butterflies provide a powerful model, as Eastern North American populations undergo a long-distance southward migration in the fall followed by a cold-dependent reversal in flight orientation after overwintering each spring. Here, we show that cold exposure induces coordinated transcriptional changes in the monarch brain, marked by attenuated integrin-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Cold-exposed monarchs exhibit increased penetration of fluorescent markers into the brain, consistent with increased BBB permeability. Notably, our findings align with previous genomic evidence identifying collagen type IV alpha 1, a major ECM component, as a locus under divergent selection between migratory and non-migratory populations. Together, these results implicate seasonal modulation of BBB permeability as a mechanism linking environmental temperature to plastic migratory behavior and identify the BBB as a dynamic interface through which seasonal cues may reprogram neural function and behavior.

">Synchrony within Aβ mechanoreceptor subtypes governs signal propagation to primary somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Fast-conducting A{beta} slowly adapting type I low threshold mechanoreceptors (SAI-LTMRs) and A{beta} rapidly adapting type I (RAI-) LTMRs are critical for discriminative touch from glabrous skin. Recent studies used mouse genetic loss-of-function and optogenetic gain-of-function manipulations to determine that signals from these A{beta} LTMRs are integrated subcortically to build the cortical representation of touch. However, the precise influence of each subtype on downstream responses is unclear, in part because previous manipulations lacked the capacity to reproduce physiological firing patterns in individual A{beta} LTMR subtypes. Here, we took advantage of a fast variant of channelrhodopsin, CatCh, which enabled us to generate physiological spiking rates and patterns in either subtype while monitoring responses in mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Doing so revealed that propagation of steady-state signals from sustained responses of A{beta} SAI-LTMRs to neural activity (spiking and local field potential) in S1 is dependent on synchronous activation of multiple A{beta} SAI-LTMRs. Asynchronous activation of the same A{beta} SAI-LTMRs rarely produced sustained responses in S1 measured at the level of single unit spiking as well as local field potentials. This suggests that the irregular firing patterns of A{beta} SAI-LTMRs during static indentations contribute to the preponderance of transient cortical responses. By contrast, both synchronous and asynchronous activation of multiple A{beta} RAI-LTMRs resulted in robust S1 responses. Overall, the temporal patterning and synchrony of activity within A{beta} LTMR subtypes govern how well their signals propagate through the ascending somatosensory system.

">Expression of Calca gene-derived peptides in the murine taste system</a></h4>

              
                The Calcitonin Related Polypeptide Alpha (Calca) gene is a source of four biologically active peptides with varied physiological roles. Alternative splicing of the Calca messenger RNA generates either prepro calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) or preprocalcitonin encoding transcripts. Proteolytic processing of preprocalcitonin generates procalcitonin, calcitonin and katacalcin. Calcitonin is a ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor calcitonin receptor (CALCR) while CGRP is a ligand for the CGRP receptor (CGRP1R) formed by the calcitonin receptor like receptor (CALCRL)receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) complex. Interestingly, procalcitonin too, is a ligand for the CGRP1R where it can antagonize CGRP. CGRP expression in taste neurons has been documented and is posited to regulate taste signaling. Single cell and bulk RNASeq of taste papillae revealed that the preprocalcitonin but not the CGRP transcript is expressed in Tas1r3- expressing type II taste cells, while Calcrl (but not Calcr) and Ramp1 are expressed in stem/progenitor and type I cells in the circumvallate papillae. The CGRP1R is also expressed by fibroblasts in the lingual mesenchyme. We confirmed this expression pattern using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), RNAScope and immunohistochemistry. qPCR of geniculate and nodose-petrosal ganglia revealed that both express Cgrp and CGRP1R subunit mRNAs, but not procalcitonin and Calcr. This interesting expression patterns suggests that procalcitonin and CGRP might reciprocally regulate the CGRP1R in taste cells and lingual fibroblasts and thereby influence taste signaling, taste cell regeneration and the taste microbiome.

">Motor unit discharge properties are modestly influenced by menstrual cycle-related fluctuations in sex hormone concentrations</a></h4>

              
                Concentrations of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), the main female sex hormones, exhibit large fluctuations across the menstrual cycle. Due to their receptors throughout the central nervous system, both hormones have the potential to influence motor function by influencing ionotropic and metabotropic inputs to motor pools, which can be estimated through the neural codes extracted from motor unit discharge patterns. To address key methodological limitations in prior menstrual cycle research on motor output, we established the Motor Units and Sex Hormones (MUSH) collaboration. The objective of this multi-site investigation was to determine whether endogenous fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone influence human motor unit activity. We hypothesized that motor unit discharge rates and persistent inward current (PIC)-related contributions to discharge would be greatest during the late follicular phase, when estradiol concentrations were highest. Fifty females completed a comprehensive protocol involving menstrual cycle and ovulation tracking, serum hormone measurement, and high-density surface electromyographic recordings during isometric contractions to quantify motor unit activity in the early follicular, late follicular, and mid luteal phases. After exclusion of 10 females with either atypical hormone concentration profiles or insufficient motor unit yield, 40 remained in the final analysis. There were significant changes in several motor unit discharge variables between menstrual cycle phases and significant associations with hormone concentrations. Increased estradiol was associated with higher peak discharge rates and ascending discharge rate nonlinearity, while increased progesterone was associated with higher peak discharge rates, more discharge rate hysteresis and ascending discharge rate nonlinearity. Despite reaching statistical significance, the magnitudes of these effects (i.e., effect sizes) were small. Overall, these findings indicate that fluctuations in sex hormones influence motor unit behavior, but the effects are subtle, highlighting the need for well-powered and methodologically rigorous menstrual cycle research.

">Dual Role of Ninjurin-1 in Myeloid Cell Adhesion and Inflammation in Relapse-Remitting EAE</a></h4>

              
                Nerve Injury-Induced Protein 1 (Ninjurin-1) is an adhesion molecule implicated in inflammation and tissue injury, yet its role in neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) remains poorly defined. Here, we identify Ninjurin-1 as a key mediator of immune activation and CNS infiltration in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE), a model of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Using flow cytometry, gene-expression profiling, and in vivo peptide blockade, we show that Ninjurin-1 is markedly upregulated on CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells during disease progression. Ninjurin-1 myeloid cells display a dual function, as both an adhesion molecule and a marker of inflammatory activation, characterized by increased antigen presentation, cytokine production, and transcriptional enrichment for genes regulating adhesion, migration, and innate immune signaling. Importantly, therapeutic blockade of Ninjurin-1 significantly reduced clinical severity, CNS immune infiltration, and demyelination in RR-EAE. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for Ninjurin-1 in myeloid-driven neuroinflammation and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for relapsing-remitting MS.

">Evaluating the reliability of functional near-infrared spectroscopy data in the context of a reasoning paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable, motion-tolerant neuroimaging method particularly well suited for developmental and naturalistic research. To evaluate the utility of fNIRS for studying individual differences and longitudinal changes, we measured activation and functional connectivity during a relational reasoning task in young adults (N = 73). We sought to (1) establish whether fNIRS captures frontoparietal activation patterns consistent with prior fMRI studies using similar paradigms, (2) assess the effect of the amount of data (number of task blocks) on signal strength and precision, (3) assess the paradigm's measurement properties in the form of intra- and interindividual stability of activation and functional connectivity within and across testing sessions, and (4) examine whether grouping channels into anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) conferred benefits to the above. We observed robust task-evoked activation across lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, with effect sizes on par with prior fMRI studies. Generally, we observed diminishing returns in effect size and measurement precision beyond ~7 minutes. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability varied across metrics; while they were very low for a specific task contrast, they were extremely high for functional connectivity, confirming the robustness of channel- and ROI-level connectivity as a stable marker of functional architecture. Exploratory analyses supported prior observations of lower signal quality in participants with darker skin tones and hair, underscoring the need for inclusive methodological strategies. Together, these findings highlight key design considerations for optimizing longitudinal and individual-differences research on higher-level cognition, particularly in diverse and developmentally variable populations.

">Progressive neurodegeneration in human dorsal root ganglion from diabetes to painful neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) is characterized by neuropathic pain accompanied by loss of sensory function. We hypothesized that neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) could underlie DPN progression. To address this question, we performed multi-omic evaluation on DRGs from otherwise healthy organ donors, donors with diabetes but no neuropathy, and donors with clinically diagnosed DPN. We discovered that the first stages of neurodegeneration begin early in diabetes before the onset of DPN, with Nageotte nodule formation accompanied by apoptotic gene expression and decreased proportion of specific populations of A-fibers in DPN with remodeling of non-neuronal cells. Our findings define DPN as a neurodegenerative disorder of the DRG, identify molecular markers of disease stage, and highlight the need for early intervention to prevent irreversible neurodegeneration.

">Spinal Mechanisms in Post-Activation Potentiation: Facilitation of Presynaptic Inhibition Contrasts H-Reflex Amplitude Reduction</a></h4>

              
                This study investigated the spinal neural mechanisms underlying post-activation potentiation in ten healthy young males (21.9 {+/-} 4.8 years). Participants performed a 10-second maximal isometric plantarflexion, after which we measured twitch torque and assessed spinal excitability using the soleus H-reflex, D1 presynaptic inhibition and heteronymous Ia facilitation (HF). High-density surface EMG was decomposed to track single motor unit responses. The conditioning contraction increased twitch torque by 12.2 Nm (p < 0.001) immediately and returning to baseline within nine minutes. This mechanical potentiation was accompanied by a 29% reduction in H-reflex amplitude (p < 0.001), which recovered within three minutes. Paradoxically, neurophysiological indices of presynaptic inhibition, D1 and HF were significantly increased (D1: p<0.017; HF: p<0.001), resulting in spinal facilitation. Single MU analysis revealed increased discharge probability, particularly in higher-threshold units indicating overall spinal facilitation. These results demonstrate that post-activation potentiation involves a complex dissociation: H-reflex pathway inhibition along facilitation of presynaptic spinal mechanisms. This paradox can be explained by either post-activation depression (caused by depletion of neurotransmitter at the Ia motoneuron synapse) or muscle thixotropy, a contraction history-dependent decrease in muscle spindle sensitivity, which reduces the efficacy of the Ia afferent volley independently of spinal inhibitory mechanisms. Our findings highlight a dissociation between spinal presynaptic facilitation and the depressed H-reflex, underscoring the need for future studies to explicitly test the roles of post-activation depression and muscle thixotropy during post-activation potentiation.

">PD-1-Dependent Modulation of Sensory Neurons by a Staphylococcus epidermidis Lipoteichoic Acid Drives Analgesia</a></h4>

              
                The immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, traditionally known for suppressing T-cell activation, is also expressed in peripheral sensory neurons where it limits excitability, but the physiological contexts in which neuronal PD-1 is engaged remain poorly defined. We previously identified a purified Staphylococcus epidermidis lipoteichoic acid analog (SELTA) that rapidly alleviates pelvic pain in mice. Here, we investigated whether SELTA functions as an exogenous activator of neuronal PD-1 and whether PD-1 is required for its analgesic effects. SELTA increased Pdcd1 transcripts and PD-1 protein in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and prostate-innervating sensory fibers, and colocalized with TLR2 at neuronal membranes where it enhanced PD-1 Y248 phosphorylation. In primary DRG cultures, SELTA suppressed ATP-evoked calcium responses, indicating reduced neuronal excitability. This effect was abolished by PD-1 neutralization but restored when neutralization was blocked by a PD-1 control peptide, demonstrating both PD-1 dependence and specificity. In male mice with chronic pelvic allodynia induced by experimental autoimmune prostatitis, intraurethral SELTA produced robust, concentration-dependent, and repeatable reductions in tactile hypersensitivity. Sensory neuron-specific PD-1 conditional knockout mice showed normal baseline behavior but failed to respond to SELTA, confirming that PD-1 expression in nociceptors is essential for SELTA-mediated analgesia. These findings identify SELTA as a commensal-derived activator of neuronal PD-1 signaling. Through TLR2 engagement, PD-1 phosphorylation, and suppression of excitatory calcium signaling, SELTA attenuates nociceptor activation and reduces pelvic pain. This mechanism highlights neuronal PD-1 as a modifiable checkpoint pathway and a promising non-opioid target for chronic pain therapy.

">m6A modification and prion-like domain proteins converge to dysregulate Neuronal RNA Granules in Alzheimer s disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a deadly neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. It is associated with several dysregulated pathways, including axonal transport. The latter supplies synapses with several essential components, including proteins and mRNAs. A proportion of RNAs in neurons is transported from the soma to neuronal extensions along microtubules in highly organized structures, known as Neuronal RNA Granules (NRGs). NRGs have a heterogeneous composition of coding and non-coding RNAs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and components of translational machinery. In this study, we investigate the potential involvement of NRGs in AD pathogenesis, with a particular focus on the N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a key RNA modification, and prion-like domain (PrLD) proteins. Our in-silico analysis revealed that a significant portion of mRNAs in NRGs are likely to be highly methylated. Using transcriptomic data from AD brain, we identify dysregulation of key genes in the m6A-methylation pathway (METTL3, FTO, YTHDF2/3, eIF3m) as well as PrLD-containing proteins associated with NRGs (STAU2, YBX1). We further observe aberrant expression of m6A-methylated mRNAs within both NRGs and synapses. Gene Ontology analysis highlights disruptions in pathways related to NRGs and synaptic function. Together, our findings suggest that impaired NRGs homeostasis may represent a critical and previously underappreciated contributor to AD pathogenesis. By outlining the potential roles of m6A and PrLD proteins in regulating NRGs, this work offers a new conceptual framework to better understand AD and identify NRGs as a potential therapeutic target. Finally, we propose a working model illustrating how dysregulation of NRGs homeostasis may drive neurodegeneration in AD.

                Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) show alterations in empathic abilities, potentially involving automatic simulation processes supported by mirror-like mechanisms in the somatosensory domain. Within the tactile mirror system (TaMS), observing touch on another person's body activates cortical regions involved in tactile perception, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Although mirror-like alterations have been suggested in BPD, the underlying mechanisms of plasticity remain underexplored. Here, we used a cross-modal paired associative stimulation (cm-PAS) protocol to investigate the plasticity mechanisms of TaMS functioning in BPD. Twenty-four individuals with BPD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Empathic abilities were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Participants performed tactile acuity and visuo-tactile spatial congruity (VTSC) tasks before and after a cm-PAS protocol. During cm-PAS, images of a hand being touched were paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the S1. The effects of cm-PAS were assessed on tactile acuity, as an index of S1 activity, and VTSC performance, as an index of TaMS functioning. Preregistered analyses revealed that patients with BPD tended to have lower cognitive empathy than HCs, with no significant cm-PAS effects on tactile acuity or VTSC performance in HCs, precluding between-group comparisons of plasticity effects. Exploratory analyses indicated notable interindividual variability. In HCs, baseline performance predicted cm-PAS-induced changes, and higher cognitive empathy was associated with stronger VTSC interference; this pattern was inconsistent in patients with BPD despite comparable baseline measures. These findings highlight substantial interindividual variability in cm-PAS effects and a disrupted relationship between cognitive empathy and TaMS functioning in BPD.

">Multiple-Context Training Enhances Generalization of Cued Fear Extinction and Requires the Dorsal Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Multiple-session fear extinction (FE) models exposure therapy, which also occurs over many sessions. In humans, conducting extinction training across multiple contexts improves fear suppression as compared to a single context, but rodent work delineating boundary conditions and neural mechanisms remains sparse. METHODS: We compared single-context FE (SCFE) versus multiple-context FE (MCFE) in 129S1 and C57BL/6J mice, manipulating context familiarity (familiar vs novel FE contexts). Outcomes included FE acquisition and tests for fear relapse such as recent (2 d) and remote (30 d) recall in trained, extinction, and novel contexts, as well as reinstatement tests. We mapped extinction-related neural activity with dual Fos labeling (TRAPxFos immunofluorescence) and graph analyses of regional co-activation, and used chemogenetic inhibition to selectively silence dorsal (dHP) or ventral hippocampus (vHP) during extinction. RESULTS: MCFE produced greater across-session reduction in freezing than SCFE. The MCFE advantage did not require contextual novelty. MCFE also enhanced short- (2 d) and long-term (30 d) recall in a novel context, but did not prevent recovery over time or US-induced reinstatement. Dual-labeling revealed that MCFE strengthened hippocampal-prefrontal co-activation (with relatively weaker prefrontal-amygdala coupling than SCFE). Chemogenetic silencing of dHP, but not vHP, selectively impaired between-session extinction under MCFE and abolished the MCFE benefit; hippocampal silencing did not improve SCFE. CONCLUSIONS: Conducting extinction across multiple contexts enhances acquisition and recall relative to SCFE, without requiring novelty, and engages distinct hippocampal-prefrontal circuit dynamics. dHP activity is necessary for the MCFE-specific improvement, highlighting a circuit mechanism in which distributing extinction across contexts augments fear reduction.

">Persistent impairment of spatial hearing and neural binaural interaction after temporary noise-induced hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Many people have trouble understanding speech in noisy environments despite normal audiometric thresholds, a condition referred to as hidden hearing loss. A leading hypothesis attributes this deficit to inner hair cell synaptic pathology (cochlear synaptopathy), which can persist after recovery from noise-induced temporary elevation of audiometric thresholds. This pathology impairs the temporally precise sound encoding necessary for spatial hearing, but direct evidence in primates, human or nonhuman, is lacking. Here, we show that a single noise exposure, producing only a temporary threshold elevation, induced long-lasting alterations in synaptic morphology, without synapse loss, resulting in persistent spatial hearing deficits for up to 11 months post-exposure in nonhuman primates of both sexes. These perceptual deficits were accompanied by a reduction in a neurophysiological measure of binaural processing - the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the auditory brainstem response (ABR). Both behavioral and neural deficits persisted despite full recovery of audiometric thresholds. Together, these findings provide the first evidence in primates that noise exposure disrupts spatial hearing and binaural neural circuit function without loss of hair cells or synapses. Because spatial hearing tests and the ABR/BIC are clinically accessible, this work also establishes translational biomarkers for early neural dysfunction underlying hidden hearing loss.

">FPmotion an Automated Signal Processing and Statistical Analysis Tool for Fiber Photometry Data</a></h4>

              
                Fiber photometry measures neural activity in vivo from genetically encoded indicators. Recordings generate large datasets that require extensive preprocessing and robust statistical methods for meaningful interpretation. However, existing analysis tools demand programming expertise, limiting accessibility. Here we describe FPmotion, a comprehensive, user-friendly software platform for batchwise processing, integration, and statistical analysis of fiber photometry data with or without accompanying behavioral information. FPmotion performs filtering, isosbestic regression, dF/F computation, detrending, and z-scoring. It also extracts detailed peak properties at whole-file, block-level, and individual-peak resolution. When behavioral data is provided, FPmotion automatically identifies behavioral bouts, computes bout-level statistics, performs peri-event signal extraction, and supports multi-group comparisons through ANOVA- and LMEM-based statistical frameworks. All analyses generate publication-ready figures and structured CSV outputs suitable for downstream workflows. FPmotion also introduces a dedicated alignment module for peri-event signal analysis. This module applies dynamic time warping followed by barycenter averaging to realign peri-event traces while preserving the behavioral time anchor, producing cleaner and more temporally coherent peri-event motifs. We demonstrate the capabilities of FPmotion software using the dlight1.1 sensor to measure dopamine responses from ventral striatum in behaving mice before and after amphetamine treatment. Together, FPmotion offers a fully automated framework for FP data analysis that improves interpretability and accessibility while reducing analysis time substantially.

">Sleep dynamics and epileptogenesis following Kainic acid in epilepsy-susceptible (DBA/2J) and epilepsy-resistant (C57BL/6) mice</a></h4>

              
                Susceptibility to epileptogenesis varies in humans and outbred mouse strains. We hypothesized that baseline sleep abnormalities increase susceptibility to epileptogenesis following Kainic acid (KA) and abnormal circadian rhythm or sleep homeostasis (SH) contribute to worse seizures in epilepsy-susceptible DBAs. Following EEG electrode implantation, C57 and DBA mice underwent repeated low-dose KA or saline treatment. Seizures, interictal spikes and sleep were examined over 8-weeks with continuous electroencephalography (EEG). Seizures were manually scored, and interictal spikes and sleep were analyzed using machine learning algorithms. Slow wave activity (SWA) was derived from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep following Fourier transform, and SH was measured by the decay of SWA during sleep and its rise with preceding wakefulness. The impact of post-KA seizures on circadian rhythm was determined using Cosinor analysis. Seizures were longer and more frequent in KA-treated DBAs than C57s. Interictal spike were much greater in saline-treated DBAs than C57s. SWA across the 24-hours was lower in DBAs at baseline. KA treatment decreased REM and increased SWA activity in DBAs but not in C57s. Cosinor analysis revealed circadian rhythm abnormalities in DBAs but not in C57s. Seizures impaired SH in DBAs, with no increase in SWA with preceding wakefulness and a progressive loss of SWA decay during lights-on over the 8-week recording. These findings suggest that baseline sleep abnormalities, poorly adaptable circadian rhythms and impaired SH are associated with increased vulnerability to epileptogenesis. Therapies enhancing circadian rhythm and SH after an insult may be avenues to mitigate epileptogenesis in vulnerable populations.

">Phase similarity between similar objects indicates representational merging across retrieval training but not sleep</a></h4>

              
                Retrieval training (i.e., cued recall) is theorised to induce rapid memory consolidation, similarly to sleep. Across consolidation, related neural representations become increasingly similar; yet, this representational change has never been directly compared between sleep and retrieval training. In this study, 30 subjects (27F, 18-34, M=22.17) completed four separate sessions in which they (1) learnt object-word pairs, followed by (2) immediate recognition testing, (3) one of four 120-min interventions (retrieval training, restudy, sleep, or wake), and (4) delayed recognition testing. We compared EEG phase similarity between similar and different objects to assess the time, frequency, and anatomical distribution of representational similarity across encoding (learning to immediate recognition), and each intervention (immediate to delayed recognition). We hypothesised that EEG phase patterns for similar objects would become more similar (i.e., representational merging) across retrieval training and sleep interventions, and predict a greater endorsement of similar-object lures. Indeed, we found increased representational similarity between similar objects across the encoding shift in the theta-band and occipital sources. Crucially, additional representational merging was only observed across the retrieval training intervention, in the alpha-band and parieto-occipital sources. Despite retrieval training leading to reduced performance in discriminating similar-objects lures, greater representational merging across retrieval training predicted greater discrimination of similar-object lures. Together, these findings suggest that sleep and retrieval training induce different memory transformations across the same timescale. Retrieval training may generally provoke rapid gist extraction, with greater neocortical integration supporting episodic discrimination. Conversely, sleep may selectively maintain task-relevant episodic and semantic details in the short-term.

">Dopamine signatures of excessive and compulsive cocaine and fentanyl use</a></h4>

              
                Excessive and compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences is a hallmark of substance use disorder, yet individuals differ markedly in their vulnerability to develop these behaviors. Drugs of abuse are long known to alter endogenous dopamine (DA) signaling, but shared principles for how DA dynamics impact compulsive use among individuals and across drug classes are lacking. Here, we monitored DA release in the medial shell of nucleus accumbens (NAc) during cocaine and fentanyl self-administration, with or without coincident punishment, in large cohorts of mice. Contingent cocaine and fentanyl self-administration evoked complex and individually distinct DA dynamics; nevertheless, a robust negative correlation held across both drugs, such that high takers exhibited lower drug-evoked DA signals. During punished drug taking, cocaine and fentanyl cases were associated with distinct DA signatures of compulsivity. For cocaine, punishment-resistant mice showed lower sustained DA responses during the post-shock, drug-associated cue period, whereas for fentanyl, punishment-resistant mice displayed larger phasic DA at the co-occurrence of footshock and drug infusion. To identify common principles underlying these observations, we developed a computational model grounded in an Actor-Critic temporal-difference (TD) learning framework that incorporates internal states, agent's uncertainty, and drug-specific effects. Remarkably, this model captures the observed diversity in DA dynamics across drug classes and among mice with variable drug taking propensities, hereby providing a unified interpretation of NAc DA signals as encoding TD reward prediction errors.

">Latent biophysical diffusion properties underlying cerebral microstructure revealed through multimodal MRI covariation in the squirrel monkey</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion MRI provides multiple quantitative descriptors of neural tissue derived from distinct physical and biophysical models, each probing different aspects of cerebral microstructure. While these metrics are often interpreted independently, their joint statistical structure may encode information about latent biophysical properties that constrain and organize brain microarchitecture. Here, we investigate whether stable patterns of multimodal diffusion MRI covariation reveal underlying biophysical diffusion properties of cerebral microstructure in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). Using a high-resolution multimodal diffusion MRI dataset acquired at 11.7T (400 m isotropic resolution) from 15 adult subjects, we analyzed tensor-based metrics alongside advanced multicompartment and axonal models, including NODDI and ActiveAx. Voxelwise and region-level correlation analyses were performed across multiple spatial scales to examine the structure, redundancy, and stability of relationships among diffusion-derived maps. We show that metrics originating from conceptually distinct models consistently organize into a low-dimensional structure characterized by stable clusters of covariation, robust to changes in parcellation and spatial aggregation. These patterns cannot be explained by trivial metric redundancy alone, but instead suggest convergence toward a reduced set of effective biophysical degrees of freedom governing diffusion behavior in neural tissue, including axonal organization, neurite density, orientation dispersion, and isotropic diffusion components. We interpret these covariation structures as manifestations of latent biophysical diffusion properties, emergent tissue states that are not directly observable through any single metric but become apparent through their structured relationships. From a systems neuroscience perspective, the stability of these latent dimensions supports the view that adult cerebral microstructure reflects the steady-state outcome of neurodevelopmental dynamics operating under biophysical constraints. Rather than providing a regional atlas, this work proposes a conceptual framework for interpreting multimodal diffusion MRI as a projection of an underlying low-dimensional biophysical state space organizing cerebral microstructure in primate brains.

">Multilayer Network Modelling of the Human Reading System</a></h4>

              
                Reading is supported by rapid and flexible coordination of neural activity across distributed brain regions. We have previously shown that left fusiform gyrus (FusG) provides a bridge flexibly linking the visual form analysis required for reading with the language system. Here, we investigate the dynamic organisation of an extending reading network encompassing classical perisylvian language areas and FusG. We do so by applying multilayer network modelling to language fMRI data acquired through the Australian Epilepsy Project, using a paradigm that contrasts reading with visuospatial judgements. The dataset included 201 participants with left dominant language, both with and without seizure disorders. We hypothesised that the relative strength of dynamic interactions within this extended language network is associated with reading ability. Time resolved functional connectivity was estimated using a sliding window Pearson's correlation approach, and the resulting connectivity matrices were entered into a multilayer community detection algorithm to quantify spatiotemporal community structure within the reading network. We concentrate our analyses on allegiance, the probability that a pair of regions is assigned to the same community over time. Our results show that community structure within the reading network is characterised by a preference for within hemisphere assignment over cross hemisphere assignment, as well as higher nodal allegiance among left language regions compared with their right hemisphere homologues. As anticipated, within versus between network allegiance followed a similar gradient in both language and attention networks: lowest between left language and right attentional regions, intermediate between the left FusG and each respective network, and highest within-network (left language or right attention). Importantly, as hypothesised, reading ability was associated with FusG-inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) interactions: higher left FusG-left IFG allegiance correlated with better reading performance, whereas increased right FusG-left IFG allegiance correlated with poorer reading. These findings highlight hemispheric asymmetries in the dynamic organisation of the reading system and provide novel evidence linking individual differences in reading ability to network level dynamics. Our findings align with a developmental literature suggesting that as reading proficiency improves, there is a shift from bilateral to unilateral left occipitotemporal engagement.

">Long-term Effects of Early Life Adversity On Brain Dopamine and Serotonin Receptor Systems Involved In Cocaine Reinforcement In Adult Macaques: a Positron Emission Tomography study</a></h4>

              
                Early life adverse (ELA) experiences such as child maltreatment (MALT) are associated with physical and mental illness, including substance use disorders (SUDs), but underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study examined long-term effects of infant MALT on adult brain serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) receptors in corticolimbic regions involved in reward and emotional control, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, a translational infant MALT macaque model of cocaine use disorder (CUD) risk and a COC self-administration (SA) paradigm. The study focused on regional serotonin 5HT1A, 5HT2A, and dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability (BP) differences between MALT and Control animals using PET, both at baseline (pre-COC SA) and following chronic COC SA (once they reached a total of 100 mgCOC/kg bodyweight intake). We also examined whether levels of these neurochemical receptors predicted COC SA measures, including reinforcing properties and potency using fixed-ratio (FR) peak response rates (RR) and progressive-ratio (PR) peak breakpoint. Our findings showed long-term effects of infant MALT on 5HT, but not DA, receptors in corticolimbic circuits. Specifically, MALT animals showed lower 5HT1A BP in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and hippocampus compared to Controls. A MALT by Sex interaction effect was detected in 5HT2A BP in the OFC, with lower levels in MALT than Control males, but not in females. In addition, upregulation of 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors was detected following chronic COC SA in most PFC subregions, hippocampus, and NAcc, particularly in the Control group. These findings suggest long-term effects of ELA on adult 5HT, but not DA, receptors in corticolimbic regions involved in emotional and reward processes. We also found associations between PET baseline (pre-COC SA) receptor BP data and COC SA measures; in particular, a positive correlation between 5HT1A receptor BP in caudate and FR Response Rates, whereas amygdala 5HT1A receptor levels were positively correlated with PR peak breakpoint and negatively correlated with and FR Response Rates. Overall, these findings suggest an important role of 5HT1A and 5HT2A PFC receptors in early COC-related changes in reward circuitry and of amygdala 5HT receptors on reward motivated behaviors. The dynamic change of these 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors following chronic COC exposure was blunted in animals with ELA. It would be important to understand the biological consequences of the dynamic changes in these 5HT receptors and whether they predict risk for COC relapse and can inform future pharmacological interventions that target 5HT receptors for treatment of CUD.

">sf-pediatric: A robust and age-adaptable end-to-end pipeline for pediatric diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a powerful, non-invasive window into white matter (WM) development. Yet, most existing processing pipelines are not well-suited to the rapidly evolving neurophysiology of the pediatric brain. Here, we introduce sf-pediatric, a scalable, end-to-end, age-adaptable dMRI pipeline that integrates normative models of brain diffusivities to enable optimal subject-specific analysis from birth through 18 years old. Leveraging normative trajectories derived from nearly 2,000 participants from six cohorts, sf-pediatric dynamically calibrates diffusion priors, template selection, segmentation, and WM atlases based on the subject's age. By incorporating automatic quality control into a portable, tested, containerized, open-access, and press-button framework across computing environments, sf-pediatric provides a robust pipeline for large-scale pediatric dMRI studies. We validated this approach by showing improved local modeling and cortical fanning while preserving reproducibility and the ability to derive brain-behavior relationships. Additionally, we demonstrated robust recovery of known developmental trajectories of WM microstructure and connectome-derived network organization.

">Persistent Hypersensitivity after Repeat Concussion is Associated with Chronic Cognitive Dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Persistent sensory hypersensitivity is a common but under-recognized feature of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and may contribute to chronic cognitive complaints. However, the mechanistic relationship between long-term sensory dysregulation and cognitive dysfunction after repeat concussion remains poorly understood. Here, we used a preclinical repeated closed-head injury (rCHI-5x), in young adult mouse model targeting the frontal cortex at 8weeks of age to test whether chronic sensory processing abnormalities contribute to cognitive impairment under increased sensory load chronically at 8-10weeks post-injury (4months old). rCHI mice exhibited significant sensory dysfunction across multiple modalities compared to sham anesthetic controls, including increased tactile sensitivity, tactile avoidance, and impaired habituation to auditory startle, despite the absence of gross structural brain damage and preserved learning and memory under low-demand conditions. While spatial learning and working memory in the Barnes maze were intact, rCHI mice displayed increased perseveration and reduced cognitive flexibility. However, these cognitive deficits emerged only when auditory and tactile sensory distractors were introduced during testing, unmasking impairments that were not evident under baseline conditions. Within-animal analyses revealed strong associations between the severity of sensory hypersensitivity, impaired sensory habituation, and deficits in cognitive flexibility, relationships in rCHI mice but not in sham controls. These findings demonstrate that chronic sensory dysregulation following repeat mild concussion is not merely a secondary symptom, but can be a mechanistic contributor to cognitive impairment under conditions of elevated sensory load. Together, this work identifies persistent sensory processing and gating dysfunction as a key driver of PCS-related cognitive deficits and reveals that targeting sensory circuitry for therapeutic neuromodulation may offer functional rescue across multiple domains, extending beyond sensory symptoms to improve higher-order cognitive performance.

">Sensory expectations and prediction error during feedback control in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                External disturbances to the body are better counteracted when their nature can be predicted in advance. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms through which probabilistic predictions shape feedback responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. We show that, prior to a mechanical perturbation applied to a finger, the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices receive a signal that linearly encodes the expected sensory input. When perturbations reach these areas, expectations are combined with the sensory input through a simple additive mechanism, yielding motor commands that reflect a weighted sum of the two signals. At the same time, M1 and S1 receive a prediction error signal, likely from upstream regions, encoding the difference between expectations and actual sensory input. This signal is visible in fMRI data in humans and in the local field potentials in non-human primates, but not in M1-S1 spiking activity.

">Bile Acids Regulate Accumbal Cholinergic Circuitry and Dopamine Release through TGR5 Activation</a></h4>

              
                Background: High calorie foods and alcohol produce strong reinforcing effects. Brain mechanisms for these reinforcers have focused largely on indirect mechanisms on mesolimbic circuits. Bile acid secretion is a major factor during caloric intake, however, the role of biliary acids on mesolimbic circuitry remains unexplored. Brain mesolimbic circuits are modulated in part by altering cholinergic interneuron (CIN) activity and tonic dopamine (DA) transmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Ethanol and fatty foods also both stimulate hepatic and possibly local brain bile acid (BA) synthesis, which raises the possibility that BAs may act as a common upstream regulator of these substances shared mesolimbic effects. Methods: This study investigated whether BAs can directly alter mesolimbic activity. We collected electrophysiological data from acute mouse brain slices to assess BA effects on accumbal CIN firing and excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic activity. Bile effects on DA release and clearance in the NAc were measured through voltammetry. Results: We found that low concentrations of a 1:1 mixture of BAs cholic acid and deoxycholic acid (1-10 M) increased CIN firing rate whereas high BA concentrations (1-10 mM) decreased CIN firing. We further demonstrated that BA-induced excitatory effects on CIN firing are independently mediated by at least two mechanisms: Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) activation and suppression of inhibitory CIN currents. Additionally, our results indicate that BAs modulate inhibitory input in a complex manner, reducing frequency at low concentrations, but increasing at high concentrations, and increasing amplitude at low concentrations current amplitude, and the distribution of postsynaptic current amplitude sizes across concentrations. Finally, our voltammetry data show that while low BA concentrations enhance NAc DA release without affecting uptake, whereas high concentrations of BA robustly inhibit accumbal DA release. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that BAs exert direct modulatory effects on neural activity in the striatum.

">Connexins are essential for the contribution of latent progenitors to self-repair after spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Gap junctions are important regulators of the biology of neural stem cells. Both in vertebrates with regenerative abilities and neonatal rodents, ependymal cells communicate via connexin (Cx) 43 and Cx26. Gap junction coupling and Cx26 are down-regulated as the ependyma becomes quiescent in adulthood, but injury overrules this developmental down-regulation suggesting a role for Cx signalling in the reactivation of ependymal cells. Here, we aim to explore the role of Cx26 and Cx43 in the response of ependymal cells to injury. We find that Cx26 is critical for the proliferative response to injury and thereby scar formation. Cx43 plays a key role in the communication between ependymal cells of Ca2+ signals induced by activation of P2X7 receptors that trigger downstream events. Our data show that Cxs are relevant targets to manipulate the ependymal stem cell niche to achieve a better self-repair after spinal cord injury.

">Behavioral state-dependent norepinephrine dynamics in the primary somatosensory and prefrontal cortices during tactile detection tasks</a></h4>

              
                Animals must integrate sensory information, ignore behaviorally irrelevant stimuli, and respond to behaviorally relevant stimuli to find food, find mates, avoid predators, and ultimately survive. In mammals, these goal-directed behaviors require the coordinated activity of many brain regions, including sensory and prefrontal cortices as well as neuromodulatory brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus (LC), which is the brain's primary source of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine resulting from LC activity and arousal indexed by pupil size exert strong influences on goal-directed behavior. We explored the relationships between pupil size, cortical noradrenergic dynamics, and behavior in a tactile signal detection task. We monitored pupil dynamics and fluorescent GRAB_NE signals in somatosensory and prefrontal cortices simultaneously during task execution and found that pupil size and synchronization of GRAB_NE signals at baseline were strong predictors of whether animals chose to respond but not baseline cortical GRABNE levels. We also employed a generalized linear model - hidden Markov model (GLM-HMM) framework to identify distinct, stable behavioral states throughout the task that optimally account for task performance. We found distinct psychometric curves, task-evoked pupil dynamics, and cortical NE dynamics across these behavioral states.

                Abstract* We employ the 34-year monthly time series of the US dollar exchange rate to explore the existence of outliers and nonlinearity which confine traditional decomposition methods for large datasets. The data was modelled as a smoothed functional over a Fourier basis of seven functions. Based on the model presented, one-way and two-way Functional Median Polish (FMP) was applied to disentangle the series into a central function, annual and monthly effects, and residuals. Functional ANOVA tests were performed to determine the significance of each of these components. The central function was 0.64–0.65 on the functional scale, and it is observed that the annual and monthly effects were not significant after functional smoothing. With short-term shocks, the residuals had a centralized size around zero and relatively heavy tails, unlike the normally present seasonal events. Such outcomes verify that FMP is a strong and interpretable working framework that avoids the adverse effects of outliers significantly and that it is appropriate in the analysis of economic time series.

                Background A cascaded model in machine learning denotes a system in which numerous models are successively organized, with the result of one model functioning as the input for the subsequent model. This method enables the utilization of the strengths of individual models to enhance overall performance, especially in intricate tasks such as image production or named entity recognition. This research examines the reliability R of a certain (2+1) cascade Stress-Strength model about the Inverse Chen distribution. When the Strength and Stress adhere to Inverse Chen random variables with unspecified shape parameter α and known parameter β. Methods Five distinct methods (Maximum Likelihood Estimator (ML), Shrinkage Estimation Method with Shrinkage Weight Factor Estimators (sh1 ) and Trigonometric Shrinkage Weight Function (sh2 ), Least Square Estimation Method (LS), Weighted Least Square Estimation Method (WLS)) are employed to estimate the specified reliability and to facilitate a comparison among them in a simulation conducted using the MATLAB(2023b) program, numerical simulation is employed after generating random samples of sizes 25, 50, 75, and 100 from the Inverse Chen Distribution to apply the Mean Square Error (MSE) criterion for comparison. Results The reliability results estimated by the five methods were recorded in tables, and the numerical simulation results were recorded in tables and graphs illustrating the suitability of data with respect to all the distributions under study. Conclusions Compared the inverse Chen distribution to some distributions such as the log-logistic, uniform, exponential, Rayleigh, Chi-Square Half-Normal, Gumbel, and Cauchy distributions, using real data for the diamonds from a major mining zone in Southwest Africa, the inverse Chen distribution seems to be a more competitive model for this data of diamonds than the other distributions. The optimal estimation approach for the reliability via MSE is the trigonometric shrinkage weight function estimator (sh2 ).

                Background Investment decision making is a critical aspect of financial planning. It involves allocating the financial resources to various investment avenues with an objective of generating future returns. Behavioral finance provides a theoretical framework for understanding psychological biases investment decision making which changes the assumptions of traditional finance. This study examines five important behavioral biases such as heuristics, prospect theory, emotions, market impact, and herding behavior on investment decision-making and portfolio management by considering investor experience and financial literacy as moderating factors. Methods Primary data was collected from individual investors in the BSE and NSE using a structured questionnaire administered through a purposive random sampling. Resulting in 151 complete responses were obtained and were considered valid for the purpose of our study. PLS-SEM was used to test the proposed hypotheses as well as the moderating effect Results Study finding indicates that heuristics have a positive and statistically significant effect on investment decisions, while prospect theory, emotions, market impact, and herding behavior showed no significant direct influence. The moderation analysis reveals that both investor experience and financial literacy significantly moderate the effects of emotions and market impact on investment decisions. However, their influence on heuristics, prospect theory, and herding behavior was statistically insignificant. Conclusions The results of this study lead to several conclusions. In this present study only one behavioral bias heuristics (HU) demonstrated a significant direct influence on investment decisions. In contrast, other behavioral biases such as prospect theory (P), emotions (E), market impact (M), and herding behavior (HB) do not significantly affect investment decisions (p > 0.05). The moderating effect of investors’ experience and financial literacy investor behavior are minimal. The result underscores that improving financial education, skills, knowledge and gaining experience may help investors regulate emotional and trend-based decisions but may not be sufficient to address more instinctive cognitive biases. The significance of the study provides important implications for financial educators, advisors, policymakers and stock market authorities regarding the need for behaviorally informed investor training, decision-support systems, and informed advisory services to promote rational investment behavior.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established surgical therapy for movement disorders, epilepsy, and psychiatric conditions, yet remains underutilized due to perceived risks. We therefore endeavored to compare the safety of DBS to other common elective procedures to provide context for its relative risk.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This retrospective cohort study utilized the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database, encompassing diverse referral and community hospitals across the United States from 2015 to 2021. Patients with DBS were compared with those receiving one of the 16 most common elective procedures. The primary outcome of interest was the weighted odds of any postoperative complication at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included risk of readmission, reoperation, and discharge disposition. Logistic regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on propensity scores adjusted for baseline group heterogeneity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 2,853,662 patients for analysis, including 4,749 DBS procedures. After IPTW adjustment, patients with DBS experienced lower 30-day complication rates compared with other procedures (1.3% vs 4.1%, OR = 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.25–0.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Readmission rates did not differ significantly (2.2% vs 2.6%, OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.69–1.02, <i>p</i> = 0.08). DBS cases had higher odds of discharge home (98.7% vs 96.3%, OR = 2.94, 95% CI = 2.27–3.82, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and lower reoperation rates (0.7% vs 1.3%, OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.35–0.72, <i>p</i> = 0.0002).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DBS demonstrates a favorable safety profile with substantially lower complication rates compared with the most widely performed elective surgeries. These findings support broader consideration of surgical referral for appropriate DBS candidates. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) remain the foundation of tissue diagnosis, yet many clinical questions, tumour–immune architecture, spatial heterogeneity, and predictors of therapy response, require molecular context that routine slides cannot provide. Spatial omics closes this gap by mapping RNA and proteins in situ while preserving morphology, and recent platforms are increasingly compatible with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, paving the way for its future potential use in routine pathology and retrospective cohorts. However, significant challenges related to cost, complexity, reproducibility, and regulation currently remain before widespread routine deployment, underscoring that it is not yet ready for In Vitro Diagnostic or routine clinical application. This mini-review offers a pragmatic, step-by-step workflow for integrating spatial assays with H&E: define the clinical decision; select a fit-for-purpose modality (whole-transcriptome spot/grid vs targeted in situ RNA; multiplex proteomics); lock pre-analytics aligned to histology (sectioning, staining, de-crosslinking, storage); pre-specify regions of interest (ROIs), registration, and segmentation rules; analyse with quality-assurance gates (normalisation, deconvolution, batch handling, spatial statistics); and validate and report using orthogonal assays and multi-site replication. FFPE-ready platforms and typical use-cases are summarised, with emphasis on pre-analytical factors that materially affect signal and analysis “recipes” distilled from recent benchmarks. Brief clinical exemplars illustrate how H&E-anchored spatial maps change decisions by pinpointing actionable niches (e.g., immune neighbourhoods, vascular niches, layer-specific programmes). Common limitations are also outlined, including technology trade-offs, pre-analytics, sampling bias, segmentation and deconvolution error, batch effects, cost, turnaround, and regulatory considerations. Future directions include standards and metadata, cross-platform integration, prospective evidence, automation and quality assurance, and multi-omic detection. Overall, the goal is to support pathology and translational teams in adopting spatial omics in FFPE with both discipline and rigor, guiding the necessary steps to ensure reproducibility and credibility for eventual clinical impact.

                Background Digital finance is also regarded as a significant means to help companies in emerging economies formalize and improve their performance. Mobile money in Sub-Saharan Africa has reduced transaction costs and expanded access to financial services, yet there is scant evidence on its impact on business formalization and outcomes. Methods We used firm-level data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys and matched it with country-level datasets from the Global Findex Database, World Development Indicators, Worldwide Governance Indicators, and mobile network coverage data. Panel regressions were used to investigate the impact of digital finance on enterprise formalization and firm performance, controlling for firm-specific characteristics, macroeconomic conditions, and institutional factors. We conducted the robustness tests on the other specifications and sub-sample tests. Results The review indicates that increased mobile money penetration enhances the likelihood that an enterprise will formalize and improve firm performance, as reflected in increased sales and productivity. These advantages are greatest among micro and small companies and women-managed companies, which highlights the inclusion-promoting role of digital finance. These impacts are enhanced by strong institutional quality and robust digital infrastructure, and mitigated to some extent by weak regulatory environments. Conclusions Our results provide strong evidence that digital finance promotes formalization and performance in Sub-Saharan Africa. The developmental benefits of digital finance can be enhanced by policies that promote interoperability of mobile money, improve the quality of digital infrastructure, and strengthen regulatory quality. The article contributes to the research by associating digital financial inclusion with formalization outcomes and firm performance, using multi-source data and rigorous empirical procedures.

                Background Deafblindness is a rare and complex condition that is often accompanied by additional intellectual and mental disabilities. Research on adolescents with deafblindness during the post-school transition remains limited, with existing studies primarily focusing on parental perspectives. Sibling voices, particularly in Indonesia, where services are scarce and family-based care is the dominant approach, are underexplored. Aim This study examined how siblings in rural and urban Indonesia manage caregiving and roles during the transition of adolescents with deaf-blindness from school to family. Methods Using a participatory Photovoice approach, eight siblings (aged 15–25) documented their daily realities through photographs, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions over a 12-week period. Data were thematically analyzed. Results Six themes emerged: invisible care work, emotional strain, rural–urban divides, social relationships and stigma, temporal transitions, and bridging advocacy. Urban siblings reported tension between education, employment, and caregiving, whereas rural siblings encountered stigma and limited services, but experienced stronger kinship support. Across various contexts, siblings often act as hidden caregivers and advocates, yet their contributions remain undervalued. Conclusions Supporting siblings requires addressing the intersecting dynamics of geographic area, culture, and disability care. Social work professionals must recognize both their challenges and their resilience, which helps them balance caregiving and personal development in the transition phase. Longitudinal research is needed to capture evolving sibling roles across the deafblind transition landscape.

                Teledentistry has emerged as a promising strategy to improve access to urgent dental care for pediatric populations, particularly in underserved areas; however, evidence regarding the agreement between telescreening and in-person assessment for pediatric dental emergencies remains limited. This before-and-after study, nested within a randomized controlled clinical trial, evaluated the level of agreement between diagnoses and risk classifications obtained through telescreening and in-person consultation in children aged 3 to 13 years presenting with dental pain. All participants underwent synchronous telescreening using a standardized questionnaire and were randomized into two groups; the present analysis included 130 children allocated to telescreening followed by an in-person consultation, which was performed by a blinded examiner unaware of the telescreening results. Agreement between treatment decisions (urgent vs. elective) was assessed, and pain outcomes were monitored at baseline, 7 and 15 days using the Wong–Baker Faces Pain Scale. Agreement between telescreening and in-person evaluation was observed in 49.2% of elective cases and 26.9% of urgent cases, with infrequent changes in treatment decisions, including 6.9% of cases reclassified from urgent to elective and 0.8% from elective to urgent. Pain scores showed a significant reduction over time (p < 0.001), with median values decreasing to zero at both follow-up assessments. These findings indicate that telescreening demonstrates good agreement with in-person evaluation for the identification and management of pediatric dental appears to be a viable and effective alternative for initial screening and referral, although adherence to subsequent in-person care remains an important consideration.

                Background Coastal flood and erosion risk management increasingly requires innovative, nature-based solutions. The European project Foreshore Assessment using Space Technology (FAST) (de Vries et al., 2018) addressed this challenge by developing MI-SAFE, a viewer and software tool designed to assess the wave attenuation capacity of vegetated intertidal flats using Earth Observation (EO) data. To ensure the long-term sustainability and adoption of this technological innovation beyond the project’s lifespan, a robust, viable business model was required. This study outlines the development and evolution of the business case for the MI-SAFE service package. Methods A user-driven approach was employed to define the value proposition and market fit. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, including coastal managers, engineers, and conservationists, to identify specific technical needs and willingness to pay. The business model was iteratively developed using standard frameworks such as the Business Model Canvas, transitioning from a traditional linear product approach to a platform-based strategy. Financial projections were calculated to assess economic viability under different adoption scenarios. Results The analysis led to the definition of a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) business model. The service is structured around a freemium strategy with three distinct tiers: an Educational level (open access for general public awareness), an Expert level (standard technical features), and an Advanced level (tailored, high-resolution consulting services). Financial modelling indicates that revenue from the Advanced tier is sufficient to subsidise the free and lower-cost levels, ensuring broad accessibility. The coordinating institute was identified as the central entity for hosting, maintenance, and commercialisation, leveraging its existing infrastructure. Conclusions The study demonstrates that transitioning to a service-oriented platform model significantly enhances the scalability and sustainability of EO-based environmental tools. By bridging the gap between marine science and business management, the proposed model ensures that MI-SAFE remains a viable resource for coastal risk management. This multidisciplinary approach serves as a blueprint for commercialising research outputs in the environmental sector, balancing public utility with financial self-sufficiency.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Leg dystonia in cerebral palsy (CP) is debilitating but remains underdiagnosed. Routine clinical evaluation has only 12% accuracy for leg dystonia diagnosis compared to gold-standard expert consensus assessment. We determined whether expert-cited leg dystonia features could be quantified to train machine learning (ML) models to detect leg dystonia in videos of children with CP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eight pediatric movement disorders physicians assessed 298 videos of children with CP performing a seated task at 2 CP centers. We extracted leg dystonia features cited by these experts during consensus-building discussions, quantified these features in videos, used these quantifications to train 4,664 ML models on 163 videos from one center, and tested the best performing models on a separate set of 135 videos from both centers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 69 quantifiable features corresponding to 12 expert-cited leg dystonia features. ML models trained using these quantifications achieved 88% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 82% positive predictive value, 84% negative predictive value, and 82% accuracy for identifying leg dystonia across both centers. Of the 25 features contributing to the best performing ML models, 17 (68%) quantified leg movement variability. We used these ML models to develop DxTonia, open-source software that identifies leg dystonia in videos of children with CP.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DxTonia primarily leverages detection of leg movement variability to achieve 82% accuracy in identifying leg dystonia in children with CP, a significant improvement over routine clinical diagnostic accuracy of 12%. Observing or quantifying leg movement variability during a seated task can facilitate leg dystonia detection in CP. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7, also known as matrilysin) is a secreted zinc-dependent endopeptidase implicated in extracellular matrix remodelling and fibrotic processes. Elevated MMP7 expression is a hallmark of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other interstitial lung diseases, where it has emerged as a candidate biomarker for disease progression. Identifying high-quality research antibodies is therefore essential to enable robust investigation of MMP7 biology and its translational potential. In this study, we systematically evaluated ten commercial antibodies for western blot and immunoprecipitation using a standardized knockout validation approach in human A549 cells, comparing readouts in MMP7 knockout lines with isogenic parental controls. These experiments form part of a larger collaborative initiative to address antibody reproducibility by characterizing commercial antibodies for human proteins and making the results openly available to the community. While antibody use and protocol conditions will vary between laboratories, this report provides a resource to guide selection of the most suitable reagents for studies of MMP7 in health and disease.

                Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), encoded by the SERPINA1 gene, is a circulating serine protease inhibitor that protects the lung from neutrophil elastase–mediated tissue damage. Mutations in SERPINA1 cause alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, one of the most common hereditary causes of respiratory disease, leading to early-onset emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as hepatic complications. Given the clinical significance of A1AT and its widespread use as a biomarker, there is a critical need for high-quality antibodies to ensure reliable detection and mechanistic insights. Here we systematically characterised eighteen commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry using a standardized knockout validation approach in human Hep G2 cells, comparing readouts in a SERPINA1 knockout line with its isogenic parental control. This work is part of a broader collaborative initiative aimed at addressing antibody reproducibility by characterising commercial antibodies for human proteins and openly sharing the results with the community. While antibody use and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific experimental needs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1175/v2?src=rss">Assessment of Brachial Plexus Dose and Associated Toxicity in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiotherapy [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Radiation plexopathy is known to depend on various parameters, and is rarely reported in head&neck cancers. While literature suggests dose constraints of 60-66 Gy, our study aimed to evaluate late brachial plexopathy after primary chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma with IMRT, and determine the maximum tolerated dose. Methods Between May 2015 and March 2020, a retrospective cohort of 50 patients with a history of previously irradiated nasopharyngeal cancer was identified. All patients underwent definitive treatment using IMRT at recommended curative doses. Clinical and treatment-related characteristics were collected, and all cases were reviewed for symptoms of radiation-induced brachial plexopathy. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to their inclusion in the study. Results Of the 50 patients, 98% received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The mean age at treatment was 44 years. All patients received a minimum dose of ≥ 60 Gy. The median maximum dose to the BP (BPMax) was 73.57Gy (ranges: 61.47 Gy-82.64 Gy). Among patients with nodal involvement, 86% received a minimum dose of ≥ 66 Gy. A correlation study with N-category showed a significant increase in BPmax dose with increasing nodal stage. The median BPmax for patients with level III/IV lymph nodes (75.19 Gy) was higher than for those with level I/II involvement (69.19 Gy) (P = 0.0001). All patients had a minimum follow-up of two years, with a median follow-up duration of 36 months (ranges: 22 – 68 months). Five patients reported clinical symptoms of acute or late brachial plexopathy, but none had confirmation via MRI or electromyography. The analysis showed a significant difference in the dose received by 0.03 cm3 of the volume across the different nodal stages (p < 0.05). As the nodal stage increases (N2, N3), the dose to this volume tends to exceed 70 Gy (p < 0.05). Dosimetric data related to the levels of nodal involvement revealed significant differences between groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion In this cohort of nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with IMRT and concurrent chemoradiotherapy, Higher nodal stages, especially level III/IV, were associated with increased doses, but symptomatic plexopathy remained rare. These results support careful dose planning in advanced nodal disease.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampal formation is a functional entity that includes the hippocampus, subicular complex, and the entorhinal cortex, and has an essential role in learning and memory, emotional processing, and spatial coding. The well-defined structure of hippocampal fields and the segregation of the connections have made this structure a favorite candidate for functional models that rely on fundamental information such as the number of neurons populating the hippocampal fields. Existing models on the rat rely on neuronal populations obtained from single studies, so we aimed to obtain more representative estimates by analyzing all available data. We identified 89 studies using reliable methodology that provided 264 stereological estimates of principal neuron populations. The resulting averages for males showed 1,000,000 neurons for the granule cell layer (GCL); 50,000 for the hilus; 210,000 for CA3; ~30,000 for CA2; 350,000 for CA1; and 300,000 for the Subiculum. Entorhinal cortex (EC) averages for both sexes showed 108,000 neurons in layer II; 270,000 in layer III; and 340,000 in layer V/VI. Most of those estimates are significantly different from those traditionally used in hippocampal models (e.g., ~2-fold difference in EC layer II), revealing an updated architecture of the rat hippocampal formation that might help build more realistic models of hippocampal connectivity and function. Comparisons by age or sex were not reliable given the scarce data available from adolescents or females, while comparisons by strain showed inconsistent results, with similar populations in most fields but significant differences in CA3/CA2. The reliability of this finding is discussed.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>I describe my progress in understanding synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Over the decades my lab has focused on the roles of glutamate receptors (AMPARs, NMDARs, mGluRs and KARs) and associated signaling molecules in LTP and LTD. Most of our studies have been conducted in area CA1 (Schaffer collateral—commissural pathway) with some conducted in CA3 (mossy fiber pathway). We have made extensive use of electrophysiology and pharmacological tools, complemented with knock-out (KO) and transgenic mice, biochemistry and dynamic imaging. From a starting point in 1980, with essentially no molecular insights available, we have developed a detailed, but still incomplete, mechanism for LTP at CA1 and CA3 synapses as well as providing insights into LTD at CA1 synapses. We have also explored how dysregulated synaptic plasticity contributes to brain disorders, with an emphasis on Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, through a molecular understanding of synaptic plasticity, now we can explain how plaques and tangles are related mechanistically and, in essence, how the early stages of dementia are triggered. Therapeutic strategies, both pharmacological and lifestyle, for tackling dementia are touched upon. Our work, together with that of many other groups, has resulted in massive progress in the understanding of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian CNS in health and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70071?af=R">Cognitive Strategy Accounts for Failure on a Relational Memory Task in Non‐Human Primates</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Relational memory, the ability to flexibly encode and retrieve associations among distinct elements, is critically dependent on the hippocampus and declines with age in humans. The Transverse Patterning (TP) task is designed to probe relational memory by requiring learning of hierarchical, circular stimulus relationships (e.g., A+ B–, B+ C–, C+ A–), a structure akin to rock-paper-scissors. In humans, TP performance is reliably impaired by hippocampal damage and aging. In non-human primates, however, findings have been inconsistent, with some studies demonstrating clear hippocampal dependence, while others report no impairment or even improvements following hippocampal lesions. This raises the possibility that species differences in cognitive strategy use may underlie these divergent outcomes. We hypothesized that non-human primates rely on an elemental learning strategy, solving problems through simple stimulus–response associations, rather than a configural strategy, which requires integrating multiple stimulus relationships into a higher-order relational structure supported by the hippocampus. To test this, we trained young and aged common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) on the TP task and several control tasks designed to isolate elemental versus configural learning. Marmosets successfully acquired reward contingencies for individual stimulus pairs but failed when success required integrating all three stimulus relationships. In contrast, all animals readily acquired control tasks solvable via simple stimulus–response associations. Notably, there was no evidence of age-related impairment on TP or control task performance. Given the early vulnerability of the hippocampus to aging and the relative preservation of striatal systems, this pattern further supports the conclusion that marmosets rely on a habit-based learning strategy that is poorly suited to relational demands. These findings suggest that humans and non-human primates may approach the same tasks using different cognitive strategies. This has critical implications for interpreting cross-species differences in memory performance and highlights the need to validate which neural systems a task engages in each species before using it as a translational model of hippocampal function or cognitive aging.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term disability, with limited effective treatment options. A key factor of TBI pathophysiology is neuroinflammation, which can involve the activation of the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Aberrant inflammation following injury has the ability to reduce the capacity to induce long-term changes in synaptic plasticity, a leading mechanism for the development of learning and memory deficits following injury. This study investigated the potential of a novel NLRP3 inhibitor, AMS-17, to mitigate synaptic plasticity deficits following mild TBI (mTBI) in mice. Adult C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to mTBI or a sham injury, and hippocampal slices were then prepared for field electrophysiological recordings in the medial perforant pathway of the dentate gyrus. We found that mTBI induced deficits in long-term potentiation that were not immediate at 2 h post-injury but developed by 3 days post-injury. We next incubated slices in AMS-17 or a control solution prior to electrophysiological recordings. Here we found that incubation with AMS-17 rescued these LTP deficits, bringing them to levels observed in sham-injured controls. Importantly, AMS-17 did not affect the capacity to induce LTP in sham-injured mice. These findings suggest that targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce learning and memory impairments following mTBI. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal therapeutic window and long-term efficacy of AMS-17 in mTBI.</p>
