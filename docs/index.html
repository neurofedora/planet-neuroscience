<p>Graphical Abstract: We used single-cell transcriptomics to explore cell type and neuronal class diversity, and in situ hybridization chain reaction to view expression in the brain of the nudibranch mollusc, <i>Berghia stephanieae</i>. Gene markers for nudibranch neurons and glia were found. Transcription factors, neuropeptides, and unannotated genes subdivided neuronal classes.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastropod molluscs such as <i>Aplysia</i>, <i>Lymnaea</i>, and <i>Tritonia</i> have been important for determining fundamental rules of motor control, learning, and memory because of their large, individually identifiable neurons. Yet only a small number of gastropod neurons have known molecular markers, limiting the ability to establish brain-wide structure–function relations. Here we combine high-throughput, single-cell RNA sequencing with in situ hybridization chain reaction in the nudibranch <i>Berghia stephanieae</i> to identify and visualize the expression of markers for cell types. Broad neuronal classes were characterized by genes associated with neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, glutamate, serotonin, and GABA, as well as neuropeptides. These classes were subdivided by other genes including transcriptional regulators and unannotated genes. Marker genes expressed by neurons and glia formed discrete, previously unrecognized regions within and between ganglia. This study provides the foundation for understanding the fundamental cellular organization of gastropod nervous systems.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria play critical roles in neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and fate decisions. The subcellular localization of mitochondria in neural stem/progenitor cells during mitosis potentially influences the distribution of mitochondria to the daughter cells and thus their fates. Therefore, understanding the spatial dynamics of mitochondria provides important knowledge about brain development. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of mitochondria in the fetal human neocortex with a particular focus on the basal radial glial cells (bRGCs), a neural stem/progenitor cell subtype attributed to the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex. During interphase, bRGCs exhibit a polarized localization of mitochondria that is localized at the base of the process or the proximal part of the process. Thereafter, mitochondria in bRGCs at metaphase show unpolarized distribution in which the mitochondria are randomly localized in the cytoplasm. During anaphase and telophase, mitochondria are still localized evenly, but mainly in the periphery of the cytoplasm. Mitochondria start to accumulate at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. These results suggest that the mitochondrial localization in bRGCs is tightly regulated during the cell cycle, which may ensure the proper distribution of mitochondria to the daughter cells and, thus in turn, influence their fates.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>For postmetamorphic specimens of amphioxus (Cephalochordata), serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the long-ignored Rohde-like cells (RLCs) at the extreme posterior end of the dorsal nerve cord. These cells, numbering about three dozen in all, are divisible into a group with larger diameters running near the dorsal side of the cord and a more ventral group with smaller diameters closely associated with the central canal of the neurocoel. It is possible that the smaller ventral cells might be generated at the ependymal zone of the dorsal nerve cord and later migrate to a dorsal position, although a functional reason for this remains a mystery. All the RLCs have conspicuous regions of microvilli covering as much as 40% of their surface; limited data (by others) on the more anterior bona fide Rohde cells also indicate an extensive microvillar surface. Thus, both the RLCs and the better-known Rohde cells appear to be rhabdomeric photoreceptors, although a specific function for this feature is currently unknown. Even more perplexingly, although the Rohde cells are quintessential neurons extending giant processes, each RLC comprises a perikaryon that does not bear any neurites.</p>

">Multi-modal Spatial-modality Attentive Fusion for Studying Neurodegenerative Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Multi-modal learning has emerged as a powerful technique that leverages diverse data sources to enhance learning and decision-making processes. Adapting this approach to analyzing data collected from different biological domains is intuitive, especially for studying neuropsychiatric disorders. A complex neuropsychiatric disorder like schizophrenia (SZ) can affect multiple aspects of the brain and biologies. These biological sources each present distinct yet correlated expressions of underlying physiological processes. Joint learning from these data sources can improve our understanding of the disorder. However, combining these biological sources is challenging for several reasons: (i) observations are domains-specific, leading to data being represented in dissimilar subspaces, and (ii) fused data is often noisy and high-dimensional, making it challenging to identify relevant information. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-modal artificial intelligence (AI) model with a novel fusion module inspired by a bottleneck attention module (BAM). We use deep neural networks (DNN) to learn latent space representations of the input streams. Next, we introduce a two-dimensional (spatio-modality) attention module to regulate the intermediate fusion for SZ classification. We implement spatial attention via a dilated convolutional neural network that creates large receptive fields for extracting significant contextual patterns. The resulting joint learning framework maximizes complementarity allowing us to explore the correspondence among the modalities. We test our model on a multi-modal imaging-genetic dataset and achieve an SZ prediction accuracy of 94.10% (P < 0.0001), outperforming state-of-the-art unimodal and multi-modal models for the task. Moreover, the model provides inherent interpretability that helps identify concepts significant for the neural network decision and explains the underlying physiopathology of the disorder. Results also show that functional connectivity among subcortical, sensorimotor, and cognitive control domains plays an important role in characterizing SZ. Analysis of the spatio-modality attention scores suggests that structural components like the supplementary motor area, caudate, and insula play a significant role in SZ. Biclustering the attention scores discover a multi-modal cluster that includes genes CSMD1, ATK3, MOB4, and HSPE1, all of which have been identified as relevant to schizophrenia. In summary, feature attribution appears to be especially useful for probing the transient and confined but decisive patterns of complex disorders, and it shows promise for extensive applicability in future studies.

">Long term rescue of Alzheimer deficits in vivo by one-time gene-editing of App C-terminus.</a></h4>

              
                Gene-editing technologies promise to create a new class of therapeutics that can achieve permanent correction with a single intervention. Besides eliminating mutant alleles in familial disease, gene-editing can also be used to favorably manipulate upstream pathophysiologic events and alter disease-course in wider patient populations, but few such feasible therapeutic avenues have been reported. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the last exon of amyloid precursor protein (App), relevant for Alzheimer disease (AD). Our strategy effectively eliminates an endocytic (YENPTY) motif at APP C-terminus, while preserving the N-terminus and compensatory APP-homologues. This manipulation favorably alters events along the amyloid-pathway; inhibiting toxic APP-beta-cleavage fragments (including amyloid-beta; and upregulating neuroprotective APP-alpha-cleavage products. AAV-driven editing ameliorates neuropathologic, electrophysiologic, and behavioral deficits in an AD knockin mouse model. Effects persist for many months, and no abnormalities are seen in WT mice even after germline App-editing; underlining overall efficacy and safety. Pathologic alterations in the glial-transcriptome of App-KI mice, as seen by single nuclei RNA-sequencing (sNuc-Seq), are also normalized by App C-terminus editing. Our strategy takes advantage of innate transcriptional rules that render terminal exons insensitive to nonsense-decay, and the upstream manipulation is expected to be effective for all forms of AD. These studies offer a path for a one-time disease-modifying treatment for AD.

                The ketogenic diet is an effective treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, but the therapeutic mechanisms are poorly understood. Although ketones are able to fuel the brain, it is not known whether ketones are directly metabolized by neurons on a time scale sufficiently rapid to fuel the bioenergetic demands of sustained synaptic transmission. Here, we show that nerve terminals can use the ketone {beta}-hydroxybutyrate in a cell-autonomous fashion to support neurotransmission in both excitatory and inhibitory nerve terminals and that this flexibility relies on Ca2+ dependent upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Using a genetically encoded ATP sensor, we show that inhibitory axons fueled by ketones sustain much higher ATP levels under steady state conditions than excitatory axons, but that the kinetics of ATP production following activity are slower when using ketones as fuel compared to lactate/pyruvate for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

">Experienced meditators show greater forward travelling cortical alpha wave strengths</a></h4>

              
                Mindfulness meditation involves training attention, commonly towards the current sensory experience, with an attitude of non-judgemental awareness. Theoretical perspectives suggest meditation alters the brain's predictive processing mechanisms, increasing the synaptic gain and precision with which sensory information is processed, and reducing the generation or elaboration of higher-order beliefs. Recent research suggests that forwards and backwards travelling cortical alpha waves provide an indication of these predictive processing functions. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to test whether the strength of forwards and backwards travelling cortical alpha waves differed between experienced meditators and a matched sample of non-meditators, both during an eyes-closed resting state (N = 97) and during a visual cognitive (Go/No-go) task (N = 126). Our results showed that meditators produced stronger forwards travelling cortical alpha waves compared to non-meditators, both while resting with their eyes closed and during task performance. Meditators also exhibited weaker backwards travelling cortical alpha wave strength while resting with their eyes closed. These results may be indicative of a neural mechanism underpinning enhanced attention associated with meditation practice, as well as a potential neural marker of the reductions in resting mind-wandering that are suggested to be associated with meditation practice. The results also support models of brain function that suggest attention modification can be achieved by mental training aimed at increased processing of sensory information, which might be indexed by greater strength of forwards travelling cortical alpha waves.

">Three-dimensional chromatin mapping of sensory neurons reveals that cohesin-dependent genomic domains are required for axonal regeneration</a></h4>

              
                The in vivo three-dimensional genomic architecture of adult mature neurons at homeostasis and after medically relevant perturbations such as axonal injury remains elusive. Here we address this knowledge gap by mapping the three-dimensional chromatin architecture and gene expression programme at homeostasis and after sciatic nerve injury in wild-type and cohesin-deficient mouse sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons via combinatorial Hi-C and RNA-seq. We find that cohesin is required for the full induction of the regenerative transcriptional program, by organising 3D genomic domains required for the activation of regenerative genes. Importantly, loss of cohesin results in disruption of chromatin architecture at regenerative genes and severely impaired nerve regeneration. Together, these data provide an original three-dimensional chromatin map of adult sensory neurons in vivo and demonstrate a role for cohesin-dependent chromatin interactions in neuronal regeneration.

">Sigh generation in preBötzinger Complex</a></h4>

              
                We explored neural mechanisms underlying sighing. Photostimulation of parafacial (pF) neuromedin B (NMB) or gastrin releasing peptide (GRP), or preBotzinger Complex (preBotC) NMBR or GRPR neurons elicited ectopic sighs with latency inversely related to time from preceding endogenous sigh. Of particular note, ectopic sighs could be produced without involvement of these peptides or their receptors in preBotC. Moreover, chemogenetic or optogenetic activation of preBotC SST neurons induced sighing, even in the presence of NMBR and/or GRPR antagonists. We propose that an increase in the excitability of preBotC NMBR or GRPR neurons not requiring activation of their peptide receptors activates partially overlapping pathways to generate sighs, and that preBotC SST neurons are a downstream element in the sigh generation circuit that converts normal breaths into sighs.

	<p>As the population ages worldwide, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent kind of neurodegenerative disorder among older people, has become a significant factor affecting quality of life, public health, and economies. However, the exact pathogenesis of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s remains elusive, and existing highly recognized pathogenesis includes the amyloid cascade hypothesis, Tau neurofibrillary tangles hypothesis, and neuroinflammation hypothesis. The major diagnoses of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease include neuroimaging positron emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid molecular diagnosis. The therapy of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease primarily relies on drugs, and the approved drugs on the market include acetylcholinesterase drugs, glutamate receptor antagonists, and amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; monoclonal antibodies. Still, the existing drugs can only alleviate the symptoms of the disease and cannot completely reverse it. This review aims to summarize existing research results on Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and drug therapy, with the objective of facilitating future research in this area.</p>

	<p>Neuropathic pain arises from injuries to the nervous system in diseases such as diabetes, infections, toxicity, and traumas. The underlying mechanism of neuropathic pain involves peripheral and central pathological modifications. Peripheral mechanisms entail nerve damage, leading to neuronal hypersensitivity and ectopic action potentials. Central sensitization involves a neuropathological process with increased responsiveness of the nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) to their normal or subthreshold input due to persistent stimuli, leading to sustained electrical discharge, synaptic plasticity, and aberrant processing in the CNS. Current treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, aim to alleviate symptoms but often face challenges due to the complexity of neuropathic pain. Neuromodulation is emerging as an important therapeutic approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients unresponsive to common therapies, by promoting the normalization of neuronal and/or glial activity and by targeting cerebral cortical regions, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and nerve endings. Having a better understanding of the efficacy, adverse events and applicability of neuromodulation through pre-clinical studies is of great importance. Unveiling the mechanisms and characteristics of neuromodulation to manage neuropathic pain is essential to understand how to use it. In the present article, we review the current understanding supporting dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord neuromodulation as a therapeutic approach for neuropathic pain.</p>

">Cell type specific roles of FOXP1 during early neocortical murine development</a></h4>

              
                Cortical development is a tightly controlled process and any deviation during development may increase the susceptibility to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Numerous studies identified mutations in FOXP1, a transcription factor enriched in the neocortex, as causal for ASD and FOXP1 syndrome. Our group has shown that Foxp1 deletion in the mouse cortex leads to overall reduced cortex thickness, alterations in cortical lamination, and changes in the relative thickness of cortical layers. However, the developmental and cell type-specific mechanisms underlying these changes remained unclear. This work characterizes the developmental requirement of neocortical Foxp1 at key embryonic and perinatal ages using a conditional knock-out of Foxp1. We find that Foxp1 deletion results in accelerated pseudo-age during early neurogenesis, increased cell cycle exit during late neurogenesis, altered gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and selective migration deficits in a subset of upper-layer neurons. These data explain the postnatal differences observed in cortical layers and relative cortical thickness. We also highlight genes regulated by FOXP1 and their enrichment with high-confidence ASD or synaptic genes. Together, these results underscore a network of neurodevelopmental disorder-related genes that may serve as potential modulatory targets for postnatal modification relevant to ASD and FOXP1 syndrome.

">Concurrent emergence of view invariance, sensitivity to critical features, and identity face classification through visual experience: Insights from deep learning algorithms</a></h4>

              
                Visual experience is known to play a critical role in face recognition. This experience is believed to enable the formation of a view-invariant representation, by learning which features are critical for face identification across views. Discovering these critical features and the type of experience that is needed to uncover them is challenging. We have recently revealed a subset of facial features that are critical for human face recognition. We further revealed that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that are trained on face classification, but not on object categorization, are sensitive to these facial features, highlighting the importance of experience with faces for the system to reveal these critical features. These findings enable us now to ask what type of experience with faces is required for the network to become sensitive to these human-like critical features and whether it is associated with the formation of a view-invariant representation and face classification performance. To that end, we systematically manipulated the number of within-identity and between-identity face images and examined its effect on the network performance on face classification, view-invariant representation, and sensitivity to human-like critical facial features. Results show that increasing the number of images per identity as well as the number of identities were both required for the simultaneous development of a view-invariant representation, sensitivity to human-like critical features, and successful identity classification. The concurrent emergence of sensitivity to critical features, view invariance and classification performance through experience implies that they depend on similar features. Overall, we show how systematic manipulation of the training diet of DCNNs can shed light on the role of experience on the generation of human-like representations.

">Visual Identification of Conspecifics Shapes Social Behavior in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing conspecifics in order to determine how to interact with them appropriately is a fundamental goal of animal sensory systems. It has undergone selective pressure in nearly all species. Mice have a large repertoire of social behaviors that are the subject of a rapidly growing field of study in neuroscience. Mouse social interactions likely incorporate all available sensory modalities, and the vast majority of studies have not attempted to isolate them. Specifically the role of vision in mouse social interactions remains unclear. We developed a behavioral platform that allowed us to present a subject mouse the visual information of stimulus mice in isolation from olfactory, acoustic, and tactile cues. Our results indicate that the visual identification of the sex or individual identity of other mice influences behavior. These findings highlight the underappreciated role of vision in mouse social interactions and open new avenues to study the visual circuits underlying social behavior.

">Disruption of Core Stress Granule Protein Aggregates Promotes CNS Axon Regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Depletion or inhibition of core stress granule proteins, G3BP1 in mammals and TIAR-2 in C. elegans, increases axon regeneration in injured neurons that show spontaneous regeneration. Inhibition of G3BP1 by expression of its acidic or B-domain accelerates axon regeneration after nerve injury bringing a potential therapeutic intervention to promote neural repair in the peripheral nervous system. Here, we asked if G3BP1 inhibition is a viable strategy to promote regeneration in the injured mammalian central nervous system where axons do not regenerate spontaneously. G3BP1 B-domain expression was found to promote axon regeneration in both the mammalian spinal cord and optic nerve. Moreover, a cell permeable peptide to a subregion of G3BP1 B-domain (rodent G3BP1 amino acids 190-208) accelerated axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury and promoted the regrowth of reticulospinal axons into the distal transected spinal cord through a bridging peripheral nerve graft. The rodent and human G3BP1 peptides promoted axon growth from rodent and human neurons cultured on permissive substrates, and this function required alternating Glu/Asp-Pro repeats that impart a unique predicted tertiary structure. These studies point to G3BP1 granules as a critical impediment to CNS axon regeneration and indicate that G3BP1 granule disassembly represents a novel therapeutic strategy for promoting neural repair after CNS injury.

">Internalized α-synuclein fibrils become truncated and resist degradation in neurons while glial cells rapidly degrade α-synuclein fibrils.</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) and other -synucleinopathies are characterized by the accumulation of -synuclein (S) pathology that can spread via the cell-to-cell transmission of S aggregates. To better understand how various brain cells contribute to the spreading of S pathology, we examined the metabolism of S aggreges or pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) in neuronal and glial cells (microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes). In neurons, while the full-length S rapidly disappeared following S PFF uptake, truncated S accumulated with a half-life of days rather than hours. Epitope mapping and fractionation studies indicate that S PFF was truncated at the C-terminal region following uptake and remained insoluble/aggregated. In contrast, microglia and astrocytes rapidly metabolized S PFF as the half-lives of S PFF in these glial cells were <6 hours. Differential processing of S by neurons was recapitulated in cell lines as differentiated CLU neuronal cell lines stably accumulate truncated S while undifferentiated cells rapidly metabolize S. Immunolocalization and subcellular fractionation studies show that internalized S PFF is initially localized to endosomes followed by lysosomes. The lysosome is largely responsible for the degradation of internalized S PFF as the inhibition of lysosomal function leads to the stabilization of S in all cell types. Significantly, S PFF causes lysosomal dysfunction in neurons. In summary, we show that neurons are inefficient in metabolizing internalized S aggregates, partially because S aggregates cause lysosomal dysfunction, potentially generating aggregation-prone truncated S. In contrast, glial cells may protect neurons from S aggregates by rapidly clearing S aggregates.

">Spatial frequency adaptation modulates population receptive field sizes</a></h4>

              
                The spatial tuning of neuronal populations in the early visual cortical regions is related to the spatial frequency (SF) selectivity of neurons. However, there has been no direct investigation into how this relationship is reflected in population receptive field (pRF) sizes despite the common application of pRF mapping in visual neuroscience. We hypothesised that adaptation to high/low SF would decrease the sensitivity of neurons with respectively small/large receptive field sizes, resulting in a change in pRF sizes as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). To test this hypothesis, we first quantified the SF aftereffect using a psychophysical paradigm where observers made SF judgments following adaptation to high/low SF noise patterns. We then incorporated the same adaptation technique into a standard pRF mapping procedure, to investigate the spatial tuning of the early visual cortex following SF adaptation. Results showed that adaptation to a low/high SF resulted in smaller/larger pRFs respectively, as hypothesised. Our results provide the most direct evidence to date that the spatial tuning of the visual cortex, as measured by pRF mapping, is related to the SF selectivity of visual neural populations. This has implications for various domains of visual processing, including size perception and visual acuity.

">Association of GLOD4 with Alzheimers Disease in Humans and Mice</a></h4>

              
                Glyoxylase domain containing protein (GLOD4) is associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). We quantified GLOD4 in human AD brains, mouse AD model, and neuroblastoma N2a-APPswe cells. We found that GLOD4 was downregulated in human AD patients compared to non-AD controls. Glod4 was similarly downregulated in Blmh-/-5xFAD mouse model of AD. Downregulated Glod4 was associated with elevated A{beta} and worsened memory/sensorimotor performance in Blmh-/-5xFAD mice. Glod4 depletion in N2a-APPswe cells upregulated A{beta}PP and downregulated autophagy-related Atg5 and p62 genes. These findings suggest that Glod4 interacts with A{beta}PP and the autophagy pathway, disruption of these interactions leads to A{beta} accumulation and cognitive/neurosensory deficits.

">On the epistemic role of hippocampal cells: the case of splitter cells</a></h4>

              
                Over the past decades, the hippocampal formation has undergone extensive study leading researchers to identify a vast array of cells with functional properties (place cells, splitter cells, etc). In the present work, we aim at investigating whether the activity of those cells derives from the anatomy and inner circuitry of the hippocampal formation or derives instead from the actual behavior of the animal. To do so, we simulated an agent navigating inside an 8-shaped track, making alternating choices (T-maze alternating task). We designed a random network, based on the reservoir computing paradigm, that processes distance-based sensors and outputs a direction change (constant speed). Despite its simplicity, the model successfully solved the task while bearing no structural similarity with the hippocampal formation. We subsequently followed the comprehensive and recent review on splitter cells by Duvelle et al. (eLife, 2019), and applied the exact same analysis onto the activity on the cells composing our model. We were able to identify splitter cells (as well as place cells, head direction cells and decision cells) and confirm a significant portion of the theoretical hypotheses of Duvelle et al. regarding splitter cells. Beyond these results, this work strongly suggests that the activity of such cells originates from the actual behavior of the agent as opposed to any structural or anatomical origin: any model doing the same task might exhibit the same cell activity. From a broader point of view, this work questions the epistemic role of such cells in our understanding of the hippocampal formation.

">Mechanism of an Intrinsic Oscillation in Rat Geniculate Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Depolarizing current injections produced a rhythmic bursting of action potentials, a bursting oscillation, in a set of local interneurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of rats. The current dynamics underlying this firing pattern have not been determined, though this cell type constitutes an important cellular component of thalamocortical circuitry, and contributes to both pathologic and non-pathologic brain states. We thus investigated the source of the bursting oscillation using pharmacological manipulations in LGN slices in vitro and in silico. 1. Selective blockade of calcium channel subtypes revealed that high-threshold calcium currents IL and IP contributed strongly to the oscillation. 2. Increased extracellular K+ concentration (decreased K+ currents) eliminated the oscillation. 3. Selective blockade of K+ channel subtypes demonstrated that the calcium-sensitive potassium current (IAHP ) was of primary importance. A morphologically simplified, multicompartment model of the thalamic interneuron characterized the oscillation as follows: 1. The low-threshold calcium current (IT ) provided the strong initial burst characteristic of the oscillation. 2. Alternating fluxes through high-threshold calcium channels and IAHP then provided the continuing burst oscillation and interburst periods respectively. This interplay between IL and IAHP contrasts with the current dynamics underlying oscillations in thalamocortical and reticularis neurons, which primarily involve IT and IH, or IT and IAHP respectively. These findings thus point to a novel electrophysiological mechanism for generating intrinsic oscillations in a major thalamic cell type. Because local interneurons can sculpt the behavior of thalamocortical circuits, these results suggest new targets for the manipulation of ascending thalamocortical network activity.

">Social valence dictates sex differences in identity recognition</a></h4>

              
                Social valence is the directional emotional significance affiliated with social experiences. Maladaptive processing of negative social valence (NSV) has been linked to mood disorder susceptibility, which is more prevalent in women. To determine whether there are sex differences in NSV processing, we developed social valence tasks where the identity recognition of conspecifics with distinct valences served as the readout. Male mice demonstrated identity recognition regardless of social valence. Conversely, female mice did not show identity recognition following the NSV task. In vivo calcium imaging of the dorsal CA1 further revealed sex differences in NSV processing with reduced hippocampal representation of social information in female mice. These results suggest the imprecise encoding of NSV may contribute to the heightened vulnerability to social stress-related mood disorders in women.

">Maternal Immune Activation imprints translational dysregulation and differential MAP2 phosphorylation in descendant neural stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Alterations induced by maternal immune activation (MIA) during gestation impact the subsequent neurodevelopment of progeny, a process that in humans, has been linked to the development of several neuropsychiatric conditions. To undertake a comprehensive examination of the molecular mechanisms governing MIA, we have devised an in vitro model based on neural stem cells (NSCs) sourced from fetuses carried by animals subjected to Poly I:C treatment. These neural progenitors demonstrate proliferative capacity and can be effectively differentiated into both neurons and glial cells. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic analyses conducted on these cellular models, in conjunction with counterparts from control treatments, revealed discernible shifts in the expression levels of a specific subset of proteins implicated in neuronal function. Noteworthy, we found an absence of congruence between these alterations at the transcriptomic level, suggesting that differences in protein translation contribute to the observed dysregulation. Furthermore, the phosphoproteomic data highlighted a discernible discrepancy in the basal phosphorylation of proteins between differentiated cells from both experimental groups, particularly within proteins associated with cytoskeletal architecture and synaptic functionality, notably those belonging to the MAP family. Observed alterations in MAP phosphorylation were found to potentially have functional consequences as they correlate with changes in neuronal plasticity and the establishment of neuronal synapses. Our data agrees with previous published observations and further underscore the importance of MAP2 phosphorylation state on its function and the impact that this protein has in neuronal structure and function.

                A BEM (boundary element method) based approach is developed to accurately solve an EEG/MEG forward problem for a modern high-resolution head model in approximately 60 seconds using a common workstation. The method utilizes a charge-based BEM with fast multipole acceleration (BEM-FMM) and a "smart" mesh pre-refinement (called b-refinement) close to the singular source(s). No costly matrix-filling or direct solution steps typical for the standard BEM are required; the method generates on-skin voltages as well as MEG magnetic fields for high-resolution head models in approximately 60 seconds after initial model assembly. The method is verified both theoretically and experimentally.

">Emotional Distractors Capture Attention even at Very Low Contrast Levels: ERP evidence</a></h4>

              
                Emotional visual stimuli, whether appealing or aversive, preferentially capture exogenous attention due to their evolutionary significance. This study assessed whether such capacity persists at low contrast levels, where stimuli are minimally perceived. To this end, we recorded behavioral and electrophysiological (event-related potentials, ERPs) indices of attentional capture from 38 participants who were exposed to negative, neutral, and positive scenes, each presented at four distinct contrast levels. These contrast levels had previously resulted in a correct recognition rate of up to 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% in a previous sample of 235 participants. Participants were presented with these scenes as distractors while simultaneously performing a perceptual task involving line orientation discrimination. The ERP results confirmed the expected emotional effect on exogenous attention and, critically, unveiled its persistence across all contrast levels. Specifically, occipito-parietal P1 (88-119 ms) was larger for negative than for positive distractors, while in a spreaded N2 component, positive distractors elicited larger amplitudes relative to both negative (213-354 ms) and neutral (213-525 ms) images. These findings reinforce the advantage of emotional distractors in accessing neural processing automatically and highlight the existence of a temporal negativity bias. Importantly, our novel findings emphasize the robustness of this exogenous attention pattern, present even under limited perceptual conditions.

                We investigate the use of competitive co-evolution for synthesizing progressively better solutions. Specifically, we introduce a set of methods to measure historical and global progress. We discuss the factors that facilitate genuine progress. Finally, we compare the efficacy of four qualitatively different algorithms. The selected algorithms promote genuine progress by creating an archive of opponents used to evaluate evolving individuals, generating archives that include high-performing and well-differentiated opponents, identifying and discarding variations that lead to local progress only (i.e. progress against a subset of possible opponents and retrogressing against a larger set). The results obtained in a predator-prey scenario, commonly used to study competitive evolution, demonstrate that all the considered methods lead to global progress in the long term. However, the rate of progress and the ratio of progress versus retrogressions vary significantly among algorithms.

                Hereditary defects in the function of the Kir7.1 in the retinal pigment epithelium are associated with the ocular diseases retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, and snowflake vitreal degeneration. Studies also suggest that Kir7.1 may be regulated by a GPCR, the melanocortin-4 receptor, in certain hypothalamic neurons. We present the first structures of human Kir7.1 and describe the conformational bias displayed by two pathogenic mutations, R162Q and E276A, to provide an explanation for the basis of disease and illuminate the gating pathway. We also demonstrate the structural basis for the blockade of the channel by a small molecule ML418 and demonstrate that channel blockade in vivo activates MC4R neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), inhibiting food intake and inducing weight loss. Preliminary purification, and structural and pharmacological characterization of an in tandem construct of MC4R and Kir7.1 suggests that the fusion protein forms a homotetrameric channel that retains regulation by liganded MC4R molecules.

                Various pathological characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) stem from abnormalities in brain resident immune cells, specifically microglia, to prune unnecessary synapses or neural connections during early development. Animal models of ASD exhibit an abundance of synapses in different brain regions, which is strongly linked to the appearance of ASD behaviors. Overexpression of CD47 on neurons acts as a do not eat me signal, safeguarding synapses from inappropriate pruning by microglia. Indeed, CD47 overexpression occurs in 16p11.2 deletion carriers, causing decreased synaptic phagocytosis and the manifestation of ASD characteristics. However, the role of CD47 in synaptic pruning impairment leading to ASD phenotypes in the 16p11.2 deletion mouse model is unclear. Moreover, whether blocking CD47 can alleviate ASD mice's behavioral deficits remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate a strong link between increased CD47 expression, decreased microglia phagocytosis capacity, and increased impairment in social novelty preference in the 16p11.2 deletion mice. The reduction in microglia phagocytosis caused a rise in excitatory synapses and transmission in the prefrontal cortex of 16p11.2 deletion mice. Importantly, blocking CD47 using a specific CD47 antibody or reducing CD47 expression using a specific shRNA enhanced the microglia phagocytosis and reduced excitatory transmission. Reduction in CD47 expression improved social novelty preference deficits in 16p11.2 mice. These findings demonstrate that CD47 contributes to the ASD phenotypes in the 16p11.2 deletion mice and could be a promising target for the development of treatment for ASD.

Algorithmically, tracking individual molecules across hundreds of micrometres and determining whether they are inside any cellular compartment of interest can be challenging. Historically, microscopy images are annotated manually, often using multiple software packages to detect fluorescence puncta (e.g. labelled mRNAs) and then trace and quantify cellular compartments of interest. Advanced ANN-based automated tools, while powerful, are often able to help only with selected parts of the data analysis pipeline, may be optimised for specific spatial resolutions or cell preparations or may not be fully open source and open access to be sufficiently customisable. To address these challenges, we developed SpyDen. SpyDen is a Python package based upon three principles: i) ease of use for multi-task scenarios, ii) open-source accessibility and data export to a common, open data format, iii) the ability to edit any software-generated annotation and generalise across spatial resolutions. Equipped with a graphical user interface and accompanied by video tutorials, SpyDen provides a collection of powerful algorithms that can be used for neurite and synapse detection as well as fluorescent puncta and intensity analysis. We validated SpyDen using expert annotation across numerous use cases to prove a powerful, integrated platform for efficient and reproducible molecular imaging analysis.

">EEG is better when cleaning effectively targets artifacts</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) is a useful tool to measure neural activity. However, EEG data are usually contaminated with non-neural artifacts, including voltage shifts generated by eye movements and muscle activity, and other artifacts that are less easily characterizable. The confounding influence of artifacts is often addressed by decomposing data into components, subtracting probable artifactual components, then reconstructing data back into the electrode space. This approach is commonly applied using independent component analysis (ICA). Here, we demonstrate the counterintuitive finding that due to imperfect component separation, component subtraction can artificially inflate effect sizes for event-related potentials (ERPs) and connectivity measures, bias source localisation estimates, and remove neural signals. To address this issue, we developed a method that targets cleaning to the artifact periods of eye movement components and artifact frequencies of muscle components. When tested across different EEG systems and cognitive tasks, our results showed that the targeted artifact reduction method is effective in cleaning artifacts while also reducing the artificial inflation of ERP and connectivity effect sizes and minimizing source localisation biases. Our results suggest EEG pre-processing is better when targeted cleaning is applied, as this improves preservation of neural signals and mitigates effect size inflation and source localisation biases that result from approaches which subtract artifact components across the entire time-series. These improvements enhance the reliability and validity of EEG data analysis. Our method is provided in the freely available RELAX pipeline, which includes a graphical user interface for ease of use and is available as an EEGLAB plugin (https://github.com/NeilwBailey/RELAX).

">Menstrual cycle phase modulates causal connectivity in the resting-state brain of healthy females.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ovarian hormones exert direct and indirect influences on the brain; however, little is known about how these hormones impact causal brain connectivity. Studying the female brain at a single time point may be confounded by distinct hormone phases. Despite this, the menstrual cycle is often overlooked. The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate resting-state causal connectivity during the early follicular and mid-luteal menstrual phases corresponding to low vs high estradiol and progesterone, respectively. Methods: Fourteen healthy control females (M = 20.36 years, SD =2.02) participated in this study. Participants were scheduled for two resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) scans during their monthly menstrual cycle. A saliva sample was also collected at each EEG session for hormone analyses. Causal connectivity was quantified using information flow rate of EEG source data. Demographic information, emotional empathy, and sleep quality were obtained from self-report questionnaires. Results: Progesterone levels were significantly higher in the mid-luteal phase compared to the early follicular phase (p = .041). We observed distinct patterns of causal connectivity along the menstrual cycle. Connectivity in the early follicular phase was centralized and shifted posteriorly during the mid-luteal phase. During the early follicular phase, the primary regions driving activity were the right central and left/right parietal regions, with the left central region being the predominant receiver of activity. During the mid-luteal phase, connections were primarily transmitted from the right side and the main receiver region was the left occipital region. Network topology during the mid-luteal phase was found to be significantly more assortative compared to the early follicular phase. Conclusions: The observed difference in causal connectivity demonstrates how network dynamics reorganize as a function of menstrual phase and level of progesterone. In the mid-luteal phase, there was a strong shift for information flow to be directed at visual spatial processing and visual attention areas, whereas in the follicular phase, there was strong information flow primarily within the sensory-motor regions. The mid-luteal phase was significantly more assortative, suggesting greater network efficiency and resilience. These results contribute to the emerging literature on brain-hormone interactions.

">Diet-microbiome interactions promote enteric nervous system resilience following spinal cord injury</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in a plethora of physiological dysfunctions across all body systems, including intestinal dysmotility and atrophy of the enteric nervous system (ENS). Typically, the ENS has capacity to recover from perturbation, so it is unclear why intestinal pathophysiologies persist after traumatic spinal injury. With emerging evidence demonstrating SCI-induced alterations to the gut microbiome composition, we hypothesized that modulation of the gut microbiome could contribute to enteric nervous system recovery after injury. Here, we show that intervention with the dietary fiber, inulin prevents ENS atrophy and limits SCI-induced intestinal dysmotility in mice. However, SCI-associated microbiomes and exposure to specific SCI-sensitive gut microbes are not sufficient to modulate injury-induced intestinal dysmotility. Intervention with microbially-derived short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolites prevents ENS dysfunctions and phenocopies inulin treatment in injured mice, implicating these microbiome metabolites in protection of the ENS. Notably, inulin-mediated resilience is dependent on signaling by the cytokine IL-10, highlighting a critical diet-microbiome-immune axis that promotes ENS resilience following SCI. Overall, we demonstrate that diet and microbially-derived signals distinctly impact recovery of the ENS after traumatic spinal injury. This protective diet-microbiome-immune axis may represent a foundation to uncover etiological mechanisms and future therapeutics for SCI-induced neurogenic bowel.

">The ventral CA2 region of the hippocampus and its differential contributions to social memory and social aggression</a></h4>

              
                Although it is well-known that the hippocampus mediates declarative memory (the repository of information of people, places, things and events) and influences behavior, the differential contributions of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus to specific forms of memory and behavior remain largely unknown. Studies to date show that the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region is important for cognitive and spatial tasks whereas the ventral CA1 region is associated with affective or emotional processing. Whether other regions and forms of hippocampal-dependent memory and behavior show a similar distinction remains unclear. Here we examine how social memory and related social behaviors are encoded across the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus. Although recent studies show that the dorsal hippocampal CA2 region is required for social memory and acts to promote social aggression, the behavioral role of ventral CA2 remains unknown. Indeed, whether a defined CA2 region extends throughout ventral hippocampus is controversial. Here, we report that a molecularly, anatomically and electrophysiologically defined CA2 region extends to the extreme ventral pole of hippocampus, with both similarities and important differences in its projection patterns and synaptic impact compared to dorsal CA2. Of particular importance, we find that ventral CA2 is not required for social memory but is critical for promoting social aggression. These results support the view that the ventral region of hippocampus is more generally tuned for emotionally-related behaviors compared to the cognitively-tuned dorsal hippocampus.

">Ternary representation of contextual information along the CA1 transverse axis</a></h4>

              
                The function of CA1 region in the rat hippocampus is transversely organized, aligning with input profiles from the entorhinal cortex and the CA3-CA2 region. We asked how CA1 neurons respond diversely to various contextual changes along the transverse axis, and how it may be influenced by selective inputs from upstream brain regions. Neuronal activity across the entire proximo-distal extent of CA1 in Long-Evans rats was monitored under manipulations of spatial or non-spatial environmental cues. Our results identified three distinct patterns of cue representation that varied from the proximal to the distal end of CA1: a descending gradient in spatial information processing, an ascending gradient in representation of local object features, and a reverse J-shaped pattern in response to non-spatial cue manipulation. This heterogeneity is closely linked to the nature of information altered in the environment, suggesting an involvement of upstream cue-selective neurons in shaping CA1 function.

">Insula uses overlapping codes for emotion in self and others</a></h4>

              
                In daily life, we must recognize others' emotions so we can respond appropriately. This ability may rely, at least in part, on neural responses similar to those associated with our own emotions. We hypothesized that the insula, a cortical region near the junction of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, may play a key role in this process. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity in human neurosurgical patients performing two tasks, one focused on identifying their own emotional response and one on identifying facial emotional responses in others. We found matching patterns of gamma- and high-gamma band activity for the two tasks in the insula. Three other regions (MTL, ACC, and OFC) clearly encoded both self- and other- emotions, but used orthogonal activity patterns to do so. These results support the hypothesis that the insula plays a particularly important role in mediating between experienced vs. observed emotions.

">Decreased scene-selective activity within the posterior intraparietal cortex in amblyopic adults</a></h4>

              
                Amblyopia is a developmental disorder associated with reduced performance in visually guided tasks, including binocular navigation within natural environments. To help understand the underlying neurological disorder, we used fMRI to test the impact of amblyopia on the functional organization of scene-selective cortical areas, including the posterior intraparietal gyrus scene-selective (PIGS) area, a recently discovered region that responds selectively to ego-motion within naturalistic environments (Kennedy et al., 2024). Nineteen amblyopic adults (10 female) and thirty age-matched controls (12 female) participated in this study. Amblyopic participants spanned a wide range of amblyopia severity, based on their interocular visual acuity difference and stereoacuity. The visual function questionnaire (VFQ-39) was used to assess the participants perception of their visual capabilities. Compared to controls, we found weaker scene-selective activity within the PIGS area in amblyopic individuals. By contrast, the level of scene-selective activity across the occipital place area (OPA), parahippocampal place area (PPA), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC)) remained comparable between amblyopic and control participants. The subjects scores on general vision (VFQ-39 subscale) correlated with the level of scene-selective activity in PIGS. These results provide novel and direct evidence for amblyopia-related changes in scene-processing networks, thus enabling future studies to potentially link these changes across the spectrum of documented disabilities in amblyopia.

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the long-term consequences of the virus, particularly the persistent symptoms that characterize long COVID. This syndrome, which can last for months after the initial infection, includes a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations that have significant implications for brain health and dementia research. This review explores the current understanding of long COVID&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and their potential impact on brain stimulation and neuroimaging studies. It argues that researchers must adapt their study designs and screening processes to account for the confounding effects of long COVID and ensure the accuracy and reliability of their findings. To advance the understanding of this condition and its long-term effects on brain health, the review proposes a series of strategies, including the development of standardized screening tools, the investigation of underlying mechanisms, and the identification of risk factors and protective factors. It also emphasizes the importance of collaborative research efforts and international data sharing platforms in accelerating the pace of discovery and developing targeted interventions for individuals with long COVID. As the prevalence of this condition continues to grow, it is imperative that the neuroscience community comes together to address this challenge and support those affected by long COVID.</p>

                <p>Clinical studies of major depression (MD) generally focus on group effects, yet interindividual differences in brain function are increasingly recognized as important and may even impact effect sizes related to group effects. Here, we examine the magnitude of individual differences in relation to group differences that are commonly investigated (e.g., related to MD diagnosis and treatment response). Functional MRI data from 107 participants (63 female, 44 male) were collected at baseline, 2, and 8&nbsp;weeks during which patients received pharmacotherapy (escitalopram, <I>N</I> = 68) and controls (<I>N</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;39) received no intervention. The unique contributions of different sources of variation were examined by calculating how much variance in functional connectivity was shared across all participants and sessions, within/across groups (patients vs controls, responders vs nonresponders, female vs male participants), recording sessions, and individuals. Individual differences and common connectivity across groups, sessions, and participants contributed most to the explained variance (&gt;95% across analyses). Group differences related to MD diagnosis, treatment response, and biological sex made significant but small contributions (0.3&ndash;1.2%). High individual variation was present in cognitive control and attention areas, while low individual variation characterized primary sensorimotor regions. Group differences were much smaller than individual differences in the context of MD and its treatment. These results could be linked to the variable findings and difficulty translating research on MD to clinical practice. Future research should examine brain features with low and high individual variation in relation to psychiatric symptoms and treatment trajectories to explore the clinical relevance of the individual differences identified here.</p>

                <p>Homeostatic plasticity stabilizes firing rates of neurons, but the pressure to restore low activity rates can significantly alter synaptic and cellular properties. Most previous studies of homeostatic readjustment to complete activity silencing in rodent forebrain have examined changes after 2&nbsp;d of deprivation, but it is known that longer periods of deprivation can produce adverse effects. To better understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to address how presynaptic as well as postsynaptic compartments change during homeostatic plasticity, we subjected mouse cortical slice cultures to a more severe 5&nbsp;d deprivation paradigm. We developed and validated a computational framework to measure the number and morphology of presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments from super-resolution light microscopy images of dense cortical tissue. Using these tools, combined with electrophysiological miniature excitatory postsynaptic current measurements, and synaptic imaging at the electron microscopy level, we assessed the functional and morphological results of prolonged deprivation. Excitatory synapses were strengthened both presynaptically and postsynaptically. Surprisingly, we also observed a decrement in the density of excitatory synapses, both as measured from colocalized staining of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in tissue and from the number of dendritic spines. Overall, our results suggest that cortical networks deprived of activity progressively move toward a smaller population of stronger synapses.</p>

                Background Non-union fractures can be prevented with bone grafts, such as hydroxyapatite made from green mussel shells. Green mussel shells contain a high percentage of HA, making them a promising alternative for bone healing. This research aims to reveal the effectiveness of green mussel shell HA as a bone substitute material and to provide knowledge for further research. Methods This research was conducted for four months using a true experimental research method with a post-test-only control group design. This study used 36 New Zealand rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) which were divided into 9 groups: positive control, negative control, and intervention at weeks 2, 4 and 6 after the intervention. All groups were subjected to three general procedures: pre-surgery, surgery, and post-surgery. This study utilized histological evaluation and biochemical assessment, specifically measuring serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, to investigate the effects of hydroxyapatite (HA) from green mussel shells on bone healing in rabbits. Results The findings demonstrated that green mussel shell HA hashad efficacy in accelerating bone healing, better than HA bovine HA i.e. green mussel shell hydroxyapatite showed superior efficacy compared to bovine hydroxyapatite in accelerating and maximizing fracture healing, as compared to the 6-week negative control group and demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusions Green mussel hydroxyapatite is proven to be able to fasten and maximize the bone healing process as fast as bovine HA, and even has higher efficacy than bovine HA.

                Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension (HPT), and type II diabetes (T2D) are of increasing concern in South Africa (SA), with women being more at risk. Authors conducted a scoping review to identify and map the evidence available about the barriers of access to obesity, HPT, and T2D care among women in SA. Methods Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping review was used. The search of the literature was completed in the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases between April and May 2022. Only studies conducted among women in SA were eligible for inclusion. Identified barriers were mapped onto Levesque’s framework of access to health care to determine which points along the chain of accessing NCD health care among women are mostly impacted. Results Seven articles were included in the review: qualitative (n=2), quantitative (n=2), mixed methods (n=2), and grey literature (n=1). The included studies reported barriers of access to HPT and T2D care only, and no study reported barriers to obesity care. Supply-side barriers included lack of knowledge about available services, physician heavy workloads, medicine stock-outs, limited availability of testing equipment, travelling long distances, long waiting times, and delayed referral. Demand-side barriers included women having low self-awareness of NCD status, concerns about confidentiality, perceived discrimination, and poverty. Conclusions The study highlighted barriers related to the availability and accessibility dimension of access to health care, indicating that care for HPT and T2D is often inaccessible, with women often unable to reach health facilities or service providers. There is a pressing need for further research on access to healthcare for obesity, T2D, and HPT for women in South Africa, particularly among women who bear a disproportionately high burden of these conditions.

                Background High work pressure and complex problems during the COVID-19 pandemic caused nursing staff, including first-line managers, experienced burnout. Objective This study aims to explore burnout experienced of first-line managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This qualitative descriptive study used thematic analysis. Twelve first-line managers were selected using purposive sampling from two government hospitals, designated as COVID-19 referral centres in Jakarta and Depok, Indonesia. Data were collected through semi-structured online face-to-face interviews using ZOOM meeting video with a guideline interview. Results Exploration of first-line manager’s burnout revealed three themes: 1) unpreparedness, 2) impact on wellbeing, and 3) resilience. Conclusion The first-line managers experienced burnout during the pandemic due to obstacles in implementing management roles and functions accompanied. Their burnout was caused by the unpreparedness of both the hospital management and the community. Their burnout has an impact on their emotional and physical well-being. By this time, the first-line manager’s resilience was formed because they used adaptive coping mechanisms and had a good support system. The experience during COVID-19 should be a lesson learned to strengthen the healthcare system in the future. Risk management mitigation must be systematically and routinely performed.

                Abstract* Background Researchers are leading the development of AI designed to conduct interviews. These developments imply that AI's role is expanding from mere data analysis to becoming a tool for social researchers to interact with and comprehend their subjects. Yet, academic discussions have not addressed the potential impacts of AI on narrative interviews. In narrative interviews, the method of collecting data is a collaborative effort. The interviewer also contributes to exploring and shaping the interviewee's story. A compelling narrative interviewer has to display critical skills, such as maintaining a specific questioning order, showing empathy, and helping participants delve into and build their own stories. Methods This case study configured an OpenAI Assistant on WhatsApp to conduct narrative interviews with a human participant. The participant shared the same story in two distinct conversations: first, following a standard cycle and answering questions earnestly, and second, deliberately sidetracking the assistant from the main interview path as instructed by the researcher, to test how well the metrics could reflect the deliberate differences between different conversations. The AI's performance was evaluated through conversation analysis and specific narrative indicators, focusing on its adherence to the interview structure, empathy, narrative coherence, complexity, and support for human participant agency. The study sought to answer these questions: 1) How can the proposed metrics help us, as social researchers without a technical background, understand the quality of the AI-driven interviews in this study? 2) What do these findings contribute to our discussion on using AI in narrative interviews for social research? 3) What further research could these results inspire? Results The findings show to what extent the AI maintained structure and adaptability in conversations, illustrating its potential to support personalized, flexible narrative interviews based on specific needs. Conclusions These results suggest that social researchers without a technical background can use observation-based metrics to gauge how well an AI assistant conducts narrative interviews. They also prompt reflection on AI's role in narrative interviews and spark further research.

                Background Mental health and work are closely interlinked. Evidence suggests that food handlers suffer from poor mental health across the globe. A job in the food service sector is emotionally demanding as employees directly interact with customers who insist on impeccable services and real-time responses. The causes of mental health conditions among food handlers are multifactorial. Studies on the antecedents, outcomes, and intervening factors of foodservice employees’ mental health are fragmented and sparse. Objective We aimed to explore the existing literature describing the antecedents and outcomes of mental health disorders among food handlers. Moreover, we also aimed to explore various contextual factors that directly or indirectly influence the relationship between multiple antecedents and outcomes of food handlers’ mental health. Inclusion criteria Studies that focus on identifying the antecedents, outcomes, and contextual factors that influence the relationship between the antecedents and consequences of food handlers’ mental health will be included in the scoping review. Methods This scoping review will follow Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework: 1) identifying the research question; 2) identifying relevant studies; 3) study selection; 4) charting the data; and 5) collating, summarizing, and reporting results. Comprehensive searches will be conducted in databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL using relevant keywords. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria that focused on antecedents, outcomes, and contextual factors influencing the mental health of food handlers will be selected. Data will be extracted and charted in electronic form. The findings will be narratively summarized and thematically analyzed to answer the research questions.

                <p>by Shaked Bergman, Tamir Tuller</p>

CRISPR is a gene editing technology which enables precise in-vivo genome editing; but its potential is hampered by its relatively low specificity and sensitivity. Improving CRISPR’s on-target and off-target effects requires a better understanding of its mechanism and determinants. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the chromosomal 3D spatial structure’s association with CRISPR’s cleavage efficiency, and its predictive capabilities. We used high-resolution Hi-C data to estimate the 3D distance between different regions in the human genome and utilized these spatial properties to generate 3D-based features, characterizing each region’s density. We evaluated these features based on empirical, in-vivo CRISPR efficiency data and compared them to 425 features used in state-of-the-art models. The 3D features ranked in the top 13% of the features, and significantly improved the predictive power of LASSO and xgboost models trained with these features. The features indicated that sites with lower spatial density demonstrated higher efficiency. Understanding how CRISPR is affected by the 3D DNA structure provides insight into CRISPR’s mechanism in general and improves our ability to correctly predict CRISPR’s cleavage as well as design sgRNAs for therapeutic and scientific use.

                <p>by Christina M. P. Ray, Huilin Yang, Jamie B. Spangler, Feilim Mac Gabhann</p>

The spread of cancer from organ to organ (metastasis) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors (IL-6R and IL-8R) with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.

Immunization through repeated direct venous inoculation of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ) under chloroquine chemoprophylaxis, using the PfSPZ Chemoprophylaxis Vaccine (PfSPZ-CVac), induces high-level protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Humoral and cellular immunity contribute to vaccine efficacy but only limited information about the implicated Pf-specific antigens is available. Here, we examined Pf-specific antibody profiles, measured by protein arrays representing the full Pf proteome, of 40 placebo- and PfSPZ-immunized malaria-naïve volunteers from an earlier published PfSPZ-CVac dose-escalation trial. For this purpose, we both utilized and adapted supervised machine learning methods to identify predictive antibody profiles at two different time points: after immunization and before CHMI. We developed an adapted multitask support vector machine (SVM) approach and compared it to standard methods, i.e. single-task SVM, regularized logistic regression and random forests. Our results show, that the multitask SVM approach improved the classification performance to discriminate the protection status based on the underlying antibody-profiles while combining time- and dose-dependent data in the prediction model. Additionally, we developed the new f<i>E</i>ature di<i>S</i>tance ex<i>P</i>lainabilit<i>Y</i> (ESPY) method to quantify the impact of single antigens on the non-linear multitask SVM model and make it more interpretable. In conclusion, our multitask SVM model outperforms the studied standard approaches in regard of classification performance. Moreover, with our new explanation method ESPY, we were able to interpret the impact of Pf-specific antigen antibody responses that predict sterile protective immunity against CHMI after immunization. The identified Pf-specific antigens may contribute to a better understanding of immunity against human malaria and may foster vaccine development.

                <p>by Ellie Mainou, Ruy M. Ribeiro, Jessica M. Conway</p>

Understanding the dynamics of acute HIV infection can offer valuable insights into the early stages of viral behavior, potentially helping uncover various aspects of HIV pathogenesis. The standard viral dynamics model explains HIV viral dynamics during acute infection reasonably well. However, the model makes simplifying assumptions, neglecting some aspects of HIV infection. For instance, in the standard model, target cells are infected by a single HIV virion. Yet, cellular multiplicity of infection (MOI) may have considerable effects in pathogenesis and viral evolution. Further, when using the standard model, we take constant infected cell death rates, simplifying the dynamic immune responses. Here, we use four models—1) the standard viral dynamics model, 2) an alternate model incorporating cellular MOI, 3) a model assuming density-dependent death rate of infected cells and 4) a model combining (2) and (3)—to investigate acute infection dynamics in 43 people living with HIV very early after HIV exposure. We find that all models qualitatively describe the data, but none of the tested models is by itself the best to capture different kinds of heterogeneity. Instead, different models describe differing features of the dynamics more accurately. For example, while the standard viral dynamics model may be the most parsimonious across study participants by the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), we find that viral peaks are better explained by a model allowing for cellular MOI, using a linear regression analysis as analyzed by <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>. These results suggest that heterogeneity in within-host viral dynamics cannot be captured by a single model. Depending on the specific aspect of interest, a corresponding model should be employed.

                Introduction Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) have low survival rates in advanced stages. Anticancer drugs (ACDs) are usually recommended, but may be associated with important toxicity and lower quality of life (QoL). Best supportive care (BSC) could represent a valid alternative of treatment. We aim to synthesise evidence regarding the effects of ACDs versus BSC in patients with advanced BTCs. Methods We conducted a systematic review including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of ACD versus BSC, placebo or no active treatment. We searched in five databases. Two reviewers performed selection, risk of bias and data extraction processes. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. Results We included eight RCTs. Biological/targeted therapies may result in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (Mean difference (MD): 1.66 months higher; 95%CI, -0.65 to 3.96; low certainty) and toxicity (Relative risk (RR): 1.38; 95%CI, 0.99 to 1.93; low certainty), with uncertain effects on QoL. Evidence is very uncertain about the effects of chemotherapy on OS (MD: 3.28 months higher; 95%CI, 0.16 to 6.39; very low certainty), and may increase toxicity (RR: 1.33; 95%CI, 1.03 to 1.72; low certainty). We identified insufficient evidence for other prespecified outcomes. Conclusions Compared to BSC, ACDs have poor OS benefit and higher toxicity. Due to overall very low certainty of evidence, the effects of ACDs on critical outcomes are still unclear. Our findings should be used to better inform decision-making processes and future research.

                Abstract* Background The high prevalence of infant stunting and maternal undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries poses a significant public health threat. The World Health Organization recommends balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplementation to pregnant women from populations with a high prevalence of underweight (prepregnancy BMI <18.5 kg/m2), leaving a notable gap in guidance for lactating women. Therefore, we established the Maternal BEP Studies Harmonization Initiative (BEP Initiative) to investigate the impact of BEP supplementation given to pregnant and/or lactating women on maternal and infant outcomes by synthesizing data from multiple clinical trials. This is a study protocol for our prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis on BEP lactation trials. Methods Data from four randomized controlled trials that include mother-infant dyads in India (n=816), Pakistan (n=957), Burkina Faso (n=800), and Nepal (n=726) will be pooled and analysed. Women were randomized to BEP (one trial had a third arm with maternal BEP plus infants receiving azithromycin) or control groups at baseline (during the first week) and received the intervention through six months postpartum. A one-stage IPD meta-analysis will be done using mixed-effects linear and log-binomial regression models to account for between-trial heterogeneity. The primary outcome of infant length-for-age z scores (LAZ) and secondary outcomes of maternal and infant indicators of nutritional status, all at six months of age, will be examined. Also, we will assess baseline characteristics as covariates and effect modifiers for the BEP to outcome relationship. Discussion This prospective IPD meta-analysis uses a one-stage IPD meta-analysis, which allows for higher statistical power to examine outcomes, more flexibility in defining variables, and can examine effect modifiers, which could inform which individuals or populations may benefit more from BEP given during lactation.

                Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the foremost mortality internationally. Cardiac rehabilitation has proven as an effective program in reducing CVD burden. Participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs is very low. Digital health intervention emerged as an alternative method to deliver Cardiac rehabilitation. This review aimed to investigate the impact of digital health intervention on the outcomes of interest Methods the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Library have been searched to retrieve randomized controlled trials that examine the impact of digital health intervention on blood pressure, body mass index, lipid profile, blood glucose, Six-Minute Walk Test, and peak oxygen consumption. filters were set to include studies published in English between 2000-2023. Results Nineteen studies were included in this review. Six-Minute Walk Test (MD = 16.70; 95% CI: 6.00 to 27.39, p = 0.000) and maximal oxygen consumption (SMD = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.45, p = 0.004) significantly improved following digital health intervention, after employing the sensitivity analysis significant improvement was observed in systolic (MD = -2.54; 95% CI: -4.98 to -0.11, p = 0.04) and diastolic blood pressure (SMD = -2.0182; 95% CI: -3.9436 to -0.0928, p = 0.04) favoring experimental groups. Subgroup analysis revealed significant improvement in quality of life after three months of follow-up (SMD = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.31, p = 0.00), no significant differences have been observed in body mass index, lipid profile, and blood glucose. Conclusion The findings emphasize the significant impact of digital vs CBCR or usual care on physical capacity, blood pressure, and quality of life. Despite the non-statistically significant differences in body mass index and lipid profile, the comparable effect between the two methods suggests the superiority of digital over CBCR or usual care due to its convenient nature, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.

                Background Colon cancer is the third most common cancer type worldwide. Novel alternative therapeutic anti-cancer drugs against colon cancer with less toxicity are to be explored . This study was aimed to explore the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory activity of various fractions of Annona reticulata ethanolic leaf extract on human colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116) and to explore the potential molecular targets from the most potent plant extract fraction. Methods After obtaining ethical clearance from the institutional ethics committee, the extract and fractions were prepared and a preliminary analysis of the phytochemical was done qualitatively. Total phenolic and flavonoids were determined. Ethanolic leaf extract and its fractions were subjected to cytotoxicity analysis using the sulforhodamine B assay and the most promising fraction which showed the highest viability was selected to study anti-migratory activity. The anti-migratory effect was studied using a scratch wound healing assay. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was done to identify the major phytocompounds present in the fraction. The major five phytocompounds identified from the GC-MS were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. Result Among the four fractions, the petroleum ether fraction exhibited the highest anti-proliferative activity. The migration of colon cancer cells was significantly inhibited by the extract and petroleum ether fraction. The major phytocompounds identified from GC-MS were phytol (13.03%), 2,6-bis (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo (3.3.0) octane (11.95%), gamma.-sitosterol (10.45%), alpha.-tocopherol-beta.-D-mannoside (7.50%) and 3-amino-4-piperonyl-5-pyrazolone (5.84%). The bioinformatics analysis of these phytochemicals showed a high potential to affect the levels of key proteins driving colon cancer progression, inhibiting the enzymes and proteins overexpressed in cancer. Conclusion The outcome of this study endorses the potential of phytochemicals of the petroleum ether fraction of ethanolic leaf extract of Annona reticulata for the development of a new chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of colon cancer.

                Introduction Surgical removal of an impacted third molar is one of the most common oral surgical procedures performed in dental offices. The postoperative phase is often associated with severe inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually prescribed to manage postoperative discomfort. NSAIDs have been associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function disturbances, and platelet count reductions. Thus, the present study demonstrates the utility of aescin in managing postoperative discomfort after the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars. This study aimed to correlate and compare the impact of aescin and diclofenac on salivary PGE2 levels and serum C-reactive protein levels after surgical extraction of the mandibular third molar. The study will also evaluate and compare the effectiveness of individual drug therapy in managing postoperative pain, swelling and mouth opening. Methods The planned study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, prospective clinical trial. Each patient will be prescribed either diclofenac sodium 150 mg/day or aescin (escin) 120 mg/day to be taken orally in divided doses for five days after surgically removing the impacted mandibular third molar. Pain will be assessed using a visual analog scale. Facial swelling and mouth opening will be recorded using a metric scale with standardized reference points. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be employed to measure salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein levels. All parameters will be recorded preoperatively (T0) on the second postoperative day (T1) and fifth postoperative day (T2). Conclusion The proposed study is expected to show a clinically acceptable response to the administration of aescin for the management of postoperative discomfort compared to diclofenac sodium after third molar surgery. The proposed study is expected to positively manipulate the levels of salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein, which are reliable inflammatory markers. The outcome of this study may provide an efficacious and safe alternative to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for managing postoperative discomfort following third molar surgery.

                Background Excess nitrogen (N) loading to coastal ecosystems impairs estuarine water quality. Land management decisions made within estuarine watersheds have a direct impact on downstream N delivery. Natural features within watersheds can act as landscape sinks for N, such as wetlands, streams and ponds that transform dissolved N into gaseous N, effectively removing it from the aquatic system. Identifying and evaluating these landscape sinks and their spatial relationship to N sources can help managers understand the effects of alternative decisions on downstream resources. Methods The N-Sink approach uses widely available GIS data to identify landscape sinks within HUC-12 (or larger) catchments, estimate their N removal potential and map the effect of those sinks on N movement through the catchment. Static maps are produced to visualize N removal efficiency, transport and delivery, the latter in the form of an index. The R package nsink was developed to facilitate data acquisition, processing and visualization. Results The R package creates static maps for a specific HUC-12, or users can visit the University of Connecticut website to explore previously mapped areas. Users can also investigate specific flowpaths interactively by clicking on any location within the catchment. A flowpath is generated with a table describing N removal along each segment. We describe the motivation behind developing nsink, discuss implementation in R, and present two use case examples. nsink is available from https://github.com/USEPA/nsink. Conclusions N-Sink is a decision support tool created for local decision-makers to facilitate better understanding of the relationship between land use and downstream N delivery. Local decision-makers that have prioritized N mitigation in their long-term planning can use nsink to better understand the potential impact of proposed development projects and zoning variances. Similarly, land trusts and other NGOs interested in N mitigation can use nsink to identify high priority areas for acquisition or restoration.

<p>High-fat diets alter amygdala and hippocampus neurochemistry in juvenile male rats.

This highlights intricate connections between obesogenic diets, neurochemistry, and cognition, implying that metabolic dysfunctions can induce both detrimental and enhanced plasticity effects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Childhood obesity increases the risk of health and cognitive disorders in adulthood. Consuming high-fat diets (HFD) during critical neurodevelopmental periods, like childhood, impairs cognition and memory in humans and animals, affecting the function and connectivity of brain structures related to emotional memory. However, the underlying mechanisms of such phenomena need to be better understood. This study aimed to investigate the neurochemical profile of the amygdala and hippocampus, brain structures involved in emotional memory, during the acquisition of conditioned odor aversion in male rats that consumed a HFD from weaning to adulthood. The rats gained weight, experienced metabolic changes, and reduced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Rats showed enhanced odor aversion memory, contrary to the expected cognitive impairments. This memory enhancement was accompanied by increased noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala and hippocampus. Importantly, this upregulation was specific to stimuli exposure, as basal neurotransmitter levels remained unaltered by the HFD. Our results suggest that HFD modifies cognitive function by altering neurochemical signaling, in this case, upregulating neurotransmitter levels rendering a stronger memory trace, demonstrating that metabolic dysfunctions do not only trigger exclusively detrimental plasticity processes but also render enhanced plastic effects depending on the type of information.</p>

                Background Research on Mpox is essential to protect public health, develop effective interventions, and enhance global preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks. Owing to the scarcity of any specific treatment for Mpox disease, public health guidelines are important for patient care and management. Therefore, this systematic review suggests a public health policy guidelines to control Mpox diseases, especially in densely populated countries. Methods In this systematic review study, the databases and search engines PubMed, Scopus, BanglaJol, WHO, and Google Scholar were searched, and related literature was retrieved for further investigation. Articles describing monkeypox epidemiology, clinical symptoms, and preventive strategies, and published in English language were the core inclusion criteria; articles published in other languages were excluded. All records in the literature were managed through Mendeley (version 1.19.4) reference manager and summarized for further investigation. Results Mpox severity is prevalent in America and Europe. Male (96.3%) and young adults aged 18-44 years (mean: 34 years) were the most vulnerable population due to the virus. Among the patients, rash and fever were the most frequent symptoms, with cough, vomiting, anogenital pain and/or bleeding, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and genital edema being the least prevalent symptoms in less than 5% of the patients. As there is no specific treatment for the disease, infection control in densely populated countries require early detection, isolation of infected individuals, strict infection control measures, mass vaccination campaigns, education, public awareness campaigns, and continued investment in research. Conclusions This study underscores the urgent need for comprehensive infection control strategies, including early detection, strict isolation protocols, mass vaccination initiatives, and ongoing research investment given the absence of specific treatment options for the disease.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26952?af=R">Accelerated Aging after Traumatic Brain Injury: An ENIGMA Multi‐Cohort Mega‐Analysis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on brain structure remain uncertain. Given evidence that a single significant brain injury event increases the risk of dementia, brain-age estimation could provide a novel and efficient indexing of the long-term consequences of TBI. Brain-age procedures use predictive modeling to calculate brain-age scores for an individual using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI (cmsTBI) is associated with a higher predicted age difference (PAD), but the progression of PAD over time remains unclear. We sought to examine whether PAD increases as a function of time since injury (TSI) and if injury severity and sex interacted to influence this progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Through the ENIGMA Adult Moderate and Severe (AMS)-TBI working group, we examine the largest TBI sample to date (n = 343), along with controls, for a total sample size of n = 540, to replicate and extend prior findings in the study of TBI brain age. Cross-sectional T1w-MRI data were aggregated across 7 cohorts, and brain age was established using a similar brain age algorithm to prior work in TBI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Findings show that PAD widens with longer TSI, and there was evidence for differences between sexes in PAD, with men showing more advanced brain age. We did not find strong evidence supporting a link between PAD and cognitive performance.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work provides evidence that changes in brain structure after cmsTBI are dynamic, with an initial period of change, followed by relative stability in brain morphometry, eventually leading to further changes in the decades after a single cmsTBI. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Trained immunity initially describes the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. Here, Yang et al. reveal the mechanism of trained immunity in zebrafish hepatocytes. They uncover that β-glucan training induces DrDectin-1-gated H3K4me3 modification of mitophagy-related genes, inhibiting pyroptosis to protect the host from septic liver injury in vivo.

They show that this synergistic effect can salvage more escaped antibodies when certain prerequisites for the narrower antigen-binding site span, such as scDbs, and the correct antibody combinations are met.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93908">Targeted protein degradation systems to enhance Wnt signaling</a></h4>

              
                Molecules that facilitate targeted protein degradation (TPD) offer great promise as novel therapeutics. The human hepatic lectin asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) is selectively expressed on hepatocytes. We have previously engineered an anti-ASGR1 antibody-mutant RSPO2 (RSPO2RA) fusion protein (called SWEETS) to drive tissue-specific degradation of ZNRF3/RNF43 E3 ubiquitin ligases, which achieved hepatocyte-specific enhanced Wnt signaling, proliferation, and restored liver function in mouse models, and an antibody–RSPO2RA fusion molecule is currently in human clinical trials. In the current study, we identified two new ASGR1- and ASGR1/2-specific antibodies, 8M24 and 8G8. High-resolution crystal structures of ASGR1:8M24 and ASGR2:8G8 complexes revealed that these antibodies bind to distinct epitopes on opposing sides of ASGR, away from the substrate-binding site. Both antibodies enhanced Wnt activity when assembled as SWEETS molecules with RSPO2RA through specific effects sequestering E3 ligases. In addition, 8M24-RSPO2RA and 8G8-RSPO2RA efficiently downregulate ASGR1 through TPD mechanisms. These results demonstrate the possibility of combining different therapeutic effects and degradation mechanisms in a single molecule.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90948">Enhancing CRISPR prime editing by reducing misfolded pegRNA interactions</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR prime editing (<b>PE</b>) requires a Cas9 nickase-reverse transcriptase fusion protein (known as PE2) and a prime editing guide RNA (<b>pegRNA</b>), an extended version of a standard guide RNA (<b>gRNA</b>) that both specifies the intended target genomic sequence and encodes the desired genetic edit. Here, we show that sequence complementarity between the 5’ and the 3’ regions of a pegRNA can negatively impact its ability to complex with Cas9, thereby potentially reducing PE efficiency. We demonstrate this limitation can be overcome by a simple pegRNA refolding procedure, which improved ribonucleoprotein-mediated PE efficiencies in zebrafish embryos by up to nearly 25-fold. Further gains in PE efficiencies of as much as sixfold could also be achieved by introducing point mutations designed to disrupt internal interactions within the pegRNA. Our work defines simple strategies that can be implemented to improve the efficiency of PE.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97035">Post-meiotic mechanism of facultative parthenogenesis in gonochoristic whiptail lizard species</a></h4>

              
                Facultative parthenogenesis (FP) has historically been regarded as rare in vertebrates, but in recent years incidences have been reported in a growing list of fish, reptile, and bird species. Despite the increasing interest in the phenomenon, the underlying mechanism and evolutionary implications have remained unclear. A common finding across many incidences of FP is either a high degree of homozygosity at microsatellite loci or low levels of heterozygosity detected in next-generation sequencing data. This has led to the proposal that second polar body fusion following the meiotic divisions restores diploidy and thereby mimics fertilization. Here, we show that FP occurring in the gonochoristic <i>Aspidoscelis</i> species <i>A. marmoratus</i> and <i>A. arizonae</i> results in genome-wide homozygosity, an observation inconsistent with polar body fusion as the underlying mechanism of restoration. Instead, a high-quality reference genome for <i>A. marmoratus</i> and analysis of whole-genome sequencing from multiple FP and control animals reveals that a post-meiotic mechanism gives rise to homozygous animals from haploid, unfertilized oocytes. Contrary to the widely held belief that females need to be isolated from males to undergo FP, females housed with conspecific and heterospecific males produced unfertilized eggs that underwent spontaneous development. In addition, offspring arising from both fertilized eggs and parthenogenetic development were observed to arise from a single clutch. Strikingly, our data support a mechanism for facultative parthenogenesis that removes all heterozygosity in a single generation. Complete homozygosity exposes the genetic load and explains the high rate of congenital malformations and embryonic mortality associated with FP in many species. Conversely, for animals that develop normally, FP could potentially exert strong purifying selection as all lethal recessive alleles are purged in a single generation.

	<p>Porcine Liver Decomposition Product (PLDP) was obtained by treating pig liver homogenate with protease and filling it into capsules. We have already confirmed from three clinical trials that PLDP enhances visual memory and delays memory recall, and we believe that its activity is due to various phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC). In this study, we clinically evaluated PLDP for depressive symptoms caused by a decline in cognitive function. This clinical trial was conducted using the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R). The HDS-R (maximum score is 30 points) is a test similar to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is commonly used in Japan. Dementia is suspected if the score falls below 20 on the HDS-R. Additionally, in a previous clinical trial, there was no change in scores in the placebo group after three doses of the HDS-R. In order to clearly confirm the effectiveness of PLDP, this study was conducted under stricter conditions (HDS-R points of 15 to 23) than previous clinical trials (all participants had scores of 20 or higher). Therefore, from ethical considerations, a clinical trial was conducted using the scores before PLDP administration as a control. In this study, PLDP was administered orally at 4 capsules per day, and the HDS-R was confirmed 2 and 4 weeks after administration. A significant increase in HDS-R scores was observed at 2 and 4 weeks after PLDP administration. Additionally, regarding each item of the HDS-R, PLDP significantly increased 2 and 4 weeks after oral administration for the question items assessing delayed recall, and the question item assessing verbal fluency tasks was recognized. From the above results, we confirmed the reproducibility of the effect of PLDP in improving the delayed recall of verbal memories. Furthermore, increasing scores on verbal fluency tasks suggest that PLDP may enhance frontal lobe function and prevent or improve depressive symptoms. The effects observed in this study may differ from the mechanisms of action of existing antidepressants, and we believe that this may lead to the discovery of new antidepressants.</p>

                Background With rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population explosion in sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda, the population has experienced increased exposure to environmental lead subsequently causing elevated blood lead levels. Mean blood levels of 332µg/dL,120µg/dʟ, 25µg/dL,11µg/dL, and 10µg/dL in children under 18 years of age in Nigeria, DR Congo, South Africa, Sudan, and Uganda respectively. Susceptibility to lead toxicity correlates with one’s nutrition status, age, and genetics. This study expounded susceptibility to lead toxicity by relating blood lead levels, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity, and genetic variations of proteins that code for ALAD in urban children of Uganda aged between 6 and 60 months. Methods A total of 198 blood samples were analyzed for blood lead levels (BLL), on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer whereas hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and ALAD enzyme activity, were analyzed on a spectrophotometer before DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length digestion for ALAD polymorphism. Results Geometric means of BLL (10.55µg/dL, SD = 7.4), Hb (7.85g/dL, SD = 1.3) and ALAD enzyme activity (37.15 units/L BLL, S.D = 9.7), corresponded to samples that coded for ALAD1 allele (99.05%) compared to the 0.05% that coded for ALAD2 with BLL (14.5µg/ dL, SD = 4.7), Hb (6.1 g/ dL), ALAD enzyme activity (33.8 units/L, SD=1.45). There was a significant relationship with a negative linear correlation between BLL, Hb (status, and ALAD enzyme activity in the three isozymes (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2, and ALAD2-2) in the strength of ALAD1-1 (r = 0.42, p-value = 0.02) ˂ ALAD1-2 (r = 0.62, effective size = 0.43, p-value = ˂ 0.001) ˂ ALAD2-2 (r = 0.67, effective size = 0.86, p-value = ˂ 0.001). Conclusions Most of the study participants coded for the ALAD1 allele hence hoarded blood lead, which could result in delayed exposure and adverse effects later in their lives.

                Objective To determine gender gaps in Emeritus researchers in Colombia. Methods Oaxaca-Blinder-Kitakagwa decomposition model, correcting the sample selection bias with the inclusion of Mills’ inverse ratio (Heckman’s Lambda) through an ordered probit model. Data: Information available in the ScienTI Platform – Colombia during the period 2015-2021. Results The results show that the gender gap between female and male researchers is 5.8%. To achieve Emeritus status, one must be over 65 years old, and the possibility of achieving Emeritus status is 5.1% higher for female researchers than for their male counterparts. These differences can be explained by the time constraints that female researchers face in being productive, as they spend more time than male researchers on caregiving responsibilities, either due to motherhood or the care of other dependent family members. Conclusions The results obtained allow us to affirm that there is a gender gap in scientific research in Colombia in the Emeritus research category in the calls for proposals for the period 2015-2021. Moreover, the existing gap cannot be explained by factors associated with attributes of education and academic productivity that are part of the regulatory requirements, insofar as not being explained by them, it evidences the existence of discrimination against women researchers to access the highest research category.

                Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease that affects premature infants and is characterized by disrupted alveolar and vascular development. Pulmonary complications significantly affect morbidity and mortality rates in neonates with BPD. Aim This systematic review aimed to outline a protocol for investigating the effects of pulmonary complications in neonates diagnosed with BPD. Methods A comprehensive search strategy will be implemented across electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Eligible studies will include primary research articles reporting pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, respiratory infections, ventilator-associated events, and airway abnormalities among neonates diagnosed with BPD. Two independent reviewers screened the titles, abstracts, and full text of the identified articles for eligibility. Data extraction will be conducted using a predefined form, including study characteristics, participant demographics, types of pulmonary complications, and relevant outcomes. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed using appropriate tools, such as the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials. Outcome measures The primary outcomes of interest will include the prevalence and incidence of pulmonary complications among neonates diagnosed with BPD. Secondary outcomes will encompass the impact of pulmonary complications on clinical outcomes, such as respiratory morbidity, mortality rates, length of hospital stay, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Narrative synthesis will be employed to summarize the findings of the included studies, and where applicable, a meta-analysis will be conducted to quantify the effects of pulmonary complications on neonatal outcomes. Discussion This systematic review protocol outlines a rigorous methodology for investigating the effects of pulmonary complications in neonates with BPD. The findings of this review will provide valuable insights into the burden of pulmonary complications in this vulnerable population, and inform clinical practice and future research endeavors aimed at improving the care and management of neonates with BPD.

                <p>by Seolah Shin, Seok Joo Chae, Seunggyu Lee, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

The Michaelis–Menten (MM) rate law has been a fundamental tool in describing enzyme-catalyzed reactions for over a century. When substrates and enzymes are homogeneously distributed, the validity of the MM rate law can be easily assessed based on relative concentrations: the substrate is in large excess over the enzyme-substrate complex. However, the applicability of this conventional criterion remains unclear when species exhibit spatial heterogeneity, a prevailing scenario in biological systems. Here, we explore the MM rate law’s applicability under spatial heterogeneity by using partial differential equations. In this study, molecules diffuse very slowly, allowing them to locally reach quasi-steady states at each time point. We find that the conventional criterion for the validity of the MM rate law cannot be readily extended to heterogeneous environments solely through spatial averages of molecular concentrations. That is, even when the conventional criterion for the spatial averages is satisfied, the MM rate law fails to capture the enzyme catalytic rate under spatial heterogeneity. In contrast, a slightly modified form of the MM rate law, based on the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA), is accurate. Specifically, the tQSSA-based modified form, but not the original MM rate law, accurately predicts the drug clearance via cytochrome P450 enzymes and the ultrasensitive phosphorylation in heterogeneous environments. Our findings shed light on how to simplify spatiotemporal models for enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the right context, ensuring accurate conclusions and avoiding misinterpretations in <i>in silico</i> simulations.

                <p>by Roberto Efraín Díaz, Stephanie A. Wankowicz</p>

Despite advances and social progress, the exclusion of diverse groups in academia, especially science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, across the US and Europe persists, resulting in the underrepresentation of diverse people in higher education. There is extensive literature about theory, observation, and evidence-based practices that can help create a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse learning environment. In this article, we propose the implementation of a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) journal club as a strategic initiative to foster education and promote action towards making academia a more equitable institution. By creating a space for people to engage with DEIJ theories* and strategize ways to improve their learning environment, we hope to normalize the practice and importance of analyzing academia through an equity lens. Guided by restorative justice principles, we offer 10 recommendations for fostering community cohesion through education and mutual understanding. This approach underscores the importance of appropriate action and self-education in the journey toward a more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and just academic environment.
*Authors’ note: We understand that “DEIJ” is a multidisciplinary organizational framework that relies on numerous fields of study, including history, sociology, philosophy, and more. We use this term to refer to these different fields of study for brevity purposes.

                <p>by Pavel Sanda, Jaroslav Hlinka, Monica van den Berg, Antonin Skoch, Maxim Bazhenov, Georgios A. Keliris, Giri P. Krishnan</p>

Brain activity during the resting state is widely used to examine brain organization, cognition and alterations in disease states. While it is known that neuromodulation and the state of alertness impact resting-state activity, neural mechanisms behind such modulation of resting-state activity are unknown. In this work, we used a computational model to demonstrate that change in excitability and recurrent connections, due to cholinergic modulation, impacts resting-state activity. The results of such modulation in the model match closely with experimental work on direct cholinergic modulation of Default Mode Network (DMN) in rodents. We further extended our study to the human connectome derived from diffusion-weighted MRI. In human resting-state simulations, an increase in cholinergic input resulted in a brain-wide reduction of functional connectivity. Furthermore, selective cholinergic modulation of DMN closely captured experimentally observed transitions between the baseline resting state and states with suppressed DMN fluctuations associated with attention to external tasks. Our study thus provides insight into potential neural mechanisms for the effects of cholinergic neuromodulation on resting-state activity and its dynamics.

                <p>by Joshua M. Mitchell, Yuanye Chi, Maheshwor Thapa, Zhiqiang Pang, Jianguo Xia, Shuzhao Li</p>

To standardize metabolomics data analysis and facilitate future computational developments, it is essential to have a set of well-defined templates for common data structures. Here we describe a collection of data structures involved in metabolomics data processing and illustrate how they are utilized in a full-featured Python-centric pipeline. We demonstrate the performance of the pipeline, and the details in annotation and quality control using large-scale LC-MS metabolomics and lipidomics data and LC-MS/MS data. Multiple previously published datasets are also reanalyzed to showcase its utility in biological data analysis. This pipeline allows users to streamline data processing, quality control, annotation, and standardization in an efficient and transparent manner. This work fills a major gap in the Python ecosystem for computational metabolomics.

                <p>by Marco A. Coelho, Márcia David-Palma, Terrance Shea, Katharine Bowers, Sage McGinley-Smith, Arman W. Mohammad, Andreas Gnirke, Andrey M. Yurkov, Minou Nowrousian, Sheng Sun, Christina A. Cuomo, Joseph Heitman</p>

In exploring the evolutionary trajectories of both pathogenesis and karyotype dynamics in fungi, we conducted a large-scale comparative genomic analysis spanning the <i>Cryptococcus</i> genus, encompassing both global human fungal pathogens and nonpathogenic species, and related species from the sister genus <i>Kwoniella</i>. Chromosome-level genome assemblies were generated for multiple species, covering virtually all known diversity within these genera. Although <i>Cryptococcus</i> and <i>Kwoniella</i> have comparable genome sizes (about 19.2 and 22.9 Mb) and similar gene content, hinting at preadaptive pathogenic potential, our analysis found evidence of gene gain (via horizontal gene transfer) and gene loss in pathogenic <i>Cryptococcus</i> species, which might represent evolutionary signatures of pathogenic development. Genome analysis also revealed a significant variation in chromosome number and structure between the 2 genera. By combining synteny analysis and experimental centromere validation, we found that most <i>Cryptococcus</i> species have 14 chromosomes, whereas most <i>Kwoniella</i> species have fewer (11, 8, 5, or even as few as 3). Reduced chromosome number in <i>Kwoniella</i> is associated with formation of giant chromosomes (up to 18 Mb) through repeated chromosome fusion events, each marked by a pericentric inversion and centromere loss. While similar chromosome inversion–fusion patterns were observed in all <i>Kwoniella</i> species with fewer than 14 chromosomes, no such pattern was detected in <i>Cryptococcus</i>. Instead, <i>Cryptococcus</i> species with less than 14 chromosomes showed reductions primarily through rearrangements associated with the loss of repeat-rich centromeres. Additionally, <i>Cryptococcus</i> genomes exhibited frequent interchromosomal translocations, including intercentromeric recombination facilitated by transposons shared between centromeres. Overall, our findings advance our understanding of genetic changes possibly associated with pathogenicity in <i>Cryptococcus</i> and provide a foundation to elucidate mechanisms of centromere loss and chromosome fusion driving distinct karyotypes in closely related fungal species, including prominent global human pathogens.

                <p>by Edwin S. Dalmaijer</p>

Homing pigeons (<i>Columba livia</i>) navigate by solar and magnetic compass, and fly home in idiosyncratic but stable routes when repeatedly released from the same location. However, when experienced pigeons fly alongside naive counterparts, their path is altered. Over several generations of turnover (pairs in which the most experienced individual is replaced with a naive one), pigeons show cumulative improvements in efficiency. Here, I show that such cumulative route improvements can occur in a much simpler system by using agent-based simulation. Artificial agents are in silico entities that navigate with a minimal cognitive architecture of goal-direction (they know roughly where the goal is), social proximity (they seek proximity to others and align headings), route memory (they recall landmarks with increasing precision), and continuity (they avoid erratic turns). Agents’ behaviour qualitatively matched that of pigeons, and quantitatively fitted to pigeon data. My results indicate that naive agents benefitted from being paired with experienced agents by following their previously established route. Importantly, experienced agents also benefitted from being paired with naive agents due to regression to the goal: naive agents were more likely to err towards the goal from the perspective of experienced agents’ memorised paths. This subtly biased pairs in the goal direction, resulting in intergenerational improvements of route efficiency. No cumulative improvements were evident in control studies in which agents’ goal-direction, social proximity, or memory were lesioned. These 3 factors are thus necessary and sufficient for cumulative route improvements to emerge, even in the absence of sophisticated communication or thought.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002501">Collective movement of schooling fish reduces the costs of locomotion in turbulent conditions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yangfan Zhang, Hungtang Ko, Michael A. Calicchia, Rui Ni, George V. Lauder</p>

The ecological and evolutionary benefits of energy-saving in collective behaviors are rooted in the physical principles and physiological mechanisms underpinning animal locomotion. We propose a turbulence sheltering hypothesis that collective movements of fish schools in turbulent flow can reduce the total energetic cost of locomotion by shielding individuals from the perturbation of chaotic turbulent eddies. We test this hypothesis by quantifying energetics and kinematics in schools of giant danio (<i>Devario aequipinnatus</i>) and compared that to solitary individuals swimming under laminar and turbulent conditions over a wide speed range. We discovered that, when swimming at high speeds and high turbulence levels, fish schools reduced their total energy expenditure (TEE, both aerobic and anaerobic energy) by 63% to 79% compared to solitary fish (e.g., 228 versus 48 kj kg<sup>−1</sup>). Solitary individuals spend approximately 22% more kinematic effort (tail beat amplitude•frequency: 1.7 versus 1.4 BL s<sup>−1</sup>) to swim in turbulence at higher speeds than in laminar conditions. Fish schools swimming in turbulence reduced their three-dimensional group volume by 41% to 68% (at higher speeds, approximately 103 versus 33 cm<sup>3</sup>) and did not alter their kinematic effort compared to laminar conditions. This substantial energy saving highlights that schooling behaviors can mitigate turbulent disturbances by sheltering fish (within schools) from the eddies of sufficient kinetic energy that can disrupt locomotor gaits. Therefore, providing a more desirable internal hydrodynamic environment could be one of the ecological drivers underlying collective behaviors in a dense fluid environment.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Suis hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

                Foreign bodies are objects that do not typically belong in the human body but can be ingested, inserted, or entered due to injuries. This article presents various cases and examples of foreign bodies, including objects swallowed, objects inserted into the rectum, vagina, urethra, ear, and nose, or due to injuries caused by falls, puncture wounds, and gunshot wounds. Foreign bodies can be difficult to detect, particularly if they are not inherently radio-opaque, and may be overlooked by patients who cannot provide an adequate history. These foreign bodies may cause harm to the patient. Interpretation is done on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), Ultrasonography (USG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Most foreign objects pass through the gastrointestinal tract without problem; sharp and elongated objects can cause significant injury, and even if they only partially perforate the bowel wall, they can produce chronic inflammatory processes that produce symptoms months or years later. Hence, searching for foreign bodies should be done throughout the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in children and people with mental illness who are more likely to swallow multiple items more than once. Although rare, various materials can be left behind in the body of a patient after surgery, including large and small wire sutures, surgical drains, and retained sponges, which can cause potential complications and foreign body reactions. This article highlights the importance of being aware of the presence of foreign bodies in clinical practice, and a thorough search should be carried out using different modalities, especially CT. Great suspicion and early diagnosis of foreign bodies can avoid potential complications and morbidity. In general, it provides information on the diagnosis and treatment of various types of foreign bodies.

                Background Certain conditions can stimulate stem cells to produce secretory factors that differ from each condition, such as hypoxia. Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells have been known to have higher proliferation rates, plasticity, and better self-improvement ability than MSCs from other sources. The objective was to analyze the secreting proteins in the Conditioned Medium - Umbilical cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (CM-UCMSCs) which potentially has a role in the chondrogenesis of cartilage defect. Methods We used SDS PAGE combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using mass spectrometer to perform a proteomic analysis of CM-UCMSCs which conditioned in a state of fasting (without serum albumin). Then, we continue to analyze to identify proteins of interest using Mascot sequence matching software. Then Analyzed using in silico / molecular docking to know the interaction of each protein with the cartilage repair factor. Results SDS PAGE performed on all secreted products in CM-UCMSCs. We found one dominant band, then we used Mass Spectrometry continued Mascot sequencing protein that band, conclude that the protein was a D4A9T1/ RNF-111/ Arkadia Protein. And then using in silico/ molecular docking method analyzed that Arkadia Protein worked synergistically with TGF-β1 Protein through activation of TGF-β1 receptors to induce the chondrogenesis. Conclusions Our results show that the fasting state on CM-UCMSCs promoted secreted Arkadia protein. From in silico model prediction, this protein suspects to have an important role in the process of repairing cartilage defects. However, further research is needed before feasible and safe for the clinical application of CM-UCMSCs in cartilage repair.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the in-vitro Tigecycline susceptibility of various pathogens from clinical samples received at the tertiary care hospitals in South India. Methods The analysis of specimens from patients admitted were carried out in this prospective cross sectional study. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by semi-automated Vitek 2 systems and Kirby Bauer method. Pattern of data analysis was done by descriptive statistics. Results Among 2574 isolates, 812 isolates were Gram positive pathogens and 1762 isolates were Gram negative pathogens. Resistance to Tigecycline was more common among Gram negative pathogens (18.62%) in comparison to the Gram positive pathogens (0.49%). Among 740 Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamases (ESBL) producers such as Klebsiella species & E coli, 629 isolates were susceptible, and 93 isolates were resistant to the tigecycline. All the methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. Conclusion Multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens like Acinetobacter species, and Klebsiella species were found to be highly effective in vitro to tigecycline for elimination of infections caused by both Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens. The use of combination therapy becomes crucial to prevent the development of Pan Drug resistance.

                Background This study investigates various surface treatment methods to assess shear bond strength between set Cention N (alkasite-based restorative material) and new alkasite based restorative material. Assessing different surface treatments provide insights in optimizing repair procedure that enables durability of the restoration, thus potentially benefitting clinical outcomes. Methods A total of 48 alkasite based restorative material blocks, measuring 4 mm in depth and 4 mm in diameter, were prepared. The samples were randomly divided into 8 groups (n = 6) according to the surface treatment done. Group I: Surface preparation by bur; Group II: Surface treatment by laser; Group III: Application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive (Adper Single Bond 2 adhesive),Group IV: Application of single step self-etch adhesive (Scotchbond Universal adhesive); Group V: Bur preparation followed by application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive; Group VI: Bur preparation followed by application of single step self-etch adhesive; Group VII: Laser preparation followed by application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive; and Group VIII: Laser preparation followed by application of single step self-etch adhesive. Post-surface preparation, all the specimens were restored with newly mixed alkasite material. Repair bond strength measurements were assessed with universal testing machine. Shapiro-Wilk and Levene's tests were used to check normality and Homogeneity of variance. ANOVA with post-hoc Games-Howell test and two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test was performed to evaluate the influence of surface preparation on the repair bond strength. Results Using a 2-step etch and rinse adhesive resulted in a higher repair bond strength (26.05±2.12) compared to other surface treatments. In contrast, roughening of the surface with burs led to lowest repair bond strength (17.06±3.29) (P=0.02). Conclusion Application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive to the existing alkasite based restorative material provides superior bonding with the newly added alkasite based restorative material.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The current study investigates the intricate connection between neurology and islands shedding light on the historical, epidemiological, and genetic aspects. Based on an elaborate literature review, we identified neurological conditions having a significant clustering in an island(s), confined to a particular island(s), named after an island, and described first in an island. The genetic factors played a crucial role, uncovering disorders like Cayman ataxia, Machado Joseph disease, SGCE-mediated dystonia-myoclonus syndrome, X-linked dystonia parkinsonism, hereditary transthyretinrelated amyloidosis, Charcot Marie Tooth 4F, and progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndromes, that exhibited remarkable clustering in diverse islands. Local customs also left enduring imprints. Practices such as cannibalism in Papua New Guinea led to Kuru, while cycad seed consumption in Guam triggered Lytico-Bodig disease. Toxin-mediated neurologic disorders exhibited intricate island connections, exemplified by Minamata disease in Kyushu islands and atypical parkinsonism in French Caribbean islands. Additionally, the Cuban epidemic of amblyopia and neuropathy was associated with severe nutritional deficiencies. This study pioneers a comprehensive review narrating the genetic, environmental, and cultural factors highlighting the spectrum of neurological disorders in island settings. It enriches the medical literature with a unique understanding of the diverse influences shaping neurological health in island environments.

                Branchial cleft cysts are frequently encountered congenital anomalies, arising from the first to fourth pharyngeal clefts and second branchial cleft anomalies are the most common. These anomalies, even though present from birth, become symptomatic only later in life. Majority of them are benign in nature. However, these cysts can get secondarily infected or can harbour secondary metastases and sometimes even primary malignancy in very rare cases. Here we discuss a case of a middle-aged female presenting with a gradually increasing branchial cleft cyst with incidental thyroid lesion on ultrasonography, later proven to be papillary thyroid carcinoma with metastatic spread to the brachial cleft cyst.

                Abstract* Attribution rules act as a tool to modify the terms of a contract by accepting pre-specified terms and conditions. This methodology ensures that the contractual relationship is protected while addressing potentially complex scenarios that may arise during contract execution due to evolving circumstances. To maintain the binding force of the contract, Parties expedite dispute resolution and protect the integrity of their contracts by choosing recourse and prior agreeing to remedies, which encourages continuity in enforcement. These clauses are intended to automatically amend the terms of the contract without requiring the parties to participate in the amendment process. These items adjust the amount of funds subject to the obligation according to changes observed by external indicators associated with the obligation. This is done by comparing the price of a particular currency with the price of a different commodity. In the case of payment in gold or foreign currency, it represents an assault on the binding legal force of the national currency by competing with it as a means of payment and considering it as one of them. Terms of payment in gold and foreign currency are excluded from the attribution requirement, which replaces legal means of payment with new means of payment. It does not constitute a basis for determining the extent of fulfillment of the obligation, and we conclude that the attribution clause is a distinct legal system that deals with amending contractual terms and the contractual imbalance they cause. Amendment is permitted in the event of circumstances occurring that would upset the balance throughout the contract implementation period, and we recommend adopting the attribution clause as an automatic adjustment tool.

                CYP2A6 enzyme is an enzyme that is responsible for the metabolism of nicotine into cotinine. Meanwhile, glutathione is a tripeptide -L-glutamyl-L-cysteineyl-glycine, which has high concentrations in the liver. This literature review study aims to determine the effect of giving foods rich in CYP2A6 enzymes and glutathione to reduce nicotine levels in the body of smokers. The inclusion criteria used were the year of publication of articles from the last 5 years, discussing the effect of food doses with CYP2A6 enzymes and glutathione on reducing nicotine levels, experimental research methods, and full-text journals that can be accessed free of charge. The data source comes from Pubmed and Writing a Literature Review began in May to June 2022. Based on the results of 4 literature review articles, it was found that there was an effect of feeding with CYP2A6 enzymes and glutathione on reducing nicotine levels in smokers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91572">Scaling between cell cycle duration and wing growth is regulated by Fat-Dachsous signaling in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                The atypical cadherins Fat and Dachsous (Ds) signal through the Hippo pathway to regulate growth of numerous organs, including the <i>Drosophila</i> wing. Here, we find that Ds-Fat signaling tunes a unique feature of cell proliferation found to control the rate of wing growth during the third instar larval phase. The duration of the cell cycle increases in direct proportion to the size of the wing, leading to linear-like growth during the third instar. Ds-Fat signaling enhances the rate at which the cell cycle lengthens with wing size, thus diminishing the rate of wing growth. We show that this results in a complex but stereotyped relative scaling of wing growth with body growth in <i>Drosophila</i>. Finally, we examine the dynamics of Fat and Ds protein distribution in the wing, observing graded distributions that change during growth. However, the significance of these dynamics is unclear since perturbations in expression have negligible impact on wing growth.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92620">Rule-based modulation of a sensorimotor transformation across cortical areas</a></h4>

              
                Flexible responses to sensory stimuli based on changing rules are critical for adapting to a dynamic environment. However, it remains unclear how the brain encodes and uses rule information to guide behavior. Here, we made single-unit recordings while head-fixed mice performed a cross-modal sensory selection task where they switched between two rules: licking in response to tactile stimuli while rejecting visual stimuli, or vice versa. Along a cortical sensorimotor processing stream including the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory areas, and the medial (MM) and anterolateral (ALM) motor areas, single-neuron activity distinguished between the two rules both prior to and in response to the tactile stimulus. We hypothesized that neural populations in these areas would show rule-dependent preparatory states, which would shape the subsequent sensory processing and behavior. This hypothesis was supported for the motor cortical areas (MM and ALM) by findings that (1) the current task rule could be decoded from pre-stimulus population activity; (2) neural subspaces containing the population activity differed between the two rules; and (3) optogenetic disruption of pre-stimulus states impaired task performance. Our findings indicate that flexible action selection in response to sensory input can occur via configuration of preparatory states in the motor cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73592">Endothelial cell signature in muscle stem cells validated by VEGFA-FLT1-AKT1 axis promoting survival of muscle stem cell</a></h4>

              
                Endothelial and skeletal muscle lineages arise from common embryonic progenitors. Despite their shared developmental origin, adult endothelial cells (ECs) and muscle stem cells (MuSCs) (satellite cells) have been thought to possess distinct gene signatures and signaling pathways. Here we shift this paradigm by uncovering how adult MuSC behavior is affected by the expression of a subset of EC transcripts. We used several computational analyses including single-cell RNAseq to show that MuSCs express low levels of canonical EC markers in mice. We demonstrate that MuSC survival is regulated by one such prototypic endothelial signaling pathway (VEGFA-FLT1). Using pharmacological and genetic gain- and loss-of-function studies, we identify the FLT1-AKT1 axis as the key effector underlying VEGFA-mediated regulation of MuSC survival. All together, our data support that the VEGFA-FLT1-AKT1 pathway promotes MuSC survival during muscle regeneration, and highlights how the minor expression of select transcripts is sufficient for affecting cell behavior.

	<p>The present study explored whether, given the association of temporal alpha with fear circuitry (learning and conditioning), exposure to complex childhood trauma (CCT) is reflected in the temporal&amp;amp;ndash;posterior alpha power in resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) in complex trauma-exposed adolescents in a sample of 25 adolescents and similar controls aged 12&amp;amp;ndash;17 years. Both trauma and psychopathology were screened or assessed, and resting-state EEG was recorded following a preregistered protocol for data collection. Temporal&amp;amp;ndash;posterior alpha power, corresponding to the T5 and T6 electrode locations (international 10&amp;amp;ndash;20 system), was extracted from resting-state EEG in both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. We found that in the eyes-open condition, temporal&amp;amp;ndash;posterior alpha was significantly lower in adolescents exposed to CCT relative to healthy controls, suggesting that childhood trauma exposure may have a measurable impact on alpha oscillatory patterns. Our study highlights the importance of considering potential neural markers, such as temporal&amp;amp;ndash;posterior alpha power, to understanding the long-term consequences of CCT exposure in developmental samples, with possible important clinical implications in guiding neuroregulation interventions.</p>

	<p>Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is related to mental and somatic disorders that result in alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), with 30% of AWS cases leading to life-threatening delirium tremens (DTs). Currently, studies do not support using any one biomarker in DTs. Neurotrophins affect neuromodulation, playing a role in the pathogenesis of AUD, AWS, and DTs. Methods: This review aims to summarize experimental and clinical data related to neurotrophins and S100B in neuroplasticity, as well as neurodegeneration in the context of AUD, AWS, and DTs. This work used publications that were selected based on the protocol consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Results: The BDNF level could be a good candidate biomarker for relapse susceptibility, as it is significantly reduced during consumption and gradually increases during abstinence. GDNF influences AUD through its integral role in the function of dopaminergic neurons and ablates the return to alcohol-drinking behavior. NGF protects neurons from ethanol-induced cytotoxic damage and affects recovery from cognitive deficits after brain damage. The NT-3 level is decreased after alcohol exposure and is involved in compensatory mechanisms for cognitive decline in AUD. NT-4 affects oxidative stress, which is associated with chronic alcohol consumption. S100B is used as a biomarker of brain damage, with elevated levels in serum in AUD, and can protect 5-HT neurons from the damage caused by alcohol. Conclusions: BDNF, GDNF, NT-3, NT-4, NGF, and S100B may be valuable markers for withdrawal syndrome. In particular, the most relevant is their association with the development of delirium complications. However, there are few data concerning some neurotrophins in AWS and DTs, suggesting the need for further research.</p>

                <p>Drugs of abuse cause changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and associated regions that impair inhibitory control over drug-seeking. Breaking the contingencies between drug-associated cues and the delivery of the reward during extinction learning reduces relapse. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has previously been shown to enhance extinction learning and reduce drug-seeking. Here we determined the effects of VNS-mediated release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on extinction and cue-induced reinstatement in male rats trained to self-administer cocaine. Pairing 10&nbsp;d of extinction training with VNS facilitated extinction and reduced drug-seeking behavior during reinstatement. Rats that received a single extinction session with VNS showed elevated BDNF levels in the medial PFC as determined via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Systemic blockade of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors during extinction, via the TrkB antagonist ANA-12, decreased the effects of VNS on extinction and reinstatement. Whole-cell recordings in brain slices showed that cocaine self-administration induced alterations in the ratio of AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated currents in Layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the infralimbic cortex (IL). Pairing extinction with VNS reversed cocaine-induced changes in glutamatergic transmission by enhancing AMPAR currents, and this effect was blocked by ANA-12. Our study suggests that VNS consolidates the extinction of drug-seeking behavior by reversing drug-induced changes in synaptic AMPA receptors in the IL, and this effect is abolished by blocking TrkB receptors during extinction, highlighting a potential mechanism for the therapeutic effects of VNS in addiction.</p>

                <p>Interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulate local neural activity to influence cognitive, motivated, and emotional behaviors. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons are the primary mediators of thalamus-evoked feed-forward inhibition across the mouse cortex, including the anterior cingulate cortex, where they are engaged by inputs from the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus. In contrast, in the adjacent prelimbic (PL) cortex, we find that PV+ interneurons are scarce in the principal thalamorecipient layer 3 (L3), suggesting distinct mechanisms of inhibition. To identify the interneurons that mediate MD-evoked inhibition in PL, we combine slice physiology, optogenetics, and intersectional genetic tools in mice of both sexes. We find interneurons expressing cholecystokinin (CCK+) are abundant in L3 of PL, with cells exhibiting fast-spiking (fs) or non&ndash;fast-spiking (nfs) properties. MD inputs make stronger connections onto fs-CCK+ interneurons, driving them to fire more readily than nearby L3 pyramidal cells and other interneurons. CCK+ interneurons in turn make inhibitory, perisomatic connections onto L3 pyramidal cells, where they exhibit cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) mediated modulation. Moreover, MD-evoked feed-forward inhibition, but not direct excitation, is also sensitive to CB1R modulation. Our findings indicate that CCK+ interneurons contribute to MD-evoked inhibition in PL, revealing a mechanism by which cannabinoids can modulate MD-PFC communication.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/23/e1095232024?rss=1">An Aggressive Interaction Rapidly Increases Brain Androgens in a Male Songbird during the Non-breeding Season</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aggression is a crucial behavior that impacts access to limited resources in different environmental contexts. Androgens synthesized by the gonads promote aggression during the breeding season. However, aggression can be expressed during the non-breeding season, despite low androgen synthesis by the gonads. The brain can also synthesize steroids ("neurosteroids"), including androgens, which might promote aggression during the non-breeding season. Male song sparrows, <I>Melospiza melodia</I>, are territorial year-round and allow the study of seasonal changes in the steroid modulation of aggression. Here, we quantified steroids following a simulated territorial intrusion (STI) for 10&nbsp;min in wild adult male song sparrows during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we examined 11 steroids: pregnenolone, progesterone, corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone, 17&beta;-estradiol, 17&alpha;-estradiol, estriol, and estrone. Steroids were measured in blood and 10 microdissected brain regions that regulate social behavior. In both seasons, STI increased corticosterone in the blood and brain. In the breeding season, STI had no rapid effects on androgens or estrogens. Intriguingly, in the non-breeding season, STI increased testosterone and androstenedione in several behaviorally relevant regions, but not in the blood, where androgens remained non-detectable. Also in the non-breeding season, STI increased progesterone in the blood and specific brain regions. Overall, rapid socially modulated changes in brain steroid levels are more prominent during the non-breeding season. Brain steroid levels vary with season and social context in a region-specific manner and suggest a role for neuroandrogens in aggression during the non-breeding season.</p>

                <p>Humans need social closeness to prosper. There is evidence that empathy can induce social closeness. However, it remains unclear how empathy-related social closeness is formed and how stable it is as time passes. We applied an acquisition&ndash;extinction paradigm combined with computational modeling and fMRI, to investigate the formation and stability of empathy-related social closeness. Female participants observed painful stimulation of another person with high probability (acquisition) and low probability (extinction) and rated their closeness to that person. The results of two independent studies showed increased social closeness in the acquisition block that resisted extinction in the extinction block. Providing insights into underlying mechanisms, reinforcement learning modeling revealed that the formation of social closeness is based on a learning signal (prediction error) generated from observing another&rsquo;s pain, whereas maintaining social closeness is based on a learning signal generated from observing another&rsquo;s pain relief. The results of a reciprocity control study indicate that this feedback recalibration is specific to learning of empathy-related social closeness. On the neural level, the recalibration of the feedback signal was associated with neural responses in anterior insula and adjacent inferior frontal gyrus and the bilateral superior temporal sulcus/temporoparietal junction. Together, these findings show that empathy-related social closeness generated in bad times, that is, empathy with the misfortune of another person, transfers to good times and thus may form one important basis for stable social relationships.</p>

                <p>The behavioral and neural effects of the endogenous release of acetylcholine following stimulation of the nucleus basalis (NB) of Meynert have been recently examined in two male monkeys (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B53">Qi et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Counterintuitively, NB stimulation enhanced behavioral performance while broadening neural tuning in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The mechanism by which a weaker mnemonic neural code could lead to better performance remains unclear. Here, we show that increased neural excitability in a simple continuous bump attractor model can induce broader neural tuning and decrease bump diffusion, provided neural rates are saturated. Increased memory precision in the model overrides memory accuracy, improving overall task performance. Moreover, we show that bump attractor dynamics can account for the nonuniform impact of neuromodulation on distractibility, depending on distractor distance from the target. Finally, we delve into the conditions under which bump attractor tuning and diffusion balance in biologically plausible heterogeneous network models. In these discrete bump attractor networks, we show that reducing spatial correlations or enhancing excitatory transmission can improve memory precision. Altogether, we provide a mechanistic understanding of how cholinergic neuromodulation controls spatial working memory through perturbed attractor dynamics in the PFC.</p>

                <p>Cocaine use disorder is a significant public health issue without an effective pharmacological treatment. Successful treatments are hindered in part by an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie long-lasting maladaptive plasticity and addiction-like behaviors. Here, we leverage a large RNA sequencing dataset to generate gene coexpression networks across six interconnected regions of the brain's reward circuitry from mice that underwent saline or cocaine self-administration. We identify phosphodiesterase 1b (<I>Pde1b</I>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent enzyme that increases cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis, as a central hub gene within a nucleus accumbens (NAc) gene module that was bioinformatically associated with addiction-like behavior. Chronic cocaine exposure increases <I>Pde1b</I> expression in NAc D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in male but not female mice. Viral-mediated <I>Pde1b</I> overexpression in NAc reduces cocaine self-administration in female rats but increases seeking in both sexes. In female mice, overexpressing <I>Pde1b</I> in D1 MSNs attenuates the locomotor response to cocaine, with the opposite effect in D2 MSNs. Overexpressing <I>Pde1b</I> in D1/D2 MSNs had no effect on the locomotor response to cocaine in male mice. At the electrophysiological level, <I>Pde1b</I> overexpression reduces sEPSC frequency in D1 MSNs and regulates the excitability of NAc MSNs. Lastly, <I>Pde1b</I> overexpression significantly reduced the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NAc following chronic cocaine, with discordant effects on gene transcription between sexes. Together, we identify novel gene modules across the brain's reward circuitry associated with addiction-like behavior and explore the role of <I>Pde1b</I> in regulating the molecular, cellular, and behavioral responses to cocaine.</p>

                <p>According to the predictive processing framework, perception emerges from the reciprocal exchange of predictions and prediction errors (PEs) between hierarchically organized neural circuits. The nonlemniscal division of the inferior colliculus (IC) is the earliest source of auditory PE signals, but their neuronal generators, properties, and functional relevance have remained mostly undefined. We recorded single-unit mismatch responses to auditory oddball stimulation at different intensities, together with activity evoked by two sequences of alternating tones to control frequency-specific effects. Our results reveal a differential treatment of the unpredictable "many-standards" control and the predictable "cascade" control by lemniscal and nonlemniscal IC neurons that is not present in the auditory thalamus or cortex. Furthermore, we found that frequency response areas of nonlemniscal IC neurons reflect their role in subcortical predictive processing, distinguishing three hierarchical levels: (1) nonlemniscal neurons with sharply tuned receptive fields exhibit mild repetition suppression without signaling PEs, thereby constituting the input level of the local predictive processing circuitry. (2) Neurons with broadly tuned receptive fields form the main, "spectral" PE signaling system, which provides dynamic gain compensation to near-threshold unexpected sounds. This early enhancement of saliency reliant on spectral features was not observed in the auditory thalamus or cortex. (3) Untuned neurons form an accessory, "nonspectral" PE signaling system, which reports all surprising auditory deviances in a robust and consistent manner, resembling nonlemniscal neurons in the auditory cortex. These nonlemniscal IC neurons show unstructured and unstable receptive fields that could result from inhibitory input controlled by corticofugal projections conveying top-down predictions.</p>

                <p>Behaviors and their execution depend on the context and emotional state in which they are performed. The contextual modulation of behavior likely relies on regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that multiplex information about emotional/autonomic states and behaviors. The objective of the present study was to understand how the representations of behaviors by ACC neurons become modified when performed in different emotional states. A pipeline of machine learning techniques was developed to categorize and classify complex, spontaneous behaviors in male rats from the video. This pipeline, termed Hierarchical Unsupervised Behavioural Discovery Tool (HUB-DT), discovered a range of statistically separable behaviors during a task in which motivationally significant outcomes were delivered in blocks of trials that created three unique "emotional contexts." HUB-DT was capable of detecting behaviors specific to each emotional context and was able to identify and segregate the portions of a neural signal related to a behavior and to emotional context. Overall, ~10<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> as many neurons responded to behaviors in a contextually dependent versus a fixed manner, highlighting the extreme impact of emotional state on representations of behaviors that were precisely defined based on detailed analyses of limb kinematics. This type of modulation may be a key mechanism that allows the ACC to modify the behavioral output based on emotional states and contextual demands.</p>

                <p>The hippocampus is a brain structure that plays key roles in a variety of cognitive processes. Critically, a wide range of neurological disorders are associated with degeneration of the hippocampal microstructure, defined as neurons, dendrites, glial cells, and more. Thus, the hippocampus is a key target for methods that are sensitive to these microscale properties. Diffusion MRI is one such method, which can noninvasively probe neural architecture. Here we review the extensive use of diffusion MRI to capture hippocampal microstructure in both health and disease. The results of these studies indicate that (1) diffusion tensor imaging is sensitive but not specific to the hippocampal microstructure; (2) biophysical modeling of diffusion MRI signals is a promising avenue to capture more specific aspects of the hippocampal microstructure; (3) use of ultra-short diffusion times have shown unique laminar-specific microstructure and response to hippocampal injury; (4) dispersion of microstructure is likely abundant in the hippocampus; and (5) the angular richness of the diffusion MRI signal can be leveraged to improve delineation of the internal hippocampal circuitry. Overall, extant findings suggest that diffusion MRI offers a promising avenue for characterizing hippocampal microstructure.</p>

                <p>The mouse auditory organ cochlea contains two types of sound receptors: inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). Tbx2 is expressed in IHCs but repressed in OHCs, and neonatal OHCs that misexpress Tbx2 transdifferentiate into IHC-like cells. However, the extent of this switch from OHCs to IHC-like cells and the underlying molecular mechanism remain poorly understood. Furthermore, whether Tbx2 can transform fully mature adult OHCs into IHC-like cells is unknown. Here, our single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that in neonatal OHCs misexpressing Tbx2, 85.6% of IHC genes, including <I>Slc17a8</I>, are upregulated, but only 38.6% of OHC genes, including <I>Ikzf2</I> and <I>Slc26a5</I>, are downregulated. This suggests that Tbx2 cannot fully reprogram neonatal OHCs into IHCs. Moreover, Tbx2 also failed to completely reprogram cochlear progenitors into IHCs. Lastly, restoring Ikzf2 expression alleviated the abnormalities detected in Tbx2+ OHCs, which supports the notion that Ikzf2 repression by Tbx2 contributes to the transdifferentiation of OHCs into IHC-like cells. Our study evaluates the effects of ectopic Tbx2 expression on OHC lineage development at distinct stages of either male or female mice and provides molecular insights into how Tbx2 disrupts the gene expression profile of OHCs. This research also lays the groundwork for future studies on OHC regeneration.</p>

                <p>Latrophilin-1 (Lphn1, aka CIRL1 and CL1; gene symbol <I>Adgrl1</I>) is an adhesion GPCR that has been implicated in excitatory synaptic transmission as a candidate receptor for &alpha;-latrotoxin. Here we analyzed conditional knock-in/knock-out mice for Lphn1 that contain an extracellular myc epitope tag. Mice of both sexes were used in all experiments. Surprisingly, we found that Lphn1 is localized in cultured neurons to synaptic nanoclusters that are present in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Conditional deletion of Lphn1 in cultured neurons failed to elicit a detectable impairment in excitatory synapses but produced a decrease in inhibitory synapse numbers and synaptic transmission that was most pronounced for synapses close to the neuronal soma. No changes in axonal or dendritic outgrowth or branching were observed. Our data indicate that Lphn1 is among the few postsynaptic adhesion molecules that are present in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and that Lphn1 by itself is not essential for excitatory synaptic transmission but is required for some inhibitory synaptic connections.</p>

                <p>Physical exercise is a robust lifestyle intervention known for its enhancement of cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, the extent to which these benefits can be transmitted across generations (intergenerational inheritance to F1, and transgenerational to F2 and beyond) remains a topic of limited comprehension. We have already shown that cognitive improvements resulting from physical exercise can be inherited from parents to their offspring, proving intergenerational effects. So, we set out to explore whether these enhancements might extend transgenerationally, impacting the F2 generation. In this study, we initially examined the behavioral traits of second generation (F2) male mice, whose grandfathers (F0) had an exercise intervention. Our findings revealed that F2 mice with physically active grandpaternal F0 progenitors displayed significantly improved memory recall, encompassing both spatial and non-spatial information when compared to their counterparts from sedentary F0 progenitors, and proving for the first time the transgenerational inheritance of physical exercise induced cognitive enhancement. Surprisingly, while F2 memory improved (as was the case with F1), adult hippocampal neurogenesis remained unchanged between experimental and control groups (unlike in F1). Additionally, our analysis of small RNA sequences in the hippocampus identified 35 differentially expressed miRNAs linked to important brain function categories. Notably, two of these miRNAs, miRNA-144 and miRNA-298, displayed a robust negative correlation with cognitive performance. These findings highlight the enduring transgenerational transmission of cognitive benefits associated with exercise, even after two generations, suggesting that moderate exercise training can have lasting positive effects, possibly orchestrated by a specific set of miRNAs that exert their influence across multiple generations.</p>

                <p>A decade ago, in 2013, and over the course of 4 summer months, three separate observations were reported that each shed light independently on a new molecular organization that fundamentally reshaped our perception of excitatory synaptic transmission (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B35">Fukata et al., 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B81">MacGillavry et al., 2013</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B90">Nair et al., 2013</cross-ref>). This discovery unveiled an intricate arrangement of AMPA-type glutamate receptors and their principal scaffolding protein PSD-95, at synapses. This breakthrough was made possible, thanks to advanced super-resolution imaging techniques. It fundamentally changed our understanding of excitatory synaptic architecture and paved the way for a brand-new area of research. In this Progressions article, the primary investigators of the nanoscale organization of synapses have come together to chronicle the tale of their discovery. We recount the initial inquiry that prompted our research, the preceding studies that inspired our work, the technical obstacles that were encountered, and the breakthroughs that were made in the subsequent decade in the realm of nanoscale synaptic transmission. We review the new discoveries made possible by the democratization of super-resolution imaging techniques in the field of excitatory synaptic physiology and architecture, first by the extension to other glutamate receptors and to presynaptic proteins and then by the notion of trans-synaptic organization. After describing the organizational modifications occurring in various pathologies, we discuss briefly the latest technical developments made possible by super-resolution imaging and emerging concepts in synaptic physiology.</p>

                <p>Foraging decisions involve assessing potential risks and prioritizing food sources, which can be challenging when confronted with changing and conflicting circumstances. A crucial aspect of this decision-making process is the ability to actively overcome defensive reactions to threats and focus on achieving specific goals. The ventral pallidum (VP) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) are two brain regions that play key roles in regulating behavior motivated by either rewards or threats. However, it is unclear whether these regions are necessary in decision-making processes involving competing motivational drives during conflict. Our aim was to investigate the requirements of the VP and BLA for foraging choices in conflicts involving overcoming defensive responses. Here, we used a novel foraging task and pharmacological techniques to inactivate either the VP or BLA or to disconnect these brain regions before conducting a conflict test in male rats. Our findings showed that BLA is necessary for making risky choices during conflicts, whereas VP is necessary for invigorating the drive to obtain food, regardless of the presence of conflict. Importantly, our research revealed that the connection between VP and BLA is critical in controlling risky food-seeking choices during conflict situations. This study provides a new perspective on the collaborative function of VP and BLA in driving behavior, aimed at achieving goals in the face of dangers.</p>

                <p>High-throughput gene expression profiling measures individual gene expression across conditions. However, genes are regulated in complex networks, not as individual entities, limiting the interpretability of gene expression data. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological knowledge are a powerful tool to extract meaningful biology from gene expression data. Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER) is an unsupervised machine learning method that defines biological pathways by leveraging the vast amount of published transcriptomic data. PLIER converts gene expression data into known pathway gene sets, termed latent variables (LVs), to substantially reduce data dimensionality and improve interpretability. In the current study, we trained the first mouse PLIER model on 190,111 mouse brain RNA-sequencing samples, the greatest amount of training data ever used by PLIER. We then validated the mousiPLIER approach in a study of microglia and astrocyte gene expression across mouse brain aging. mousiPLIER identified biological pathways that are significantly associated with aging, including one latent variable (LV41) corresponding to striatal signal. To gain further insight into the genes contained in LV41, we performed <I>k</I>-means clustering on the training data to identify studies that respond strongly to LV41. We found that the variable was relevant to striatum and aging across the scientific literature. Finally, we built a Web server (<A HREF="http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/">http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/</A>) for users to easily explore the learned latent variables. Taken together, this study defines mousiPLIER as a method to uncover meaningful biological processes in mouse brain transcriptomic studies.</p>

                <p>Social behavior is important for our well-being, and its dysfunctions impact several pathological conditions. Although the involvement of glutamate is undeniable, the relevance of vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (VGluT3), a specific vesicular transporter, in the control of social behavior is not sufficiently explored. Since midbrain median raphe region (MRR) is implicated in social behavior and the nucleus contains high amount of VGluT3+ neurons, we compared the behavior of male VGluT3 knock-out (KO) and VGluT3-Cre mice, the latter after chemogenetic MRR-VGluT3 manipulation. Appropriate control groups were included. Behavioral test battery was used for social behavior (sociability, social discrimination, social interaction, resident intruder test) and possible confounding factors (open field, elevated plus maze, Y-maze tests). Neuronal activation was studied by c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Human relevance was confirmed by VGluT3 gene expression in relevant human brainstem areas. VGluT3 KO mice exhibited increased anxiety, social interest, but also aggressive behavior in anxiogenic environment and impaired social memory. For KO animals, social interaction induced lower cell activation in the anterior cingulate, infralimbic cortex, and medial septum. In turn, excitation of MRR-VGluT3+ neurons was anxiolytic. Inhibition increased social interest 24&nbsp;h later but decreased mobility and social behavior in aggressive context. Chemogenetic activation increased the number of c-Fos+ neurons only in the MRR. We confirmed the increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired memory of VGluT3 KO strain and revealed increased, but inadequate, social behavior. MRR-VGluT3 neurons regulated mobility and social and anxiety-like behavior in a context-dependent manner. The presence of VGluT3 mRNA on corresponding human brain areas suggests clinical relevance.</p>

                Background Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a condition that affects 5–12% of the general population. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is the preferred treatment because of its few adverse effects and highest success rates. The most common post-operative consequences include synechia, nasal blockage, and disease recurrence. Spray cryotherapy is a novel therapeutic approach with promising outcomes for the treatment of upper airway disorders. This review aimed to investigate the effects of spray cryotherapy (SCT) following ESS in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Methods Six electronic databases were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The selected trials were evaluated for methodological quality, and data were extracted by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the quality of evidence. Results Three RCTs with 85 patients were included in the final analysis. SCT was related to -16 and -77 reductions in Lund-McKay and SNOT-22 scores after 36 weeks of follow-up, in contrast to a placebo, which showed -10.4, -65. Regarding the side effects of SCT, no adverse effects were reported, and visual assessments showed no pain, visual field loss, or any other ocular complications. Conclusions SCT is a new treatment modality after endoscopic sinus surgery that shows an effective post-operative management strategy with better post-operative scales (Lund-McKay, SNOT-22, POSE, and Lund-Kennedy) and less edema, obstruction, crusting, and inflammation with minimal or no side effects. However, further research with longer follow-ups, a larger sample size, and subjective assessment is needed to assess any possible long-term side effects.

                Background Car painting workers are at risk because of the use of solvents containing benzene as the main ingredient in the car painting process. One of the clinical effects of systemic benzene is kidney disorders. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between benzene and Risk Quotient (RQ) benzene concentrations with Malondialdehyde (MDA), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels in workers exposed to benzene in car painting workshops in Surabaya. Methods This study used an observational design with a cross-sectional method conducted at two car paint workshops in Surabaya. The study population was all workers exposed to benzene in the two car paint workshops, aged between 20-65 years in 2019. The sample was taken using an accidental sampling method, involving 30 respondents. Inclusion criteria included workers exposed to benzene and willing to participate, while exclusion criteria included workers with a liver or kidney disease history. The variables studied included benzene concentration, benzene RQ (benzene metabolite), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as a marker of oxidative stress, and indicators of kidney function (BUN and creatinine levels). Data were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate analysis with Pearson correlation test. Results There was no significant relationship between concentrations, RQ benzene, and MDA levels in workers in painting in Surabaya (p> 0.05). There was no significant relationship between benzene concentration, BUN levels, and creatinine levels in paint workers in Surabaya (p> 0.05). There was no significant relationship between benzene RQ and BUN and creatinine levels in paint workers in Surabaya (p> 0.05). Conclusions This study's results indicate that benzene's effects do not lead to impaired kidney function. The benzene RQ variable in this study did not become a determining factor in BUN and creatinine levels in workers.

                Improvements in DNA sequencing technology are allowing the dramatic increase of whole genome data for a wide variety of species. Such genome sequence data can assist the monitoring of intraspecific genetic diversity, but is often lacking for threatened species. In this project, we focused on the national Red List, a catalog of extinct and threatened species, issued by the Japanese government. We combined the data included in it with the record of genome assembly in NCBI and tabulated the assembly availability of the species in the list. The combined data shows a low percentage (2.1%) of the availability of whole genome sequence data for the taxa ranked on the Japanese Red List as well as a strong bias towards mammals and birds in Animalia and vascular plants in Plantae. Our data presentation highlights potential systematic limitations in genome sequencing (e.g., budget for sequencing large genomes of amphibians) and instructs future policies including which taxon needs more effort for genome sequencing. The resultant tables are available in the original website https://treethinkers.nig.ac.jp/redlist/ and are regularly updated.

                Background Pelvic masses in females often present a diagnostic challenge, necessitating accurate detection and characterization for appropriate clinical management. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a valuable tool in pelvic mass evaluation, offering superior soft tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging capabilities. This prospective observational study aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic MRI, determine anatomic origin, classify masses, estimate local spread, and evaluate the impact of gadolinium contrast in a tertiary care hospital in Central India. Methods The study will be conducted over a two-year period, enrolling female patients with lower back pain and clinical suspicion or inconclusive ultrasonographic findings of pelvic masses. A systematic approach to participant identification, recruitment, and engagement will be employed, with both verbal and written informed consent obtained. The imaging protocol will involve T1 and T2 weighted images, and gadolinium contrast administration when necessary. Data collection will encompass demographic information, medical history, clinical details, and MRI findings. Statistical analyses, including sensitivity, specificity, prevalence estimates, and regression analyses, will be performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic MRI. Expected outcome We anticipate that pelvic MRI will exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in detecting and characterizing pelvic masses, providing valuable information on anatomic origin and pelvic compartment localization. The study aims to contribute evidence on the impact of gadolinium contrast in enhancing diagnostic capabilities. The findings are expected to optimize clinical decision-making for effective management of females with pelvic masses, leading to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

                Background Malaria in pregnancy leads to placental malaria. The primary pathogenesis of the complex fetal implications in placental malaria is tissue hypoxia due to sequestrations of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. However, the pathomechanism of placental Plasmodium vivax infection has not been thoroughly investigated. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key transcriptional mediator of the response to hypoxic conditions, which interacts with the change and imbalances of many chemical mediators, including angiogenic factors, leading to fetal growth abnormality. Methods This study was conducted cross-sectionally in Maumere, Sikka Regency, East Nusa Tenggara Province, previously known as one of the malaria endemic areas with a high incidence of low birth weight (LBW) cases. This study collected peripheral and umbilical blood samples and placental tissues from mothers who delivered their babies with LBW at the TC Hiller Regional Hospital. All of the blood samples were examined for parasites by microscopic and PCR techniques, while the plasma levels of VEGF, PlGF, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α were determined using ELISA. The sequestration of infected erythrocytes and hemozoin was determined from placental histological slides, and the expression of placenta angiogenic factors was observed using the immunofluorescent technique. Results In this study, 33 cases had complete data to be analyzed. Of them, 19 samples were diagnosed as vivax malaria and none of falciparum malaria. There were significant differences in Δ 10th percentile growth curve of baby's body weights and also all angiogenic factors in placental tissues {VEGF, PlGF, and VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and HIF-1α} between those infected and not infected cases (p<0.05), but not for VEGF and VEGFR-2 in the plasma. Conclusion This study indicated that Plasmodium vivax sequestration may promote LBW through alterations and imbalances in angiogenic factors led by HIF-1α.

                Background The dimensions of popliteus muscle and its tendon are subjected to variability in the origin, mode of insertion, innervation patterns and vascular supply. The aim of this study was to measure the length, thickness and width of the popliteus muscle and its tendon at its different parts. The objectives were to study the topographic anatomy of the neurovascular structures of the popliteus and also to determine the dimensions of the popliteo-fibular ligament. Methods This descriptive cross sectional institutional based study included 50 formalin embalmed adult lower limb specimens. The measurements were performed by using the digital Vernier caliper. Results The length of the popliteus muscle belly along the upper and lower border were 44.2±6.63 mm and 89.26±14.41 mm, width of the muscle belly at midpoint, musculotendinous junction and insertion were 28.45±6.85 mm, 11.7±3.5 mm and 75.95±10.7 mm. The thickness of muscle belly at the midpoint was 2.55±0.55 mm. The length of popliteal tendon, width at origin and at musculotendinous junction were 24.85±2.15 mm, 7.55±1.55 mm and 8.5±1.15 mm. The thickness of tendon of popliteus was 2.6±0.75 mm. The length of nerve to popliteus was 50.44±8.66 mm and its origin was located 27.54±6.18 mm from the intercondylar line.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-580/v1?src=rss">Use of pumice stone and silica fume as precursor material for the design of a geopolymer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Geopolymers are alternative materials to cement because they require less energy in their production process; hence, they contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of using industrial residues such as silica fume (SF) to improve the physical and mechanical properties of a pumice stone (PS)-based geopolymer. Methods Through an experimental methodology, the process starts with the extraction, grinding, and sieving of the raw material to carry out the physical and chemical characterization of the resulting material, followed by the dosage of the geopolymer mixture considering the factors that influence the resistance mechanical strength. Finally, the physical and mechanical properties of the geopolymer were characterized. This research was carried out in four stages: characterization of the pumice stone, design of the geopolymer through laboratory tests, application according to the dosage of the concrete, and analysis of the data through a multi-criteria analysis. Results It was determined that the optimal percentage of SF replacement is 10%, which to improves the properties of the geopolymer allowing to reach a maximum resistance to compression and flexion of 14.10 MPa and 4.78 MPa respectively, showing that there is a direct relationship between the percentage of SF and the resistance. Conclusions Geopolymer preparation involves the use of PS powder with a composition rich in silicon and aluminum. The factors influencing strength include the ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, water content, temperature, curing time, molarity of sodium hydroxide, and binder ratio. The results showed an increase in the compression and flexural strength with 10% SF replacement. The geopolymer’s maximum compressive strength indicates its non-structural use, but it can be improved by reducing the PS powder size.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-579/v1?src=rss">From ‘village tanks’ to ‘evaporating pans’: Colonial and Post-colonial responses to ancient village tanks in Sri Lanka [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Village tanks, prevalent since ancient times, were an integrated part of the irrigation system in Sri Lanka (‘Ceylon’ till 1972). It was under these village tanks that paddy cultivation took place, and they were a part of the socially, technologically, and ecologically cohesive way of village life. The colonial authorities, who tried to renovate that ancient system, perceived village tanks as technically inefficient due to excessive evaporation and uneconomical land use. However, for several reasons, that perception could not be materialized during their renovation works. During the post-colonial period, with the implementation of the land colonization schemes in the 1930’s and the multipurpose river valley development schemes in the 1960’s, the scenario took a different shape. The technically perceived inferiority of the village tanks was brought into the new water management policies and the engineering designs. As a result, many of the village tanks were demolished, and those lands were converted to the farmlands. Instead of water availabilities assured through village tanks, canal irrigation became prominent. The socio-technical bondage between the village tanks and the village communities was not considered, presenting a classic case study for the consequences of neglecting social component of the technology. This paper discusses the social, political, and technical implications of these moves and their influence on shaping the present irrigation setup in the island.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-729/v2?src=rss">The relationship of age, sex and prothrombin time related to the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 46 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Older and male COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of having diabetes compared to younger and female COVID-19 patients. As diabetes is a comorbidity in COVID-19, it can be concluded that old age and male sex are associated with a more severe disease.
