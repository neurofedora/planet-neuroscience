                Introduction Biofeedback is a non-pharmacological treatment option valued for its minimal risk of adverse events and offers a safe alternative for individuals seeking preventive care for migraine. Despite level A evidence for migraine prevention, biofeedback treatment is still unavailable to most patients. We developed a novel medical device (Cerebri) for multimodal biofeedback treatment that omits the need for healthcare personnel involvement. Cerebri consists of a smartphone application (app) and two wireless sensors. Unique in its approach, the Cerebri app seamlessly integrates three biofeedback modalities – heart rate variability, temperature, and electromyography – making it a comprehensive, therapist-independent solution for non-pharmacological migraine management. Methods Biofeedback therapy using Cerebri for the prevention of migraine attacks in adults with episodic migraine (The BioCer study) was an open-label, randomized, waitlist-controlled, multicenter trial. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of daily home-based biofeedback sessions using the Cerebri device. A total of 286 participants will be randomized to either a 12-week intervention arm or waitlist control arm. The primary outcome was the change in the mean number of migraine days from baseline to the last 28-day period during the treatment phase in the treatment group compared with the control group. The primary outcome variable was prospectively collected through daily eDiary entries. Ethics and Dissemination Approval from the ethics committee and competent authorities was obtained prior to study initiation. Participation was voluntary and informed and written consent was obtained prior to inclusion. The results of this trial will be published in peer-reviewed international medical journals and communicated to patients and healthcare personnel through the relevant channels. Trial registration numbers EUDAMED: CIV-NO-22-08-040446 REK (Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics): 502734 Date of approval 2022-10-14 Trial registration: NCT05616741, 2022-11-15, https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05616741

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-774/v1?src=rss">Digital well-being in children and youth: Protocol for a comprehensive systematic review of reviews on interventions of problematic digital technology use [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Digital technologies proliferate in many people’s lives around the world with over 65% of these technology users being online. Children and youth are among the most prominent adopters of digital technologies in forms such as video gaming, social media, and online shopping. Problematic use of digital technologies can lead to poorer school/work performance, neglect of self-care skills, and comorbidities with other mental health issues. However, when used non-problematically, digital technology can also contribute to improving health and well-being. With the abundance of literature published, many reviews have sought to collate literature on treatment and interventions for children and youth with varying results. Thus, our proposed systematic review aims to synthesize current systematic reviews and meta-analyses on interventions and treatment of problematic digital technology use in children and youth (up to 25 years old). Methods As part of a three-paper series, a systematic search was completed in PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. Grey literature databases of the World Health Organization (IRIS database) and ClinicalTrials.gov were also searched. Furthermore, hand-searching of reference lists was also conducted. Title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening, were completed by at least two independent reviewers. For this review, the extractions and the quality of selected reviews will be assessed using AMSTAR 2.0 by two authors independently and reviewed by two additional authors. Results Results will be presented in narrative and tabular form. The results of this study are expected to offer insights into the populations of children and youth studied, treatments/interventions provided, outcomes, results, limitations, and conclusions of literature from the past five years. Feasibility and generalizability of the reviews will also be discussed. Conclusions Methodological strengths and weaknesses of reviewed studies will point to gaps in knowledge and can be used to inform future areas of policy and research.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/7/ENEURO.0001-24.2024?rss=1">Synchronous Measurements of Extracellular Action Potentials and Neurochemical Activity with Carbon Fiber Electrodes in Nonhuman Primates</a></h4>

              
                <p>Measuring the dynamic relationship between neuromodulators, such as dopamine, and neuronal action potentials is imperative to understand how these fundamental modes of neural signaling interact to mediate behavior. We developed methods to measure concurrently dopamine and extracellular action potentials (i.e., spikes) in monkeys. Standard fast-scan cyclic voltammetric (FSCV) electrochemical (EChem) and electrophysiological (EPhys) recording systems are combined and used to collect spike and dopamine signals, respectively, from an array of carbon fiber (CF) sensors implanted in the monkey striatum. FSCV requires the application of small voltages at the implanted sensors to measure redox currents generated from target molecules, such as dopamine. These applied voltages create artifacts at neighboring EPhys measurement sensors which may lead to misclassification of these signals as physiological spikes. Therefore, simple automated temporal interpolation algorithms were designed to remove these artifacts and enable accurate spike extraction. We validated these methods using simulated artifacts and demonstrated an average spike recovery rate of 84.5%. We identified and discriminated cell type-specific units in the monkey striatum that were shown to correlate to specific behavioral task parameters related to reward size and eye movement direction. Synchronously recorded spike and dopamine signals displayed contrasting relations to the task variables, suggesting a complex relationship between these two modes of neural signaling. Future application of our methods will help advance our understanding of the interactions between neuromodulator signaling and neuronal activity, to elucidate more detailed mechanisms of neural circuitry and plasticity mediating behaviors in health and in disease.</p>

                <p>Preparing acute brain slices produces trauma that mimics severe penetrating brain injury. In neonatal acute brain slices, the spatiotemporal characteristics of trauma-induced calcium dynamics in neurons and its effect on network activity are relatively unknown. Using multiphoton laser scanning microscopy of the somatosensory neocortex in acute neonatal mouse brain slices (P8&ndash;12), we simultaneously imaged neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (GCaMP6s) and cytotoxicity (propidium iodide or PI) to determine the relationship between cytotoxic Ca<sup>2+</sup> loaded neurons (GCaMP-filled) and cell viability at different depths and incubation times. PI<sup>+</sup> cells and GCaMP-filled neurons were abundant at the surface of the slices, with an exponential decrease with depth. Regions with high PI<sup>+</sup> cells correlated with elevated neuronal and neuropil Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The number of PI<sup>+</sup> cells and GCaMP-filled neurons increased with prolonged incubation. GCaMP-filled neurons did not participate in stimulus-evoked or seizure-evoked network activity. Significantly, the superficial tissue, with a higher degree of trauma-induced injury, showed attenuated seizure-related neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Calpain inhibition prevented the increase in PI<sup>+</sup> cells and GCaMP-filled neurons in the deep tissue and during prolonged incubation times. Isoform-specific pharmacological inhibition implicated calpain-2 as a significant contributor to trauma-induced injury in acute slices. Our results show a calpain-mediated spatiotemporal relationship between cell death and aberrant neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> load in acute neonatal brain slices. Also, we demonstrate that neurons in acute brain slices exhibit altered physiology depending on the degree of trauma-induced injury. Blocking calpains may be a therapeutic option to prevent acute neuronal death during traumatic brain injury in the young brain.</p>

                Background The discovery of an ideal and effective therapy is urgently required for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease that appear before the clinical symptoms are neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, brain inflammation, and neuronal atrophy throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. GSK-3β (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β) is regarded as the most important and promising target for therapeutic use because GSK-3β expression levels increase with age and are the most abundant and hyperactive in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Methods We used Maestro, which is Schrodinger, for our computational simulation studies. In the present work, we have used different modules that were used in previous studies with a little modification, the modules such as Protein Preparation with the help of Protein Preparation Wizard, Ligand Preparation with the help of LigPrep, for ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) prediction we used Qikprop, Docking studies we used Glide module, Binding energy prediction we used Prime and Molecular dynamic simulation studies by Desmond Results Our focus is mainly on an in-silico approach, focusing on library generation; we first drew an imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IMID 2) scaffold structure at Enamine and subjected it to a substructure search to target the receptor grid region (ATP-competitive site) of 6Y9R. They were then subjected to various screening processes. Finally, we selected nine compounds and subjected them to molecular dynamic simulation studies. Conclusions Nine compounds showed good results with the most stable interactions. Further experiments and studies are required to confirm these results.

                Photobiomodulation (PBM) has demonstrated positive effects on bone healing after fracture. This case report describes a skateboard-related shoulder anterior dislocation with Bankart and Hill-Sachs lesions. After a non-invasive reduction, the patient received conservative treatment with PBM. PBM was started on the accident day and continued daily for 30 days, followed by bi-weekly irradiation for 33 months. In the initial 30 days, the patient’s pain decreased, and the shoulder function was recovered with no pain, swelling, or bruising. On day 28, there was a reduction in edema compared to the initial injury and a full shoulder recovery for daily and sports activities. Physical examinations confirmed shoulder joint stability and the images at 33 months demonstrated Hill-Sachs lesion healing and significant Bankart lesion repair. In conclusion, PBM can induce recovery, alleviate pain, and facilitate functional rehabilitation. Additional clinical trials are required to validate the efficacy of this complementary therapy.

                Background Determinant and characteristic polynomials are important concepts related to square matrices. Due to the absence of additive inverse in max-plus algebra, the determinant of a matrix over max-plus algebra can be represented by a permanent. In addition, there are several types of square matrices over max-plus algebra, including triangular and diagonal strictly double ℝ -astic matrices. A special formula has been devised to determine the permanent and characteristic max-polynomial of those matrices. Another algebraic structure that is isomorphic with max-plus algebra is min-plus algebra. Methods Min-plus algebra is the algebraic structure of triple ( ℝ ε ′ , ⊕ ′ , ⊗ ) . Furthermore, square matrices over min plus algebra are defined by the set of matrices sized n × n , the entries of which are the elements of ℝ ε ′ . Because these two algebraic structures are isomorphic, the permanent and characteristic min-polynomial can also be determined for each square matrix over min-plus algebra, as well as the types of matrices. Results In this paper, we find out the special formulas for determining the permanent and characteristic min-polynomial of the triangular matrix and the diagonal strictly double ℝ -astic matrix. Conclusions We show that the formula for determining the characteristic min-polynomial of the two matrices is the same, for each triangular matrix and strictly double ℝ -astic matrix A , χ A ( x ) = ⨁ r = 0 , 1 , … , n ′ δ n − r ⊗ n r .

                Background Because of its close relationship with vessels that supply the thyroid gland, it is necessary to understand and document the course of the laryngeal nerves to prevent accidental damage. Otherwise it can lead to weakness in vocal cord function if ligated along with the arteries during thyroidectomy or other surgical procedures. The aim of our study was to examine and document the origin, relationship, and branching patterns of the laryngeal nerves on the side of the neck. Method The present cross sectional anatomical study was conducted on 64 dissected necks of formalin-fixed cadavers that were utilized for undergraduate teaching purposes. Different parameters were measured in the neck along with the relationship between the laryngeal nerves and their accompanying arteries. Results We observed usual and unusual course of laryngeal nerves along with some variations. Some of the novel findings were an internal laryngeal nerve piercing the thyroid cartilage lamina and an external laryngeal nerve communicating with the superior cervical ganglion. Conclusion The present study observed anatomical variations in the course of the laryngeal nerves, which are relevant for clinical practice. The potential risks of damage to these laryngeal nerves during various surgical procedures make it necessary to review and compile its relationship with the surrounding structures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-769/v1?src=rss">Comparative hemodynamics of ATTR and AL amyloidosis with exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension: A retrospective analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cardiac amyloidosis, characterized by the deposition of amyloid proteins in the heart tissue, presents in two main types: transthyretin (ATTR) and light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. The hemodynamic response to exercise and the relationship with pulmonary hypertension (PH) in these patients is not well understood. Methods This retrospective study analyzed 100 patients diagnosed with either ATTR or AL amyloidosis. We assessed the prevalence of PH at rest and its induction during exercise stress tests. Hemodynamic parameters were measured to identify differences in the cardiac response to exercise between the two subtypes. Results A higher prevalence of PH was noted in the ATTR group compared to the AL group. Exercise stress tests induced significant PH, particularly in the ATTR subgroup. Subtle yet clinically relevant hemodynamic differences were observed between the amyloidosis subtypes. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the amyloidosis subtype is an important factor in the management of PH. There is a need for tailored clinical approaches to address the distinct pathophysiological mechanisms in ATTR and AL amyloidosis. This study contributes to a better understanding of the hemodynamic changes during exercise in cardiac amyloidosis and underscores the importance of subtype-specific management strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-522/v2?src=rss">Identifying the role of Phytomolecules in  the management of liver diseases by modulating NRF2 pathway: A Scoping Review Protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The Liver is a vital organ in the human body, which plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. Oxidative stress is a critical factor in the pathogenesis and progression of various liver diseases, contributing to cellular damage and dysfunction. The Liver is particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of reactive oxygen species when the balance between their production and the body’s antioxidant defense mechanisms is disrupted. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for liver diseases due to its pivotal role in cellular defense against oxidative stress and inflammation. Plants have always been a source of drugs which has been used to treat various pharmacological disorders and most of its activity is due to its potential as an antioxidant. However, the specific mechanisms by which they interact with the NRF2 pathway and confer protection against liver diseases remain inadequately elucidated. Therefore, this scoping review aims to identify and analyze the existing literature pertaining to the relationship between Phytomolecules, which can modulate NRF2 and protect against liver diseases. Methods The proposed scoping review will follow the steps given by “Arksey and O’Malley and Levac et al”. Electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, etc.) will be searched for recent relevant studies. A predefined criterion for the inclusion and exclusion of studies will be independently adopted by two reviewers. The review will be presented as per the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR)” guidelines. Conclusion The scoping review finding is expected to help understanding the role of Phytomolecules in preventing liver diseases by modulating the NRF2 pathway. Ultimately, this review will serve as a foundational step toward developing targeted interventions to improve liver health outcomes and reduce the global burden of liver diseases.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The degree of intratumoral lipiodol staining after conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) has the potential to predict tumor responses and disease prognosis. This study is aimed at evaluating the correlation between the lipiodol retention of the tumor with a complete response after cTACE and tumor recurrence by quantitative assessment. Methods From January 2013 to September 2023, every patient receiving cTACE for HCC was recognized. Inclusion criteria were patients with ≤6 HCCs and sizes 1-6 cm, with at least one tumor obtaining a complete response after cTACE, and available baseline and follow-up CT studies. Tumoral, cTACE procedural, and lipiodol staining parameters were analyzed. Using univariate and multivariate analysis, significant factors associated with tumor recurrence were identified. ROC curve analysis was used to identify the optimal cutoff point for the statistically significant factors, predicting tumor recurrence. Results The final population included 39 patients with 63 HCCs. Tumor recurrence was detected in 18/63 (28.6%) at a mean of 27.8 months. On univariate analysis, the incidence of tumor recurrence significantly increased with increased tumor size (p = 0.007), an inhomogeneous lipiodol staining pattern (p<0.001), a low minimum lipiodol radiodensity (p = 0.012), and a high lipiodol washout rate (p = 0.046). On multivariate analysis, an inhomogeneous lipiodol staining pattern (p<0.001) and a high lipiodol washout rate (p = 0.012) were significant predictors for tumor recurrence. On ROC analysis, a lipiodol washout rate of greater than 6.44 HU/month was related to tumor recurrence (sensitivity 83%, specificity 51%). Conclusions Inhomogeneous lipiodol staining pattern and lipiodol washout rate of >6.44 HU/month were predictors for recurrence of HCC after a complete response after cTACE. These correlations may provide useful guidance for subsequent imaging surveillance and treatment approaches.

                Background Education of ‘108' ambulance personnel involved in transporting neonates may improve outcomes. We assessed i) perceptions/practices of ‘108’ ambulance personnel for transporting neonates, ii) clinical parameters of transported neonates at arrival, and iii) outcomes such as survival/mortality and NICU stay (before and after skill-based educational intervention). Methods We conducted a single-arm intervention study (pre-and post) over 18 months. We assessed the perceptions and practices of 77 ambulance personnel on neonatal transport pre- versus post-intervention. Checklists assessed ambulance equipment availability/usage in both phases. We compared clinical parameters and outcomes of transported neonates between the pre-intervention (n=62) and post-intervention (n=53) phases. We analyzed data using SPSS version 25. Results Post-intervention, there was a significant reduction in the levels of hypothermia (p < 0.001), hypoglycemia (p=0.010), and prolonged capillary refill time (p=0.042), along with improvement in the use of intravenous fluids (p <0.001), a reduction in the positivity of umbilical swab growth (p=0.002) and in the duration of NICU stay (p = 0.001), significant improvement (p < 0.001) in the perceptions/practices of ambulance personnel towards neonatal transport. There was an improvement in the ambulance equipment availability/usage post-intervention. Conclusions The perceptions and practices of the ‘108’ ambulance towards transporting neonates had significantly improved post-educational intervention. Further, a significant decrease in hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and duration of NICU stay was seen in neonates transported post-intervention.

                Background and aim Hypertension (HTN) is a significant public health concern worldwide, affecting approximately a third of people during their lifetimes. There are many factors that influence people with HTN to develop cardiovascular disease, such as lifestyle, genetics, economics, overall health, and medications; the authors did not find any previous study employing Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) analysis using machine learning. There is a sense of urgency to understand the characteristics of HTN patients in Pakistan; by using MAUT to analyze and evaluate different factors related to developing HTN, we can gain valuable insights into the characteristics of HTN and cardiovascular HTN (HTN-CVD) patients in Pakistan. Methods and results This study utilized a cross-sectional survey with 98 participants diagnosed with HTN and HTN-CVD. The questionnaire included sociodemographic items, symptoms, heredity factors, and dietary habits. The study was approved by the Research Ethical Committees of Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi (PMAS-AAUR), Pakistan. The result shows that there is a wide difference between HTN and HTN-CVD patients’ scores for symptoms (37% vs. 63%) and economic status (39% vs. 61%) (respectively). Other than these, the attribute proportions of scores for HTN and HTN-CVD are almost the same. The highest MAUT scores were higher for patients with HTN-CVD (373) than for those with HTN alone (270), and the mean age of HTN patients is higher than HTN-CVD; almost all attributes’ groups of the 10 highest MAUT scores of HTN-CVD higher than HTN patients except for attribute of medication status. Conclusion Patients with HTN-CVD complications have higher MAUT scores for lifestyle, social status, health status, and economic status. This emphasizes the importance of educating patients (and indeed the general public) about risks, symptoms, and adopting healthy behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-136/v2?src=rss">Diagnosis and Molecular Characterization of Dermatophytosis: An Observational Study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Dermatophytes are the keratinophilic fungi which infect humans and is the most recurring type of disease. The high level of transmissibility creates an epidemiological risk and emphasises the significance of these illnesses. However, a growing number of reports describing dermatophytes can cause deep infections in diabetic and immunocompromised patients, by invading deep layers like the dermis and hypodermis. Despite the prevalence and significance of dermatophytes in clinical mycology, it is not always possible to accurately diagnose this specific infection due to its overlapping structures among species of dermatophytes. Since it is difficult to identify species that exhibit weak characteristics in the morphological highlights, identification of the dermatophyte is often relied on its morphological analysis, which is a laborious process and demands skill. The massive shift in genetic variation, the source of infection, and epidemiological research can be discovered using molecular approaches. Therefore, the development of an accurate laboratory test for dermatophyte species identification is essential for the prevention and efficient management of dermatophytoses. One such methodology allows use of PCR technology which has many methods for molecular level characterization which is rapid, efficient, and capable of producing DNA polymorphisms specific to various dermatophyte species based on distinctive band patterns seen by agarose gel electrophoresis. The RAPD-PCR approach will be used in this study protocol to molecularly characterize the dermatophytes for precise speciation of the sample. In addition to improving knowledge of fungal biology and pathology with a focus on adaptive mechanisms to combat difficult conditions from host counteractions, there is a need to improve awareness of the importance of these diseases through accurate epidemiological data. The advantages of molecular approaches for characterizing objects over traditional methods are their sensitivity and specificity.

                Abstract* This report details a rare case of corneal infection caused by Medicopsis romeroi, highlighting clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, treatment, and outcome. An early adolescence male, after recent corneal tear repair, presented acute eye pain, redness, and decreased vision for 1 day. He underwent corneal tear repair elsewhere post vegetative matter-related swimming injury. Ophthalmic examination revealed a 2.5*3.3mm ulcer around sutures. Corneal scrapings enabled microscopy and culture. With lesion worsening, tissue adhesive (TA) and bandage contact lens (BCL) were applied. Fungal culture identified Medicopsis romeroi. Patient's history, clinical course, and treatment were documented. Microscopy unveiled fungal hyphae, later confirmed as Medicopsis romeroi. Treatment included topical/systemic antifungals. Post-TA + BCL, significant improvement followed, with re-epithelialization, scarring. This report underscores the importance of considering rare fungal pathogens like Medicopsis romeroi in cases of corneal ulcers, especially in individuals with unusual risk factors. Timely diagnosis through microscopy and fungal culture, coupled with tailored antifungal treatment led to successful management and favorable patient outcomes. This case also emphasizes the significance of vigilant clinical observation, precise laboratory analysis, and multidisciplinary collaboration between ophthalmologists and microbiologists in managing atypical ocular infections.

                Background COVID-19 has heavily impacted the financial and economic well-being of the world’s population. Various national relief programs and initiatives have been carried out to address society’s financial difficulties, especially the issue of poverty among the vulnerable, like refugees and immigrants. Consequently, being one of the main elements in Islamic social finance, waqf has been emphasised and proven throughout Islamic history as one of the practical tools for poverty reduction. However, recent waqf initiatives towards poverty reduction focused more on aiding the micro and small entrepreneurs, whilst limited waqf initiatives were available to help low-income households, refugees, and immigrants during this critical time in Malaysia. Methods This study introduces a novel waqf model, specifically designed to contribute to poverty reduction in society. It is tailored for low-income households, refugees, and immigrants, aiming to sustain their financial independence. By combining the elements of waqf and crowdfunding, this model proposes an innovative agriculture-based microfinance programme. It utilizes undeveloped waqf lands and equity-based crowdfunding to reach its objective of poverty reduction. This study has adopted a secondary research approach using the existing scholarly literature. Results This paper also discusses the potential of the proposed model to deliver more than its primary objective, as the framework illustrates that waqf institutions will have a continuous inflow of funds that will allow them to initiate other waqf-based projects, job creation through the microfinance programmes, and financial return for the investor of equity-based crowdfunding projects. Conclusion This study not only underscores the sustainability of the proposed model, but also its alignment with the increasing awareness of value-based and social impact objectives. It further explores the potential of waqf to be integrated with other financing instruments during the pandemic to help the vulnerable, specifically refugees and immigrants. This research thus contributes to the true purpose of Islamic social finance, highlighting the significance of its findings.

                Background The improper management of hazardous solid waste in dental care offices poses significant risks to public health and the environment. Dental offices generate hazardous waste, including biological and chemical contaminants, which can lead to infections, pollution, and harm if not managed properly. Effective waste management practices are crucial, yet compliance varies significantly across regions, especially in Latin America, due to limited resources, inadequate training, and insufficient infrastructure. This study compares hazardous waste management practices in dental offices in Talara, Peru, and Machala, Ecuador, to provide actionable recommendations for improvement. Policy and Implications In Peru, hazardous waste management involves critical steps such as conditioning, segregation, transport, storage, treatment, and disposal. Compliance minimizes exposure risks and environmental contamination. Ecuador emphasizes administrative and operational aspects, including policies, records, training, and procedures. Improving practices in both countries can model enhanced waste management across Latin America. Recommendations To address challenges in Talara and similar Latin American cities, it is essential to strengthen administrative systems, increase budget allocations for waste management, and develop comprehensive training programs. Waste management should be prioritized within public policy agendas with clear guidelines and accountability measures. Both cities need improved resource allocation, modern waste treatment facilities, and centralized storage solutions. Continuous education and certification programs are crucial. Implementing integrated policies, regular reviews, and robust compliance mechanisms based on Machala’s practices can benefit other regions. Public awareness campaigns and regional collaboration through workshops and research initiatives are also recommended. Conclusions Significant disparities in hazardous waste management exist between Talara and Machala. Talara requires strengthened systems and improved infrastructure, while Machala’s practices serve as a model. Tailored interventions can enhance public health and environmental outcomes across Latin America. Regular monitoring, evaluation, and collaboration are essential for sustained improvements.

                Lymphomas of the oral and oropharyngeal regions are rather uncommon, and diagnosis can be challenging and confusing due to the multiple histological subgroups. Lymphomas are the third most common type of tumor in the head and neck region and are brought on by the lymphoreticular system. The two forms of lymphoma are Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case report of oropharyngeal lymphoma. The female patient reported with a complaint of swelling over the palatal region for two to three months. An ulceroproliferative lesion was evident over the posterior palatal region. We diagnosed reactive lymphadenitis based on an incisional biopsy. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions, a punch biopsy followed by immunohistochemical studies were done. Features suggestive of activated B-cell-diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were confirmed. Among malignant lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most prevalent variety. Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding the molecular pathophysiology of this disease.

Identifying the association and corresponding types of miRNAs and diseases is crucial for studying the molecular mechanisms of disease-related miRNAs. Compared to traditional biological experiments, computational models can not only save time and reduce costs, but also discover potential associations on a large scale. Although some computational models based on tensor decomposition have been proposed, these models usually require manual specification of numerous hyperparameters, leading to a decrease in computational efficiency and generalization ability. Additionally, these linear models struggle to analyze complex, higher-order nonlinear relationships. Based on this, we propose a novel framework, KBLTDARD, to identify potential multiple types of miRNA–disease associations. Firstly, KBLTDARD extracts information from biological networks and high-order association network, and then fuses them to obtain more precise similarities of miRNAs (diseases). Secondly, we combine logistic tensor decomposition and Bayesian methods to achieve automatic hyperparameter search by introducing sparse-induced priors of multiple latent variables, and incorporate auxiliary information to improve prediction capabilities. Finally, an efficient deterministic Bayesian inference algorithm is developed to ensure computational efficiency. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that KBLTDARD has better Top-1 precision, Top-1 recall, and Top-1 F1 for new type predictions, and higher AUPR, AUC, and F1 values for new triplet predictions, compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, case studies demonstrate the efficiency of KBLTDARD in predicting multiple types of miRNA-disease associations.

                <p>by Ulrik Hvid, Namiko Mitarai</p>

T-even bacteriophages are known to employ lysis inhibition (LIN), where the lysis of an infected host is delayed in response to secondary adsorptions. Upon the eventual burst of the host, significantly more phage progenies are released. Here, we analysed the competitive advantage of LIN using a mathematical model. In batch culture, LIN provides a bigger phage yield at the end of the growth where all the hosts are infected due to an exceeding number of phage particles and, in addition, gives a competitive advantage against LIN mutants with rapid lysis by letting them adsorb to already infected hosts in the LIN state. By simulating plaque formation in a spatially structured environment, we show that, while LIN phages will produce a smaller zone of clearance, the area over which the phages spread is actually comparable to those without LIN. The analysis suggests that LIN induced by secondary adsorption is favourable in terms of competition, both in spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous environments.

Psychological and neuroscientific research over the past two decades has shown that the Bayesian causal inference (BCI) is a potential unifying theory that can account for a wide range of perceptual and sensorimotor processes in humans. Therefore, we introduce the BCI Toolbox, a statistical and analytical tool in Python, enabling researchers to conveniently perform quantitative modeling and analysis of behavioral data. Additionally, we describe the algorithm of the BCI model and test its stability and reliability via parameter recovery. The present BCI toolbox offers a robust platform for BCI model implementation as well as a hands-on tool for learning and understanding the model, facilitating its widespread use and enabling researchers to delve into the data to uncover underlying cognitive mechanisms.

                <p>by Ghazaleh Ostovar, James Q. Boedicker</p>

Quorum sensing (QS) is a regulatory mechanism used by bacteria to coordinate group behavior in response to high cell densities. During QS, cells monitor the concentration of external signals, known as autoinducers, as a proxy for cell density. QS often involves positive feedback loops, leading to the upregulation of genes associated with QS signal production and detection. This results in distinct steady-state concentrations of QS-related molecules in QS-ON and QS-OFF states. Due to the slow decay rates of biomolecules such as proteins, even after removal of the initial stimuli, cells can retain elevated levels of QS-associated biomolecules for extended periods of time. This persistence of biomolecules after the removal of the initial stimuli has the potential to impact the response to future stimuli, indicating a memory of past exposure. This phenomenon, which is a consequence of the carry-over of biomolecules rather than genetic inheritance, is known as "phenotypic" memory. This theoretical study aims to investigate the presence of phenotypic memory in QS and the conditions that influence this memory. Numerical simulations based on ordinary differential equations and analytical modeling were used to study gene expression in response to sudden changes in cell density and extracellular signal concentrations. The model examined the effect of various cellular parameters on the strength of QS memory and the impact on gene regulatory dynamics. The findings revealed that QS memory has a transient effect on the expression of QS-responsive genes. These consequences of QS memory depend strongly on how cell density was perturbed, as well as various cellular parameters, including the Fold Change in the expression of QS-regulated genes, the autoinducer synthesis rate, the autoinducer threshold required for activation, and the cell growth rate.

                <p>by Gustavo Magaña-López, Laurence Calzone, Andrei Zinovyev, Loïc Paulevé</p>

Boolean networks are largely employed to model the qualitative dynamics of cell fate processes by describing the change of binary activation states of genes and transcription factors with time. Being able to bridge such qualitative states with quantitative measurements of gene expressions in cells, as scRNA-seq, is a cornerstone for data-driven model construction and validation. On one hand, scRNA-seq binarisation is a key step for inferring and validating Boolean models. On the other hand, the generation of synthetic scRNA-seq data from baseline Boolean models provides an important asset to benchmark inference methods. However, linking characteristics of scRNA-seq datasets, including dropout events, with Boolean states is a challenging task.
We present scBoolSeq, a method for the bidirectional linking of scRNA-seq data and Boolean activation state of genes. Given a reference scRNA-seq dataset, scBoolSeq computes statistical criteria to classify the empirical gene pseudocount distributions as either unimodal, bimodal, or zero-inflated, and fit a probabilistic model of dropouts, with gene-dependent parameters. From these learnt distributions, scBoolSeq can perform both binarisation of scRNA-seq datasets, and generate synthetic scRNA-seq datasets from Boolean traces, as issued from Boolean networks, using biased sampling and dropout simulation. We present a case study demonstrating the application of scBoolSeq’s binarisation scheme in data-driven model inference. Furthermore, we compare synthetic scRNA-seq data generated by scBoolSeq with BoolODE’s, data for the same Boolean Network model. The comparison shows that our method better reproduces the statistics of real scRNA-seq datasets, such as the mean-variance and mean-dropout relationships while exhibiting clearly defined trajectories in two-dimensional projections of the data.

                <p>by Jesper J. Madsen, Y. Zenmei Ohkubo</p>

Membrane binding is a crucial mechanism for many proteins, but understanding the specific interactions between proteins and membranes remains a challenging endeavor. Coagulation factor Va (FVa) is a large protein whose membrane interactions are complicated due to the presence of multiple anchoring domains that individually can bind to lipid membranes. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the membrane binding of FVa and identify the key mechanisms that govern its interaction with membranes. Our results reveal that FVa can either adopt an upright or a tilted molecular orientation upon membrane binding. We further find that the domain organization of FVa deviates (sometimes significantly) from its crystallographic reference structure, and that the molecular orientation of the protein matches with domain reorganization to align the C2 domain toward its favored membrane-normal orientation. We identify specific amino acid residues that exhibit contact preference with phosphatidylserine lipids over phosphatidylcholine lipids, and we observe that mostly electrostatic effects contribute to this preference. The observed lipid-binding process and characteristics, specific to FVa or common among other membrane proteins, in concert with domain reorganization and molecular tilt, elucidate the complex membrane binding dynamics of FVa and provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of protein-membrane interactions. An updated version of the HMMM model, termed extHMMM, is successfully employed for efficiently observing membrane bindings of systems containing the whole FVa molecule.

                <p>by Mason A. McCool, Carson J. Bryant, Laura Abriola, Yulia V. Surovtseva, Susan J. Baserga</p>

Cancer initiates as a consequence of genomic mutations and its subsequent progression relies in part on increased production of ribosomes to maintain high levels of protein synthesis for unchecked cell growth. Recently, cytidine deaminases have been uncovered as sources of mutagenesis in cancer. In an attempt to form a connection between these 2 cancer driving processes, we interrogated the cytidine deaminase family of proteins for potential roles in human ribosome biogenesis. We identified and validated APOBEC3A and APOBEC4 as novel ribosome biogenesis factors through our laboratory’s established screening platform for the discovery of regulators of nucleolar function in MCF10A cells. Through siRNA depletion experiments, we highlight APOBEC3A’s requirement in making ribosomes and specific role within the processing and maturation steps that form the large subunit 5.8S and 28S ribosomal (r)RNAs. We demonstrate that a subset of APOBEC3A resides within the nucleolus and associates with critical ribosome biogenesis factors. Mechanistic insight was revealed by transient overexpression of both wild-type and a catalytically dead mutated APOBEC3A, which both increase cell growth and protein synthesis. Through an innovative nuclear RNA sequencing methodology, we identify only modest predicted APOBEC3A C-to-U target sites on the pre-rRNA and pre-mRNAs. Our work reveals a potential direct role for APOBEC3A in ribosome biogenesis likely independent of its editing function. More broadly, we found an additional function of APOBEC3A in cancer pathology through its function in ribosome biogenesis, expanding its relevance as a target for cancer therapeutics.

In the past 20 years, more remarkable revelations about sleep and its varied functions have arguably been made than in the previous 200. Building on this swell of recent findings, this essay provides a broad sampling of selected research highlights across genetic, molecular, cellular, and physiological systems within the body, networks within the brain, and large-scale social dynamics. Based on this raft of exciting new discoveries, we have come to realize that sleep, in this moment of its evolution, is very much polyfunctional (rather than monofunctional), yet polyfunctional for reasons we had never previously considered. Moreover, these new polyfunctional insights powerfully reaffirm sleep as a critical biological, and thus health-sustaining, requisite. Indeed, perhaps the only thing more impressive than the unanticipated nature of these newly emerging sleep functions is their striking divergence, from operations of molecular mechanisms inside cells to entire group societal dynamics.

                Fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells that are responsible for creating and maintaining tissue architecture through the production of extracellular matrix. These cells also play critical roles in processes such as wound repair and immune modulation in normal tissues and various disease states including fibrosis, autoimmunity, and cancer. Fibroblasts have a complex repertoire of functions that vary by organ, inflammatory state, and the developmental stage of an organism. How fibroblasts manage so many functions in such a context-dependent manner represents a gap in our understanding of these cells. One possibility is that a tissue-resident precursor cell state exists that provides the fibroblast lineage with flexibility during growth, inflammation, or other contexts that require dynamic tissue changes. Recent work has suggested that a precursor fibroblast cell state is marked by expression of Peptidase inhibitor 16 (Pi16). This review aims to concatenate and compare studies on fibroblasts that express Pi16 to clarify the roles of this cell state in fibroblast lineage development and other functions.

                Abstract* Hypoglossal nerve injuries are classified according to their anatomical localization in: Infranuclear, nuclear, and supranuclear. Supranuclear injuries can occur in cerebral cortex, corticobulbar tracts, internal capsule, cerebral peduncles, or in the pons, and most often caused by a stroke. These lesions usually do not generate a significant alteration of tongue motility due to the bilateral innervation of both nuclei from the cortex. We present a case of a 43-year-old male with dysarthria, left central facial paralysis, and an important tongue palsy and deviation to the same side. Brain CT revealed a right frontotemporal stroke with little hemorrhagic transformation, and an EKG that showed auricular fibrillation. He received treatment with amiodarone and rivaroxaban was initiated when a second brain CT scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage. This case is remarkable due the unusual presentation in a supranuclear lesion of the hypoglossal nerve. It is important to enrich the semiology and consider the possibility of cortical cerebrovascular events in patients with acute deviation of the tongue, even in the absence of involvement of other cranial nerves; or marked ipsilateral motor implication.

                Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has infected more than 600 million people and killed more than 6 million people worldwide. This infection affects mainly certain groups of people that have high susceptibility to present severe COVID-19 due to comorbidities. Moreover, the long-COVID-19 comprises a series of symptoms that may remain in some patients for months after infection that further compromises their health. Thus, since this pandemic is profoundly affecting health, economy, and social life of societies, a deeper understanding of viral replication cycle could help to envisage novel therapeutic alternatives that limit or stop COVID-19. Several findings have unexpectedly discovered that mitochondria play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. Indeed, it has been suggested that this organelle could be the origin of its replication niches, the double membrane vesicles (DMV). In this regard, mitochondria derived vesicles (MDV), involved in mitochondria quality control, discovered almost 15 years ago, comprise a subpopulation characterized by a double membrane. MDV shedding is induced by mitochondrial stress, and it has a fast assembly dynamic, reason that perhaps has precluded their identification in electron microscopy or tomography studies. These and other features of MDV together with recent SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome and other findings link SARS-CoV-2 to mitochondria and support that these vesicles are the precursors of SARS-CoV-2 induced DMV. In this work, the morphological, biochemical, molecular, and cellular evidence that supports this hypothesis is reviewed and integrated into the current model of SARS-CoV-2 cell infection. In this scheme, some relevant questions are raised as pending topics for research that would help in the near future to test this hypothesis. The intention of this work is to provide a novel framework that could open new possibilities to tackle SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through mitochondria and DMV targeted therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87292">DHODH inhibition enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade by increasing cancer cell antigen presentation</a></h4>

              
                Pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis is a druggable metabolic dependency of cancer cells, and chemotherapy agents targeting pyrimidine metabolism are the backbone of treatment for many cancers. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an essential enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway that can be targeted by clinically approved inhibitors. However, despite robust preclinical anticancer efficacy, DHODH inhibitors have shown limited single-agent activity in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Therefore, novel combination therapy strategies are necessary to realize the potential of these drugs. To search for therapeutic vulnerabilities induced by DHODH inhibition, we examined gene expression changes in cancer cells treated with the potent and selective DHODH inhibitor brequinar (BQ). This revealed that BQ treatment causes upregulation of antigen presentation pathway genes and cell surface MHC class I expression. Mechanistic studies showed that this effect is (1) strictly dependent on pyrimidine nucleotide depletion, (2) independent of canonical antigen presentation pathway transcriptional regulators, and (3) mediated by RNA polymerase II elongation control by positive transcription elongation factor B (P-TEFb). Furthermore, BQ showed impressive single-agent efficacy in the immunocompetent B16F10 melanoma model, and combination treatment with BQ and dual immune checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1) significantly prolonged mouse survival compared to either therapy alone. Our results have important implications for the clinical development of DHODH inhibitors and provide a rationale for combination therapy with BQ and immune checkpoint blockade.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93052">Sex-specific resilience of neocortex to food restriction</a></h4>

              
                Mammals have evolved sex-specific adaptations to reduce energy usage in times of food scarcity. These adaptations are well described for peripheral tissue, though much less is known about how the energy-expensive brain adapts to food restriction, and how such adaptations differ across the sexes. Here, we examined how food restriction impacts energy usage and function in the primary visual cortex (V1) of adult male and female mice. Molecular analysis and RNA sequencing in V1 revealed that in males, but not in females, food restriction significantly modulated canonical, energy-regulating pathways, including pathways associated waith AMP-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, mammalian target of rapamycin, and oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that in contrast to males, food restriction in females did not significantly affect V1 ATP usage or visual coding precision (assessed by orientation selectivity). Decreased serum leptin is known to be necessary for triggering energy-saving changes in V1 during food restriction. Consistent with this, we found significantly decreased serum leptin in food-restricted males but no significant change in food-restricted females. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that cortical function and energy usage in female mice are more resilient to food restriction than in males. The neocortex, therefore, contributes to sex-specific, energy-saving adaptations in response to food restriction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94709">Early evolution of the ecdysozoan body plan</a></h4>

              
                Extant ecdysozoans (moulting animals) are represented by a great variety of soft-bodied or articulated organisms that may or may not have appendages. However, controversies remain about the vermiform nature (i.e. elongated and tubular) of their ancestral body plan. We describe here <i>Beretella spinosa</i> gen. et sp. nov. a tiny (maximal length 3 mm) ecdysozoan from the lowermost Cambrian, Yanjiahe Formation, South China, characterized by an unusual sack-like appearance, single opening, and spiny ornament. <i>Beretella spinosa</i> gen. et sp. nov has no equivalent among animals, except <i>Saccorhytus coronarius</i>, also from the basal Cambrian. Phylogenetic analyses resolve both fossil species as a sister group (Saccorhytida) to all known Ecdysozoa, thus suggesting that ancestral ecdysozoans may have been non-vermiform animals. Saccorhytids are likely to represent an early off-shot along the stem-line Ecdysozoa. Although it became extinct during the Cambrian, this animal lineage provides precious insight into the early evolution of Ecdysozoa and the nature of the earliest representatives of the group.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92990">Chemoproteomics validates selective targeting of Plasmodium M1 alanyl aminopeptidase as an antimalarial strategy</a></h4>

              
                New antimalarial drug candidates that act via novel mechanisms are urgently needed to combat malaria drug resistance. Here, we describe the multi-omic chemical validation of <i>Plasmodium</i> M1 alanyl metalloaminopeptidase as an attractive drug target using the selective inhibitor, MIPS2673. MIPS2673 demonstrated potent inhibition of recombinant <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (<i>Pf</i>A-M1) and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> (<i>Pv</i>A-M1) M1 metalloaminopeptidases, with selectivity over other <i>Plasmodium</i> and human aminopeptidases, and displayed excellent in vitro antimalarial activity with no significant host cytotoxicity. Orthogonal label-free chemoproteomic methods based on thermal stability and limited proteolysis of whole parasite lysates revealed that MIPS2673 solely targets <i>Pf</i>A-M1 in parasites, with limited proteolysis also enabling estimation of the binding site on <i>Pf</i>A-M1 to within ~5 Å of that determined by X-ray crystallography. Finally, functional investigation by untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that MIPS2673 inhibits the key role of <i>Pf</i>A-M1 in haemoglobin digestion. Combined, our unbiased multi-omic target deconvolution methods confirmed the on-target activity of MIPS2673, and validated selective inhibition of M1 alanyl metalloaminopeptidase as a promising antimalarial strategy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92764">Human promoter directionality is determined by transcriptional initiation and the opposing activities of INTS11 and CDK9</a></h4>

              
                RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription initiates bidirectionally at many human protein-coding genes. Sense transcription usually dominates and leads to messenger RNA production, whereas antisense transcription rapidly terminates. The basis for this directionality is not fully understood. Here, we show that sense transcriptional initiation is more efficient than in the antisense direction, which establishes initial promoter directionality. After transcription begins, the opposing functions of the endonucleolytic subunit of Integrator, INTS11, and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) maintain directionality. Specifically, INTS11 terminates antisense transcription, whereas sense transcription is protected from INTS11-dependent attenuation by CDK9 activity. Strikingly, INTS11 attenuates transcription in both directions upon CDK9 inhibition, and the engineered recruitment of CDK9 desensitises transcription to INTS11. Therefore, the preferential initiation of sense transcription and the opposing activities of CDK9 and INTS11 explain mammalian promoter directionality.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90318">EEG-fMRI in awake rat and whole-brain simulations show decreased brain responsiveness to sensory stimulations during absence seizures</a></h4>

              
                In patients suffering absence epilepsy, recurring seizures can significantly decrease their quality of life and lead to yet untreatable comorbidities. Absence seizures are characterized by spike-and-wave discharges on the electroencephalogram associated with a transient alteration of consciousness. However, it is still unknown how the brain responds to external stimuli during and outside of seizures. This study aimed to investigate responsiveness to visual and somatosensory stimulation in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a well-established rat model for absence epilepsy. Animals were imaged under non-curarized awake state using a quiet, zero echo time, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence. Sensory stimulations were applied during interictal and ictal periods. Whole-brain hemodynamic responses were compared between these two states. Additionally, a mean-field simulation model was used to explain the changes of neural responsiveness to visual stimulation between states. During a seizure, whole-brain responses to both sensory stimulations were suppressed and spatially hindered. In the cortex, hemodynamic responses were negatively polarized during seizures, despite the application of a stimulus. The mean-field simulation revealed restricted propagation of activity due to stimulation and agreed well with fMRI findings. Results suggest that sensory processing is hindered or even suppressed by the occurrence of an absence seizure, potentially contributing to decreased responsiveness during this absence epileptic process.

">Population connective field modeling reveals retinotopic visual cortex organization in the prenatal human brain</a></h4>

              
                The visual space is sampled by cortical field maps in which nearby neuronal populations encode nearby locations of images received from the retina. Whether this retinotopic cortical organization already emerges in the prenatal human brain before visual experience is currently unknown. To answer this question in vivo, we applied population connective field modeling to 526 functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets ranging from prenatal to young adult age. We found retinotopically organized eccentricity and polar angle connectivity maps in V2 of the visual cortex as early as in the 21st week of gestation while connective field model fits increased significantly throughout development. These results highlight that retinotopic cortical maps develop in the second trimester of pregnancy, predating visual experience.

">Humans forage for reward in reinforcement learning tasks</a></h4>

              
                How do we make good decisions in uncertain environments? In psychology and neuroscience, the classic answer is that we calculate the value of each option and then compare the values to choose the most rewarding, modulo some exploratory noise. An ethologist, conversely, would argue that we commit to one option until its value drops below a threshold, at which point we start exploring other options. In order to determine which view better describes human decision-making, we developed a novel, foraging-inspired sequential decision-making model and used it to ask whether humans compare to threshold ("Forage") or compare alternatives ("Reinforcement-Learn" [RL]). We found that the foraging model was a better fit for participant behavior, better predicted the participants' tendency to repeat choices, and predicted the existence of held-out participants with a pattern of choice that was almost impossible under RL. Together, these results suggest that humans use foraging computations, rather than RL, even in classic reinforcement learning tasks.

">Default Mode Network activation at task switches reflects mental task-set structure</a></h4>

              
                Recent findings challenge traditional views of the Default Mode Network (DMN) as purely task-negative or self-oriented, showing increased DMN activity during demanding switches between externally-focused tasks (Crittenden et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2024). However, it is unclear what modulates the DMN at switches, with transitions within a stimulus domain activating DMN regions in some studies but not others. Differences in the number of tasks suggest that complexity or structure of the set of tasks may be important. In this fMRI study, we examined whether the DMN's response to task switches depends on the complexity of the active set of tasks, manipulated by the number of tasks in a run, or abstract task groupings based on instructional order. Core DMN activation at task switches was unaffected by the number of currently relevant tasks. Instead, it depended on the order in which groups of tasks had been learnt. Multivariate decoding revealed that Core DMN hierarchically represents individual tasks, task domains, and higher-order task groupings based on instruction order. We suggest that, as the complexity of instructions increases, rules are increasingly organized into higher-level chunks, and Core DMN activity is highest at switches between chunks.

">Beta-frequency sensory stimulation enhances gait rhythmicity through strengthened coupling between striatal networks and stepping movement</a></h4>

              
                Stepping movement is delta (1-4 Hz) rhythmic and depends on sensory inputs. In addition to delta rhythms, beta (10-30 Hz) frequency dynamics are also prominent in the motor circuits and are coupled to neuronal delta rhythms both at the network and the cellular levels. Since beta rhythms are broadly supported by cortical and subcortical sensorimotor circuits, we explore how beta-frequency sensory stimulation influences delta-rhythmic stepping movement, and dorsal striatal circuit regulation of stepping. We delivered audiovisual stimulation at 10 Hz or 145 Hz to mice voluntarily locomoting, while simultaneously recording stepping movement, striatal cellular calcium dynamics and local field potentials (LFPs). We found that 10 Hz, but not 145 Hz stimulation prominently entrained striatal LFPs. Even though sensory stimulation at both frequencies promoted locomotion and desynchronized striatal network, only 10 Hz stimulation enhanced the delta rhythmicity of stepping movement and strengthened the coupling between stepping and striatal LFP delta and beta oscillations. These results demonstrate that higher frequency sensory stimulation can modulate lower frequency dorsal striatal neural dynamics and improve stepping rhythmicity, highlighting the translational potential of non-invasive beta-frequency sensory stimulation for improving gait.

">Cerebellar output neurons impair non-motor behaviors by altering development of extracerebellar connectivity</a></h4>

              
                The capacity of the brain to compensate for insults during development depends on the type of cell loss, whereas the consequences of genetic mutations in the same neurons are difficult to predict. We reveal powerful compensation from outside the cerebellum when the excitatory cerebellar output neurons are ablated embryonically and demonstrate that the minimum requirement for these neurons is for motor coordination and not learning and social behaviors. In contrast, loss of the homeobox transcription factors Engrailed1/2 (EN1/2) in the cerebellar excitatory lineage leads to additional deficits in adult learning and spatial working memory, despite half of the excitatory output neurons being intact. Diffusion MRI indicates increased thalamo-cortico-striatal connectivity in En1/2 mutants, showing that the remaining excitatory neurons lacking En1/2 exert adverse effects on extracerebellar circuits regulating motor learning and select non-motor behaviors. Thus, an absence of cerebellar output neurons is less disruptive than having cerebellar genetic mutations.

">Photopharmacological activation of adenosine A1receptor signaling suppresses seizures in a mousemodel for temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Up to 30% of epilepsy patients suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). The search for innovative therapies is therefore important to close the existing treatment gap in these patients. The adenosinergic system possesses potent anticonvulsive effects, mainly through the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R). However, clinical application of A1R agonists is hindered by severe systemic side effects. To achieve local modulation of A1Rs, we employed a photopharmacological approach using a caged version of the A1R agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine, termed cCPA. We performed the first in vivo study with intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered cCPA to investigate the potential to uncage sufficient amounts of cCPA in the hippocampus by local illumination in order to suppress hippocampal excitability and seizures in mice. Using hippocampal evoked potential recordings, we showed a reduction in hippocampal neurotransmission after photo-uncaging of cCPA, similar to that obtained with ICV injection of CPA. Furthermore, in the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model for DRE, photo-uncaging of CPA in the epileptic hippocampus resulted in a strong suppression of seizures. Finally, we demonstrated that intrahippocampal photo-uncaging of CPA resulted in less impairment of motor performance in the rotarod test compared to ICV administration of CPA. These results provide a proof of concept for photopharmacological A1R modulation as an effective precision treatment for DRE.

">Calcium-triggered (de)ubiquitination events in synapses</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal communication relies on neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles (SVs), whose dynamics are controlled by calcium-dependent pathways, as many thoroughly studied phosphorylation cascades. However, little is known about other post-translational modifications, as ubiquitination. To address this, we analysed resting and stimulated synaptosomes (isolated synapses) by quantitative mass spectrometry. We identified more than 5,000 ubiquitination sites on ~2,000 proteins, the majority of which participate in SV recycling processes. Several proteins showed significant changes in ubiquitination in response to calcium influx, with the most pronounced changes in CaMKII and the clathrin adaptor protein AP180. To validate this finding, we generated a CaMKII mutant lacking the ubiquitination target site (K291) and analysed it both in neurons and non-neuronal cells. K291 ubiquitination influences CaMKII activity and synaptic function by modulating its autophosphorylation at a functionally important site (T286). We suggest that ubiquitination in response to synaptic activity is an important regulator of synaptic function.

">EM-Compressor: Electron Microscopy Image Compression in Connectomics with Variational Autoencoders</a></h4>

              
                The ongoing pursuit to map detailed brain structures at high resolution using electron microscopy (EM) has led to advancements in imaging that enable the generation of connectomic volumes that have reached the petabyte scale and are soon expected to reach the exascale for whole mouse brain collections. To tackle the high costs of managing these large-scale datasets, we have developed a data compression approach employing Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to significantly reduce data storage requirements. Due to their ability to capture the complex patterns of EM images, our VAE models notably decrease data size while carefully preserving important image features pertinent to connectomics-based image analysis. Through a comprehensive study using human EM volumes (H01 dataset), we demonstrate how our approach can reduce data to as little as 1/128th of the original size without significantly compromising the ability to subsequently segment the data, outperforming standard data size reduction methods. This performance suggests that this method can greatly alleviate requirements for data management for connectomics applications, and enable more efficient data access and sharing. Additionally, we developed a cloud-based application named EM-Compressor on top of this work to enable on-the-fly interactive visualization: https://em-compressor-demonstration.s3.amazonaws.com/EM-Compressor+App.mp4.

">Astroglial atrophy associates with loss of nuclear S100A10 in the hippocampus of aged male tree shrews</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are glial cells that participate in multiple physiological functions, such as protecting neurons against all types of damage. However, astrocytes develop morphological alterations during aging, such as decreased length, volume, and branch points of their processes, also known as astrocytic atrophy. Until now, the exact mechanism associated with the onset of atrophy is unknown. Tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a long-lived animal from the Scadentia order that develops several age-dependent brain alterations. In this study, we analyzed the morphology of GFAP+ astrocytes in the hippocampal region of adult, old, and aged male tree shrews. Aged animals presented more GFAP+ astrocytes in the proximal subiculum, CA3, and CA2-CA1 subregions than younger animals, being significantly higher only in CA3. However, in aged subjects, the number of atrophic astrocytes was significantly higher in the dentate gyrus and CA2 subregion compared to old animals. Interestingly, in the proximal subiculum, astrocytes had a reduced arborization at all ages evaluated. S100A10, a protein overexpressed by neuroprotective-type astrocytes, was mainly found in the nucleus of astrocytes of adult and old subjects. However, in old and aged animals, S100A10 was located in the cytoplasmic compartment of atrophic astrocytes. Furthermore, in astrocytes of aged tree shrews, cytoplasmic inclusions of S100A10 colocalized with the nuclear export protein, Crm-1. These results suggest that the transport of S100A10 from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic compartment of astrocytes could be a process related to astroglial atrophy during the aging process in the hippocampus of three shrews.

                The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), one of the smallest living primates, emerges as a promising model organism for neuroscience research. This is due to its genetic similarity to humans, its evolutionary position between rodents and humans, and its primate-like features encapsulated within a rodent-sized brain. Despite its potential, the absence of a comprehensive reference brain atlas impedes the progress of research endeavors in this species, particularly at the microscopic level. Existing references have largely been confined to the macroscopic scale, lacking detailed anatomical information. Here, we present eLemur, a new resource, comprising a repository of high-resolution brain-wide images immunostained with multiple cell type and structural markers, elucidating the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the mouse lemur brain. Additionally, it encompasses a segmented two-dimensional (2D) reference and 3D anatomical brain atlas delineated into cortical, subcortical, and other vital regions. Furthermore, eLemur includes a comprehensive 3D cell atlas, providing densities and spatial distributions of non-neuronal and neuronal cells across the mouse lemur brain. Accessible via a web-based viewer (https://eeum-brain.com/#/lemurdatasets), the eLemur resource streamlines data sharing and integration, fostering the exploration of new hypotheses and experimental designs using the mouse lemur as a model organism. Moreover, in conjunction with the growing 3D datasets for rodents, non-human primates, and humans, our eLemur 3D digital framework enhances the potential for comparative analysis and translation research, facilitating the integration of extensive rodent study data into human studies.

                Contextual interference (CI) enhances learning by practicing motor tasks in a random order rather than a blocked order. One hypothesis suggests that the benefits arise from enhanced early perceptual/attentional processes, while another posits that better learning is due to highly activated mnemonic processes. We propose to harness high-density electroencephalography in a multi-scale analysis approach, including topographic analyses, source estimations, and functional connectivity, to examine the intertwined dynamics of attentional and mnemonic processes within short time windows. We recorded scalp activity from 35 participants as they performed an aiming task at three different distances, under both random and blocked conditions using a crossover design. Our results showed that topographies associated with processes related to perception/attention (N1, P3a) and working memory (P3b) were more pronounced in the random condition. Source estimation analyses supported these findings, revealing greater involvement of the perceptual ventral pathway and the anterior cingulate and parietal cortices, along with increased functional connectivity in ventral alpha and frontoparietal theta band networks during random practice. Our results suggest that CI is driven, in the random compared to the blocked condition, by enhanced specific processes such as perceptual, attentional, and mnemonic, as well as large-scale general processes.

">Microglial low-affinity FcγR mediates the phagocytic elimination of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinsons disease degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation contributes to dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration in Parkinsons disease (PD). It is thought that microglial cells interact with DA neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the most vulnerable region in parkinsonian neuropathology, playing a critical role through the process of neuronal loss. However, the specific mechanisms by which microglial reactivity is triggered and exerts such a deleterious effect remains unclear. Experimental models of PD in mice have shown that phagocytosis plays an essential role in the elimination of degenerating neurons, suggesting that blocking this microglial function could be beneficial to preserve remaining DA neurons. In the present work, we pinpoint the role of the Fc{gamma}receptor (F{gamma}R) as a potential trigger of microglial phagocytosis in PD. We found that the Fc{gamma}R is overexpressed in the degenerating SNpc in postmortem samples of PD patients, alongside histological indications of phagocytic microglia. Likewise, experimental models of PD also show increased Fc{gamma}R expression, together with evidence of similar phagocytosis events. Most importantly, blocking Fc{gamma}R in vitro, by using neutralizing antibodies, reduced the microglial-mediated elimination of DA cells. High resolution imaging revealed that the Fc{gamma}R is involved in phagocytic synapse formation, and appeared polarized, and segregated to actin-rich protruding cups, when interacting one-on-one towards single target DA cells. Additionally, by inhibiting Fc{gamma}R downstream actin-polymerizing signaling Cdc42, microglia were unable to eliminate DA cells. Finally, experiments in vivo, using an experimental model of PD in mouse, revealed that passive immunotherapy with Fc{gamma}R neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, as well as inhibiting its downstream signaling Cdc42, protect DA neurons from elimination. These results indicate that the Fc{gamma}R may be a critical factor inducing DA neuron phagocytosis in PD and suggest a novel immunotherapeutic strategy targeting microglia to preserve neuronal loss.

">Time-resolved functional connectivity during visuomotor graph learning</a></h4>

              
                Humans naturally attend to patterns that emerge in our perceptual environments, building mental models that allow for future experiences to be processed more effectively and efficiently. Perceptual events and statistical relations can be represented as nodes and edges in a graph, respectively. Recent work in the field of graph learning has shown that human behavior is sensitive to graph topology, but less is known about how that topology might elicit distinct neural responses during learning. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by applying time-resolved network analyses to fMRI data collected during a visuomotor graph learning task to assess neural signatures of learning modular graphs and non-modular lattice graphs. We found that performance on this task was supported by a highly flexible visual system and otherwise relatively stable brain-wide community structure, cohesiveness within the dorsal attention, limbic, default mode, and subcortical systems, and an increasing degree of integration between the visual and ventral attention systems. Additionally, we found that the time-resolved connectivity of the limbic, default mode, temporoparietal, and subcortical systems was associated with enhanced performance for the modular group but not the lattice group. These findings provide evidence for the differential neural processing of statistical structures with distinct topologies and highlight similarities between the neural correlates of graph learning and statistical learning more broadly.

">Delayed accumulation of inhibitory input explains gamma frequency variation with changing contrast in an Inhibition Stabilized Network</a></h4>

              
                Gamma rhythm (30-70 Hz), thought to represent the push-pull activity of excitatory and inhibitory population, can be induced by presenting achromatic gratings in the primary visual cortex (V1) and is sensitive to stimulus properties such as size and contrast. In addition, gamma occurs in short bursts, and shows a "frequency-falloff" effect where its peak frequency is high after stimulus onset and slowly decreases to a steady state. Recently, these size-contrast properties and temporal characteristics were replicated in a self-oscillating Wilson-Cowan (WC) model operating as an Inhibition stabilized network (ISN), stimulated by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)-type inputs. In particular, frequency-falloff was explained by delayed and slowly accumulated inputs arriving at local inhibitory populations. We hypothesized that if the stimulus is preceded by another higher contrast stimulus, frequency-falloff could be abolished or reversed, since the excessive inhibition will now take more time to dissipate. We presented gratings at different contrasts consecutively to two female monkeys while recording gamma using microelectrode arrays in V1 and confirmed this prediction. Further, this model also replicated a characteristic pattern of gamma frequency modulation to counter-phasing stimuli as reported previously. Thus, the ISN model with delayed surround input replicates gamma frequency responses to time-varying contrasts.

">Characterizing BOLD activation patterns in the human hippocampus with laminar fMRI</a></h4>

              
                The human hippocampus has been extensively studied at the macroscale using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) but the underlying microcircuits at the mesoscale (i.e., at the level of layers) are largely uninvestigated in humans. We target two questions fundamental to hippocampal laminar fMRI: How does the venous bias affect the interpretation of hippocampal laminar responses? And can we establish a benchmark laminar fMRI experiment which robustly elicits single-subject hippocampal activation utilizing the most widely applied GRE-BOLD contrast? We comprehensively characterized GRE-BOLD responses as well as T2*, tSNR and physiological noise as a function of cortical depth in individual subfields of the human hippocampus. Our results show that the vascular architecture differs between subfields leading to subfield-specific laminar biases of GRE-BOLD responses. Using an autobiographical memory paradigm, we robustly acquired depth-specific BOLD responses in hippocampal subfields. In the CA1 subregion, our results indicate a more pronounced trisynaptic path input rather than dominant direct inputs from entorhinal cortex during autobiographical memory retrival. Our study provides unique insights into the hippocampus at the mesoscale level, and will help interpreting hippocampal laminar fMRI responses and allow researchers to test mechanistic hypotheses of hippocampal function.

">The dynamic gene regulatory landscape of the mouse brain in response to sleep deprivation</a></h4>

              
                Sleep deprivation (SD) negatively impacts nearly all brain functions including cognition, memory consolidation and metabolism. However, the gene regulatory networks that underlie these biological effects are not well understood. In order to identify these networks, we conducted a multiomic analysis to analyse how gene expression, chromatin accessibility, enhancer activity and DNA methylation change with acute SD in mice. By studying three brain regions involved in different aspects of sleep - the cortex (CTX), dentate gyrus (DG), and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) - we found that the effects of SD on the multiome varied widely, impacting physiological processes specific to each area, from spine formation in the dentate gyrus to neuropeptide release in the SCN. Our integrated analysis showed that distinct brain region-specific networks of regulatory factors dynamically alter the epigenomic landscape in response to SD to orchestrate transcriptional responses. These findings provide new understanding of the regulatory grammar encoded within the genome, which enables a general physiological signal like SD to produce unique effects in a tissue-specific context.

">MJF-14 proximity ligation assay detects early non-inclusion alpha-synuclein pathology with enhanced specificity and sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Lewy pathology, consisting of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, is the pathological hallmark of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, but it is generally thought to represent late-stage pathological changes. In contrast, alpha-synuclein oligomers are regarded as early-stage pathology, likely involved in disease progression and cellular toxicity. Oligomers, however, are not detected by standard immunohistochemistry but require specific detection techniques such as the proximity ligation assay (PLA). Here, we describe the MJF-14 PLA, a new PLA towards aggregated alpha-synuclein with unprecedented specificity, attained by the utilization of aggregate conformation-specific alpha-synuclein antibody MJFR-14-6-4-2 (hereafter MJF-14). Signal in the assay directly correlates with alpha-synuclein aggregation in SH-SY5Y cells, as treatment with aggregation inhibitor ASI1D significantly lowers PLA signal. In human cortical neurons, MJF-14 PLA detects pre-formed fibril-induced aggregation, especially prominent when using stealth PFFs invisible to the MJF-14 antibody. Co-labelling of MJF-14 PLA and pS129-alpha-synuclein immunofluorescence in post-mortem dementia with Lewy bodies cases showed that while the MJF-14 PLA reveals extensive non-inclusion pathology, it is not sensitive towards Lewy bodies. In Parkinson's disease brain, direct comparison of PLA and IHC with the MJF-14 antibody, combined with machine learning-based quantification, showed striking alpha-synuclein pathology preceding the formation of conventional Lewy pathology. The majority of the PLA-revealed non-inclusion pathology was found in the neuropil, including some clearly located in the presynaptic terminals. With this work, we introduce an improved alpha-synuclein aggregate PLA to uncover abundant non-inclusion pathology, which deserves future validation with multiple brain bank resources and in different synucleinopathies.

">Macrovascular contributions to resting-state fMRI signals: A comparison between EPI and bSSFP at 9.4 Tesla</a></h4>

              
                The draining-vein bias of T2*-weighted sequences, like gradient echo echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI), can limit the spatial specificity of functional MRI (fMRI). The underlying extravascular signal changes increase with field strength (B0) and the perpendicularity of draining veins to the main axis of B0, and are therefore particularly problematic at ultra-high field (UHF). In contrast, simulations showed that T2-weighted sequences are less affected by the draining-vein bias, depending on the amount of rephasing of extravascular signal. As large pial veins on the cortical surface follow the cortical folding tightly, their orientation can be approximated by the cortical orientation to B0. In our work, we compare the influence of the cortical orientation to B0 on the resting-state fMRI signal of three sequences aiming to understand their macrovascular contribution. While 2D GRE-EPI and 3D GRE-EPI (both T2*-weighted) showed a high dependence on the cortical orientation to B0, especially on the cortical surface, this was not the case for 3D balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) (T2/T1-weighted). Here, a slight increase of orientation dependence was shown in depths closest to WM. And while orientation dependence decreased with increased distance to the veins for both EPI sequences, no change in orientation dependence was observed in bSSFP. This indicates the low macrovascular contribution to the bSSFP signal, making it a promising sequence for layer fMRI at UHF.

">The perineurium integrates leptin with its sympathetic outflow to protect against obesity</a></h4>

              
                The regulatory mechanism of leptin's afferent action in the brain, constituting a negative feedback loop, is contingent upon the efferent sympathetic innervation of white and brown adipose tissues. Nonetheless, the peripheral regulation governing the relative strengths of the afferent and efferent arms remains ambiguous. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on murine sympathetic ganglia, we identified the unique expression of both the leptin receptor (LepR) and the beta 2 adrenergic receptor (Adrb2) in perineurial cells that form a barrier around sympathetic ganglia and nerve bundles in adipose tissues. We show that LepR+ Sympathetic Perineurial Cells (SPCs) are molecularly similar to endothelial cells and that conditional knockout of Adrb2 in LepR+ SPCs predisposes mice to obesity without affecting food intake. Notably, we found that hyperleptinemia associated with obesity causes apoptosis in SPCs, leading to a significant erosion of the perineurial barrier and concomitant adipose sympathetic neuropathy. We further show that this deleterious effect can be reversed by sympathomimetic beta 2 adrenergic receptor agonism. These results have relevance to human obesity, as we observed a synergistic effect of highly common polymorphisms of LEPR and ADRB2 on the risk of increased BMI in a large European population. We propose that SPCs are the nexus of leptin action by integrating the afferent and efferent arms of the neuroendocrine loop to influence its setpoint.

">Multivariate analysis of multimodal brain structure predicts individual differences in risk and intertemporal preference</a></h4>

              
                Large changes to brain structure (e.g., from damage or disease) can explain alterations in behavior. It is therefore plausible that smaller structural differences in healthy samples can be used to better understand and predict individual differences in behavior. Despite the brain's multivariate and distributed structure-to-function mapping, most studies have used univariate analyses of individual structural brain measures. Here we used a multivariate approach in a multimodal data set composed of volumetric, surface-based, diffusion-based, and functional resting-state MRI measures to predict reliable individual differences in risk and intertemporal preferences. We show that combining twelve brain structure measures led to better predictions across tasks than using any individual measure, and by examining model coefficients, we visualize the relative contribution of different brain measures from different brain regions. Using a multivariate approach to brain structure-to-function mapping that combines across many brain structure properties, along with reliably measured behavior phenotypes, may increase out-of-sample prediction accuracies and insight into neural underpinnings. Furthermore, this methodological approach may be useful to improve predictions and neural insight across basic, translational, and clinical research fields.

">Evidence for low affinity of GABA at the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2. Implications for transmitter co-release from dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose: Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons comprise a heterogeneous population of cells. For instance, some DA neurons express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 allowing these cells to co-release DA and glutamate. Additionally, GABA may be co-released from DA neurons. However, most cells do not express the canonical machinery to synthesize GABA or the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT. Instead, GABA seems to be taken up into DA neurons by a plasmalemmal GABA transporter (GAT1) and stored in synaptic vesicles via the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2. Yet, it remains unclear whether GABA indeed interacts with VMAT2, or whether another transmitter could be responsible for the observed inhibitory effects attributed to GABA. Experimental Approach: We used radiotracer flux measurements in VMAT2 expressing HEK-293 cells and synaptic vesicles from rodents to determine whether GABA qualifies as substrate at VMAT2. mRNA in situ hybridization was employed to determine expression of VMAT2 and GAT1 transcripts in DA neurons of mouse and in human midbrains. Key Results: We found that GABA reduced uptake of VMAT2 substrates in rodent synaptic vesicle preparations from striatum and cerebellum at millimolar concentrations but had no effect in VMAT2-expressing cells indicating that key components are missing in a non-neuronal system. Roughly 60 % of murine and human DA neurons in the substantia nigra express VMAT2 and GAT1 suggesting that many may be capable of co-releasing DA and GABA. Conclusion and Implication: Our experiments suggest that GABA is a low-affinity substrate at VMAT2 with potential implications for basal ganglia physiology and disease.

">Methamphetamine-induced adaptation of learning rate dynamics depend on baseline performance.</a></h4>

              
                The ability to calibrate learning according to new information is a fundamental component of an organisms ability to adapt to changing conditions. Yet, the exact neural mechanisms guiding dynamic learning rate adjustments remain unclear. Catecholamines appear to play a critical role in adjusting the degree to which we use new information over time, but individuals vary widely in the manner in which they adjust to changes. Here, we studied the effects of a low dose of methamphetamine (MA), and individual differences in these effects, on probabilistic reversal learning dynamics in a within-subject, double-blind, randomized design. Participants first completed a reversal learning task during a drug-free baseline session to provide a measure of baseline performance. Then they completed the task during two sessions, one with MA (20 mg oral) and one with placebo (PL). First, we showed that, relative to PL, MA modulates the ability to dynamically adjust learning from prediction errors. Second, this effect was more pronounced in participants who performed poorly at baseline. These results present novel evidence for the involvement of catecholaminergic transmission on learning flexibility and highlights that baseline performance modulates the effect of the drug.

">Dichotomy between extracellular signatures of active dendritic chemical synapses and gap junctions</a></h4>

              
                Background and motivation: Local field potentials (LFPs) are compound signals comprising synaptic currents and several transmembrane currents from active structures, which represent the dynamic flow of information across the brain. Although LFP analyses have remained largely limited to chemical synaptic inputs, neurons and other cell types also receive gap junctional inputs that play essential roles in neuronal and network physiology. Gap junctional inputs have been historically excluded from LFP analyses because, unlike synaptic receptors, these inputs are not mediated by transmembrane currents that involve the extracellular space. However, the voltage response to gap junctional inputs onto active compartments triggers several transmembrane currents across the neuron. Therefore, two fundamental questions required for enhanced accuracy of LFP interpretations are: (i) Do gap junctional inputs onto active compartments contribute to LFPs? (ii) Are there differences in extracellular signatures associated with gap junctional vs. chemical synaptic inputs onto active compartments? Methodology: We built morphologically realistic conductance-based neuronal models and placed a 3D array of extracellular electrodes spanning the somato-dendritic stretch. We employed different types of inputs: (i) synchronous; (ii) random; and (iii) rhythmic (1-128 Hz). We computed LFPs at all electrodes and analyzed the spatiotemporal profiles of intra- and extra-cellular voltages for several model configurations, involving different input types, with active vs. passive dendrites, with gap junctions vs. chemical synapses, and in the presence vs. absence of different ion channels. Results: We demonstrate a striking reversal in the polarity of extracellular potentials associated with synchronous inputs through chemical synapses vs. gap junctions onto active dendrites. Whereas synchronous inputs through chemical synapses yielded a negative deflection in proximal electrodes, those onto gap junctions manifested a positive deflection. Importantly, we observed extracellular dipoles only when inputs arrived through chemical synapses, but not with gap junctions. Remarkably, the slow hyperpolarization-activation cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which typically conduct inward currents, mediated outward currents triggered by the fast voltage transition caused by synchronous inputs. With random inputs, extracellular potentials in proximal electrodes were largely negative with chemical synapses but were biphasic with gap junctional inputs. Finally, with rhythmic inputs arriving through gap junctions, we found strong suppression of LFP power at higher frequencies. There were frequency-dependent differences in the spike phase associated with the LFP, depending on whether inputs arrived through gap junctions or chemical synapses. LFP differences across all input types were mediated by the relative dominance of synaptic currents vs. voltage-driven transmembrane currents with chemical synapses vs. gap junctions, respectively. Implications: Our analyses unveil a prominent role for gap junctional connections in shaping the spatiotemporal and spectral profiles of extracellular potentials, with critical implications for polarities and spatial spread of LFPs. The stark dichotomies in extracellular signatures associated with gap junctional vs. chemical synaptic inputs imply that conclusions could be erroneous if cells were incorrectly assumed to be exclusively receiving chemical synaptic inputs.

	<p>Neuroscience has revolved around brain structural changes, functional activity, and connectivity alteration in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD); however, how the network topology organization becomes altered is still unclear, specifically in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s patients with severe hyposmia. In this study, we have examined the functional network topological alteration in patients affected by Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease with normal cognitive ability (ODN), Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease with severe hyposmia (ODP), and healthy controls (HCs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data. We have analyzed brain topological organization using popular graph measures such as network segregation (clustering coefficient, modularity), network integration (participation coefficient, path length), small-worldness, efficiency, centrality, and assortativity. Then, we used a feature ranking approach based on the diagonal adaptation of neighborhood component analysis, aiming to determine a graph measure that is sensitive enough to distinguish between these three different groups. We noted significantly lower segregation and local efficiency and small-worldness in ODP compared to ODN and HCs. On the contrary, we did not find differences in network integration in ODP compared to ODN and HCs, which indicates that the brain network becomes fragmented in ODP. At the brain network level, a progressive increase in the DMN (Default Mode Network) was observed from healthy controls to ODN to ODP, and a continuous decrease in the cingulo-opercular network was observed from healthy controls to ODN to ODP. Further, the feature ranking approach has shown that the whole-brain clustering coefficient and small-worldness are sensitive measures to classify ODP vs. ODN, as well as HCs. Looking at the brain regional network segregation, we have found that the cerebellum and limbic, fronto-parietal, and occipital lobes have higher ODP reductions than ODN and HCs. Our results suggest network topological measures, specifically whole-brain segregation and small-worldness decreases. At the network level, an increase in DMN and a decrease in the cingulo-opercular network could be used as biomarkers to characterize ODN and ODP.</p>

	<p>This research on sleep disturbances emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study investigated the association between self-reported sleep disturbances among teleworkers and the preventive measures employers took to improve their working environment. Answers obtained via a web survey gathered from 1086 teleworkers (517 in the spring of 2021 and 569 in the spring of 2022) were analysed. The odds of self-reported sleep disturbances were significantly higher for all preventive measures in the group of respondents reporting a lack of a particular measure. The highest odds ratios were observed for the statement &amp;amp;ldquo;My employer identified conditions where I am teleworking&amp;amp;rdquo; (adjusted OR = 2.98, 95% CI 2.10&amp;amp;ndash;4.23) and &amp;amp;ldquo;Online team-building events were organised&amp;amp;rdquo; (adjusted OR = 2.85, 95% CI 1.88&amp;amp;ndash;4.35). The results of our study have revealed that workplace interventions that serve as a mediator for sleep disorders, even if they are not directly targeted at managing sleep disturbances or stress, can reduce the number of teleworkers reporting sleep disturbances. According to our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the effectiveness of employer interventions that help teleworkers manage their sleep disturbances.</p>

	<p>Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric disorder severely affecting patients&amp;amp;rsquo; functioning and quality of life. Unlike positive symptoms, cognitive impairment and negative symptoms cannot be treated pharmacologically and represent consistent predictors of the illness&amp;amp;rsquo;s prognosis. Cognitive remediation (CR) interventions have been applied to target these symptoms. Brain stimulation also provides promising yet preliminary results in reducing negative symptoms, whereas its effect on cognitive impairment remains heterogeneous. Here, we combined intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) with CR to improve negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia spectrum patients. One hundred eligible patients were invited, and twenty-one participated. We randomized them into four groups, manipulating the stimulation condition (real vs. sham) and CR (no training vs. training). We delivered fifteen iTBS sessions over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for three weeks, followed (or not) by 50 min of training. Consensus-based clinical and cognitive assessment was administered at baseline and after the treatment, plus at three follow-ups occurring one, three, and six months after the intervention. Mixed-model analyses were run on cognitive and negative symptom scores. The preliminary findings highlighted a marginal modulation of iTBS on negative symptoms, whereas CR improved isolated cognitive functions. We herein discuss the limitations and strengths of the methodological approach.</p>

">Organizational principles of the primate cerebral cortex at the single-cell level</a></h4>

              
                The primate cerebral cortex, the major organ for cognition, consists of an immense number of neurons. However, the organizational principles governing these neurons remain unclear. By accessing the single-cell spatial transcriptome of over 25 million neuron cells across the entire macaque cortex, we discovered that the distribution of neurons within cortical layers is highly non-random. Strikingly, over three-quarters of these neurons are located in distinct neuronal clusters. Within these clusters, different cell types tend to collaborate rather than function independently. Typically, excitatory neuron clusters mainly consist of excitatory-excitatory combinations, while inhibitory clusters primarily contain excitatory-inhibitory combinations. Both cluster types have roughly equal numbers of neurons in each layer. Importantly, most excitatory and inhibitory neuron clusters form spatial partnerships, indicating a balanced local neuronal network and correlating with specific functional regions. These findings suggest that different brain regions of the primate cortex may exhibit similar mechanisms at the neuronal population level.

">Inhibitory neurons defined by a synaptogenic molecule impair memory discrimination</a></h4>

              
                The CA3 region is central to hippocampal function during learning and memory because of its unique connectivity. CA3 pyramidal neurons are the targets of huge, excitatory mossy fiber synapses from DG axons and have an unusually high degree of excitatory recurrent connectivity. Thus, inhibition likely plays an outsized importance in constraining runaway excitation and shaping CA3 ensembles during learning and memory. Here, we investigate the function of a group of dendrite-targeting, hippocampal GABAergic neurons defined by expression of the synaptogenic adhesion molecule, Kirrel3. We discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABAergic neurons impairs memory discrimination by inhibiting CA3 pyramidal neurons in novel contexts. Kirrel3 is required for DG-to-GABA synapse formation and variants in Kirrel3 are strong risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, our work suggests that Kirrel3-GABA neurons are a critical source of feed-forward inhibition from DG to CA3 during contextual memory whose activity may be specifically disrupted in some brain disorders.

">Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging of White Matter in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Multiple studies point to the role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SCZ), however, there have been few in vivo tools for imaging brain inflammation. Diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) is an advanced diffusion-based MRI method developed to quantitatively assess microstructural alternations relating to neuroinflammation, axonal fiber, and other white matter (WM) pathologies. Methods: We acquired one-hour-long high-directional diffusion MRI data from young control (CON, n =27), schizophrenia (SCZ, n =21), and bipolar disorder (BPD, n =21) participants aged 18-30. We applied Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to allow whole-brain WM analyses and compare DBSI-derived isotropic and anisotropic diffusion measures between groups. Clinical relationships of DBSI metrics with clinical symptoms were assessed across SCZ and control participants. Results: In SCZ participants, we found a generalized increase in DBSI-derived cellularity (a putative marker of neuroinflammation), a decrease in restricted fiber fraction (a putative marker of apparent axonal density), and an increase in extra-axonal water (a putative marker of vasogenic edema) across several WM tracts. There were only minimal WM abnormalities noted in BPD, mainly in regions of the corpus callosum (increase in DTI-derived RD and extra-axonal water). DBSI metrics showed significant partial correlations with psychosis and mood symptoms across groups. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that SCZ involves generalized white matter neuroinflammation, decreased fiber density, and demyelination, which is not seen in bipolar disorder. Larger studies are needed to identify medication-related effects. DBSI metrics could help identify high-risk groups requiring early interventions to prevent the onset of psychosis and improve outcomes.

">Valence and Salience Encoding in the Central Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The central amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an important brain region for regulating both negative (fear and anxiety) and positive (reward) affective behaviors. The CeA has been proposed to encode affective information in the form of valence (whether the stimulus is good or bad) or salience (how significant is the stimulus), but the extent to which these two types of stimulus representation occur in the CeA is not known. Here, we used single cell calcium imaging in mice during appetitive and aversive conditioning and found that majority of CeA neurons (~65%) encode the valence of the unconditioned stimulus (US) with a smaller subset of cells (~15%) encoding the salience of the US. Valence and salience encoding of the conditioned stimulus (CS) was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent. These findings show that the CeA is a site of convergence for encoding oppositely valenced US information.

                Caveolins are a family of transmembrane proteins located in caveolae, small lipid raft invaginations of the plasma membrane. The roles of caveolin-enriched lipid rafts are diverse, and include mechano-protection, lipid homeostasis, metabolism, transport, and cell signaling. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and other caveolins were described in endothelial cells and later in various other cell types of the central nervous system (CNS), including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and pericytes. This pancellular presence of caveolins demands a better understanding of their functional roles in each cell type. In this review we describe the various functions of Cav-1 in the cells of normal and pathological brains. Several emerging preclinical findings suggest that Cav-1 could represent a potential therapeutic target in brain disorders.

">Concurrent optogenetic motor mapping of multiple limbs in awake mice reveals cortical organization of coordinated movements</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motor mapping allows for determining the macroscopic organization of motor circuits and corresponding motor movement representations on the cortex. Techniques such as intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) are robust, but can be time consuming and invasive, making them non-ideal for cortex-wide mapping or longitudinal studies. In contrast, optogenetic motor mapping offers a rapid and minimally invasive technique, enabling mapping with high spatiotemporal resolution. However, motor mapping has seen limited use in tracking 3-dimensonal, multi-limb movements in awake animals. This gap has left open questions regarding the underlying organizational principles of motor control of coordinated, ethologically relevant movements involving multiple limbs. Objective: Our first objective was to develop Multi-limb Optogenetic Motor Mapping (MOMM) to concurrently map motor movement representations of multiple limbs with high fidelity in awake mice. Having established MOMM, our next objective was determine whether maps of coordinated and ethologically relevant motor output were topographically organized on the cortex. Methods: We combine optogenetic stimulation with a deep learning driven pose-estimation toolbox, DeepLabCut (DLC), and 3-dimentional triangulation to concurrently map motor movements of multiple limbs in awake mice. Results: MOMM consistently revealed cortical topographies for all mapped features within and across mice. Many motor maps overlapped and were topographically similar. Several motor movement representations extended beyond cytoarchitecturally defined somatomotor cortex. Finer articulations of the forepaw resided within gross motor movement representations of the forelimb. Moreover, many cortical sites exhibited concurrent limb coactivation when photostimulated, prompting the identification of several cortical regions harboring coordinated and ethologically relevant movements. Conclusions: The cortex appears to be topographically organized by motor programs, which are responsible for coordinated, multi-limbed, and behavioral-like movements.

">Developmental encoding of ultrasound vocalizations in the mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Mice communicate through high-frequency ultrasound vocalizations (USVs), which are crucial for social interactions such as courtship and aggression. Although USV representation has been found in adult brain areas along the auditory pathway, including the auditory cortex (ACx), no evidence is available on the neuronal representation of USVs early in life. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, we analyzed ACx layer 2/3 neuronal responses to USVs, pure tones (4-90 kHz), and high-frequency modulated sweeps from postnatal day 12 (P12) to P21. We found that ACx neurons are tuned to respond to USV syllables as early as P12-P13, with an increasing number of responsive cells as the mouse age. By P14, while pure tone responses showed a frequency preference, no syllable preference was observed. Additionally, at P14, USVs, pure tones, and modulated sweeps activate clusters of largely non-overlapping responsive neurons. Finally, we show that while cell correlation decreases with increasing processing of peripheral auditory stimuli, neurons responding to the same stimulus maintain highly correlated spontaneous activity after circuits have attained mature organization, forming neuronal sub-networks sharing similar functional properties.

">Altered cortico-cerebellar connectivity in cerebellar degeneration patients improves with motor training</a></h4>

              
                People with cerebellar degeneration show characteristic ataxic motor impairments. In the early stages of degeneration they can still improve motor function with sensorimotor training. Yet, how such training affects functional brain networks affected by cerebellar degeneration is unknown. We here investigated neuroplastic changes in the cortico-cerebellar network after a five-day forearm movement training in 40 patients with mild to severe cerebellar degeneration and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants were assigned to one of four motor training conditions, varying online visual feedback and explicit verbal feedback. Anatomical and resting-state fMRI was collected on the days before and after training. To overcome the limitations of standard brain templates that fail in the presence of severe anatomical abnormalities, we developed a specific template for comparing cerebellar patients with age-matched controls. Our new template reduced the spatial spread of cerebellar anatomical landmarks by 30% relative to existing templates and tripled fMRI noise classification accuracy. Using this pipeline, we found that patients showed impaired connectivity between cerebellar motor regions and neocortical visuomotor and premotor regions at baseline compared to controls, whereas their cortico-cortico connectivity remained intact. Training with vision strengthened connectivity in the cortico-cerebellar visuomotor network contralateral to the trained arm in all participants. Cerebellar patients exhibited additional increased connectivity ipsilateral to the training arm in this network. Further, training with explicit verbal feedback facilitated connectivity between a cerebellar cognitive region and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that motor training in cerebellar degeneration leads to enhanced functional connectivity of the cortico-cerebellar network.

                Introduction Mitochondria are cell organelles that function as the cell’s main power plant, producing ATP, the main energy molecule in cells. Mitochondria play an important role in the context of neuroprotection, and mitochondrial function has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent research in the field of neuroprotection has focused on the development of therapies that target mitochondria. Natural ingredients have long been used in traditional medicine and show potential as neuroprotective agents. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords natural agents, herb*, neuroprotective, and mitochondria. The data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results The research trend found are documents by year, most global cited document, most relevant sources, A factorial map illustrating the leading contributors of papers, documents by author, documents by country or territory, documents by subject area, network visualization, overlay visualization of scopus database using vosviewer, density visualization, thematic map, thematic evolution, cluster analysis, qualitative analysis, and word cloud. Conclusions Natural Agent Neurotropik is a natural substance that influences the brain’s nervous system and peripheral nervous system, enhancing cognition, mood, and brain function. Derived from herbs, spices, and herbal products, it has advantages over other natural agents in energy production, brain biogenesis, and neuroprotection.

                <p>CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing represents an exciting avenue to study genes of unknown function and can be combined with genetically encoded tools such as fluorescent proteins, channelrhodopsins, DREADDs, and various biosensors to more deeply probe the function of these genes in different cell types. However, current strategies to also manipulate or visualize edited cells are challenging due to the large size of Cas9 proteins and the limited packaging capacity of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). To overcome these constraints, we developed an alternative gene editing strategy using a single AAV vector and mouse lines that express Cre-dependent Cas9 to achieve efficient cell-type specific editing across the nervous system. Expressing Cre-dependent Cas9 from a genomic locus affords space to package guide RNAs for gene editing together with Cre-dependent, genetically encoded tools to manipulate, map, or monitor neurons using a single virus. We validated this strategy with three common tools in neuroscience: ChRonos, a channelrhodopsin, for studying synaptic transmission using optogenetics, GCaMP8f for recording Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients using photometry, and mCherry for tracing axonal projections. We tested these tools in multiple brain regions and cell types, including GABAergic neurons in the nucleus accumbens, glutamatergic neurons projecting from the ventral pallidum to the lateral habenula, dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, and proprioceptive neurons in the periphery. This flexible approach could help identify and test the function of novel genes affecting synaptic transmission, circuit activity, or morphology with a single viral injection.</p>

                <p>Previous studies have shown that ligands that bind to sigma-2 receptor/TMEM97 (s<SUB>2</SUB>R/TMEM97), a transmembrane protein, have anxiolytic/antidepressant-like properties and relieve neuropathic pain-like effects in rodents. Despite medical interest in s<SUB>2</SUB>R/TMEM97, little affective and pain behavioral characterization has been done using transgenic mice, which limits the development of s<SUB>2</SUB>R/TMEM97 as a viable therapeutic target. Using wild-type (WT) and global <I>Tmem97</I> knock-out (KO) mice, we sought to identify the contribution of <I>Tmem97</I> in modulating affective and pain-like behaviors using a battery of affective and pain assays, including open field, light/dark preference, elevated plus maze, forced swim test, tail suspension test, and the mechanical sensitivity tests. Our results demonstrate that female <I>Tmem97</I> KO mice show less anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in light/dark preference and tail suspension tests but not in an open field, elevated plus maze, and forced swim tests at baseline. We next performed spared nerve injury in WT and <I>Tmem97</I> KO mice to assess the role of <I>Tmem97</I> in neuropathic pain-induced anxiety and depression. WT mice, but not <I>Tmem97</I> KO mice, developed a prolonged neuropathic pain-induced depressive-like phenotype when tested 10&nbsp;weeks after nerve injury in females. Our results show that <I>Tmem97</I> plays a role in modulating anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in naive animals with a significant change in the presence of nerve injury in female mice. Overall, these data demonstrate that <I>Tmem97</I> could be a target to alleviate affective comorbidities of pain disorders.</p>

                Background This study seeks to examine the causal link between financial deepening, national security, ecological footprint, and economic growth in Nigeria, in order to contribute to the contradicting evidence on economic growth drivers. Methods The dynamic ARDL model was employed as the baseline model to establish the link between the phenomena, and the FMOLS and DOLS as robust models using time series data spanning from 1995 to 2022. The FMOLS and DOLS models take into consideration the presence of endogeneity, cross-sectional dependency, and heterogeneity. Results The results demonstrate that whereas ecological footprint has positive and significant long-term relationships with economic growth, financial deepening and national security have negative and significant long-run relationships with economic growth. There was a 34% and 50% correction to the short-term to long-term adjustment speed, respectively. The findings of the Granger causality, interaction terms, marginal (ME), and threshold (TH) effects demonstrate: a) a significant bidirectional causal relationship between national security and economic growth, as well as a one-way significant causal link between financial deepening and economic growth; b) changes in national security and ecological footprint have a significant and negative impact on the financial deepening effect on economic growth; c) significant negative and marginal effects of national security on economic growth, as well as significant positive marginal effects of ecological footprints on economic growth; and d) the impact of financial deepening on economic growth becomes apparent when the increases in the marginal effect of the ecological footprint reach a critical limit over the ( TH CO 2 = 0.981) threshold. Conclusions This study highlights the significant link between Nigeria’s financial deepening, national security, ecological footprint, and economic growth. It recommends that viable policies be put in place to support the development of financial institutions, increasing security infrastructure investment, and promoting renewable energy use for sustainable environment and reduced carbon emissions.

                Background: The microbiota in the intestine is made up of trillions of living bacteria that coexist with the host. Administration of antibiotics during neonatal infection causes depletion of gut flora resulting in gut dysbiosis. Over the last few decades, probiotics have been created and promoted as microbiota management agents to enrich gut flora. Probiotics decrease the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria in the gut of preterm neonates, reducing the frequency of nosocomial infections in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICUs). Methods: The systematic review will include randomized control trials (RCTs) of premier neonates with sepsis. Studies will be retrieved from global databases like Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL Plus via EBSCO host, MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Ovid, Web of Science, ProQuest Medical Library, Microsoft academic, and DOAJ by utilizing database-specific keywords. Screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal of included research will be carried out separately by two review writers. Findings will be reported in accordance with the PRISMS-P 2020 guidelines. Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review will help to translate the evidence-based information needed to encourage the implementation of potential research output in the field of neonatal intensive care, guide best clinical practise, assist policy making and implementation to prevent gut dysbiosis in neonates with sepsis by summarising and communicating the evidence on the topic. PROSPERO registration number: This systematic review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) on 10th March 2022. The registration number is CRD42022315980.

                The 2020 world population data sheet indicates that world population is projected to increase from 7.8 billion in 2020 to 9.9 billion by 2050 (Increase of more than 25%). Due to the expected growth in human population, the demand for meats that could improve health status and provide therapeutic benefits is also projected to rise. The dromedary also known as the Arabian camel, or one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius), a pseudo ruminant adapted to arid climates, has physiological, biological and metabolic characteristics which give it a legendary reputation for surviving in the extreme conditions of desert environments considered restrictive for other ruminants. Camel meat is an ethnic food consumed across the arid regions of Middle East, North-East Africa, Australia and China. For these medicinal and nutritional benefits, camel meat can be a great option for sustainable meat worldwide supply. A considerable amount of literature has been published on technological aspects and quality properties of beef, lamb and pork but the information available on the technological aspects of the meat of the one humped camel is very limited. Camels are usually raised in less developed countries and their meat is as nutritionally good as any other traditional meat source. Its quality also depends on the breed, sex, age, breeding conditions and type of muscle consumed. A compilation of existing literature related to new technological advances in packaging, shelf-life and quality of camel meat has not been reviewed to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, this review attempts to explore the nutritional composition, health benefits of camel meat, as well as various technological and processing interventions to improve its quality and consumer acceptance. This review will be helpful for camel sector and highlight the potential for global marketability of camel meat and to generate value added products.

Cognitive disorders, including Down syndrome (DS), present significant morphological alterations in neuron architectural complexity. However, the relationship between neuromorphological alterations and impaired brain function is not fully understood. To address this gap, we propose a novel computational model that accounts for the observed cell deformations in DS. The model consists of a cross-sectional layer of the mouse motor cortex, composed of 3000 neurons. The network connectivity is obtained by accounting explicitly for two single-neuron morphological parameters: the mean dendritic tree radius and the spine density in excitatory pyramidal cells. We obtained these values by fitting reconstructed neuron data corresponding to three mouse models: wild-type (WT), transgenic (TgDyrk1A), and trisomic (Ts65Dn). Our findings reveal a dynamic interplay between pyramidal and fast-spiking interneurons leading to the emergence of gamma activity (∼40 Hz). In the DS models this gamma activity is diminished, corroborating experimental observations and validating our computational methodology. We further explore the impact of disrupted excitation-inhibition balance by mimicking the reduction recurrent inhibition present in DS. In this case, gamma power exhibits variable responses as a function of the external input to the network. Finally, we perform a numerical exploration of the morphological parameter space, unveiling the direct influence of each structural parameter on gamma frequency and power. Our research demonstrates a clear link between changes in morphology and the disruption of gamma oscillations in DS. This work underscores the potential of computational modeling to elucidate the relationship between neuron architecture and brain function, and ultimately improve our understanding of cognitive disorders.

The practical application of new single molecule protein sequencing (SMPS) technologies requires accurate estimates of their associated sequencing error rates. Here, we describe the development and application of two distinct parameter estimation methods for analyzing SMPS reads produced by fluorosequencing. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based approach, extends whatprot, where we previously used HMMs for SMPS peptide-read matching. This extension offers a principled approach for estimating key parameters for fluorosequencing experiments, including missed amino acid cleavages, dye loss, and peptide detachment. Specifically, we adapted the Baum-Welch algorithm, a standard technique to estimate transition probabilities for an HMM using expectation maximization, but modified here to estimate a small number of parameter values directly rather than estimating every transition probability independently. We demonstrate a high degree of accuracy on simulated data, but on experimental datasets, we observed that the model needed to be augmented with an additional error type, N-terminal blocking. This, in combination with data pre-processing, results in reasonable parameterizations of experimental datasets that agree with controlled experimental perturbations. A second independent implementation using a hybrid of DIRECT and Powell’s method to reduce the root mean squared error (RMSE) between simulations and the real dataset was also developed. We compare these methods on both simulated and real data, finding that our Baum-Welch based approach outperforms DIRECT and Powell’s method by most, but not all, criteria. Although some discrepancies between the results exist, we also find that both approaches provide similar error rate estimates from experimental single molecule fluorosequencing datasets.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012246">Nonlinear fusion is optimal for a wide class of multisensory tasks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marcus Ghosh, Gabriel Béna, Volker Bormuth, Dan F. M. Goodman</p>

Animals continuously detect information via multiple sensory channels, like vision and hearing, and integrate these signals to realise faster and more accurate decisions; a fundamental neural computation known as multisensory integration. A widespread view of this process is that multimodal neurons linearly fuse information across sensory channels. However, does linear fusion generalise beyond the classical tasks used to explore multisensory integration? Here, we develop novel multisensory tasks, which focus on the underlying statistical relationships between channels, and deploy models at three levels of abstraction: from probabilistic ideal observers to artificial and spiking neural networks. Using these models, we demonstrate that when the information provided by different channels is not independent, linear fusion performs sub-optimally and even fails in extreme cases. This leads us to propose a simple nonlinear algorithm for multisensory integration which is compatible with our current knowledge of multimodal circuits, excels in naturalistic settings and is optimal for a wide class of multisensory tasks. Thus, our work emphasises the role of nonlinear fusion in multisensory integration, and provides testable hypotheses for the field to explore at multiple levels: from single neurons to behaviour.

                <p>by Xun Fu, Jack Withers, Juri A. Miyamae, Talia Y. Moore</p>

Computational models of musculoskeletal systems are essential tools for understanding how muscles, tendons, bones, and actuation signals generate motion. In particular, the OpenSim family of models has facilitated a wide range of studies on diverse human motions, clinical studies of gait, and even non-human locomotion. However, biological structures with many joints, such as fingers, necks, tails, and spines, have been a longstanding challenge to the OpenSim modeling community, especially because these structures comprise numerous bones and are frequently actuated by extrinsic muscles that span multiple joints—often more than three—and act through a complex network of branching tendons. Existing model building software, typically optimized for limb structures, makes it difficult to build OpenSim models that accurately reflect these intricacies. Here, we introduce ArborSim, customized software that efficiently creates musculoskeletal models of highly jointed structures and can build branched muscle-tendon architectures. We used ArborSim to construct toy models of articulated structures to determine which morphological features make a structure most sensitive to branching. By comparing the joint kinematics of models constructed with branched and parallel muscle-tendon units, we found that among various parameters—the number of tendon branches, the number of joints between branches, and the ratio of muscle fiber length to muscle tendon unit length—the number of tendon branches and the number of joints between branches are most sensitive to branching modeling method. Notably, the differences between these models showed no predictable pattern with increased complexity. As the proportion of muscle increased, the kinematic differences between branched and parallel models units also increased. Our findings suggest that stress and strain interactions between distal tendon branches and proximal tendon and muscle greatly affect the overall kinematics of a musculoskeletal system. By incorporating complex muscle-tendon branching into OpenSim models using ArborSim, we can gain deeper insight into the interactions between the axial and appendicular skeleton, model the evolution and function of diverse animal tails, and understand the mechanics of more complex motions and tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012228">Joint modeling of choices and reaction times based on Bayesian contextual behavioral control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah Schwöbel, Dimitrije Marković, Michael N. Smolka, Stefan Kiebel</p>

In cognitive neuroscience and psychology, reaction times are an important behavioral measure. However, in instrumental learning and goal-directed decision making experiments, findings often rely only on choice probabilities from a value-based model, instead of reaction times. Recent advancements have shown that it is possible to connect value-based decision models with reaction time models. However, typically these models do not provide an integrated account of both value-based choices and reaction times, but simply link two types of models. Here, we propose a novel integrative joint model of both choices and reaction times by combining a computational account of Bayesian sequential decision making with a sampling procedure. This allows us to describe how internal uncertainty in the planning process shapes reaction time distributions. Specifically, we use a recent context-specific Bayesian forward planning model which we extend by a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to obtain both choices and reaction times. As we will show this makes the sampler an integral part of the decision making process and enables us to reproduce, using simulations, well-known experimental findings in value based-decision making as well as classical inhibition and switching tasks. Specifically, we use the proposed model to explain both choice behavior and reaction times in instrumental learning and automatized behavior, in the Eriksen flanker task and in task switching. These findings show that the proposed joint behavioral model may describe common underlying processes in these different decision making paradigms.

                <p>by Robyn M. Stuart, Jamie A. Cohen, Cliff C. Kerr, Prashant Mathur, National Disease Modelling Consortium of India , Romesh G. Abeysuriya, Marita Zimmermann, Darcy W. Rao, Mariah C. Boudreau, Serin Lee, Luojun Yang, Daniel J. Klein</p>

In 2020, the WHO launched its first global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer, outlining an ambitious set of targets for countries to achieve over the next decade. At the same time, new tools, technologies, and strategies are in the pipeline that may improve screening performance, expand the reach of prophylactic vaccines, and prevent the acquisition, persistence and progression of oncogenic HPV. Detailed mechanistic modelling can help identify the combinations of current and future strategies to combat cervical cancer. Open-source modelling tools are needed to shift the capacity for such evaluations in-country. Here, we introduce the Human papillomavirus simulator (HPVsim), a new open-source software package for creating flexible agent-based models parameterised with country-specific vital dynamics, structured sexual networks, and co-transmitting HPV genotypes. HPVsim includes a novel methodology for modelling cervical disease progression, designed to be readily adaptable to new forms of screening. The software itself is implemented in Python, has built-in tools for simulating commonly-used interventions, includes a comprehensive set of tests and documentation, and runs quickly (seconds to minutes) on a laptop. Performance is greatly enhanced by HPVsim’s multi-scale modelling functionality. HPVsim is open source under the MIT License and available via both the Python Package Index (via pip install) and GitHub (hpvsim.org).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The physiological aging process is well known for functional decline in visual abilities. Among the components of the visual system, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (DLG) and superior colliculus (SC) provide a good model for aging investigations, as these structures constitute the main visual pathways for retinal inputs reaching the visual cortex. However, there are limited data available on quantitative morphological and neurochemical aspects in DLG and SC across lifespan. Here, we used optical density to determine immunoexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and design-based stereological probes to estimate the neuronal number, total volume, and layer volume of the DLG and SC in marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), ranging from 36 to 143 months of age. Our results revealed an age-related increase in total volume and layer volume of the DLG, with an overall stability in SC volume. Furthermore, a stable neuronal number was demonstrated in DLG and superficial layers of SC (SCv). A decrease in GFAP immunoexpression was observed in both visual centers. The results indicate region-specific variability in volumetric parameter, possibly attributed to structural plastic events in response to inflammation and compensatory mechanisms at the cellular and subcellular level. Additionally, the DLG and SCv seem to be less vulnerable to aging effects in terms of neuronal number. The neuropeptidergic data suggest that reduced GFAP expression may reflect morphological atrophy in the astroglial cells. This study contributes to updating the current understanding of aging effects in the visual system and stablishes a crucial foundation for future research on visual perception throughout the aging process.</p>

                Background As a post-COVID complication in children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is important because of its varied and life-threatening manifestations. With this background, this study attempts to focus on MIS-C cases in an underprivileged rural setting in north-eastern India, with most patients being treated with methylprednisolone rather than intravenous immunoglobulin due to financial constraints. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study at MGM Medical College, 27 MIS-C cases diagnosed following WHO criteria were included. Laboratory and radiological investigations, including echocardiography, were performed as required for diagnosis and to assess prognosis. Most patients were treated with methylprednisolone. A follow-up assessment was done six weeks after discharge for any residual impairment. Results The most frequently affected age group was 5–10 years (59.28%), while respiratory (48.14%) and cardiac (40.74%) were the most commonly involved systems. Logistic regression studies established a significant association between serum ferritin level and prolonged hospital stay (coefficient 0.0674, p=0.0041), possibly due to greater complications in cases with high ferritin levels. Organ impairment was found to increase the need for inotrope use (coefficient 3.8797, p=0.00584). Most cases were treated with methylprednisolone alone (85.18%) with a favourable response and no death occurred. Conclusion The favourable response in cases treated with methylprednisolone only affirms the effectiveness of the drug as a cheaper alternative in a resource-poor setting. The study highlights that higher ferritin levels in complicated cases leads to prolonged hospitalisation and the increased need for inotropes in cases with organ impairment.

                Background It is important and challenging to distinguish between acute myocardial infarction and Wellens syndrome due to its time to intervention. Difficulties in differentiating between subtypes could mean the patients are overtreated or receive undertreatment. Case report A 57-year-old man was referred to our emergency ward with acute onset of chest pain. Electrocardiograms changes were suggestive of type A Wellens syndrome. Nitroglycerin was administrated, the patient's chest pain disappeared, and we planned an early invasive strategy. He had a previous documented electrocardiogram before he went for catheterization and based on the second electrocardiogram changes were suggestive of an ST-elevation. As the result of the invasive strategy, it was found that there was single-vessel disease, critical occlusion in the middle of the left anterior descending artery coronary artery with collateral from the right coronary artery. After two days of observation in the Intensive Cardiovascular Care Unit, the patient improved and was transferred to Low Care Unit. Conclusions The case highlights Wellens syndrome in acute critical occlusion with collateral artery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-302/v3?src=rss">Efficacy of Lycium barbarum (Goji berry) mouthwash for managing periodontitis: a randomized clinical trial [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Removal of the microbial deposits (plaque and calculus) by performing effective scaling and root planing (SRP) is the fundamental step for managing periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). Various adjuncts in the form of mouthwash, gels, and toothpaste are also being used as adjuncts to SRP for managing periodontitis. Recently, Lycium barbarum (L. barbarum), commonly known as goji berry or wolfberry, has gained popularity for managing chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, its efficacy in managing periodontitis has never been explored. Hence the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of goji berry mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash for managing periodontitis. Methods 60 adult participants were divided randomly using computer-generated random sequences into two groups (case group: L. barbarum mouthwash (Males: 16; Female: 14); control group: 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (Males: 14; Females: 16)). The changes in the gingival index (Gi), plaque index (Pi), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), microbial load, and antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were noted at the baseline, at 15 days and one month. Results A significant reduction in the mean PPD, Pi, and Gi was seen from baseline to one month in both the control (P-value=0.006, 0.027, and 0.036 respectively) and test groups (P-value=0.035, 0.000, and 0.000 respectively). CAL was reduced significantly only in the control group. However, the antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were significantly increased only in the test group. Conclusion Goji berry mouthwash along with SRP reduced the Gi, Pi, BOP, and PPD in patients with periodontitis. However, no statistically significant difference was noted between the use of goji berry and chlorhexidine mouthwash. Goji berry mouthwash was more effective than chlorhexidine in increasing the antioxidant levels in saliva.

                Background The goal of eliminating tuberculosis has not yet shown a bright spot. Specifically for HIV patients (PLHIV), WHO has made it a special category as a pillar for eliminating tuberculosis. The tuberculosis screening has not yet reached the national target because it is carried out manually by health workers, requiring optimization following technological developments. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of tuberculosis case finding using a self-assessment paradigm in HIV patients. Methods This research was cross-sectional. The data obtained from HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application for 3 months each was analyzed using the compare mean independent t-test. Then the Chi-squared test was carried out on the E-TIBI screening characteristic variables. Result In total, there were 921 respondents with 148 (16%) presumptive TB. It was found that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in the number of presumptive TB cases found in HIV patients before and after using the E-TIBI application. The person with presumptive TB showed 20 of 24 characteristic variables that were statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion E-TIBI can increase the tuberculosis case finding in HIV patients so it has the potential to be implemented as a screening tool in the PLHIV community.

                Background Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) stands as the third most fatal malignancy worldwide, accounting for over 830,000 fatalities annually. This pressing concern has spurred extensive research into potential early diagnostic biomarkers, with a particular focus on the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in recognizing angiogenesis within HCC. VEGF offers an intricate insight into the angiogenic processes, among its multifaceted advantages. Methods We systematically curated articles from PubMed and Epistemonikos, concentrating on the determination of VEGF’s diagnostic cutoff value, sensitivity, and specificity for HCC. Employing the PRISMA 2020 flowchart, we meticulously delineated the process of article selection. Results In total, our review encompasses nine studies, encompassing 576 HCC patients, subject to qualitative analysis. The collective findings indicate that the specificity of VEGF outweighs its sensitivity, indicating its aptitude in distinguishing HCC from both a healthy population and other high-risk conditions, most notably in comparison with these high-risk conditions. Specificity holds pivotal significance as a preferred parameter for a screening test, endorsing the prospective utility of VEGF in HCC screening. Conclusions For individuals, especially those within the normal alpha-fetoprotein range, VEGF may serve as a viable alternative for HCC screening, facilitating the differentiation of this condition from other high-risk conditions.

                Multimorbidity and the associated consumption of multiple medications are common among the older population, posing a significant health concern. This leads to an increased incidence of side effects, adverse drug reactions, and higher healthcare costs for the individual, their family, and the country’s overall healthcare expenditure. Older adults experience complications due to the natural aging process and polypharmacy. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables of medications play a crucial role in their recovery and overall health. While many studies have highlighted the rising incidence of multimorbidity among older adults, they often overlook the importance of optimizing medication therapy to reduce complications, side effects, adverse drug reactions, falls, and improve medication adherence. This narrative review focuses on the impact of polypharmacy on older adults, age-related pharmacokinetic changes, pharmacodynamics in this population, and various methods to optimize pharmacotherapy. The findings of this review aim to provide healthcare providers with a better understanding of how to optimize pharmacotherapies and reduce drug-related complications in older adults.

                Background Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in resource-limited countries relies primarily on bacteriological confirmation using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain or culture. However, this method has low sensitivity due to suboptimal sampling and techniques. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes are crucial in the pathogenesis of granulomatous inflammation and immune reactions. We investigated the usefulness of the haematological parameters and their ratios, like the Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Monocyte to Lymphocyte ratio (MLR), for diagnosing tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively grouped 114 patients with fever into those diagnosed with TB and control groups. We obtained their haematological data and calculated their derived ratios. The ratios obtained from the two groups were compared. Their sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results Haematological parameters like MLR were higher in TB patients than in the control group. Although NLR was not significantly increased, MLR was significantly increased with p values <0.05. These tests had low sensitivity but high specificity. Conclusion Serum NLR and MLR emerge as valuable tools in TB diagnosis. Their simplicity and cost-effectiveness render them particularly suitable for screening and recurrence monitoring in rural and remote settings, thereby mitigating loss to follow-up.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-746/v1?src=rss">Planet activeness: a new concept to enhance the accuracy of Astromet weather forecast. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Astrometeorology is an ancient science, that deals the relationship between planet position and weather events. Several Indian studies proved that Astrometeorology could be a complementary method to improve numerical weather forecast accuracy. Since 2011, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University is conducting astrometeorological research and devised a novel concept “Planet Activeness Chart”. The principle is that “planets’ influence on a location’s weather varies throughout the day and may be negative, inactive, active, highly active and rule depending on their angle to that location”. Most existing astromet studies used planetary position to predict the occurrence of weather events (yes/no) but failed to capture intensity of the event. The “Planet Activeness Concept” could address this limitation and enhance forecast usability. Methods A study was carried out from 2018 to 2021 with six years data (2011-16) to verify the “Planet activeness” on hourly rainfall and windspeed events in Tamil Nadu. The frequency of planet activeness for a weather event was calculated by dividing the number of times a planet was in the selected activeness during a specific event category by the total number of events. Results The results indicated that negative state of the Sun, active status of the Saturn, Uranus, Venus and Moon were positively associated with rainfall intensity. The windy planet Mercury and Neptune at active state, the Sun and Saturn at rule state, Venus and Uranus at negative state, Jupiter at highly active state had significant influence on the increased wind speed. Conclusion Applying the planet activeness concept with azimuth could enhance the accuracy and usability of Astrometeorological forecasts. This study establishes a mathematical relationship between planet activeness and weather as a first step to understand the science behind this relationship. It is suggested to study different combination of planet activeness during a weather event for more insights.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89292">Nucleotide binding to the ATP-cone in anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases allosterically regulates activity by modulating substrate binding</a></h4>

              
                A small, nucleotide-binding domain, the ATP-cone, is found at the N-terminus of most ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalytic subunits. By binding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) it regulates the enzyme activity of all classes of RNR. Functional and structural work on aerobic RNRs has revealed a plethora of ways in which dATP inhibits activity by inducing oligomerisation and preventing a productive radical transfer from one subunit to the active site in the other. Anaerobic RNRs, on the other hand, store a stable glycyl radical next to the active site and the basis for their dATP-dependent inhibition is completely unknown. We present biochemical, biophysical, and structural information on the effects of ATP and dATP binding to the anaerobic RNR from <i>Prevotella copri</i>. The enzyme exists in a dimer–tetramer equilibrium biased towards dimers when two ATP molecules are bound to the ATP-cone and tetramers when two dATP molecules are bound. In the presence of ATP, <i>P. copri</i> NrdD is active and has a fully ordered glycyl radical domain (GRD) in one monomer of the dimer. Binding of dATP to the ATP-cone results in loss of activity and increased dynamics of the GRD, such that it cannot be detected in the cryo-EM structures. The glycyl radical is formed even in the dATP-bound form, but the substrate does not bind. The structures implicate a complex network of interactions in activity regulation that involve the GRD more than 30 Å away from the dATP molecules, the allosteric substrate specificity site and a conserved but previously unseen flap over the active site. Taken together, the results suggest that dATP inhibition in anaerobic RNRs acts by increasing the flexibility of the flap and GRD, thereby preventing both substrate binding and radical mobilisation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91327">Early parafoveal semantic integration in natural reading</a></h4>

              
                Humans can read and comprehend text rapidly, implying that readers might process multiple words per fixation. However, the extent to which parafoveal words are previewed and integrated into the evolving sentence context remains disputed. We investigated parafoveal processing during natural reading by recording brain activity and eye movements using MEG and an eye tracker while participants silently read one-line sentences. The sentences contained an unpredictable target word that was either congruent or incongruent with the sentence context. To measure parafoveal processing, we flickered the target words at 60 Hz and measured the resulting brain responses (i.e. <i>Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging, RIFT</i>) during fixations on the pre-target words. Our results revealed a significantly weaker tagging response for target words that were incongruent with the previous context compared to congruent ones, even within 100ms of fixating the word immediately preceding the target. This reduction in the RIFT response was also found to be predictive of individual reading speed. We conclude that semantic information is not only extracted from the parafovea but can also be integrated with the previous context before the word is fixated. This early and extensive parafoveal processing supports the rapid word processing required for natural reading. Our study suggests that theoretical frameworks of natural reading should incorporate the concept of deep parafoveal processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91685">Factorized visual representations in the primate visual system and deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Object classification has been proposed as a principal objective of the primate ventral visual stream and has been used as an optimization target for deep neural network models (DNNs) of the visual system. However, visual brain areas represent many different types of information, and optimizing for classification of object identity alone does not constrain how other information may be encoded in visual representations. Information about different scene parameters may be discarded altogether (‘invariance’), represented in non-interfering subspaces of population activity (‘factorization’) or encoded in an entangled fashion. In this work, we provide evidence that factorization is a normative principle of biological visual representations. In the monkey ventral visual hierarchy, we found that factorization of object pose and background information from object identity increased in higher-level regions and strongly contributed to improving object identity decoding performance. We then conducted a large-scale analysis of factorization of individual scene parameters – lighting, background, camera viewpoint, and object pose – in a diverse library of DNN models of the visual system. Models which best matched neural, fMRI, and behavioral data from both monkeys and humans across 12 datasets tended to be those which factorized scene parameters most strongly. Notably, invariance to these parameters was not as consistently associated with matches to neural and behavioral data, suggesting that maintaining non-class information in factorized activity subspaces is often preferred to dropping it altogether. Thus, we propose that factorization of visual scene information is a widely used strategy in brains and DNN models thereof.

	<p>Lateropulsion is a post-stroke phenomenon marked by an active push of the body across the midline towards the more affected side and/or a resistance of the weight shift towards the less affected side. Within the mechanisms of treatment, feedback systems have been shown to be effective. The aim of the present study was to create a body of knowledge by performing a literature review on the use of feedback mechanisms in the treatment of lateropulsion and to report two cases of lateropulsion patients who had undergone feedback-based treatment. Methods: The review was performed across five different databases (Embase, Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro) up to February 2024, and haptic feedback intervention was incorporated into the case series (with lateropulsion and ambulation capacity as the main variables). Results: In total, 211 records were identified and 6 studies were included after the review of the literature. The most used feedback modality was visual feedback. In the case series, positive results were observed from the intervention, particularly in the recovery of lateropulsion and balance, as well as in the improvement of gait for one patient. Patients demonstrated good adherence to the intervention protocol without adverse effects. Conclusions: Visual feedback is the most commonly used feedback modality in lateropulsion patients but other mechanisms such as haptic feedback also are feasible and should be taken into account. Larger sample sizes, extended follow-up periods, and the isolation of feedback mechanisms must be established to clarify evidence.</p>

	<p>Objectives: To study the correlation between positive cochlin tomoprotein testing (CTP), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and the auditory and vestibular function amongst patients with sudden hearing loss. Study Design: Prospective case series. Methods: We prospectively examined eight patients who presented with sudden hearing loss (&amp;amp;gt;60 dB) with or without vertigo or tinnitus. We performed an ELISA-based CTP detection test using middle ear lavage samples. In addition to the CTP examination, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed using different sequences (T1 and a T1 sequence with a contrast medium (CM), a T2 sequence, 4 h delayed intravenous gadolinium-enhanced three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D FLAIR)). Results: All patients with sudden hearing loss (&amp;amp;gt;60 dB) presented a non-specific contrast enhancement in the cochlea and vestibulum on the affected side on delayed 3D-FLAIR MRI. Four patients had a positive CTP test, suggesting a perilymphatic fistula (PLF). However, no specific MRI signal for a PLF was observed. Conclusions: Using multimodal diagnostic measures, such as CTP testing and different MRI sequences, no correlation could be found in patients with a PLF.</p>

                Background: Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) or Leriche syndrome, is a peripheral artery disease, specifically affecting the infrarenal aorta and iliac arteries. Presentation of AIOD patients ranged from asymptomatic to having limb-threatening emergencies. Advances and innovations in endovascular devices have replaced surgical approach for AIOD treatment. Here we reported a 52-year-old man presenting with AIOD managed by endovascular approach using kissing stent technique. Case presentation: A 52-year-old man, with history of chronic coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, long-standing hypertension, and who was a heavy smoker, was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of long time with bilateral claudication and became leg rest pain. He had history of aorto-infrarenal occlusion known from previous percutaneous coronary intervention from right and left femoral artery access. Aortoiliac occlusive disease (TASC II Type D Class) diagnosis was made by lower extremity duplex ultrasound and CT angiography. The patient underwent urgent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with kissing stent technique. The patient was discharged 4 days after the procedure without any significant complaints, received optimal medical treatment, and was educated about smoking cessation. Conclusion: Treatment of AIOD should include both modification of risk factors and efforts to increase perfusion to the lower extremities. An endovascular approach is an excellent alternative and may replace surgical approach in complex aortoiliac obstructive disease. In this case report, an endovascular approach with kissing stent technique showed good results for the patient.

                Introduction The aim of the research was to demonstrate the efficiency of microorganisms and the effectiveness of biodegradation techniques on Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastics. The research question was: What is the efficiency of LDPE-degrading microorganisms and the effectiveness of biodegradation techniques? Methods The systematic review was based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Articles were obtained from Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), Embase, and Google Scholar. The DeCS/Mesh search terms were: Low-density polyethylene, efficiency, biodegradation, microbial consortia, fungi, bacteria. Inclusion criteria were: scientific articles that included bacteria, fungi, and microbial consortia reported as LDPE degraders that report the percentage of weight loss; articles published from January 2010 to October 2022, and publications in Spanish and English with open access. Exclusion criteria were: studies that do not report gravimetry, the biodegradation time of LDPE, and the genus or species of the polyethylene-degrading microorganism. Results Out of 483 studies found, 50 were included in this Systematic Review (SR). The most frequent study techniques were scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gravimetry, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and in the case of microorganisms, the most studied belonged to the genus Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Aspergillus. Regarding the isolation place, the most frequent mentioned in the reviewed articles were landfill soil and sanitary landfill soil. The efficiency of LDPE-degrading microorganisms was higher in bacteria such as Enterobacter spp., Pantoea spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Bacillus spp., which obtained a range of DE of 9.00-70.00%, 24.00-64%, 1.15 – 61.00%, 45.00%, and 1.5-40% with DT of 4-150, 120, 4-150, 30, and 30-120 days, respectively; in the case of fungi, the main microorganisms are Neopestalotiopsis phangngaensis, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Thyrostroma jaczewskii with efficiencies of 54.34, 48.78, and 46.34%, in 90 days, respectively; and the most efficient microbial consortia were from Enterobacter spp. and Pantoea sp. with 38.00 – 81.00%, in 120 days; and, Pseudomonas protegens, Stenotrophomonas sp., B. vallismortis and Paenibacillus sp. with 55. 00 – 75.00% in 120 days. Conclusions The most efficient microorganisms in LDPE degradation are Enterobacter spp., Pantoea spp., Pseudomonas spp., Escherichia coli, and Bacillus spp.; in fungi Neopestalotiopsis phangngaensis, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Thyrostroma jaczewskii; and in microbial consortia, those formed by Enterobacter spp. and Pantoea sp., and that of P. protegens, Stenotrophomonas sp., B. vallismortis and Paenibacillus sp.; and the most effective techniques used in LDPE biodegradation are SEM, gravimetry, and FTIR.

                Background Recent innovations are making radiology more advanced for patient and patient services. Under the immense burden of radiology practice, Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists in obtaining Computed Tomography (CT) images with less scan time, proper patient placement, low radiation dose (RD), and improved image quality (IQ). Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the positioning accuracy, RD, and IQ of AI-based automatic and manual positioning techniques for CT kidney ureters and bladder (CT KUB). Methods This prospective study included 143 patients in each group who were referred for computed tomography (CT) KUB examination. Group 1 patients underwent manual positioning (MP), and group 2 patients underwent AI-based automatic positioning (AP) for CT KUB examination. The scanning protocol was kept constant for both the groups. The off-center distance, RD, and quantitative and qualitative IQ of each group were evaluated and compared. Results The AP group (9.66±6.361 mm) had significantly less patient off-center distance than the MP group (15.12±9.55 mm). There was a significant reduction in RD in the AP group compared with that in the MP group. The quantitative image noise (IN) was lower, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the AP group than in the MP group (p<0.05). Qualitative IQ parameters such as IN, sharpness, and overall IQ also showed significant differences (p< 0.05), with higher scores in the AP group than in the MP group. Conclusions The AI-based AP showed higher positioning accuracy with less off-center distance (44%), which resulted in 12% reduction in RD and improved IQ for CT KUB imaging compared with MP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-744/v1?src=rss">Teacher attributes as predictors of assessment practices in public universities of Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Higher education teachers dwell on various classroom assessment practices. Their assessment practices play a significant part of the teaching learning process and in determining student achievement. In this respect, their different attributes determine the nature of their classroom assessment practices. This cross-sectional survey study aimed to examine differences in assessment practices among public university teachers with respect to their academic status, teaching experience, assessment training and specializations. Methods The study adopted Assessment Practices Inventory (API) which was distributed to a sample of 380 randomly selected teachers from four public universities. The majorities (93.4%) of questionnaires which were properly completed were entered to SPSS version 25 software and used for analysis. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used for analysis and Pillai’s Trace was utilized for interpretation of the results. Results The results showed that academic status (P= .000); teaching experience (P = .000); and assessment training (P =.030) had significant differences for the combined dependent variables (assessment practice). However, field of specialization (P =.130) did not show significant difference in the overall assessment practice although differences were observed in assessment design and interpretation. Conclusion Academic status, teaching experience, and assessment training are important attributes of teachers that shape their assessment practices. Therefore, as teachers hold the sole responsibility of classroom assessment, training and development courses in assessment, experience sharing and learning opportunities are necessary regardless of their specializations, academic status, and teaching experience.

                Abstract* Background Attachment style and object relation maturity have been linked to patterns of relating to others and mental health outcomes. However, little research has tested how these processes relate or the level of unique variance they each account for in outcomes. This study aimed to explore these issues. Methods A sample of n = 77 adults completed self-report scales of attachment style, splitting and dyadic splitting tendencies and mental distress (measured via the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8) scales). Questionnaires were completed online. Results The results suggested that anxious attachment and tendency towards splitting were related to higher levels of mental distress. Splitting was positively related to attachment anxiety and avoidance. However, a series of mediation models (testing the relationship between splitting and mental health, mediated by attachment avoidance and anxiety) suggested that anxious attachment did not predict unique variance in distress. Splitting remained related to mental distress but was not mediated by anxious or avoidant attachment styles. Conclusions The findings point towards potential links between two distinct aspects of systems that influence relating and psychological wellbeing. They also suggested that addressing both aspects will be beneficial in helping clients improve their relationships and well-being.

                Background The objective was to investigate the impact of physical activity (PA) teaching and learning approaches in healthcare professionals (HCPs) education on PA-related knowledge, confidence, and behaviour. Methods Eligible experimental studies investigated the effect of interventions that incorporate PA in to the undergraduate and postgraduate education, and continuous professional development of any HCP (medical doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, etc.) on PA-related outcomes including knowledge, perceptions, and confidence to prescribe PA. Six databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, Medline, and SPORTDiscus) were searched from inception to October 2022. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. A narrative data synthesis was undertaken to assess the overall effectiveness of the reviewed educational interventions: knowledge, perceptions, confidence, attitudes, beliefs, and changes in behaviour/practice. Results A total of 32 studies comprising 3,256 participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The most frequently employed learning approach in eligible studies was training workshops (n=13), followed by experiential learning (n=4). Half of the studies included knowledge as an outcome (n=16) and 10 studies each included a measure of confidence and changes in behaviour/practice. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=7), showed no improvement in any measure of knowledge, confidence, or behaviour. Two RCTs reported beneficial effects of experiential learning on confidence and perceived behavioural control. In non-randomised studies, training workshops and didactic input with and without simulated e-learning led to statistical improvements in knowledge, confidence, perceived competence, and attitudes. Discussion Most of the eligible studies lacked an adequate sample size, and, in many cases, there was a high loss to follow up which represents a threat to the internal validity of the studies. We found that a blended approach to teaching and learning supported with experiential or simulated experiences to improve the knowledge, perceived competence, and confidence to prescribe PA.

                Health systems are experiencing increasing pressures worldwide due to heightened service demands, demographic aging, stringent regulations, and economic constraints, making efficiency and efficacy in health management critical aspects. At the heart of this complexity, health managers seek to optimize resources and improve care delivery at a time when the adoption of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), becomes increasingly imperative. This necessity reflects not only the pursuit of innovation but also the urgency to adapt to an ever-evolving environment. However, the effective characterization, availability, and incorporation of these technologies as support tools still represent an emerging challenge that is insufficiently explored in the literature. In response, this project proposes the development of a framework of theoretical and practical guidelines for the implementation and management of digital tools in health systems in the age of AI. Adopting a mixed-methods approach that includes systematic review, analyses of commercial off-the-shelf solutions, and qualitative studies with health managers and practitioners, the aim is to map current technology use, identify gaps and best practices, and provide a guide for future direction. This project also intends to develop in co-creation with professionals in the field to ensure the relevance and practical applicability of the developed guidelines. The results are expected to not only contribute to the scientific literature but also offer an evidence-based guide to optimizing the use of digital technologies in health management, promoting a significant transformation in the development and adoption of innovative digital solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-740/v1?src=rss">Protocol for scoping review: Instruments for assessing vision-specific health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with visual impairment. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Childhood visual impairment (VI) is less common than in adults, but research has demonstrated that it can have significant long-term negative impacts on the health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) of children and adolescents. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of vision-specific instruments available for accurately assessing HR-QoL in children and adolescents with VI, particularly in resource-limited settings. The objective of this scoping review is to methodically evaluate the evidence pertaining to (1) the accessibility and usage of instruments specifically designed to assess HR-QoL in children and adolescents who have VI, (2) summarise studies on HR-QoL in children and adolescent with VI, and (3) describe the psychometric properties of vision-specific instruments used for assessing HR-QoL in children and adolescents with VI. The review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guideline (2020) for scoping reviews, utilizing frameworks by Arksey and O’Malley, and methodological enhancements suggested by Levac (2010). A systematic search will be performed through various databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost, to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English from inception until 31 December 2023. The EBSCOhost platform will include several databases, such as Academic Search Complete, APA PsycINFO, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, and Open Dissertations. The extracted data will be analysed narratively using QualCoder 1.9 version, and the study’s findings will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The researchers anticipate that the literature will assist in exploring and relating various types of HR-QoL tools used globally. This review’s conclusion will help researchers ascertain research gaps in vision-related QoL instruments based on different economies, countries, and environments. This will further aid researchers in planning and developing tools suitable for African contexts and languages.

                Background Healthcare, like other industries, emphasizes performance, quality, and consumer experience while also attempting to reduce costs. However, high-quality healthcare remains paramount for vulnerable and ill patients. This study aimed to investigate parents' and caregivers' level of satisfaction with physiotherapy services provided to neuropediatric outpatients on the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study included 103 parents/caregivers of children with neurological disabilities that were randomly selected from different Emirates Health Services Hospitals in the UAE. Data was collected using the long-form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-III). Results The overall mean satisfaction was 159±7.73 (out of 250 points). Communication (20.36/25), interpersonal factors (20.17/35), and doctor-patient time (20.17/35) had the highest mean satisfaction scores (8.06/10). The lowest mean satisfaction scores were for access/availability/convenience (34.60/60), technical quality (33.17/50), and economic elements (23.83/40). Conclusion Despite participants’ overall satisfaction scores being positive, some service domains require improvement to improve satisfaction, specifically the access/availability/convenience, technical quality, and economic elements. These areas should be prioritized by service providers and managers to improve patients’ experiences and clinical outcomes.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although the mammalian cerebral cortex is most often described as a hexalaminar structure, there are cortical areas (primary motor cortex) and species (elephants, cetaceans, and hippopotami), where a cytoarchitecturally indistinct, or absent, layer 4 is noted. Thalamocortical projections from the core, or first order, thalamic system terminate primarily in layers 4/inner 3. We explored the termination sites of core thalamocortical projections in cortical areas and in species where there is no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 using the immunolocalization of vesicular glutamate transporter 2, a known marker of core thalamocortical axon terminals, in 31 mammal species spanning the eutherian radiation. Several variations from the canonical cortical column outline of layer 4 and core thalamocortical inputs were noted. In shrews/microchiropterans, layer 4 was present, but many core thalamocortical projections terminated in layer 1 in addition to layers 4 and inner 3. In primate primary visual cortex, the sublaminated layer 4 was associated with a specialized core thalamocortical projection pattern. In primate primary motor cortex, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was evident and the core thalamocortical projections terminated throughout layer 3. In the African elephant, cetaceans, and river hippopotamus, no cytoarchitecturally distinct layer 4 was observed and core thalamocortical projections terminated primarily in inner layer 3 and less densely in outer layer 3. These findings are contextualized in terms of cortical processing, perception, and the evolutionary trajectory leading to an indistinct or absent cortical layer 4.</p>

     alt="The Neural Representation of Binaural Sound Localization Cues Across Different Subregions of the Chicken's Inferior Colliculus"/>
<p>This study matched physiology and anatomical subregions in the chicken inferior colliculus. We found neural topographies for binaural sound localization cues, but, in contrast to the well-studied barn owl, there was no distinct differentiation of responses in the different subregions. Together with previous work in pigeon and chicken, this suggests a plesiomorphic condition of multisensory integration in the midbrain that is dominated by lateral panoramic vision.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The sound localization behavior of the nocturnally hunting barn owl and its underlying neural computations is a textbook example of neuroethology. Differences in sound timing and level at the two ears are integrated in a series of well-characterized steps, from brainstem to inferior colliculus (IC), resulting in a topographical neural representation of auditory space. It remains an important question of brain evolution: How is this specialized case derived from a more plesiomorphic pattern? The present study is the first to match physiology and anatomical subregions in the non-owl avian IC. Single-unit responses in the chicken IC were tested for selectivity to different frequencies and to the binaural difference cues. Their anatomical origin was reconstructed with the help of electrolytic lesions and immunohistochemical identification of different subregions of the IC, based on previous characterizations in owl and chicken. In contrast to barn owl, there was no distinct differentiation of responses in the different subregions. We found neural topographies for both binaural cues but no evidence for a coherent representation of auditory space. The results are consistent with previous work in pigeon IC and chicken higher-order midbrain and suggest a plesiomorphic condition of multisensory integration in the midbrain that is dominated by lateral panoramic vision.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Data mining was performed at the databases of the Allen Institute for Brain Science (<a target="_blank"

   title="Link to external resource: RRID:SCR_017001">RRID:SCR_017001</a>) searching for genes expressed selectively throughout the adult mouse mesocortex (transitional cortex ring predicted within the concentric ring theory of mammalian cortical structure, in contrast with central isocortex [ICx] and peripheral allocortex). We aimed to explore a shared molecular profile selective of all or most mesocortex areas. This approach checks and corroborates the precision of other previous definitory criteria, such as poor myelination and high kainate receptor level. Another aim was to examine which cortical areas properly belong to mesocortex. A total of 34 positive adult selective marker genes of mesocortex were identified, jointly with 12 negative selective markers, making a total of 46 markers. All of them identify the same set of cortical areas surrounding the molecularly different ICx as well as excluding adjacent allocortex. Four representative mesocortex markers—<i>Crym</i>, <i>Lypd1</i>, <i>Cdh13</i>, and <i>Smoc2</i>—are amply illustrated, jointly with complementary material including <i>myelin basic protein</i>, to check myelination, and <i>Rorb</i>, to check layer 4 presence. The retrosplenial (ReSp) area, long held to be mesocortical, does not share any of the 46 markers of mesocortex and instead expresses <i>Nr4a2</i> and <i>Tshz2</i>, selective parahippocampal allocortex markers. Moreover, it is not hypomyelinic and lacks a <i>Rorb</i>-positive layer 4, aspects generally present in mesocortex. Exclusion of the ReSp area from the mesocortex ring reveals the latter to be closed at this locus instead by two adjacent areas previously thought to be associative visual ICx (reidentified here molecularly as postsplenial and parasplenial mesocortex areas). The concepts of ICx, mesocortex, and parahippocampal allocortex are thus subtly modified by substantial molecular evidence.</p>

     alt="Atypical Course of the Habenulo-Interpeduncular Tract in Chick Embryos"/>
<p>The retroflex tract is a prominent diencephalic landmark in vertebrates but seems absent in adult avian. Here, using BEN immunohistochemistry that specifically identifies fibers of this tract, we study their distribution from the habenular region to the interpeduncular complex. We found that many habenular fibers diverge in an atypical dispersed course through the thalamic cell mass and toward the prethalamic region (top figure). The diagram shows the atypical course of the fibers. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Classical studies of the avian diencephalon hardly mention the habenulo-interpeduncular tract (a.k.a. retroflex tract), although both the habenula (HB) (its origin) and the interpeduncular nuclear complex (its target) are present. Retroflex tract fibers were described at early embryonic stages but seem absent in the adult in routine stains. However, this tract is a salient diencephalic landmark in all other vertebrate lineages. It typically emerges out of the caudal HB, courses dorsoventrally across thalamic alar and basal plates just in front of the thalamo-pretectal boundary, and then sharply bends 90° caudalwards at paramedian basal plate levels (this is the “retroflexion”), to approach longitudinally via paramedian pretectum and midbrain the rostralmost hindbrain, specifically the prepontine median interpeduncular complex across isthmus and rhombomere 1. We systematize this habenulo-interpeduncular course into four parts named subhabenular, retrothalamic, tegmental, and interpeduncular. We reexamined the chicken habenulo-interpeduncular fibers at stages HH30 and HH35 (6.5- and 9-day incubation) by mapping them specifically with immunoreaction for BEN protein, a well-known marker. We found that only a small fraction of the stained retroflex tract fibers approaches the basal plate by coursing along the standard dorsoventral pathway in front of the thalamo-pretectal boundary. Many other habenular fibers instead diverge into atypical dispersed courses across the thalamic cell mass (implying alteration of the first subhabenular part of the standard course) before reaching the basal plate; this dispersion explains their invisibility. A significant number of such transthalamic habenular fibers cross orthogonally the zona limitans (ZLI) (the rostral thalamic boundary) and invade the caudal alar prethalamus. Here, they immediately descend dorsoventrally, just rostrally to the ZLI, until reaching the prethalamic basal plate, where they bend (retroflex) caudalwards, entering the thalamic basal paramedian area. These atypical fibers gradually fasciculate with the other groups of habenular efferent fibers in their final longitudinal approach to the hindbrain interpeduncular complex. We conclude that the poor visibility of this tract in birds is due to its dispersion into a diversity of atypical alternative routes, though all components eventually reach the interpeduncular complex. This case merits further analysis of the diverse permissive versus nonpermissive guidance mechanisms called into action, which partially correlate distinctly with successive diencephalic, mesencephalic, and hindbrain neuromeric fields and their boundaries.</p>

     alt="Excitatory Projections of Wide Field Collicular Neurons to the Nucleus of the Optic Tract in the Rat"/>
<p>We report a novel class of rat collicular neurons (SCWF<sub>NOT</sub>) with horizontally oriented and spiny-rich dendrites in the retinorecipient superficial layers of the superior colliculus. This subpopulation of excitatory wide field neurons invariably project to the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT), and some of them express the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The superficial layers of the mammalian superior colliculus (SC) contain neurons that are generally responsive to visual stimuli but can differ considerably in morphology and response properties. To elucidate the structure and function of these neurons, we combined extracellular recording and juxtacellular labeling, detailed anatomical reconstruction, and ultrastructural analysis of the synaptic contacts of labeled neurons, using transmission electron microscopy. Our labeled neurons project to different brainstem nuclei. Of particular importance are neurons that fit the morphological criteria of the wide field (WF) neurons and whose dendrites are horizontally oriented. They display a rather characteristic axonal projection pattern to the nucleus of optic tract (NOT); thus, we call them superior collicular WF projecting to the NOT (SCWF<sub>NOT</sub>) neurons. We corroborated the morphological characterization of this neuronal type as a distinct neuronal class with the help of unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. Our ultrastructural data demonstrate that SCWF<sub>NOT</sub> neurons establish excitatory connections with their targets in the NOT. Although, in rodents, the literature about the WF neurons has focused on their extensive projection to the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus, as a conduit for information to reach the visual association areas of the cortex, our data suggest that this subclass of WF neurons may participate in the optokinetic nystagmus.</p>

                E. Courvan et al. show that hypoxia and inflammatory signals synergize to induce rapid transcriptome turnover in macrophages. Using TimeLapse-seq to measure transcript degradation rates and gene expression simultaneously, they find that inflammation generates a distinct hypoxic state with characteristic signaling output, decreased ECM component production, and increased ribosome biosynthesis.

                Brauer et al. describe the ion-conducting activity of the gramillin toxin from Fusarium graminearum. Gramillin advances fungal infestation of the plant by promoting fungal secondary metabolite gene expression. Plants detect ionophores, including gramillin, to activate cellular stress responses, and the genes influencing these responses promote host susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93079">The breath shape controls intonation of mouse vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                Intonation in speech is the control of vocal pitch to layer expressive meaning to communication, like increasing pitch to indicate a question. Also, stereotyped patterns of pitch are used to create distinct sounds with different denotations, like in tonal languages and, perhaps, the 10 sounds in the murine lexicon. A basic tone is created by exhalation through a constricted laryngeal voice box, and it is thought that more complex utterances are produced solely by dynamic changes in laryngeal tension. But perhaps, the shifting pitch also results from altering the swiftness of exhalation. Consistent with the latter model, we describe that intonation in most vocalization types follows deviations in exhalation that appear to be generated by the re-activation of the cardinal breathing muscle for inspiration. We also show that the brainstem vocalization central pattern generator, the iRO, can create this breath pattern. Consequently, ectopic activation of the iRO not only induces phonation, but also the pitch patterns that compose most of the vocalizations in the murine lexicon. These results reveal a novel brainstem mechanism for intonation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95727">An atlas of brain-bone sympathetic neural circuits in mice</a></h4>

              
                There is clear evidence that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mediates bone metabolism. Histological studies show abundant SNS innervation of the periosteum and bone marrow-these nerves consist of noradrenergic fibers that immunostain for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine beta hydroxylase, or neuropeptide Y. Nonetheless, the brain sites that send efferent SNS outflow to bone have not yet been characterized. Using pseudorabies (PRV) viral transneuronal tracing, we report, for the first time, the identification of central SNS outflow sites that innervate bone. We find that the central SNS outflow to bone originates from 87 brain nuclei, sub-nuclei and regions of six brain divisions, namely the midbrain and pons, hypothalamus, hindbrain medulla, forebrain, cerebral cortex, and thalamus. We also find that certain sites, such as the raphe magnus (RMg) of the medulla and periaqueductal gray (PAG) of the midbrain, display greater degrees of PRV152 infection, suggesting that there is considerable site-specific variation in the levels of central SNS outflow to bone. This comprehensive compendium illustrating the central coding and control of SNS efferent signals to bone should allow for a greater understanding of the neural regulation of bone metabolism, and importantly and of clinical relevance, mechanisms for central bone pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94608">Perceptual error based on Bayesian cue combination drives implicit motor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor system can recalibrate itself without our conscious awareness, a type of procedural learning whose computational mechanism remains undefined. Recent findings on implicit motor adaptation, such as over-learning from small perturbations and fast saturation for increasing perturbation size, challenge existing theories based on sensory errors. We argue that perceptual error, arising from the optimal combination of movement-related cues, is the primary driver of implicit adaptation. Central to our theory is the increasing sensory uncertainty of visual cues with increasing perturbations, which was validated through perceptual psychophysics (Experiment 1). Our theory predicts the learning dynamics of implicit adaptation across a spectrum of perturbation sizes on a trial-by-trial basis (Experiment 2). It explains proprioception changes and their relation to visual perturbation (Experiment 3). By modulating visual uncertainty in perturbation, we induced unique adaptation responses in line with our model predictions (Experiment 4). Overall, our perceptual error framework outperforms existing models based on sensory errors, suggesting that perceptual error in locating one’s effector, supported by Bayesian cue integration, underpins the sensorimotor system’s implicit adaptation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92993">Involvement of TRPV4 in temperature-dependent perspiration in mice</a></h4>

              
                Reports indicate that an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 (ANO1) could be widely involved in water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting that the interaction could play a role in perspiration. In secretory cells of sweat glands present in mouse foot pads, TRPV4 clearly colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5). Mouse sweat glands showed TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases that were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice and was inhibited by menthol both in wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. The basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. Sweating could be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads, and this possibility is supported by the finding that wild-type mice climbed up a slippery slope more easily than TRPV4-deficient mice. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. Collectively, TRPV4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1, and TRPV4 itself or the TRPV4/ANO 1 complex would be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89903">Essential function of transmembrane transcription factor MYRF in promoting transcription of miRNA lin-4 during C. elegans development</a></h4>

              
                Precise developmental timing control is essential for organism formation and function, but its mechanisms are unclear. In <i>C. elegans</i>, the microRNA <i>lin-4</i> critically regulates developmental timing by post-transcriptionally downregulating the larval-stage-fate controller LIN-14. However, the mechanisms triggering the activation of <i>lin-4</i> expression toward the end of the first larval stage remain unknown. We demonstrate that the transmembrane transcription factor MYRF-1 is necessary for <i>lin-4</i> activation. MYRF-1 is initially localized on the cell membrane, and its increased cleavage and nuclear accumulation coincide with <i>lin-4</i> expression timing. MYRF-1 regulates <i>lin-4</i> expression cell-autonomously and hyperactive MYRF-1 can prematurely drive <i>lin-4</i> expression in embryos and young first-stage larvae. The tandem <i>lin-4</i> promoter DNA recruits MYRF-1<sup>GFP</sup> to form visible loci in the nucleus, suggesting that MYRF-1 directly binds to the <i>lin-4</i> promoter. Our findings identify a crucial link in understanding developmental timing regulation and establish MYRF-1 as a key regulator of <i>lin-4</i> expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84798">Hsp47 promotes biogenesis of multi-subunit neuroreceptors in the endoplasmic reticulum</a></h4>

              
                Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) deficiency is an important contributing factor to neurological and metabolic diseases. However, how the proteostasis network orchestrates the folding and assembly of multi-subunit membrane proteins is poorly understood. Previous proteomics studies identified Hsp47 (Gene: <i>SERPINH1</i>), a heat shock protein in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, as the most enriched interacting chaperone for gamma-aminobutyric type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors. Here, we show that Hsp47 enhances the functional surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in rat neurons and human HEK293T cells. Furthermore, molecular mechanism study demonstrates that Hsp47 acts after BiP (Gene: <i>HSPA5</i>) and preferentially binds the folded conformation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors without inducing the unfolded protein response in HEK293T cells. Therefore, Hsp47 promotes the subunit-subunit interaction, the receptor assembly process, and the anterograde trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Overexpressing Hsp47 is sufficient to correct the surface expression and function of epilepsy-associated GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor variants in HEK293T cells. Hsp47 also promotes the surface trafficking of other Cys-loop receptors, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and serotonin type 3 receptors in HEK293T cells. Therefore, in addition to its known function as a collagen chaperone, this work establishes that Hsp47 plays a critical and general role in the maturation of multi-subunit Cys-loop neuroreceptors.

	<p>The differential diagnosis between atypical Parkinsonian syndromes may be challenging and critical. We aimed to proposed a radiomics-guided deep learning (DL) model to discover interpretable DL features and further verify the proposed model through the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes. We recruited 1495 subjects for 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) scanning, including 220 healthy controls and 1275 patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (IPD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Baseline radiomics and two DL models were developed and tested for the Parkinsonian diagnosis. The DL latent features were extracted from the last layer and subsequently guided by radiomics. The radiomics-guided DL model outperformed the baseline radiomics approach, suggesting the effectiveness of the DL approach. DenseNet showed the best diagnosis ability (sensitivity: 95.7%, 90.1%, and 91.2% for IPD, MSA, and PSP, respectively) using retained DL features in the test dataset. The retained DL latent features were significantly associated with radiomics features and could be interpreted through biological explanations of handcrafted radiomics features. The radiomics-guided DL model offers interpretable high-level abstract information for differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian disorders and holds considerable promise for personalized disease monitoring.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-3/v2?src=rss">COVID-19 and the need for special care for women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective The study investigates the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and assess whether women with PCOS are at a higher susceptibility and risk for COVID-19 complications. Methods This review analyzes articles indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library, focusing on the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 1, 2019, until November 1, 2022. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the NIH quality assessment tool. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023371956) on January 12, 2023. Results A total of 11 observational studies were identified, totaling 22,155 PCOS patients. Despite the heterogeneity of the included studies, the findings of most of the studies were similar in terms of increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection in PCOS patients. PCOS patients were reported to have a 51% higher risk of COVID-19 infection than non-PCOS women (HR =1.51). Many causes have been identified to play a role, most notably the overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and elevated levels of RAS-associated proteins, decreased serum levels of neuropilin-1 (sNRP1), elevated serum biomarkers such as platelet degranulation and coagulation cascade markers increased acute phase response, and lower levels of vitamin D could render PCOS patients susceptible to a chronic inflammatory state, which can also lead to difficulties and severe consequences, when impacted by COVID-19. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic also influenced psychological well-being, with an increase in the incidence and severity of depression and anxiety among PCOS patients in the COVID-19 pandemic era compared to healthy individuals. Conclusions Patients with PCOS are more likely to get infected with COVID-19 and display a higher affinity to severe infections and complications due to overlapping and confounding factors. These findings suggest that PCOS patients may need more medical attention when infected with COVID-19.

                <p>Phospholipids (PLs) are asymmetrically distributed at the plasma membrane. This asymmetric lipid distribution is transiently altered during calcium-regulated exocytosis, but the impact of this transient remodeling on presynaptic function is currently unknown. As phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) randomizes PL distribution between the two leaflets of the plasma membrane in response to calcium activation, we set out to determine its role in neurotransmission. We report here that PLSCR1 is expressed in cerebellar granule cells (GrCs) and that PLSCR1-dependent phosphatidylserine egress occurred at synapses in response to neuron stimulation. Synaptic transmission is impaired at GrC <I>Plscr1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> synapses, and both PS egress and synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis are inhibited in <I>Plscr1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> cultured neurons from male and female mice, demonstrating that PLSCR1 controls PL asymmetry remodeling and SV retrieval following neurotransmitter release. Altogether, our data reveal a novel key role for PLSCR1 in SV recycling and provide the first evidence that PL scrambling at the plasma membrane is a prerequisite for optimal presynaptic performance.</p>

                <p>Sex differences have complicated our understanding of the neurobiological basis of many behaviors that are key for survival. As such, continued elucidation of the similarities and differences between sexes is necessary to gain insight into brain function and vulnerability. The connection between the hippocampus (Hipp) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a crucial site where modulation of neuronal activity mediates reward-related behavior. Our previous work demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) of Hipp-&gt;NAc synapses is rewarding, and mice can establish learned associations between LTP of these synapses and the contextual environment in which LTP occurred. Here, we investigated sex differences in the mechanisms underlying Hipp-&gt;NAc LTP using whole-cell electrophysiology and pharmacology. We observed similarities in basal synaptic strength between males and females and found that LTP occurs postsynaptically with similar magnitudes in both sexes. However, key sex differences emerged as LTP in males required NMDA receptors (NMDAR), whereas LTP in females utilized an NMDAR-independent mechanism involving L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) and estrogen receptor &alpha; (ER&alpha;). We also uncovered sex-similar features as LTP in both sexes depended on CaMKII activity and occurred independently of dopamine-1 receptor (D1R) activation. Our results have elucidated sex-specific molecular mechanisms for LTP in an integral pathway that mediates reward-related behaviors, emphasizing the importance of considering sex as a variable in mechanistic studies. Continued characterization of sex-specific mechanisms underlying plasticity will offer novel insight into the neurophysiological basis of behavior, with significant implications for understanding how diverse processes mediate behavior and contribute to vulnerability to developing psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <p>The semantic knowledge stored in our brains can be accessed from different stimulus modalities. For example, a picture of a cat and the word "cat" both engage similar conceptual representations. While existing research has found evidence for modality-independent representations, their content remains unknown. Modality-independent representations could be semantic, or they might also contain perceptual features. We developed a novel approach combining word/picture cross-condition decoding with neural network classifiers that learned latent modality-independent representations from MEG data (25 human participants, 15 females, 10 males). We then compared these representations to models representing semantic, sensory, and orthographic features. Results show that modality-independent representations correlate both with semantic and visual representations. There was no evidence that these results were due to picture-specific visual features or orthographic features automatically activated by the stimuli presented in the experiment. These findings support the notion that modality-independent concepts contain both perceptual and semantic representations.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/27/e0790232024?rss=1">Regulation of the Mouse Ventral Tegmental Area by Melanin-Concentrating Hormone</a></h4>

              
                <p>Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) acts via its sole receptor MCHR1 in rodents and is an important regulator of homeostatic behaviors like feeding, sleep, and mood to impact overall energy balance. The loss of MCH signaling by MCH or MCHR1 deletion produces hyperactive mice with increased energy expenditure, and these effects are consistently associated with a hyperdopaminergic state. We recently showed that MCH suppresses dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, which principally receives dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but the mechanisms underlying MCH-regulated dopamine release are not clearly defined. MCHR1 expression is widespread and includes dopaminergic VTA cells. However, as the VTA is a neurochemically diverse structure, we assessed <I>Mchr1</I> gene expression at glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic VTA cells and determined if MCH inhibited the activity of VTA cells and/or their local microcircuit. <I>Mchr1</I> expression was robust in major VTA cell types, including most dopaminergic (78%) or glutamatergic cells (52%) and some GABAergic cells (38%). Interestingly, MCH directly inhibited dopaminergic and GABAergic cells but did not regulate the activity of glutamatergic cells. Rather, MCH produced a delayed increase in excitatory input to dopamine cells and a corresponding decrease in GABAergic input to glutamatergic VTA cells. Our findings suggested that MCH may acutely suppress dopamine release while disinhibiting local glutamatergic signaling to restore dopamine levels. This indicated that the VTA is a target of MCH action, which may provide bidirectional regulation of energy balance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/27/e1175232024?rss=1">Complexity Matters: Normalization to Prototypical Viewpoint Induces Memory Distortion along the Vertical Axis of Scenes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Scene memory is prone to systematic distortions potentially arising from experience with the external world. Boundary transformation, a well-known memory distortion effect along the near-far axis of the three-dimensional space, represents the observer's erroneous recall of scenes&rsquo; viewing distance. Researchers argued that normalization to the prototypical viewpoint with the high-probability viewing distance influenced this phenomenon. Herein, we hypothesized that the prototypical viewpoint also exists in the vertical angle of view (AOV) dimension and could cause memory distortion along scenes&rsquo; vertical axis. Human subjects of both sexes were recruited to test this hypothesis, and two behavioral experiments were conducted, revealing a systematic memory distortion in the vertical AOV in both the forced choice (<I>n</I> = 79) and free adjustment (<I>n</I> = 30) tasks. Furthermore, the regression analysis implied that the complexity information asymmetry in scenes&rsquo; vertical axis and the independent subjective AOV ratings from a large set of online participants (<I>n</I> = 1,208) could jointly predict AOV biases. Furthermore, in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (<I>n</I> = 24), we demonstrated the involvement of areas in the ventral visual pathway (V3/V4, PPA, and OPA) in AOV bias judgment. Additionally, in a magnetoencephalography experiment (<I>n</I> = 20), we could significantly decode the subjects&rsquo; AOV bias judgments ~140&nbsp;ms after scene onset and the low-level visual complexity information around the similar temporal interval. These findings suggest that AOV bias is driven by the normalization process and associated with the neural activities in the early stage of scene processing.</p>
