              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013">Goals and the Structure of Experience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.15013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning, posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation (descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal. Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral, phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse substrates.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12139">Discontinuous phase transition of feature detection in lateral predictive coding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.12139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The brain may adopt the strategy of lateral predictive coding (LPC) to construct optimal internal representations for salient features in input sensory signals, reducing the energetic cost of information transmission. Here we first consider the task of detecting one non-Gaussian signal by LPC from Gaussian background signals of the same magnitude, which is intractable by principal component decomposition. We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness, and implement this tradeoff by a thermodynamic free energy. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. There are at least three types of optimal LPC matrices, one type with very weak synaptic weights and $S \approx 0$, and two functional types either with low energy $E$ or with high entropy $S$ in which one single unit selectively responds to the non-Gaussian input feature. Energy--information tradeoff induce two discontinuous phase transitions between these three types of optimal LPC networks. We then extend the discussion to detecting and distinguishing between two non-Gaussian input features and observe similar discontinuous phase transitions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22146">Flexible Tool Selection through Low-dimensional Attribute Alignment of Vision and Language</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.22146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Human evaluation studies validate our framework's alignment with human decision-making patterns, and generalization experiments demonstrate effective performance on novel tool categories. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, elongation, hand-relatedness) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15082">From Basic Affordances to Symbolic Thought: A Computational Phylogenesis of Biological Intelligence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought, but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding, to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15074">A Scalable Trie Building Algorithm for High-Throughput Phyloanalysis of Wafer-Scale Digital Evolution Experiments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based simulation platforms play a key role in enabling fast-to-run evolution experiments that can be precisely controlled and observed in detail. Availability of high-resolution snapshots of lineage ancestries from digital experiments, in particular, is key to investigations of evolvability and open-ended evolution, as well as in providing a validation testbed for bioinformatics method development. Ongoing advances in AI/ML hardware accelerator devices, such as the 850,000-processor Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE), are poised to broaden the scope of evolutionary questions that can be investigated in silico. However, constraints in memory capacity and locality characteristic of these systems introduce difficulties in exhaustively tracking phylogenies at runtime. To overcome these challenges, recent work on hereditary stratigraphy algorithms has developed space-efficient genetic markers to facilitate fully decentralized estimation of relatedness among digital organisms. However, in existing work, compute time to reconstruct phylogenies from these genetic markers has proven a limiting factor in achieving large-scale phyloanalyses. Here, we detail an improved trie-building algorithm designed to produce reconstructions equivalent to existing approaches. For modestly-sized 10,000-tip trees, the proposed approach achieves a 300-fold speedup versus existing state-of-the-art. Finally, using 1 billion genome datasets drawn from WSE simulations encompassing 954 trillion replication events, we report a pair of large-scale phylogeny reconstruction trials, achieving end-to-end reconstruction times of 2.6 and 2.9 hours. In substantially improving reconstruction scaling and throughput, presented work establishes a key foundation to enable powerful high-throughput phyloanalysis techniques in large-scale digital evolution experiments.

                arXiv:2508.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum sequence learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15555">HEAS: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation Framework for Cross-Scale Modeling and Multi-Objective Search</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.

                arXiv:2506.03302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) uniquely combine high accuracy with interpretability, making them valuable for scientific modeling. However, it is unclear a priori how deep a network needs to be for any given task, and deeper KANs can be difficult to optimize and interpret. Here we introduce multi-exit KANs, where each layer includes its own prediction branch, enabling the network to make accurate predictions at multiple depths simultaneously. This architecture provides deep supervision that improves training while discovering the right level of model complexity for each task. Multi-exit KANs consistently outperform standard, single-exit versions on synthetic functions, dynamical systems, and real-world datasets. Remarkably, the best predictions often come from earlier, simpler exits, revealing that these networks naturally identify smaller, more parsimonious and interpretable models without sacrificing accuracy. To automate this discovery, we develop a differentiable "learning-to-exit" algorithm that balances contributions from exits during training. Our approach offers scientists a practical way to achieve both high performance and interpretability, addressing a fundamental challenge in machine learning for scientific discovery.

">Learning-Associated Flexibility of Cortical Taste Coding Is Impaired in Shank3 Knockout Mice</a></h4>

              
                The ability to update the valence of sensory perception to influence behavior is crucial for survival. A common phenotype in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is defects in sensory processing, but whether these defects impair flexible sensory encoding is largely unexplored. In particular, how genetic risk factors such as Shank3 deletion affect the adaptability of cortical taste processing and downstream behavior is unknown. To address this gap, we performed two-photon calcium imaging during a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) learning paradigm, an ethologically relevant form of associative learning that depends on taste processing in the anterior insular cortex (AIC), to examine how Shank3 knockout alters taste-related neuronal activity in AIC and influences CTA learning. We found that AIC neurons in Shank3 knockout mice exhibited reduced stimulus-evoked suppression and increased trial-to-trial correlated variability during the acquisition of CTA memory. These activity changes, which likely reduced signal-to-noise ratio in AIC, were associated with slower CTA acquisition in knockout mice. In both genotypes, CTA learning enhanced, while subsequent extinction reduced, taste discriminability in AIC, and both extinction and the associated reduction in discriminability were faster in knockout than in wild-type mice. Together, these results show that Shank3 loss is associated with destabilized cortical activity dynamics in AIC, which may contribute to inefficient encoding and maintenance of learned taste aversion. These findings show that loss of Shank3 compromises the ability of animals to update behavior to incorporate negative outcomes, and suggest this loss of flexibility may be an important feature of monogenic ASDs.

">Modulation of motor cortical theta and gamma oscillations using phase-targeted, closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of local excitatory and inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Theta and gamma oscillations are prominent features of cortical local field potentials (LFPs) and stimulation of the motor cortex at these frequencies can enhance motor learning. Phase-targeted closed-loop stimulation could provide a more precise and effective method to modulate these oscillations, particularly if stimulation parameters could harness the dynamics of the specific circuit mechanisms underpinning the generation of these activities. To address this question, we defined the response of theta- and gamma-frequency oscillations in the motor cortex to closed-loop optogenetic stimulation of excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons transfected with Channelrhodopsin-2 in awake, head-fixed RBP4-Cre (retinol-binding-protein-4) and PV-Cre (parvalbumin) mice, respectively. Phase-targeted blue-light pulses were delivered using the OscillTrack algorithm to track theta phase in the cortical LFP in real time and trigger stimulation at one of four target theta phases. Stimulation was delivered over a quarter of the target theta cycle, either as a single continuous pulse (continuous protocol) or three short pulses at gamma (75Hz) frequency (gamma protocol). Stimulation of both neuron types, using either stimulation protocol, modulated theta power in a phase-dependent manner, with continuous stimulation of excitatory cells leading to stronger modulation. Phase-dependent amplification during stimulation of excitatory vs inhibitory neurons was offset by 90{degrees}, in line with predictions from computational models. Open-loop replay of previously recorded closed-loop stimulation patterns did not elicit the same phase-specific effects, demonstrating the necessity of the closed-loop interaction to produce these effects. Stimulation of pyramidal neurons using the gamma protocol amplified gamma power, independently of target theta phase. These findings reveal phase-dependent amplification of cortical theta power can be induced by stimulation of local excitatory or inhibitory neurons, with a phase-offset likely resulting from circuit interactions. This approach can be used to inform the development of brain stimulation methods to modulate these activities more effectively in humans.

">Complement contributes to hyperactive behavior in the 16p11.2 hemideletion mouse model</a></h4>

              
                The complement system is a major component of the innate immune system and plays an important role in immune surveillance. Recent research has demonstrated that the complement system also plays pivotal roles in brain development, and dysregulation of complement is involved in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms by which the complement system contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) remain poorly understood. In this study, we find that the expression of a central regulator of the complement cascade, complement component 3 (C3), is upregulated in the striatum of mice modeling the 16p11.2 hemideletion (16p11.2 del). 16p11.2 del is among the most common copy number variations associated with NDDs including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID). Pharmacological inhibition of the C3a receptor alleviates hyperactivity in 16p11.2 del mice, suggesting that elevated complement contributes to NDD-relevant behavioral changes. Due to the pro-inflammatory actions of the C3a receptor, we assess the cytokine environment in the striatum, a key neural substrate for locomotor behavior, and find that several inflammatory factors are upregulated in 16p11.2 del mice. Collectively, these results indicate that increased expression of the complement system, especially C3, mediates hyperactive behavior and is associated with a pro-inflammatory environment in the striatum of 16p11.2 del mice. Our results suggest that inhibition of an overactive complement system may be an effective strategy to ameliorate NDD symptoms resulting from 16p11.2 hemideletion including those associated with ADHD.

">Synaptic high-frequency jumping synchronises vision to high-speed behaviour</a></h4>

              
                During high-speed behaviour, animals must predict, detect, process, and respond synchronously to rapid environmental changes, including those caused by their own movements. How neural systems achieve such precision remains unclear. Here, we investigate how the housefly (Musca domestica), renowned for agile aerial manoeuvres, maintains visual accuracy during ultrafast motion. Although rapid movements typically blur vision, houseflies exhibit remarkable visual acuity; their visual neurons achieve record-high rates of information sampling (~2,500 bits/s) and synaptic transmission (~4,100 bits/s), substantially surpassing previous estimates. Using intracellular and photomechanical recordings of photoreceptors exposed to rapid sequences of saccade-like stimuli, we traced information transmission to large monopolar cells (LMCs), the first interneurons in the visual pathway. We identify a previously unknown mechanism - synaptic high-frequency jumping - in which photoreceptor-LMC synapses dynamically shift transmission towards higher frequencies during saccadic input. This mechanism extends visual bandwidth to ~920 Hz, eliminates synaptic delays, and quadruples traditional flicker-fusion limits (~230 Hz). Ultrafast behavioural experiments confirm flies respond synchronously within ~13-20 ms, even while photoreceptor responses are still approaching their peak (9-16 ms), directly challenging classical sequential-processing models. Our biophysically realistic photoreceptor-LMC model demonstrates how photomechanical, quantal, and refractory sampling processes co-adapt dynamically with behaviour. Thus, flies actively shape their visual input through self-generated saccades, driving high-frequency jumping, efficient neural coding, hyperacute vision, and neural synchronisation. These findings redefine foundational principles of compound-eye function, uncovering a universal neural strategy underlying synchronous, high-speed predictive processing.

                <p>Adolescent nicotine use is particularly concerning due to increased susceptibility to long-term effects and dependence during this critical developmental period. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of thiamine on nicotine withdrawal-induced anxiety, anhedonia, and depression in rats. Adolescent rats received nicotine (2&nbsp;mg/kg, s.c.) for 21&nbsp;d, followed by 21&nbsp;d of withdrawal. Thiamine (25 or 50&nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.) was administered during exposure and withdrawal. Behavioral assessments were used to evaluate anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms, and biochemical analyses measured oxidative stress markers, serotonin levels, MAO activity, BDNF, and GFAP as indicators of neuroinflammation in the prefrontal cortex. Nicotine withdrawal significantly elevated anxiety-, depression-, and anhedonia-like behaviors, increased oxidative stress, and upregulated MAO-A activity and GFAP expression, indicating neuroinflammatory effects. Notably, thiamine administration during both nicotine exposure and withdrawal effectively alleviated these behavioral impairments, restored serotonin levels, reduced oxidative stress markers, and mitigated the increase in GFAP expression. Additionally, thiamine alone has been shown to alleviate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. This study highlights thiamine's potential as a promising intervention for managing psychological distress associated with nicotine withdrawal. Given the high prevalence of adolescent nicotine use and its associated mental health challenges, further research on thiamine's mechanisms and therapeutic potential is warranted to improve treatment strategies during this critical developmental stage.</p>

                <p>Every neuron contains the same genomic information, but its complement of proteins is the product of countless neuron-specific steps including pre-mRNA splicing. Despite advances in RNA sequencing techniques, pre-mRNA splicing biases that favor one isoform over another are largely inscrutable in live neurons in situ. Here, in <I>Drosophila</I>, we developed bichromatic fluorescent reporters to investigate alternative splicing of <I>cacophony</I> (<I>cac</I>)&mdash;a gene that codes the pore-forming &alpha;<SUB>1</SUB> subunit of the primary neuronal voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VGCC). These reporters revealed a neuron-specific pattern of exon biases, highly consistent from one animal to the next, suggesting that each neuron splices a unique and consistent portfolio of VGCC isoforms. Stereotypical patterns were observed within motor neurons and multidendritic sensory neurons of female larvae and also within mushroom body Kenyon cells of female adults. In a validation step, we demonstrated that exon splice bias reporting was not dependent on the choice of fluorophores. Additionally, functional properties of the female larval motor neuron terminals could be generally reconciled with the functional properties predicted for the reported exon bias. The application of this technology to a large gene such as <I>cac</I> provides a precedence for effective exon-reporter design for other <I>Drosophila</I> genes.</p>

                <p>by Haoran Chen, Yangyuan Zhang, Robert F. Murphy</p>

Recent advances in multiplexed fluorescence imaging have provided new opportunities for deciphering the complex spatial relationships among various cell types across diverse tissues. We introduce CytoSpatio, open-source software that constructs generative, multirange, and multitype point process models that capture interactions among multiple cell types at various distances simultaneously. On analyzing five cell types across five tissues, our software showed consistent spatial relationships within the same tissue type, with certain cell types like proliferating T cells consistently clustering across tissue types. It also revealed that the attraction-repulsion relationships between cell types like B cells and CD4-positive T cells vary with tissue type. Models for a published dataset demonstrated consistency with prior findings. CytoSpatio can also generate synthetic tissue patterns from learned models, a capability not provided by previous descriptive, motif-based approaches. This potentially allows spatially realistic simulations of how cell relationships affect tissue biochemistry.

                <p>by Amirmahdi Mostofinejad, David A. Romero, Dana Brinson, Thomas K. Waddell, Golnaz Karoubi, Cristina H. Amon</p>

Differentiation of embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into endoderm derivatives, including thyroid, thymus, lungs, liver, and pancreas, has broad implications for disease modeling and therapy. We utilize and expand a model development approach previously outlined by the authors to construct a model for the directed differentiation of iPSCs into definitive endoderm (DE). Assuming discrete intermediate stages in the differentiation process with a homogeneous population in each stage, three lineage models with two, three, and four populations and three growth models are constructed. Additionally, three models for error distribution are defined, resulting in a total of 27 models. Experimental data obtained <i>in vitro</i> are used for model calibration, model selection, and final validation. Model selection suggests that no transitory state during differentiation expresses the DE biomarkers CD117 and CD184, a finding corroborated by existing literature. Additionally, space-limited growth models, such as logistic and Gompertz growth, outperform exponential growth. Validation of the inferred model with leave-out data results in prediction errors of 26.4%. Using the inferred model, it is predicted that the optimal differentiation period is between 1.9 and 2.4 days, plating populations closer to 300 000 cells per well result in the highest yield efficiency, and that iPSC differentiation outpaces the DE proliferation as the main driver of the population dynamics. We also demonstrate that the model can predict the effect of growth modulators on cell population dynamics. Our model serves as a valuable tool for optimizing differentiation protocols, providing insights into developmental biology.

                <p>by John Robertson, Shorya Consul, Haris Vikalo</p>

Motivation: Oncoviruses, pathogens known to cause or increase the risk of cancer, include both common viruses such as human papillomaviruses and rarer pathogens such as human T-lymphotropic viruses. Computational methods for detecting viral DNA from data acquired by modern DNA sequencing technologies have enabled studies of the association between oncoviruses and cancers. Those studies are rendered particularly challenging when multiple species of oncovirus are present in a tumor sample. In such scenarios, merely detecting the presence of a sequencing read of viral origin is insufficiently informative—instead, a more precise characterization of the viral content in the sample is required.
Results: We address this need with NextVir, to our knowledge the first multi-class viral classification framework that adapts genomic foundation models to detecting and classifying sequencing reads of oncoviral origin. Specifically, NextVir explores several foundation models—DNABERT-S, Nucelotide Transformer, and HyenaDNA—and efficiently fine-tunes them to enable accurate identification of the sequencing reads’ origin. The results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed framework over existing deep learning methods and suggest downstream potential for foundational models in genomics.

Accurate determination of cell-type composition in disease-relevant tissues is essential for identifying potential disease targets and understanding tissue heterogeneity. Most current spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies lack single-cell resolution, which makes precise cell-type composition identification challenging. Several deconvolution methods have been developed to address this limitation by relying on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to estimate the cell type composition in ST data spots. However, these methods often overlook the inherent differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Domain-Adversarial Masked Autoencoder (SpaDAMA) method. SpaDAMA leverages Domain-Adversarial Learning (DAL) to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the source domain (pseudo-ST data generated from scRNA-seq) to the target domain (real ST data). Through adversarial training, SpaDAMA harmonizes the distributions of both datasets and maps them onto a unified latent representation, thereby reducing discrepancies in data modalities. Furthermore, to strengthen the model’s capability in extracting reliable features from real ST data, SpaDAMA employs masking strategies that effectively minimize noise and mitigate spatial artifacts. We validated SpaDAMA on 32 simulated datasets and 4 real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in cell-type deconvolution and providing a promising tool for spatial transcriptomic analyses.

                <p>by Emily R. Bozich, Xiaolu Guo, Jennifer L. Wilson, Alexander Hoffmann</p>

Single-cell studies of signal transduction have revealed complex temporal dynamics that determine downstream biological function. For example, the stimulus-specific dynamics of the transcription factor NFκB specify stimulus-specific gene expression programs, and loss of specificity leads to disease. Thus, it is intriguing to consider drugs that may restore signaling specificity in disease contexts, or reduce activity but maintain signaling specificity to avoid unwanted side effects. However, while steady-state dose-response relationships have been the focus of pharmacological studies, there are no established methods for quantifying drug impact on stimulus-response signaling dynamics. Here we evaluated how drug treatments affect the stimulus-specificity of NFκB activation dynamics and its ability to accurately code ligand identity and dose. Specifically, we simulated the dynamic NFκB trajectories in response to 15 stimuli representing various immune threats under treatment of 10 representative drugs across 20 dosage levels. To quantify the effects on coding capacity, we introduced a Stimulus Response Specificity (SRS) score and a stimulus confusion score. We constructed stimulus confusion maps by employing epsilon network clustering in the trajectory space and in various dimensionally reduced spaces: canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD), functional principal component analysis (fPCA), and NFκB signaling codons (i.e., established, informative dynamic features). Our results indicated that the SRS score and the stimulus confusion map based on signaling codons are best-suited to quantify stimulus-specific NFκB dynamics confusion under pharmacological perturbations. Using these tools we found that temporal coding capacity of the NFκB signaling network is generally robust to a variety of pharmacological perturbations, thereby enabling the targeting of stimulus-specific dynamics without causing broad side-effects.

                <p>by Yuhang Zhang, Tao Sun, Boyang Zang, Sen Wan</p>

Decoding animal decision-making behavior from neural spike data emerges as a particularly challenging problem in neuroscience. To address this, we have devised a decision-making decoding model, incorporating a channel attention bi-directional long short-term memory network (CA-BiLSTM), with the aim of effectively parsing sparse neural spike data across multiple brain regions. Notably, the attention mechanism embedded within this model serves the crucial purpose of adeptly localizing neurons integral to decision-making stability within the task at hand. Specifically, when applied to the reproducible electrophysiology dataset from the International Brain Laboratory (IBL), our proposed model has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for accurately forecasting decision-making behavior in mice. Consequently, this investigation furnishes a novel perspective for unraveling the intricacies of neural decision-making mechanisms.

                <p>by Clara L. Shaw, David A. Kennedy</p>

Spillover of viruses into novel host species occurs frequently. Often, spillover results in dead-end infections in novel hosts, sometimes, in stuttering transmission chains that die out, and rarely, in large epidemics with sustained transmission. If we could identify early which outcome will occur following a spillover event, we could more appropriately invest in efforts to surveil, respond to, or prevent disease emergence. Our goal was to identify early epidemiological characteristics that correlate with these outcomes, including those predictive of population-level virus persistence in novel hosts. To identify these characteristics, we experimentally induced spillover in the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> nematode-Orsay virus system and measured infection prevalence in exposed populations and virus shedding and infection intensity from infected hosts in replicate populations of eight strains belonging to seven non-native host species. We then passaged 20 adult nematodes from exposed populations to virus-free plates where they reproduced, initiating new populations to which they had the potential to transmit virus. We used quantitative PCR to track virus presence in passaged host populations for 10 passages or until virus was undetectable, indicating its loss. We then used a correlative modeling and a mechanistic modeling approach to understand which epidemiological characteristics were associated with population-level viral persistence. In our correlative models, we found that the number of passages until virus loss was associated with early epidemiological characteristics in the spillover host populations, including infection prevalence in the initially exposed population, the ability of hosts to detectably shed the virus, and the relative susceptibility of the host species, but not infection intensity. When all these characteristics were included simultaneously in a correlative model, only infection prevalence and shedding were significantly associated with virus maintenance, and the model explained over half of the variation in the data. We then developed a mechanistic model that attempts to explain virus passage success by using our epidemiological characteristics data to calculate the probability that at least one worm infectious enough to infect a conspecific is transferred during passage. This mechanistic model explained 38% of the variation in the data on its own. With the goal of understanding how our mechanistic model falls short, we used model selection to test a suite of larger models that included or excluded each epidemiological characteristic and included random effects of strain, experimental line, passage number, and block while the mechanistic prediction was included as an offset. We found that 66% of the variation in our data could be explained by a model that included our mechanistic prediction in addition to infection prevalence, infection intensity, and random effects. Altogether, our study demonstrates that early epidemiological characteristics can play a substantial role in explaining the ultimate outcome of a spillover event.

<p>Monosynaptic rabies tracing shows that the ventral subiculum and thalamic paraventricular nucleus are sources of input to a nucleus accumbens shell- ventral pallidum pathway involved in modulating dopamine neuron activity.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh) regulates motivation and reward via its dense projection to the ventral pallidum (VP). This ventral striatopallidal system has also been shown to regulate the activity of midbrain dopamine neurons and the release of dopamine in the NAcSh. The present study applied monosynaptic rabies tracing in the rat to quantify the brain-wide sources of synaptic input to neurons in the medial NAcSh that project to the ventromedial VP. The ventral subiculum of the hippocampus (vSub) was the largest source of input cells to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons. Anterograde tracing of vSub-NAcSh projection neurons demonstrated that their fibers terminated densely in the NAcSh largely avoiding other regions of the striatum. Another relatively strong source of input cells included the anterior part of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT). The CA1, lateral septal nucleus, VP, paratenial thalamic nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, lateral preoptic area and dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus were moderately strong sources of input neurons. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala were found to be relatively weak sources of input. A lack of sex differences for all the sources of input identified indicates that there is no apparent sexual dimorphism in the afferents to the striatopallidal system. In summary, the vSub and the aPVT are the major sources of cortical and thalamic monosynaptic inputs to the NAcSh-VP projection neurons where these inputs converge to regulate behavior and dopamine release in the NAcSh.</p>

                Guo et al. perform a systematic assessment of genetic dependencies and cell surface targets in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, identifying biomarkers, mapping interpatient and intratumoral heterogeneity, and nominating combination strategies. Experimental validation of dependencies associated with mesenchymal/EMT gene expression signatures identified the CDS2 enzyme as a mesenchymal state selective dependency.

                Ren et al. demonstrate that TCF25 enhances lysosomal acidification via V-ATPase during glucose starvation, promoting autophagy to maintain energy balance. However, prolonged starvation makes TCF25-mediated lysosomal-autophagic activity crucial for ferritinophagy, ultimately causing lysosome-dependent cell death.

                Kim et al. develop a consensus definition for layer 6b (L6b) excitatory neurons in adult mouse neocortex, enabling comparisons of their synaptic organization and function across studies. These neurons project to layer 1; express CTGF, Cplx3, and Nxph4; and project locally and between ipsilateral cortical areas but not to the thalamus.

                Huang et al. show that spatial exploration activates astrocytes in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MECII). Visual inputs contribute to this process. They further demonstrate that in vivo suppression of MECII astrocytic activities is sufficient to suppress spatial exploration and MECII neuronal activities.

                <p>Nature Physics, Published online: 21 August 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-03011-7">doi:10.1038/s41567-025-03011-7</a></p>The most commonly pursued quantum error-correction schemes encode quantum information using multiple two-level qubits. Now, two logical qubits have been encoded in the infinite-dimensional bosonic motional degrees of freedom of a trapped ion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106963">Comment on ‘Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness’</a></h4>

              
                In a recent article Fahrenfort and colleagues demonstrate that auditory and monetary punishment change the criteria that participants use to rate the clarity of perception (Fahrenfort et al., 2025). This leads them to conclude that “subjective measures do not reliably measure the construct they intend to measure” and that their construct validity is threatened. Here, we argue that the main findings had already been demonstrated in other experiments, and the general limitations of subjective measures has been known for decades without the field dismissing their usefulness. We further argue that the experimental manipulations of Fahrenfort and colleagues are so radical that they could be used to invalidate essentially any psychological/cognitive test. In our view, both of the above-mentioned conclusions are thus inappropriate considering the evidence presented, and we believe that the take-home message both before and after the study of Fahrenfort and colleagues is to acknowledge the limitations of subjective reports when they are used.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107622">Response to comment on ‘Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness’</a></h4>

              
                In Fahrenfort et al., 2025 we show the influence of non-perceptual criterion shifts on neural measures of consciousness. We fully agree (and point out in our article) that it was already known that subjective measures are sensitive to criterion confounds, and we are happy to read that this is acknowledged by Sandberg and Overgaard in their comment (Sandberg and Overgaard, 2025). However, we contest that the main findings of our simulations and empirical studies had already been demonstrated. Several findings from our studies are novel, such as the fact that criterion effects reveal themselves as over- (or under-) estimations of both conscious and unconscious processing in tandem, and that this has tangible implications when analyzing real neural data. We also challenge the suggestion that our experimental manipulations are (too) radical compared to signal-to-noise variations that occur naturally between experiments.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84749">Migrating mesoderm cells self-organize into a dynamic meshwork structure during chick gastrulation</a></h4>

              
                Migration of cell populations is a fundamental process in morphogenesis and disease. The mechanisms of collective cell migration of epithelial cell populations have been well studied. It remains unclear, however, how the highly motile mesenchymal cells, which migrate extensively throughout the embryo, are connected with each other and coordinated as a collective. During chick gastrulation, cells emerging from the primitive streak and migrating in the 3D space between ectoderm and endoderm (mesoderm region) exhibit a novel form of collective migration. Using live imaging and quantitative analysis, such as topological data analysis (TDA), we found that these cells undergo a novel form of collective migration, in which they form a meshwork structure while moving away from the primitive streak. Overexpressing a mutant form of N-cadherin was associated with reduced speed of tissue progression and directionality of the collective cell movement, whereas the speed of individual cells remains unchanged. To investigate how this meshwork arises, we utilized an agent-based theoretical model, which suggests that cell elongation, cell-cell adhesion, and cell density are the key parameters for the meshwork formation. These data provide novel insights into how a supracellular structure of migrating mesenchymal cells may arise in loosely connected cell populations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105264">A Commander-independent function of COMMD3 in endosomal trafficking</a></h4>

              
                Endosomal recycling is a branch of intracellular membrane trafficking that retrieves endocytosed cargo proteins from early and late endosomes to prevent their degradation in lysosomes. A key player in endosomal recycling is the Commander complex, a 16-subunit protein assembly that cooperates with other endosomal factors to recruit cargo proteins and facilitate the formation of tubulo-vesicular carriers. While the crucial role of Commander in endosomal recycling is well established, its molecular mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we genetically dissected the Commander complex using unbiased genetic screens and comparative targeted mutations. Unexpectedly, our findings revealed a Commander-independent function for COMMD3, a subunit of the Commander complex, in endosomal recycling. COMMD3 regulates a subset of cargo proteins independently of the other Commander subunits. The Commander-independent function of COMMD3 is mediated by its N-terminal domain (NTD), which binds and stabilizes ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTPase regulating endosomal recycling. Mutations disrupting the COMMD3-ARF1 interaction diminish ARF1 expression and impair COMMD3-dependent cargo recycling. These data provide direct evidence that Commander subunits can function outside the holo-complex and raise the intriguing possibility that components of other membrane trafficking complexes may also possess functions beyond their respective complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104856">Multi-omics single-cell analysis reveals key regulators of HIV-1 persistence and aberrant host immune responses in early infection</a></h4>

              
                The clearance of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) remains a significant public health challenge due to impaired cellular immune responses and HIV-1 maintenance during acute infection. However, the genetic and epigenetic changes influencing the immune response on host infected cells remain unclear. Here, this study analyzes HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people living with HIV-1 during early infection (&lt;6 months) using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing. It is observed that HIV-1 hinders the antiviral response, particularly by interfering with the interferon signaling pathway. Multimodal analysis identifies KLF2 as a key transcription factor in infected CD4+ T cells. Moreover, cells harboring HIV-1 provirus are predominantly identified as Th17 cells, which exhibit elevated KLF2 activity. This suggests an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and a constrained immune response due to the quiescent characteristics of these cells. The finding provides insights into the immune mechanisms and key regulators of HIV-1 maintenance in CD4+ T cells during the early stages of infection.

">Frontal theta synchronization facilitates the acquisition of new statistical regularities, evidenced by predictive eye movements</a></h4>

              
                Frontal midline theta oscillations are key neural markers for learning, set-shifting, and adaptive behavior, signaling cognitive control and the reorganization of neural representations. The present study explored how these oscillations mediate the extraction and updating of statistical regularities. We delivered 6 Hz in-phase transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) or sham tACS, synchronizing the bilateral prefrontal cortex during an eye-tracking probabilistic sequence learning task designed to test cognitive flexibility and assess pre-stimulus gaze direction changes. A novel probabilistic sequence with a partially overlapping structure was introduced that allowed us to distinguish between the retention of old sequences and the acquisition of new ones. Following comparable statistical learning in both groups during the practice session, our results showed that tACS reduced the incorrect anticipations of previously learned triplets that remained high-probability in the new sequence and allowed participants to more flexibly anticipate triplets newly becoming high-probability. These results suggest a role of frontal midline theta in the flexible rewiring of the mental representations of prior probabilistic structures.

">Anticipated Relevance Prepares Visual Processing for Efficient Memory-Guided Selection</a></h4>

              
                Finding an object typically involves the use of working memory to prioritize relevant visual information at the right time. For example, successfully detecting a highway exit sign is useless when your announced exit is still ten minutes away, but becomes relevant with only thirty seconds to go. Using EEG, we investigated how predictable changes in stimulus relevance influence top-down (i.e., memory-guided) visual selection. Participants memorized an oriented grating, followed by a cue indicating which of two sequentially presented probes was relevant for a memory-match/-mismatch judgment. Consistent with earlier work, relevant probes evoked stronger univariate responses than irrelevant probes. Furthermore, multivariate responses to (memory-matching and memory-mismatching) probes were more distinct when they were relevant compared to irrelevant. Crucially, using rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT), we found that early visual responses to the (empty) probe location were enhanced even before the presentation of relevant (compared to irrelevant) probes. These results demonstrate that predictable changes in stimulus relevance induce both pro-active and re-active changes in visual processing. We conclude that anticipating the (ir)relevance of upcoming visual events enables the visual system to prepare ahead of time, enabling efficient memory-guided visual selection.

">Executive control in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A worldwide mega-analysis of task-based functional neuroimaging data of the ENIGMA-OCD consortium</a></h4>

              
                Objective Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with impaired executive function and altered activity in associated neural circuits, contributing to reduced goal-directed behavior. To investigate neural activation during executive control, we conducted a mega-analysis in the ENIGMA-OCD consortium pooling individual participant data from 475 individuals with OCD and 345 healthy controls across 15 fMRI tasks collected worldwide. Methods Individual participant data was uniformly processed using HALFpipe to construct voxelwise statistical images of executive control and task load contrasts. Parameter estimates extracted from regions of interest were entered into multilevel Bayesian models to examine regional and whole-brain effects of diagnosis, and, within OCD, the influence of medication status, symptom severity, and age of onset on task activation. Results We observed a robust task activation pattern across individuals with OCD and control participants in executive control regions across tasks. Relative to controls, individuals with OCD showed moderate to very strong evidence of weaker activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, frontal eye fields, and inferior parietal lobule during executive control (all positive posterior probabilities [P+]<0.1). Individuals with OCD also showed stronger activation in regions of the default mode network during executive function relative to controls. We found little evidence for differential activation during executive control in task-positive regions related to disease onset, severity and medication status. Conclusion In the first mega-analysis of fMRI studies of executive function in OCD, we found strong evidence of weaker frontoparietal activation during executive control tasks. Our findings also suggest a failure of default mode network regions to appropriately disengage during task performance in OCD.

">Transcriptional profiling defines unique subtypes of transit amplifying neural progenitors within the neonatal mouse subventricular zone</a></h4>

              
                While significant progress has been made in understanding the heterogeneity in the NSCs, our understanding of similar heterogeneity among the more abundant transit amplifying progenitors is lagging. Our work on the NPs of the neonatal subventricular zone (SVZ) began over a decade ago, when we used antibodies to the 4 antigens, Lex CD133,LeX,CD140a and NG2 and FACs to classify subsets of the neontal SVZ as either multi-potential (MP1, MP2, MP3, MP4 and PFMPs), glial-restricted (GRP1, GRP2, and GRP3), or neuron-astrocyte restricted (BNAP). Using RNAseq we have characterized the distinctive molecular fingerprint of 4 SVZ neural progenitors and compared their gene expression profiles to those of the NSCs. Overall, we identified 1581 genes that were upregulated in at least one NP compared to the NSCs. Of these genes, 796 genes were upregulated in BNAP/GRP1 compared to NSCs; 653 in GRP2/MP3; 440 in GRP3; 527 in PFMPs. One gene in particular that emerged from our analysis that can be used to distinguish the NPs from the NSCs is Etv1, also known as Er81. Interestingly, PFMPs expressed high levels of the transcription factor GSX1, which has been shown to play important roles in regulating interneuron development in the forebrain. PFMPs are also highly express PDGFR, CSPG4 (NG2+) Olig2 and transcripts for olfactory receptors. PFMPs also express Sox10, Gjb1, Zfp488 and Myt1 which have been shown to be important for oligodendrocyte development. The top transcription factors with unique upregulation in BNAP/GRP1s were Zfp57, Hoxac6, and Zfp955a. Unlike the other NPs, the GRP1 and GRP2 NPs expressed many proteins involved in immune cell function. In contrast, the top downregulated genes in the NPs are those involved in cilia formation, consistent with the loss of cilia as neural stem cells become multipotential progenitors. We performed bionformatic analyses to provide insights into the transcription factor interactions that are likely regulating their development as well as the functional consequences of these diffferences in gene expression. The present work will serve as an important resource for investigators interested in further defining the transit amplifying progenitors of the mammalian SVZ.

">Efficient coding in working memory is adapted to the structure of the environment</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) relies on efficient coding strategies to overcome its limited capacity, yet how the brain adaptively organizes WM representations to maximize coding efficiency based on environmental structure remains largely unknown. In our study, participants remembered a sequence of gratings defined in a two-dimensional feature space where we manipulated directional consistency, revealing enhanced performance for structured (consistent direction) vs non-strutured (non-consistent direction) contexts, particularly for individuals with lower WM capacity. Magnetoencephalography analyses uncovered dissociable neural bases: consistent sequences engaged anterior temporal and medial frontal cortices for abstract directional representations during maintenance, while inconsistent sequences preferentially reactivated item-specific representations in parietal regions. These neural patterns predicted behavioral performance, establishing a neural efficiency principle wherein the brain adaptively switches between relational and item-based coding strategies, mitigating WM constraints. These findings advance our understanding of how structures shape WM organization, offering insights into cognitive flexibility and neural resource allocation in complex environments.

">Auditory-motor synchronization determines the use of predictions in music perception</a></h4>

              
                When listening to music, our brain constantly generates predictions about the timing and pitch of upcoming sounds based on the structure of the music. Individual differences in the ability to make such rhythmic and melodic predictions shape music perception. Previous studies show that during rhythmic auditory-motor synchronization tasks, better performance is related to stronger motor system engagement. However, whether individual differences in auditory-motor interactions influence higher-level rhythmic predictions is unknown. Here, we used electroencephalography during a naturalistic music listening task to assess the neural tracking of rhythmic and melodic predictions generated from (short-term) local contextual information and (long-term) experience using the Information Dynamics of Music model. We combined a multivariate temporal response function approach with two behavioral measures of auditory-motor synchronization (whispering and finger tapping). We found that stronger auditory-motor synchronization predicted stronger neural tracking of lower-level temporal aspects of the music signal, i.e. acoustic envelope and note onset. Across participants, higher-level (short- and long-term) predictions were also neurally tracked, with neural tracking stronger for rhythmic than melodic predictions. Importantly, our evidence suggests individual differences in the weighting of musical predictions. Individuals with stronger auditory-motor synchronization showed stronger neural tracking of rhythmic compared to melodic predictions, and this effect was especially pronounced for short-term predictions. Our findings demonstrate that the motor system is critically involved at several processing levels even in purely perceptual music tasks, and pave the way for understanding individual differences in the weighting of rhythmic and melodic predictions during music listening.

">Hippocampal stimulation reveals causal role of persistent neural activity in human working memory</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) enables the temporary maintenance and manipulation of information, supporting flexible, goal-directed behavior. While converging evidence suggests that the hippocampus contributes to WM storage, its causal role in WM remains unclear. Here, we combined simultaneous intracranial single-neuron recordings in the hippocampus and several cortical areas with focal electrical stimulation in the human hippocampus to test the causal necessity of hippocampal activity for WM. Thirty patients with implanted hybrid depth electrodes performed a WM task with images as memoranda. Electrical stimulation (2 s, 50 Hz, 1 mA) was delivered to the hippocampus during the maintenance period on a subset of trials. Behaviorally, stimulation impaired WM performance, reducing accuracy and increasing response times. Neuronally, stimulation reduced memoranda-selective persistent activity in hippocampus and ventral temporal cortex (VTC), thereby disrupting content-specific neural representations. The extent of neural disruption was correlated trial-by-trial with impaired WM-related behavior, establishing a causal link between disrupted neural activity and impaired WM. At the population level, stimulation shifted neural trajectories farther from attractor states, consistent with degraded mnemonic fidelity. Together, these data provide causal evidence that persistent activity of individual neurons in hippocampus and VTC supports WM maintenance in humans. Our results demonstrate that perturbing hippocampal dynamics disrupts both single-neuron coding and population-level attractor stability, linking cellular mechanisms to behavior and highlighting hippocampal contributions to WM maintenance.

">Shared latent representations of speech production for cross-patient speech decoding</a></h4>

              
                Speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can restore communication in individuals with neuromotor disorders who are unable to speak. However, current speech BCIs limit patient usability and successful deployment by requiring large volumes of patient-specific data collected over long periods of time. A promising solution to facilitate usability and accelerate their successful deployment is to combine data from multiple patients. This has proven difficult, however, due to differences in user neuroanatomy, varied placement of electrode arrays, and sparse sampling of targeted anatomy. Here, by aligning patient-specific neural data to a shared latent space, we show that speech BCIs can be trained on data combined across patients. Using canonical correlation analysis and high-density micro-electrocorticography (ECoG), we uncovered shared neural latent dynamics with preserved micro-scale speech information. This approach enabled cross-patient decoding models to achieve improved accuracies relative to patient-specific models facilitated by the high resolution and broad coverage of ECoG. Our findings support future speech BCIs that are more accurate and rapidly deployable, ultimately improving the quality of life for people with impaired communication from neuromotor disorders.

">Semantic elaboration determines the time course of alpha-beta oscillations during the encoding and retrieval of narrative memories</a></h4>

              
                Understanding and remembering everyday events requires us to retrieve semantic relationships between elements by activating prior knowledge, allowing us to form a deeper memory trace. However, the neural interplay between semantic and episodic systems to encode and retrieve recent memories remains unclear. The present study addresses how semantic elaboration enhances episodic memory formation through neural oscillations. We presented participants with continuous auditory verbal and non-verbal narratives to memorise. Participants rated the perceived coherence of each narrative to provide a subjective measure of semantic elaboration. We assessed memory of the narratives depending on semantic elaboration and modality of encoding with a subsequent retrieval test. We recorded their electroencephalogram (EEG) to establish how semantic elaboration modulated the representation of narrative information proxied by neocortical alpha-beta oscillations during the encoding and retrieval. First, we found that semantic elaboration facilitated narrative information processing by speeding perceived coherence responses during encoding. Second, the magnitude of alpha-beta desynchronisation across the semantic network progressively increased with the chronological position of the events indexing information accumulation as the narratives unfolded. Third, the coherence scores of the narratives negatively correlated with the magnitude of alpha-beta oscillation desynchronisation later during successful retrieval. Our findings provide direct behavioural and alpha-beta oscillatory evidence of how semantic elaboration influences the time course of neural operations supporting information representation and reinstatement mediated by neocortical alpha-beta oscillations.

">Octopamine and Tyramine Modulate Motor Program Competition in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic Interactions amongst competing motor programs shape behavioural output. Here, we use a combination of opto- and electro-physiology to explore how the tdc2+ adrenergic-like system modulates competition amongst central pattern generating (CPG) networks controlling locomotion in Drosophila larvae. Bath application of octopamine (OA) promoted fictive forwards locomotion, suppressed backwards locomotion, and induced bouts of fictive head sweeps during wash period that were proportional to the promotion of forward waves. In contrast, tyramine (TA), the conceptualised inhibitory antagonist to OA, promoted collisions and overlap of motor programmes, activity-dependent inhibition, and bouts of silence during wash periods. Dual-colour calcium imaging of the tdc2+ system with motor neurons revealed that the tdc2+ neurons are recruited phasically prior to a majority of fictive locomotor behaviours. Optogenetic manipulation of the tdc2+ system recapitulated a subset of effects and further revealed that activity in tdc2+ system neurons necessary and sufficient for locomotor CPG activity in the system. Overall, our work generates testable predictions for computational and connectomics studies for Drosophila motor competition and provides insights into how adrenergic-like systems can modulate dynamics of motor competition among interacting CPGs within locomotor networks.

">An optogenetic assay of Drosophila larval motor neuron performance in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Background: Over fifty million people worldwide currently live with neurodegenerative diseases, many of which are the result of pathogenic gene variants. Genetically malleable model organisms provide an avenue for research into the genetic bases of these diseases, and the large motor neurons of fruit fly larvae provide a test bed for investigating neuronal mechanisms impacted by pathogenic gene variants. However, it is challenging to collect information from these neurons under physiological conditions as they terminate on muscle fibers that are perpetually contracting - driven by motor neuron burst-firing. New Method: As a test of in vivo neuronal performance, we expressed light-activated opsins in motor-neurons of unrestrained intact Drosophila larva and used light pulses to drive cyclical body-wall contractions that were captured on camera and analyzed offline. Results: We describe the assembly of an apparatus to systematically activate motor-neurons in Drosophila larvae and an image acquisition system to capture the resulting body-wall contractions. To test the utility of the assay we performed a motor-neuron specific knock-down of dMiro, an adaptor for mitochondrial transport into motor-neuron terminals. As predicted, contractions were poorly sustained in larvae with impaired axonal transport of mitochondria. Comparison with Existing Methods: This in vivo assay allows for a test of sustained neuronal performance while sidestepping the shortcomings of electrophysiological assays of neurotransmission in situ where hemolymph-like solutions may not recapitulate hemolymph properties, axons are severed and where recordings are mechanically disrupted at endogenous firing rates. Secondly, unlike adult climbing assays and larval locomotion assays, performance is assayed independently of the organism's motivation to perform or ability to detect stimuli. Conclusions: We demonstrated that Drosophila 3rd instar larvae cannot sustain body-wall contractions if mitochondria are not delivered to motor nerve terminals - validating a motor neuron performance assay in a model organism suited for molecular genetic analysis.

">Hugin-AstA circuitry is a novel central energy sensor that directly regulates sweet sensation in Drosophila and mouse</a></h4>

              
                Taste sensation plays a crucial role in shaping feeding behavior and is intricately influenced by internal states like hunger or satiety. Despite the identification of numerous neural substrates regulating feeding behavior, the central neural substrate that linked energy-sensing and taste sensation remained elusive. Here, we identified a novel neural circuitry that could directly sense internal energy state and modulate sweet sensation in the Drosophila brain. Specifically, a subset of neuropeptidergic neurons expressing hugin directly detected elevated levels of circulating glucose via glucose transporter Glut1 and ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Upon activation, these neurons released hugin peptide and activated downstream Allatostatin A (AstA)+ neurons via its cognate receptor PK2-R1. Subsequently, the activation of AstA+ neurons then directly inhibited sweet sensation via AstA peptide and its cognate receptor AstA-R1 expressed in sweet-sensing Gr5a+ neurons. We also showed that neuromedin U (NMU), the mammalian homolog of fly hugin, served as an energy sensor to suppress sweet sensation. Therefore, these data identify hugin+ neuron as a central energy sensor responsible for regulating sweet sensation across species.

">Mice and humans evaluate odor stimulus strength using common psychophysical principles</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems translate physical stimuli from the environment--such as light, sound, or chemicals--into signals that the brain can interpret. Across these systems, the amplitude of a stimulus is represented by its perceived intensity (Stevens 1957). While previous research has largely focused on understanding how physical stimuli are represented in the brain, the neural representation of perceptual variables like stimulus intensity remains less explored. This is primarily due to the difficulty in measuring perceptual responses in animal models, where neural recordings are more accessible. In this study, we use mouse olfaction as a model system to develop a framework for measuring perceived odor intensity. We begin by employing a two-odor concentration classification task to demonstrate that both mice and humans assess stimulus amplitude using a common perceptual scale. We then show that this scale corresponds to intensity. Finally, we apply this method to determine iso-intense concentrations of different odorants in mice. Our approach offers a powerful tool for testing hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying perceived odor intensity, potentially enhancing our understanding of olfactory processing and its neural substrates.

">From berries to brain: Assessing the impact of (poly)phenols in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                The growing burden of chronic neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), particularly Parkinson's disease (PD), prompts the need for effective preventive strategies and treatments. Dietary (poly)phenols have emerged for their neuroprotective potential. This study investigated a (poly)phenol-enriched diet, comprising a berry mixture, to counteract key PD hallmarks in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice and elucidate the phenolic metabolic fingerprint underlying these effects. The berry-enriched diet prevented motor deficits in the MPTP mice model, preserved dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, reduced glial activation and gene expression of inflammatory cytokines. Notably, berries also attenuated macrophage infiltration observed in the substantia nigra 7 days post-MPTP. Metabolomic analysis revealed distinct phenolic signatures in plasma and brain tissue between standard- and berry-fed mice. Overall, this pioneering study provides compelling evidence that a (poly)phenol-enriched diet may play a protective role in neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its potential for future strategies to prevent or slow PD progression.

">Drosophila Pyruvate Kinase Links Metabolic State with Circadian Output via TARANIS and PDF</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock generates ~24-hour rhythms that anticipate daily environmental changes. Circadian clock and glucose metabolism are tightly interconnected, and both are disrupted in aging and disease. To examine how glucose hypometabolism impacts circadian rhythm, we downregulated glycolytic enzymes - Hexokinase-C (Hex-C), Phosphofructokinase (Pfk), and Pyruvate kinase (Pyk) - in Drosophila clock cells. Only Hex-C and Pyk knock-down (KD) altered period, lengthening and shortening rhythms, respectively. Notably, Pyk KD induced period shortening persisted in adult-specific KD (AKD), indicating a role independent of developmental effects. Pyk AKD reduced both PERIOD and Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) protein levels, with PDF loss driving the short-period phenotype. Mechanistically, the transcriptional co-regulator TARANIS (TARA) was required: Pyk AKD lowered tara expression, while tara overexpression rescued PDF and circadian period. Our findings identify a novel PYK-TARA-PDF regulatory axis linking glycolytic activity to circadian neuropeptide output, providing mechanistic insight into how metabolic dysfunction contributes to circadian disruption in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

">Multiple scales of coordination along the body axis during Drosophila larval locomotion</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated movement along the body axis is critical to locomotion. In segmented, limbless animals, anterior (head) and posterior (tail) segments play different roles in locomotion, leading to a need for flexible coordination across body regions. Larval Drosophila melanogaster present a tractable experimental model for limbless, segmented crawling given the extensive genetic tools available and the optical clarity of the body. Prior work has suggested that, during crawling, all larval body segments contract similarly, despite the fact that each crawl cycle comprises two overlapping phases: an piston involving the most posterior segments, and a peristaltic wave involving all body segments. To test whether coordination varies regionally during locomotion, we expressed GCaMP in all body wall muscles, and recorded segmental contraction kinematics and muscle recruitment during many cycles of locomotion in linear channels. Facilitated by machine vision techniques, we discovered new features of larval crawling at multiple scales. First, the propagation of both contraction and recruitment waves slowed approaching mid-body segments, then sped up towards the head. Second, the timing relationship between contraction and recruitment waves could be highly variable in anterior segments. Third, contraction durations showed particularly strong intersegmental correlations among posterior segments. These data suggest posterior segments coordinately power the piston phase while anterior segments tolerate greater flexibility to enable reorienting behaviors. Our results depict an unanticipated degree of axial heterogeneity in the coordination of limbless crawling, opening new avenues to study the origins of whole body coordination and the consequences of segmental diversity for locomotion.

">An Explainable Web-Based Diagnostic System for Alzheimer's Disease Using XRAI and Deep Learning on Brain MRI</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by cognitive decline and memory loss. Despite advancements in AI-driven neuroimaging analysis for AD detection, clinical deployment remains limited due to challenges in model interpretability and usability. Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks such as XRAI offer potential to bridge this gap by providing clinically meaningful visualizations of model decision-making. Methods: This study developed a comprehensive, clinically deployable AI system for AD severity classification using 2D brain MRI data. Three deep learning architectures MobileNet-V3 Large, EfficientNet-B4, and ResNet-50 were trained on an augmented Kaggle dataset (33,984 images across four AD severity classes). The models were evaluated on both augmented and original datasets, with integrated XRAI explainability providing region-based attribution maps. A web-based clinical interface was built using Gradio to deliver real-time predictions and visual explanations. Results: MobileNet-V3 achieved the highest accuracy (99.18% on the augmented test set; 99.47% on the original dataset), while using the fewest parameters (4.2M), confirming its efficiency and suitability for clinical use. XRAI visualizations aligned with known neuroanatomical patterns of AD progression, enhancing clinical interpretability. The web interface delivered sub-20 second inference with high classification confidence across all AD severity levels, successfully supporting real-world diagnostic workflows. Conclusion: This research presents the first systematic integration of XRAI into AD severity classification using MRI and deep learning. The MobileNet-V3-based system offers high accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability through a user-friendly clinical interface. These contributions demonstrate a practical pathway toward real-world adoption of explainable AI for early and accurate Alzheimer's disease detection.

We encountered four such cases among 397 banked brains, with the donors died of hematological malignances (blood cancers) or cardiovascular diseases. To explore the pathological implications, we examined 17 brains (10-87 year-old, y) from blood cancer patients and three (52-82 y) with cardiovascular diseases, focusing on vascular injury, axonal pathology and A{beta} formation. A{beta} plaques occurred in two adult brains (31 y, 63 y) with blood cancers and two (52 y, 65 y) with cardiovascular diseases in the absence of tau. In the blood cancer brains, 17/17 had vascular injuries seen in hematoxylin-eosin stained sections, 13/17 had iron leakage, and 13/17 had axonal pathology. Malignant cell infiltration was found in 5/14 brains with myeloid, lymphocytic and lymphoma malignances, with light chain infiltration in 3/3 brains with multiple myeloma. In the cardiovascular disease brains, A{beta} deposition primarily as diffuse plaques occurred in the cerebral cortex, with vascular and axonal pathologies in the white matter, striatum and internal capsule. Using a multi-labeling approach, the injury/stress induced axonal pathology was found to concur with {beta}-amyloid processor protein elevation and enhanced {beta}-secretase 1 processing but not intraneuronal A{beta} accumulation. The current findings suggest that hematological malignances and cardiovascular diseases are risk conditions for early-onset cerebral {beta}-amyloidosis, potentially attributable to vascular injury.

">Temperature Induced Codimension-One and Codimension-Two Bifurcations in Hodgkin-Huxley Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Temperature fluctuations can have detrimental effects on the firing pattern and electrical activity of biological neurons, eliciting diverse responses depending on the neuronal cell types and the underlying ion channels exhibited. Using the classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, we performed a comprehensive dynamical systems analysis to determine how temperature fluctuations alter neuronal excitability, spike morphology, and bifurcation structure. We first relied on experimentally-derived temperature coefficients, or Q10 values, associated with gating kinetics and conductances, and examined codimension-1 and codimension-2 bifurcations across a range of temperatures and standard HH parameters governing the intrinsic properties (firing frequency, spike amplitude, spike width, afterhyperpolarization (AHP), time-to-peak AHP, etc) of the model HH neuron. Our analysis revealed that increasing temperature accelerates gating dynamics, leading to narrower and higher-frequency spikes but reduced amplitudes, and ultimately to a loss of sustained firing via temperature-induced depolarization block. We identified generalized Hopf (Bautin) bifurcations as critical boundaries beyond which the system becomes strictly monostable. Extending the model to independently scale sodium activation, sodium inactivation, and potassium activation kinetics showed that excitability is particularly sensitive to potassium gating dynamics. Our findings provide a quantitative framework for understanding temperature modulations of neuronal activity, highlighting how temperature reshapes the excitability landscape, unveiling the intricate interplays between the activation/inactivation kinetics of ion channels, and identifying key parameters governing temperature robustness in neuronal models.

">Transcriptional Interference Gates Monogenic Odorant Receptor Expression in Ants</a></h4>

              
                Communication is crucial to social life, and in ants, it is mediated primarily through olfaction. Ants have more odorant receptor (OR) genes than any other group of insects, generated through tandem duplications that produce large genomic arrays of related genes. However, how olfactory sensory neurons produce a single functional OR from these arrays remains unclear. In ants, only mRNA from one OR in an array is exported into the cytoplasm, while upstream genes are silent and transcripts from downstream genes remain nuclear. Here, we show that non-canonical readthrough transcription in the downstream direction generates non-translated transcripts. We also find that OR promoters are bidirectional, producing antisense long non-coding RNAs that appear to suppress the expression of upstream genes. Finally, we present evidence that this regulatory architecture is conserved across ants and bees, suggesting that this mechanism for functionally monogenic OR expression is widespread in insects with expanded OR repertoires.

">Pathology-Specific Modulation of Corticostriatal Circuitry by Chronic Alcohol Consumption in Alzheimers Disease Mouse Models</a></h4>

              
                Chronic alcohol use is a major modifiable risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD), yet the mechanisms by which it modulates AD pathophysiology remain unclear. Here, we examined circuit-level and pathological changes in two distinct AD mouse models, humanized Abeta; knock-in (hAPP-KI) (Abeta;-driven) and PS19 (tau-driven), subjected to a chronic intermittent alcohol exposure paradigm. In hAPP-KI mice, alcohol increased Abeta; accumulation and excitatory transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) while reducing corticostriatal transmission and striatal cholinergic output. These alterations were accompanied by enhanced recruitment of microglia around A{beta} plaques. In contrast, alcohol-exposed PS19 mice displayed elevated mPFC-to-dorsomedial striatum (DMS) glutamatergic transmission and increased tau phosphorylation without significant changes in microglial activation or local mPFC excitatory drive. In wild-type mice, microglial depletion enhanced glutamatergic transmission onto cortical neurons, suggesting a homeostatic role for microglia in maintaining excitatory balance. Together, these findings reveal pathology-specific effects of alcohol on circuit dysfunction and propose microglia as an important modulator of alcohol-induced synaptic remodeling in the early stage of AD.

">Distributed Cortical Network Dynamics of Binocular Convergent Eye Movements in Humans</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging studies in humans have localized brain functions to specific brain regions, but a recent shift toward distributed network-based models of brain function promises deeper insights into the network processes that generate brain functionality. Resting-state functional connectivity provides a rich mapping of the brain's network architecture, linking with both underlying structure and task-evoked responses across the whole brain. In this study, we utilized a model based on propagation of task-evoked activations over resting-state functional connectivity networks to identify cortical contributions to localized functional brain activations associated with binocular convergent eye movements. Binocular vision is crucial for daily routine activities, with its impairment leading to significant challenges in daily life. The distributed network-level mechanisms of binocular convergent eye movements remain unknown. Results showed that mapping activity flow over brain connections accurately generated actual brain activations associated with convergent eye movements, which were distinct from those observed during control tasks. The visual and dorsal attention networks dominated the propagation of activations through resting-state connections during convergent eye movements. Submodel analyses further revealed that restricting activity flow to individual networks, such as the visual or dorsal attention systems alone, substantially reduced model accuracy, underscoring the necessity of distributed, whole-brain contributions. In conclusion, highly distributed network pathways are involved in convergent eye movements, with some pathways contributing much more than others, providing important implications for future clinical models of binocular dysfunction.

                Developmental delay and seizures with or without movement abnormalities (OMIM 617836) caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in the DHDDS gene (DHDDS-CDG) is a rare genetic disease that belongs to the progressive encephalopathy spectrum. It results in developmental delay in affected children, accompanied by myoclonus, seizures, ataxia and tremor, which worsens over time. DHDDS encodes a subunit of a DHDDS/NUS1 cis-prenyltransferase (cis-PTase), a branch point enzyme of the mevalonate pathway essential for N-linked glycosylation. We describe the first mouse model of this disease, DhddsR37H+/- strain, heterozygous for the human recurrent de novo c.110G>A:p.R37H pathogenic variant. DhddsR37H+/- mice present with seizures, myoclonus and memory deficits associated with reduced density or/and maturity of inhibitory interneurons in the cortex. Multiomics analyses of mouse CNS tissues, together with the enzymatic/structural characterization of the R37H DHDDS mutant protein, reveal that the variant produces a catalytically inactive enzyme and results in a brain dolichol deficit, aberrant glycosylation of brain glycoproteins, including those involved in synaptic transmission, and major perturbations in the CNS proteome and lipidome. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor clinically approved for treatment of glaucoma, epilepsy, and intracranial hypertension, and successfully used off-label to treat genetic movement disorders, drastically reduces seizure susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol in DhddsR37H+/- mice, suggesting potential therapeutic value of using this drug in human DHDDS-CDG patients. Together, our results define cis-PTase as a master regulator of CNS development and function and establish that its monoallelic debilitating variants cause a novel Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation, associated with aberrant levels of neuronal proteins and lipids.

">Age-related differences in the cortical motor network during uni-manual and bimanual coordination - an EEG study</a></h4>

              
                Aging is accompanied by various neurophysiological changes that may affect cognitive and motor function. Compared to younger adults, motor performance in older adults engages more brain regions and exhibits elevated neural activity in the motor-related alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) frequency bands of electro-encephalography (EEG) signals. To what extent these functional changes correlate with the quality of motor performance is underexplored. We recorded EEG in 19 young and 19 older adults during unimanual and bimanual visuomotor tasks with different degrees of difficulty. Older participants showed a lower quality of performance than younger adults, especially during asymmetric bimanual tasks. We analyzed source-localized activity in bilateral parietal and (pre-)motor areas to investigate, especially, the hypothesized pivotal role of left premotor cortex (PMCL) activity within the motor network during motor performance. In PMCL, beta activity was indeed significantly affected by age during bimanual performance, while alpha activity was altered in the bilateral (pre-)cuneus. When predicting error of performance via alpha and beta modulations, we found significant associations in bilateral M1 and (pre-)cuneusR during unimanual performance, while in bimanual performance, PMCL and (pre-)cuneusL were also included in the significant association. Our results confirm the importance of PMCL and (pre-)cuneusL for the performance of bimanual tasks, especially when the tasks are challenging. The age-related differences in alpha power in bilateral (pre-)cuneus and their associations with motor performance suggest that altered visuomotor integration has an important contribution to the reduction of the quality of motor performance in older adults.

">The neuro-ocular costs of texting during driving</a></h4>

              
                Texting while driving is among the most dangerous forms of distraction, yet the neurophysiological mechanisms linking cognitive load, gaze control, and driving behavior remain poorly understood. Here, EEG, eye tracking, head kinematics, and driving performance were recorded in a naturalistic driving task while participants solved arithmetic problems presented on a dashboard-mounted display under low and high working-memory (WM) load, mimicking real-world interaction with dashboard media. High WM load resulted in slower reaction times, reduced accuracy, prolonged gaze toward the stimulus, increased corrective head rotations, and compensatory reductions in driving speed. Time-frequency analysis revealed robust alpha power suppression (~8-13 Hz) over occipito-parietal regions scaling with WM load and closely paralleling gaze behavior. Source reconstruction further identified a transient, stimulus-locked increase in oscillatory power at ~15 Hz involving the ipsilateral cerebellum and posterior parietal preceding the head rotation onset. These findings illuminate the time course of a neuro-ocular action circuit involving cerebellum and cortex as candidate neurophysiological precursor of upcoming behavioral costs as a result of driver distraction. Bridging cognitive neuroscience and applied traffic research, the present results provide an ecologically valid framework for studying action-attention coupling in realworld behavior.

">Epigenetic Reactivation of CNS Endothelial Developmental Programs Triggers Adult Brain Angiogenesis, Promotes Post-Stroke Revascularization and Neuronal Regeneration.</a></h4>

              
                Therapeutic angiogenesis is essential for regenerating brain tissue damaged by stroke, yet it remains an unmet clinical challenge. During brain development, pro-angiogenic genes drive the formation of vascular networks, with their expression tightly regulated in later stages. We found that in adult CNS endothelial cells (ECs), angiogenesis-related genes are epigenetically silenced through histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Conditional deletion of Hdac2 in ECs reactivated pro-angiogenic signaling, including Wnt/{beta}-catenin target genes, leading to functional neovascularization with preserved blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in the adult brain. In contrast, Ezh2 (PRC2 subunit) deletion reduced vessel density and compromised BBB function. Deletion of Hdac2 and Ezh2 immediately after transient ischemic stroke conferred vascular protection by modulating stroke-induced transcriptional programs in CNS ECs. In contrast, delayed deletion, initiated seven days post-stroke, after significant neuronal loss in the infarct region, induced robust revascularization and promoted post-stroke neurogenesis, with differentiation into both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. These findings highlight CNS EC HDAC2 as a promising therapeutic target for inducing adult brain angiogenesis, facilitating revascularization, and supporting neuronal regeneration following stroke.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Brain commissures are antiparallel white matter fiber bundles that connect both hemispheres across the midsagittal plane at different anatomical levels. In the mammalian brain, the best-known commissures are the corpus callosum, the anterior and the posterior commissures. Recent studies have identified a new white matter pathway, the thalamic commissures (TCs), that connect the cortex to the contralateral thalamus in rodents and primates. However, the specific cortical regions that project via the TCs and their target thalamic nuclei are still unknown. To thoroughly and accurately map this projectome, we utilized the mouse Allen Brain Institute connectivity atlas. Our results indicate that not all cortical regions project via the TCs, with most of these regions concentrated in the rostral portion of the brain. In addition, our data suggest that the TCs projections are very numerous, although less robust than the ipsilateral counterpart. Furthermore, these projections had a high degree of bilateral symmetry. We did not find any projections from the thalamus to the contralateral cortex, suggesting that the TCs are not reciprocal. Our findings reinforce the concept of the thalamus as an interhemispheric connectivity hub and suggest that the TCs might play a role in interhemispheric functional modulation.</span>

This study describes movements elicited from long-train intracortical microstimulation in the greater galago (<span style="font-style:italic;">Otolemur garnettii</span>) in area 3b and adjacent frontal and parietal cortical fields. We found that the representation of forelimb digits was exceptionally small relative to other primate species, while tongue representations were enlarged—possibly an adaptation for frugivory. We discuss these findings in relation to primate behavioral variation, and highlight features of movement representations in 3b and M1 that are common to all mammals studied using similar methods.</span>

                <p>Cognitive, social behavior, speech, and motor skills are known challenges for people with trisomy 21/Down syndrome (DS), but the precise mechanisms that lead to these impactful changes have not yet been described. Data from human and mouse model fetal brains indicate that alterations in prenatal neurogenesis might account for the neurological phenotypes that manifest after birth. Here, we evaluated key features of cortical neurogenesis in the humanized mouse model of DS (TcMAC21 of undetermined sex) to test whether and how the presence of the human HSA21q transchromosome impacts cortical development. Brain growth measurements throughout the second half of gestation and at several periods of postnatal development show overall that the TcMAC21 brain phenotype is less severe than in other DS mouse models that have less genetic similarity to humans with DS. However, despite the lack of gross changes in brain growth, we uncovered a significant temporally limited neurogenesis defect at midgestation that correlates with long-lasting effects on neuronal dispersion and neuronal function in the neocortex. Using Cre/Lox-mediated genetic fate mapping, we discovered a transient reduction in neocortical basal intermediate progenitor cells (bIPCs) and that bIPC neuronal progeny are underrepresented in the superficial layers of the neocortex. This change in neuronal production is associated with cortical activity changes after birth. Altogether, our data isolate the cell types associated with a very specific temporal change in cortical formation that, due to the high levels of excitability of bIPC-derived neurons, creates lasting effects on network activity and circuit development in trisomic brains.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0050252025?rss=1">Isolating Brain Mechanisms of Expectancy Effects on Pain: Cue-Based Stimulus Expectancies versus Placebo-Based Treatment Expectancies</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clinical trials, laboratory experiments, and neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence that pain is highly sensitive to expectations, whether based on the psychosocial context surrounding treatment (e.g., placebo analgesia) or transient cues that provide information about painful events (e.g., pain-predictive cues). We asked whether placebo analgesia and pain-predictive cues modulate pain through the same mechanisms or dissociable brain pathways. Forty healthy volunteers of both sexes rated pain in response to noxious heat during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We crossed pain-predictive cues, which induce expectations for high or low pain on a trial-by-trial basis, with administration of an inert placebo cream or a control cream. Behavioral analyses revealed a significant interaction, such that predictive cues had weaker effects on pain during placebo blocks than control blocks. This interaction was accompanied by interactions in the insula, pons, and other brain regions. We also observed distinct neural substrates when we compared pure cue effects with pure placebo effects, and only predictive cues modulated responses in nociceptive regions and the neurologic pain signature (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B49">Wager et al., 2013</cross-ref>). The only regions that were influenced similarly by both types of expectations were the rostral anterior cingulate and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that cue-based expectations about stimulus intensity and placebo-based expectations about treatment outcomes are distinct and that pain researchers should differentiate between sources of expectations. Furthermore, cue-based expectations were associated with more consistent effects than treatment-based expectations, suggesting that clinicians should be particularly mindful of how they present information about impending pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0089252025?rss=1">Locally Induced Traveling Waves Generate Globally Observable Traveling Waves</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical traveling waves have been proposed as a fundamental mechanism for neural communication and computation. Methodological uncertainties currently limit the interpretability of noninvasive, extracranial traveling wave data, sparking debates about their cortical origin. Studies using EEG or MEG typically report waves that cover large portions of the sensor array which are often interpreted as reflecting long range cortical waves. Meanwhile, invasive, intracranial recordings in humans and animals routinely find both local, mesoscopic waves and large-scale, macroscopic waves in cortex. Whether the global sensor array waves found with EEG/MEG necessarily correspond to macroscopic cortical waves or whether they are merely projections of local dynamics remains unclear. In this study, we made use of the well-established retinotopic organization of early visual cortex to generate traveling waves with known properties in human participants (<I>N</I> = 19, 10 female, 9 male) via targeted visual stimulation, while simultaneously recording MEG and EEG. The inducer stimuli were designed to elicit waves whose traveling direction in mesoscopic retinotopic visual areas depends on stimulus direction, while leaving macroscopic activation patterns along the visual hierarchy largely unchanged. We observed that the preferred direction of traveling waves across the sensor array was influenced by that of the visual stimulus, but only at the stimulation frequency. Comparison between single-trial and trial-averaged responses further showed considerable temporal variation in traveling wave patterns across trials. Our results highlight that under tight experimental control, noninvasive, extracranial recordings can recover mesoscopic traveling wave activity, thus making them viable tools for the investigation of spatially constrained wave dynamics.</p>

                <p>Visual resolution, contrast sensitivity, and form perception improve gradually with age. In nonhuman primates, the sensitivity and resolution of cells in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, and primary visual cortex (V1) also improve, but not enough to account for the perceptual changes. So, what aspects of visual system development limit visual sensitivity in infants? Improvements in behavioral sensitivity might arise from maturation of regions downstream of V1 such as V2, V4, and IT, which are thought to support increasingly complex perceptual abilities. We recorded the responses of populations of neurons in areas V1, V2, V4, and PIT to radial frequency patterns&mdash;a type of global form stimulus. Subjects were three young monkeys (two female, one male) between the ages of 19 and 54&nbsp;weeks and a single adult animal (male). We found that neurons and neural populations in V4 reliably encoded global form in radial frequency stimuli at the earliest ages we studied, while V1 neurons do not. V2 and PIT populations also showed some degree of selectivity for these patterns at early ages, especially at higher radial frequency values. We did not find significant, systematic changes in neural decoding performance that could account for the improvement in behavioral performance over the same age range in an overlapping group of animals (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B68">Rodriguez Deliz et al., 2024</cross-ref>). Finally, consistent with our prior behavioral results, neural populations in V4 show highest sensitivity for the higher radial frequency values, which contain the highest concentration of curvature and orientation cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/34/e0381252025?rss=1">Increased Sleep Spindles in Regions Engaged during Motor Learning Predict Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sleep spindles play a critical role in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Although spindles can occur widely across the cortex, they are often focal. Focal spindles may promote plasticity in distinct circuits to consolidate specific memory types. In this study, we simultaneously acquired EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 25 healthy adults (six females) during daytime naps to investigate whether learning the finger tapping motor sequence task (MST) preferentially increases spindle density (#/min) within cortical regions engaged during task performance and whether these task-related spindle increases predict performance improvement measured after the nap. We employed a novel algorithm to project EEG/MEG signals into source space using anatomical constraints from MRI and detected spindles in cortical regions. Compared with a baseline nap, MST training preferentially increased spindle density in regions engaged while learning, which in turn predicted postnap performance improvement. Learning during training and postnap improvement were not correlated, suggesting that they reflect discrete processes. They also had different neural correlates. Whereas learning during training correlated with spindle density increases in motor execution regions, postnap improvement correlated with increases in motor planning regions. We speculate that spindles in motor execution regions represent the memory, while those in planning regions enhance future performance. Our findings demonstrate that spindle expression is influenced by prior learning and support the theory that spindles in task-related regions promote the neural plasticity necessary for motor memory consolidation. We propose that spindles in task-related regions may be more sensitive biomarkers of learning and sleep-dependent memory consolidation than those occurring elsewhere.</p>

                <p>While transient changes in synaptic strength occurring during the repetitive firing of primary afferent inputs to the spinal superficial dorsal horn (SDH) are predicted to strongly influence the fidelity with which nociceptive signals are transmitted through the SDH network, little is known about whether the properties of short-term plasticity (STP) at sensory synapses depend on the identity of the postsynaptic target or whether STP is under the control of neuromodulators such as dopamine. Here we investigate these issues using ex vivo patch-clamp recordings from identified lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons, inhibitory interneurons (VGAT+), and putative excitatory interneurons (VGAT&ndash;) in spinal cord slices from adult mice of both sexes. Repeated activation of A-fiber inputs to the SDH evoked short-term depression (STD) across all major subtypes of SDH neurons, although the magnitude of STD was greatest in projection neurons with high-frequency stimulation. Meanwhile, repetitive activation of C-fiber synapses onto GABAergic interneurons evoked more pronounced STD compared with excitatory neurons across a range of stimulation frequencies. Both A-fiber and C-fiber synapses recovered from STD at a similar rate across the different SDH cell types examined. Dopamine (20&nbsp;&micro;M) significantly depressed the overall glutamatergic drive, and reduced afferent-evoked firing, selectively in spinoparabrachial neurons and excitatory interneurons without changes in the properties of STP. Collectively, these findings reveal novel potential mechanisms by which the efficacy of the spinal inhibitory "gate," and thus the gain of ascending nociceptive transmission to the brain, may be rapidly altered during periods of strong sensory input to the SDH network.</p>

                <p>Mutations in <I>ARL13B</I> lead to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy with neurological and retinal abnormalities. In photoreceptors, ARL13B localizes to the connecting cilia and outer segments. However, the specific function and the need for ARL13B in photoreceptor cilia remain unclear. We used a knock-in mouse model with the <I>Arl13b</I> V358A mutation, which disrupts ciliary localization while preserving guanine exchange factor (GEF) activity, to investigate the role of ARL13B in the photoreceptor cilia. Using female and male littermates, we show by electroretinogram (ERG) that the exclusion of ARL13B from photoreceptor cilia leads to an early loss of cone-mediated vision followed by a decline in rod-mediated vision. This phenotype was unique to the cilia-excluded V358A model, as analysis using the GEF-impaired R79Q model did not show similar changes in photoreceptor function. Morphological analyses using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and transmission electron microscopy revealed shortened cone axonemes and structural abnormalities in cone outer segments. IHC staining further demonstrated that loss of ciliary ARL13B disrupts the localization of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88) in photoreceptors. In addition, the phosphoinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<SUB>2</SUB>) binding protein, Tubby-like protein 1 (TULP1), associated with inherited retinal diseases, was mislocalized to cone outer segments in the V358A model. These findings establish an essential role for ciliaryARL13B in maintaining cone photoreceptor axoneme length, outer segment organization, and proper protein localization. They also suggest that phosphoinositide gradients are critical for cone photoreceptor function and morphology. Together, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating photoreceptor cilia and the pathogenesis of ciliopathies.</p>

                <p>Alternative mRNA splicing generates transcriptomic diversity to direct tissue-specific functions. There is a high level of alternative splicing in the brain during embryonic development, but the master regulators of this process are poorly understood. One key splicing event in neuronal differentiation is the inclusion of a microexon in the SH3 domain of the ubiquitous tyrosine kinase, C-SRC, to yield the constitutively active, neural-specific N1-SRC kinase. We previously demonstrated that specific inhibition of N1-SRC in developing <I>Xenopus</I> embryos inhibits neurogenesis, but the targets and mode of action of N1-SRC were unknown. In the current study, we screened for N1-SRC SH3 domain interactors, surprisingly finding no unique targets compared with the C-SRC SH3 domain, but rather a subset of binding partners, enriched in splicing regulators. Analysis of public phosphoproteomic data revealed that SRC-dependent phosphorylation of the splicing machinery is widespread and enriched in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). To investigate whether N1-SRC-dependent regulation of splicing underpins its role in neurogenesis, we undertook long- and short-read RNA-seq analysis of N1-SRC knockdown <I>Xenopus</I> embryos. We observed an upregulation of splicing factor expression and aberrant splicing of splicing regulators, principally HNRNPA1 and TRA2A. The affected splice junctions in both genes are in their glycine-rich C-termini, and junctions contain putative binding sites for SFPQ/NONO and FUS RBPs. Both SFPQ and FUS are SRC substrates, suggesting a mechanism by which N1-SRC knockdown leads to mis-splicing of HNRNPA1 and TRA2A. Thus, the neuronal splicing of C-SRC to generate N1-SRC regulates the alternative splicing landscape during neurogenesis.</p>

                <p>A central component of wayfinding is the ability to maintain a consistent representation of one's facing direction (FD) when moving about the world. In rodents, head direction cells are believed to support this "neural compass," but identifying a similar mechanism in humans during dynamic naturalistic navigation has been challenging. To address this issue, we acquired fMRI data from male and female human participants while they freely navigated through a virtual reality city. Encoding model analyses revealed voxel clusters in the posterior&ndash;medial cortex (the "retrosplenial complex") and superior parietal lobule that exhibited reliable tuning as a function of FD. Crucially, these directional tunings were consistent across perceptually different versions of the city, spatially separated locations within the city, and motivationally distinct phases of the behavioral task. Analysis of the model weights indicated that these regions represent a broad range of possible FDs and that they do so by representing heading relative to the principal axis of the environment. These findings reveal specific mechanisms in the human brain that allow us to maintain a sense of direction during naturalistic, dynamic navigation.</p>

                <p>Neurite initiation from newly born neurons is a critical step in neuronal differentiation and migration. Neuronal migration in the developing cortex is accompanied by dynamic extension and retraction of neurites as neurons progress through bipolar and multipolar states. However, there is a relative lack of understanding regarding how the dynamic extension and retraction of neurites is regulated during neuronal migration. In recent work, we have shown that Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4), a member of the F-BAR family of membrane-bending proteins, inhibits cortical neurite formation in culture, while family member formin binding protein 17 (FBP17) induces premature neurite outgrowth. These results beg the question of how CIP4 and FBP17 function in radial neuron migration and differentiation in vivo, including the timing and manner of neurite extension and retraction. Indeed, the regulation of neurite outgrowth is essential for the transitions between bipolar and multipolar states during radial migration. To examine the effects of modulating expression of CIP4 and FBP17 in vivo, we used in utero electroporation, in combination with our published Double UP technique, to compare knockdown or overexpression cells with control cells within the same mouse tissue of either sex. We show that either knockdown or overexpression of CIP4 and FBP17 results in the marked disruption of radial neuron migration by modulating neuronal morphology and neurite outgrowth, consistent with our findings in culture. Our results demonstrate that the F-BAR proteins CIP4 and FBP17 are essential for proper radial migration in the developing cortex and thus play a key role in cortical development.</p>

                <p>by Elliot M.R. Vincent, Edward M. Hill, Stephen Parnell</p>

Reducing reliance on pesticides is an important global challenge. With increasing constraints on their use, in recent years there has been a declining trend in pesticide use for arable crops in the UK. But with increasing disease pressures and global demand for food, there is a greater need for effective measures of pest and disease control. These circumstances highlight the need for widespread adoption of sustainable alternative control measures. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is one such solution, comprising a set of management strategies which focus on the long-term prevention, detection and control of pests, weeds and diseases. While many of these methods are acknowledged to offer effective control, their implementation has thus far been limited in practice. As a case study we considered Septoria tritici blotch (STB) (<i>Zymoseptoria tritici</i>), an economically important disease of wheat. We used epidemiological modelling techniques to investigate the potential of different IPM control strategies (crop residue burial, delayed sowing, variety mixtures and biocontrols). Combining existing data with a deterministic, compartmental infectious disease model of STB transmission, we simulated the implementation of an IPM regime into the STB disease system. We investigated the outcomes on disease prevalence and crop yield when comparing conventional and IPM control regimes. In a single field, for the individual implementation of IPM measures we found the starkest difference in potential yield outcomes between delayed sowing and biocontrols (greatest yields), and crop residue burial and variety mixtures (lowest yields). We also found that the collective use of IPM measures has the potential to offer individual growers comparable control to a standard fungicide regime. For a multi-field setting, representing a community of crop growers, a high proportion of growers using IPM can reduce the level of external infection incurred by the growers who maintain a fungicide regime.

Memories can involuntarily come to mind out of nowhere. These spontaneous flashes often feel vivid and emotionally powerful. A new study in PLOS Biology reveals that involuntary and voluntary memory rely on distinct brain mechanisms.

Involuntary memories come on spontaneously and can feel vivid and emotionally powerful. This Primer highlights a recent PLOS Biology study showing that involuntary and voluntary memory recall rely on distinct neural processes.

                <p>by Philip Ruthig, David Edler v.d. Planitz, Maria Morozova, Katja Reimann, Carsten Jäger, Tilo Reinert, Siawoosh Mohammadi, Nikolaus Weiskopf, Evgeniya Kirilina, Markus Morawski</p>

The size and complexity of the human brain require optimally sized and myelinated fibers. White matter fibers facilitate fast communication between distant areas, but also connect adjacent cortical regions via short association fibers. The difference in length and packing density of long and short association fibers pose different requirements on their optimal size and degree of myelination. The fundamental questions of (i) how thick the short association fibers are and (ii) how strongly they are myelinated as compared to long fibers, however, remain unanswered. We present a comprehensive two-dimensional transmission electron microscopic analysis of ~400,000 fibers of human white matter regions with long (corpus callosum) and short fibers (superficial white matter). Using a deep learning approach, we demonstrate a substantially higher fiber diameter and higher myelination thickness (both approximately 25% higher) in corpus callosum than in superficial white matter. Surprisingly, we do not find a difference in the ratio between axon diameter and myelin thickness (g-ratio), which is close to the theoretically optimal value of ~0.6 in both areas (0.54). This work reveals a fundamental principle of brain organization that provides a key foundation for understanding the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78006?af=R">Brain Endothelial Soluble ST2 Production and Cerebral Edema in a Rat Model of Ischemic Stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>No current therapy prevents swelling after ischemic stroke, and pathways leading to edema formation are not completely understood. We have found the immune regulator soluble ST2 (sST2) to be a candidate mediator of edema formation. In the current study, we sought to identify a mechanistic relationship between sST2 and edema in ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a proteomics survey for plasma biomarkers of edema in patients with large ischemic stroke and verified associations with outcome. We performed middle-cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats and measured sST2 expression. We used both in vitro and in vivo techniques to determine the cellular source of sST2. We generated a sST2 knockout rat line and performed MCAO to determine the effect of knockout on brain edema, endothelial and microglial gene expression, and blood–brain barrier integrity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found sST2 to be associated with edema, outcome and mortality after large ischemic stroke. We replicated the elevation in plasma sST2 in a rat model of stroke and found brain endothelium as the cell type with highest expression. Knockout of sST2 did not alter lesion volume but was associated with reduced swelling and increased staining for the tight junction protein zona occludens 1 (ZO-1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Plasma sST2 level is associated with edema, functional outcome, and mortality after ischemic stroke. Knockout of sST2 reduced post-stroke cerebral edema and was associated with increased staining for the tight junction protein ZO-1. These findings establish a mechanistic link between sST2 and brain edema and highlight its potential as a future therapeutic target. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Nimkar and colleagues present a flatmount spatial transcriptomics platform for mapping the distribution of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types. The analysis uncovers systematic topographic biases among RGC types and identifies perivascular RGC types surviving preferentially after experimental glaucoma. The results highlight neuroprotective roles of perivascular niche in the retina.

                Xu et al. identify the chromatin remodeler RSC1 as a key regulator of shaping open chromatin architecture in Magnaporthe oryzae. RSC1 restricts H3K27me3 spreading by positively modulating the abundance of a histone H3K27 demethylase JMJ1 and promotes transcriptional activation by recognizing acetylated histones and recruiting histone acetyltransferase GCN5b.
