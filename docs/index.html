                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/TGqmqUk3vGI/article">Bayesian refinement of protein structures and ensembles against SAXS data using molecular dynamics</a></h4>

<p>by Roman Shevchuk, Jochen S. Hub</p>

Small-angle X-ray scattering is an increasingly popular technique used to detect protein structures and ensembles in solution. However, the refinement of structures and ensembles against SAXS data is often ambiguous due to the low information content of SAXS data, unknown systematic errors, and unknown scattering contributions from the solvent. We offer a solution to such problems by combining Bayesian inference with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and explicit-solvent SAXS calculations. The Bayesian formulation correctly weights the SAXS data versus prior physical knowledge, it quantifies the precision or ambiguity of fitted structures and ensembles, and it accounts for unknown systematic errors due to poor buffer matching. The method further provides a probabilistic criterion for identifying the number of states required to explain the SAXS data. The method is validated by refining ensembles of a periplasmic binding protein against calculated SAXS curves. Subsequently, we derive the solution ensembles of the eukaryotic chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) against experimental SAXS data. We find that the SAXS data of the apo state of Hsp90 is compatible with a single wide-open conformation, whereas the SAXS data of Hsp90 bound to ATP or to an ATP-analogue strongly suggests heterogenous ensembles of a closed and a wide-open state.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TGqmqUk3vGI" width="1" />

<p>by Cen Wan, Jonathan G. Lees, Federico Minneci, Christine A. Orengo, David T. Jones</p>

Accurate gene or protein function prediction is a key challenge in the post-genome era. Most current methods perform well on molecular function prediction, but struggle to provide useful annotations relating to biological process functions due to the limited power of sequence-based features in that functional domain. In this work, we systematically evaluate the predictive power of temporal transcription expression profiles for protein function prediction in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Our results show significantly better performance on predicting protein function when transcription expression profile-based features are integrated with sequence-derived features, compared with the sequence-derived features alone. We also observe that the combination of expression-based and sequence-based features leads to further improvement of accuracy on predicting all three domains of gene function. Based on the optimal feature combinations, we then propose a novel multi-classifier-based function prediction method for <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> proteins, FFPred-fly+. Interpreting our machine learning models also allows us to identify some of the underlying links between biological processes and developmental stages of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ODoUz0HshHs" width="1" />

<p>Forgetting memories is important for animals to properly respond to continuously changing environments. To elucidate the mechanisms of forgetting, we used one of the behavioral plasticities of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> hermaphrodite, olfactory adaptation to an attractive odorant, diacetyl, as a simple model of learning. In <i>C. elegans,</i> the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway accelerates forgetting of olfactory adaptation by facilitating neural secretion from AWC sensory neurons. In this study, to identify the downstream effectors of the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway, we conducted a genetic screen for suppressors of the gain-of-function mutant of <i>tir-1</i> (<i>ok1052</i>), which shows excessive forgetting. Our screening showed that three proteins—a membrane protein, MACO-1; a receptor tyrosine kinase, SCD-2; and its putative ligand, HEN-1—regulated forgetting downstream of the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway. We further demonstrated that MACO-1 and SCD-2/HEN-1 functioned in parallel genetic pathways, and only MACO-1 regulated forgetting of olfactory adaptation to isoamyl alcohol, which is an attractive odorant sensed by different types of sensory neurons. In olfactory adaptation, odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in olfactory neurons are attenuated by conditioning and recovered thereafter. A Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging study revealed that this attenuation is sustained longer in <i>maco-1</i> and <i>scd-2</i> mutant animals than in wild-type animals like the TIR-1/JNK-1 pathway mutants. Furthermore, temporal silencing by histamine-gated chloride channels revealed that the neuronal activity of AWC neurons after conditioning is important for proper forgetting. We propose that distinct signaling pathways, each of which has a specific function, may coordinately and temporally regulate forgetting by controlling sensory responses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Active forgetting is an important process to understand the whole mechanisms of memories. Recent papers have reported that the noncell autonomous regulations are required for proper forgetting in invertebrates. We found that in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> hermaphrodite, the noncell autonomous regulations of forgetting of olfactory adaptation is regulated by three conserved proteins: a membrane protein, MACO-1; a receptor tyrosine kinase, SCD-2: and its ligand, HEN-1. MACO-1 and SCD-2/HEN-1, working in coordination, accelerate forgetting by controlling sensory responses in parallel. Furthermore, temporal regulation of neuronal activity is important for proper forgetting. We suggest that multiple pathways may coordinately and temporally regulate forgetting through control of sensory responses. This study should lead to a better understanding of forgetting in higher organisms.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10230?rss=1">Enhanced Nociception in Angelman Syndrome Model Mice</a></h4>

<p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation or deletion of the maternal <i>UBE3A</i> allele. The maternal <i>UBE3A</i> allele is expressed in nearly all neurons of the brain and spinal cord, whereas the paternal <i>UBE3A</i> allele is repressed by an extremely long antisense transcript (<i>UBE3A-ATS</i>). Little is known about expression of <i>UBE3A</i> in the peripheral nervous system, where loss of maternal <i>UBE3A</i> might contribute to AS phenotypes. Here we sought to examine maternal and paternal <i>Ube3a</i> expression in DRGs neurons and to evaluate whether nociceptive responses were affected in AS model mice (global deletion of maternal <i>Ube3a</i> allele; <i>Ube3a</i><sup><i>m</i>–/<i>p</i>+</sup>). We found that most large-diameter proprioceptive and mechanosensitive DRG neurons expressed maternal <i>Ube3a</i> and paternal <i>Ube3a-ATS</i>. In contrast, most small-diameter neurons expressed <i>Ube3a</i> biallelically and had low to undetectable levels of <i>Ube3a-ATS</i>. Analysis of single-cell DRG transcriptomes further suggested that <i>Ube3a</i> is expressed monoallelically in myelinated large-diameter neurons and biallelically in unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Behavioral responses to some noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli were enhanced in male and female AS model mice; however, nociceptive responses were not altered by the conditional deletion of maternal <i>Ube3a</i> in the DRG. These data suggest that the enhanced nociceptive responses in AS model mice are due to loss of maternal <i>Ube3a</i> in the central, but not peripheral, nervous system. Our study provides new insights into sensory processing deficits associated with AS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss or mutation of the maternal <i>UBE3A</i> allele. While sensory processing deficits are frequently associated with AS, it is currently unknown whether <i>Ube3a</i> is expressed in peripheral sensory neurons or whether maternal deletion of <i>Ube3a</i> affects somatosensory responses. Here, we found that <i>Ube3a</i> is primarily expressed from the maternally inherited allele in myelinated large-diameter sensory neurons and biallelically expressed in unmyelinated small-diameter neurons. Nociceptive responses to select noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli were enhanced following global, but not sensory neuron-specific, deletion of maternal <i>Ube3a</i> in mice. These data suggest that maternal loss of <i>Ube3a</i> affects nociception via a central, but not peripheral mechanism, with implications for AS.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10215?rss=1">The Neural Basis of Aversive Pavlovian Guidance during Planning</a></h4>

<p>Important real-world decisions are often arduous as they frequently involve sequences of choices, with initial selections affecting future options. Evaluating every possible combination of choices is computationally intractable, particularly for longer multistep decisions. Therefore, humans frequently use heuristics to reduce the complexity of decisions. We recently used a goal-directed planning task to demonstrate the profound behavioral influence and ubiquity of one such shortcut, namely aversive pruning, a reflexive Pavlovian process that involves neglecting parts of the decision space residing beyond salient negative outcomes. However, how the brain implements this important decision heuristic and what underlies individual differences have hitherto remained unanswered. Therefore, we administered an adapted version of the same planning task to healthy male and female volunteers undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the neural basis of aversive pruning. Through both computational and standard categorical fMRI analyses, we show that when planning was influenced by aversive pruning, the subgenual cingulate cortex was robustly recruited. This neural signature was distinct from those associated with general planning and valuation, two fundamental cognitive components elicited by our task but which are complementary to aversive pruning. Furthermore, we found that individual variation in levels of aversive pruning was associated with the responses of insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices to the receipt of large monetary losses, and also with subclinical levels of anxiety. In summary, our data reveal the neural signatures of an important reflexive Pavlovian process that shapes goal-directed evaluations and thereby determines the outcome of high-level sequential cognitive processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Multistep decisions are complex because initial choices constrain future options. Evaluating every path for long decision sequences is often impractical; thus, cognitive shortcuts are often essential. One pervasive and powerful heuristic is aversive pruning, in which potential decision-making avenues are curtailed at immediate negative outcomes. We used neuroimaging to examine how humans implement such pruning. We found it to be associated with activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex, with neural signatures that were distinguishable from those covarying with planning and valuation. Individual variations in aversive pruning levels related to subclinical anxiety levels and insular cortex activation. These findings reveal the neural mechanisms by which basic negative Pavlovian influences guide decision-making during planning, with implications for disrupted decision-making in psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>The cerebral cortex is subdivided into six layers based on morphological features. The supragranular layers 2/3 (L2/3) contain morphologically and genetically diverse populations of neurons, suggesting the existence of discrete classes of cells. In primates and carnivores L2/3 can be subdivided morphologically, but cytoarchitectonic divisions are less clear in rodents. Nevertheless, discrete classes of cells could exist based on their computational requirement, which might be linked to their associated functional microcircuits. Through <i>in vitro</i> slice recordings coupled with laser-scanning photostimulation we investigated whether L2/3 of male mouse auditory cortex contains discrete subpopulations of cells with specific functional microcircuits. We use hierarchical clustering on the laminar connection patterns to reveal the existence of multiple distinct classes of L2/3 neurons. The classes of L2/3 neurons are distinguished by the pattern of their laminar and columnar inputs from within A1 and their location within L2/3. Cells in superficial L2 show more extensive columnar integration than deeper L3 cells. Moreover, L3 cells receive more translaminar input from L4. <i>In vivo</i> imaging in awake mice revealed that L2 cells had higher bandwidth than L3 cells, consistent with the laminar differences in columnar integration. These results suggest that similar to higher mammals, rodent L2/3 is not a homogenous layer but contains several parallel microcircuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Layer 2/3 of auditory cortex is functionally diverse. We investigated whether L2/3 cells form classes based on their functional connectivity. We used <i>in vitro</i> whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with laser-scanning photostimulation and performed unsupervised clustering on the resulting excitatory and inhibitory connection patterns. Cells within each class were located in different sublaminae. Superficial cells showed wider integration along the tonotopic axis and the amount of L4 input varied with sublaminar location. To identify whether sensory responses varied with sublaminar location, we performed <i>in vivo</i> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and found that L2 cells were less frequency-selective than L3 cells. Our results show that the diversity of receptive fields in L2/3 is likely due to diversity in the underlying functional circuits.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS). To date, the investigation of mitochondrial dysfunction in MS has focused exclusively on neurons, with no studies exploring whether dysregulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics and/or genetics in oligodendrocytes might be associated with the etiopathogenesis of MS and other demyelinating syndromes. To address this question, we established a mouse model where mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) double-strand breaks (DSBs) were specifically induced in myelinating oligodendrocytes (PLP:mtPstI mice) by expressing a mitochondrial-targeted endonuclease, mtPstI, starting at 3 weeks of age. In both female and male mice, DSBs of oligodendroglial mtDNA caused impairment of locomotor function, chronic demyelination, glial activation, and axonal degeneration, which became more severe with time of induction. In addition, after short transient induction of mtDNA DSBs, PLP:mtPstI mice showed an exacerbated response to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Together, our data demonstrate that mtDNA damage can cause primary oligodendropathy, which in turn triggers demyelination, proving PLP:mtPstI mice to be a useful tool to study the pathological consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in oligodendrocytes. In addition, the demyelination and axonal loss displayed by PLP:mtPstI mice recapitulate some of the key features of chronic demyelinating syndromes, including progressive MS forms, which are not accurately reproduced in the models currently available. For this reason, the PLP:mtPstI mouse represents a unique and much needed platform for testing remyelinating therapies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we show that oligodendrocyte-specific mitochondrial DNA double-strand breaks in PLP:mtPstI mice cause oligodendrocyte death and demyelination associated with axonal damage and glial activation. Hence, PLP:mtPstI mice represent a unique tool to study the pathological consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction in oligodendrocytes, as well as an ideal platform to test remyelinating and neuroprotective agents.</p>

<p>Rhythmic visual stimulation ("flicker") is primarily used to "tag" processing of low-level visual and high-level cognitive phenomena. However, preliminary evidence suggests that flicker may also entrain endogenous brain oscillations, thereby modulating cognitive processes supported by those brain rhythms. Here we tested the interaction between 10 Hz flicker and endogenous alpha-band (~10 Hz) oscillations during a selective visuospatial attention task. We recorded EEG from human participants (both genders) while they performed a modified Eriksen flanker task in which distractors and targets flickered within (10 Hz) or outside (7.5 or 15 Hz) the alpha band. By using a combination of EEG source separation, time-frequency, and single-trial linear mixed-effects modeling, we demonstrate that 10 Hz flicker interfered with stimulus processing more on incongruent than congruent trials (high vs low selective attention demands). Crucially, the effect of 10 Hz flicker on task performance was predicted by the distance between 10 Hz and individual alpha peak frequency (estimated during the task). Finally, the flicker effect on task performance was more strongly predicted by EEG flicker responses during stimulus processing than during preparation for the upcoming stimulus, suggesting that 10 Hz flicker interfered more with reactive than proactive selective attention. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that visual flicker entrained endogenous alpha-band networks, which in turn impaired task performance. Our findings also provide novel evidence for frequency-dependent exogenous modulation of cognition that is determined by the correspondence between the exogenous flicker frequency and the endogenous brain rhythms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we provide novel evidence that the interaction between exogenous rhythmic visual stimulation and endogenous brain rhythms can have frequency-specific behavioral effects. We show that alpha-band (10 Hz) flicker impairs stimulus processing in a selective attention task when the stimulus flicker rate matches individual alpha peak frequency. The effect of sensory flicker on task performance was stronger when selective attention demands were high, and was stronger during stimulus processing and response selection compared with the prestimulus anticipatory period. These findings provide novel evidence that frequency-specific sensory flicker affects online attentional processing, and also demonstrate that the correspondence between exogenous and endogenous rhythms is an overlooked prerequisite when testing for frequency-specific cognitive effects of flicker.</p>

<p>Tolerance to the analgesic effects of opioids is a major problem in chronic pain management. Microglia are implicated in opioid tolerance, but the core mechanisms regulating their response to opioids remain obscure. By selectively ablating microglia in the spinal cord using a saporin-conjugated antibody to Mac1, we demonstrate a causal role for microglia in the development, but not maintenance, of morphine tolerance in male rats. Increased P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) activity is a cardinal feature of microglial activation, and in this study we found that morphine potentiates P2X7R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in resident spinal microglia acutely isolated from morphine tolerant rats. The increased P2X7R function was blocked in cultured microglia by PP2, a Src family protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We identified Src family kinase activation mediated by μ-receptors as a key mechanistic step required for morphine potentiation of P2X7R function. Furthermore, we show by site-directed mutagenesis that tyrosine (Y<sub>382–384</sub>) within the P2X7R C-terminus is differentially modulated by repeated morphine treatment and has no bearing on normal P2X7R function. Intrathecal administration of a palmitoylated peptide corresponding to the Y<sub>382–384</sub> site suppressed morphine-induced microglial reactivity and preserved the antinociceptive effects of morphine in male rats. Thus, site-specific regulation of P2X7R function mediated by Y<sub>382–384</sub> is a novel cellular determinant of the microglial response to morphine that critically underlies the development of morphine analgesic tolerance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Controlling pain is one of the most difficult challenges in medicine and its management is a requirement of a large diversity of illnesses. Although morphine and other opioids offer dramatic and impressive relief of pain, their impact is truncated by loss of efficacy (analgesic tolerance). Understanding why this occurs and how to prevent it are of critical importance in improving pain therapies. We uncovered a novel site (Y<sub>382–384</sub>) within the P2X7 receptor that can be targeted to blunt the development of morphine analgesic tolerance, without affecting normal P2X7 receptor function. Our findings provide a critical missing mechanistic piece, site-specific modulation by Y<sub>382–384</sub>, that unifies P2X7R function to the activation of spinal microglia and the development of morphine tolerance.</p>

<p>Prior studies have reported "local" field potential (LFP) responses to faces in the macaque auditory cortex and have suggested that such face-LFPs may be substrates of audiovisual integration. However, although field potentials (FPs) may reflect the synaptic currents of neurons near the recording electrode, due to the use of a distant reference electrode, they often reflect those of synaptic activity occurring in distant sites as well. Thus, FP recordings within a given brain region (e.g., auditory cortex) may be "contaminated" by activity generated elsewhere in the brain. To determine whether face responses are indeed generated within macaque auditory cortex, we recorded FPs and concomitant multiunit activity with linear array multielectrodes across auditory cortex in three macaques (one female), and applied current source density (CSD) analysis to the laminar FP profile. CSD analysis revealed no appreciable local generator contribution to the visual FP in auditory cortex, although we did note an increase in the amplitude of visual FP with cortical depth, suggesting that their generators are located below auditory cortex. In the underlying inferotemporal cortex, we found polarity inversions of the main visual FP components accompanied by robust CSD responses and large-amplitude multiunit activity. These results indicate that face-evoked FP responses in auditory cortex are not generated locally but are volume-conducted from other face-responsive regions. In broader terms, our results underscore the caution that, unless far-field contamination is removed, LFPs in general may reflect such "far-field" activity, in addition to, or in absence of, local synaptic responses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Field potentials (FPs) can index neuronal population activity that is not evident in action potentials. However, due to volume conduction, FPs may reflect activity in distant neurons superimposed upon that of neurons close to the recording electrode. This is problematic as the default assumption is that FPs originate from local activity, and thus are termed "local" (LFP). We examine this general problem in the context of previously reported face-evoked FPs in macaque auditory cortex. Our findings suggest that face-FPs are indeed generated in the underlying inferotemporal cortex and volume-conducted to the auditory cortex. The note of caution raised by these findings is of particular importance for studies that seek to assign FP/LFP recordings to specific cortical layers.</p>

<p>Binocular mechanisms for visual processing are thought to enhance spatial acuity by combining matched input from the two eyes. Studies in the primary visual cortex of carnivores and primates have confirmed that eye-specific neuronal response properties are largely matched. In recent years, the mouse has emerged as a prominent model for binocular visual processing, yet little is known about the spatial frequency tuning of binocular responses in mouse visual cortex. Using calcium imaging in awake mice of both sexes, we show that the spatial frequency preference of cortical responses to the contralateral eye is ~35% higher than responses to the ipsilateral eye. Furthermore, we find that neurons in binocular visual cortex that respond only to the contralateral eye are tuned to higher spatial frequencies. Binocular neurons that are well matched in spatial frequency preference are also matched in orientation preference. In contrast, we observe that binocularly mismatched cells are more mismatched in orientation tuning. Furthermore, we find that contralateral responses are more direction-selective than ipsilateral responses and are strongly biased to the cardinal directions. The contralateral bias of high spatial frequency tuning was found in both awake and anesthetized recordings. The distinct properties of contralateral cortical responses may reflect the functional segregation of direction-selective, high spatial frequency-preferring neurons in earlier stages of the central visual pathway. Moreover, these results suggest that the development of binocularity and visual acuity may engage distinct circuits in the mouse visual system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Seeing through two eyes is thought to improve visual acuity by enhancing sensitivity to fine edges. Using calcium imaging of cellular responses in awake mice, we find surprising asymmetries in the spatial processing of eye-specific visual input in binocular primary visual cortex. The contralateral visual pathway is tuned to higher spatial frequencies than the ipsilateral pathway. At the highest spatial frequencies, the contralateral pathway strongly prefers to respond to visual stimuli along the cardinal (horizontal and vertical) axes. These results suggest that monocular, and not binocular, mechanisms set the limit of spatial acuity in mice. Furthermore, they suggest that the development of visual acuity and binocularity in mice involves different circuits.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10114?rss=1">The Interplay between Long- and Short-Range Temporal Correlations Shapes Cortex Dynamics across Vigilance States</a></h4>

<p>Increasing evidence suggests that cortical dynamics during wake exhibits long-range temporal correlations suitable to integrate inputs over extended periods of time to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in decision making and working memory tasks. Accordingly, sleep has been suggested as a state characterized by a breakdown of long-range correlations. However, detailed measurements of neuronal timescales that support this view have so far been lacking. Here, we show that the cortical timescales measured at the individual neuron level in freely behaving male rats change as a function of vigilance state and time awake. Although quiet wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are characterized by similar, long timescales, these long timescales are abrogated in non-REM sleep. We observe that cortex dynamics exhibits rapid transitions between long-timescale states and sleep-like states governed by short timescales even during wake. This becomes particularly evident during sleep deprivation, when the interplay between these states can lead to an increasing disruption of long timescales that are restored after sleep. Experiments and modeling identify the intrusion of neuronal offline periods as a mechanism that disrupts the long timescales arising from reverberating cortical network activity. Our results provide novel mechanistic and functional links among behavioral manifestations of sleep, wake, and sleep deprivation and specific measurable changes in the network dynamics relevant for characterizing the brain's changing information-processing capabilities. They suggest a network-level function of sleep to reorganize cortical networks toward states governed by long timescales to ensure efficient information integration for the time awake.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lack of sleep deteriorates several key cognitive functions, yet the neuronal underpinnings of these deficits have remained elusive. Cognitive capabilities are generally believed to benefit from a neural circuit's ability to reliably integrate information. Persistent network activity characterized by long timescales may provide the basis for this integration in cortex. Here, we show that long-range temporal correlations indicated by slowly decaying autocorrelation functions in neuronal activity are dependent on vigilance states. Although wake and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep exhibit long timescales, these long-range correlations break down during non-REM sleep. Our findings thus suggest two distinct states in terms of timescale dynamics. During extended wake, the rapid switching to sleep-like states with short timescales can lead to an overall decline in cortical timescales.</p>

<p>Integrating inputs across sensory systems is a property of the brain that is vitally important in everyday life. More than two decades of fMRI research have revealed crucial insights on multisensory processing, yet the multisensory operations at the neuronal level in humans have remained largely unknown. Understanding the fine-scale spatial organization of multisensory brain regions is fundamental to shed light on their neuronal operations. Monkey electrophysiology revealed that the bimodal superior temporal cortex (bSTC) is topographically organized according to the modality preference (visual, auditory, and bimodal) of its neurons. In line with invasive studies, a previous 3 Tesla fMRI study suggests that the human bSTC is also topographically organized according to modality preference (visual, auditory, and bimodal) when analyzed at 1.6 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.6 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.6 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel resolution. However, it is still unclear whether this resolution is able to unveil an accurate spatial organization of the human bSTC. This issue was addressed in the present study by investigating the spatial organization of functional responses of the bSTC in 10 participants (from both sexes) at 1.5 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.5 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.5 mm<sup>3</sup> and 1.1 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.1 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.1 mm<sup>3</sup> using ultra-high field fMRI (at 7 Tesla). Relative to 1.5 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.5 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.5 mm<sup>3</sup>, the bSTC at 1.1 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.1 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.1 mm<sup>3</sup> resolution was characterized by a larger selectivity for visual and auditory modalities, stronger integrative responses in bimodal voxels, and it was organized in more distinct functional clusters indicating a more precise separation of underlying neuronal clusters. Our findings indicate that increasing the spatial resolution may be necessary and sufficient to achieve a more accurate functional topography of human multisensory integration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The bimodal superior temporal cortex (bSTC) is a brain region that plays a crucial role in the integration of visual and auditory inputs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the fine-scale spatial organization of the bSTC by using ultra-high magnetic field fMRI at 7 Tesla. Mapping the functional topography of bSTC at a resolution of 1.1 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.1 <font face="arial,helvetica">x</font> 1.1 mm<sup>3</sup> revealed more accurate representations than at lower resolutions. This result indicates that standard-resolution fMRI may lead to wrong conclusions about the functional organization of the bSTC, whereas high spatial resolution is essential to more accurately approach neuronal operations of human multisensory integration.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10097?rss=1">Visual Experience Shapes the Neural Networks Remapping Touch into External Space</a></h4>

<p>Localizing touch relies on the activation of skin-based and externally defined spatial frames of reference. Psychophysical studies have demonstrated that early visual deprivation prevents the automatic remapping of touch into external space. We used fMRI to characterize how visual experience impacts the brain circuits dedicated to the spatial processing of touch. Sighted and congenitally blind humans performed a tactile temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, either with the hands uncrossed or crossed over the body midline. Behavioral data confirmed that crossing the hands has a detrimental effect on TOJ judgments in sighted but not in early blind people. Crucially, the crossed hand posture elicited enhanced activity, when compared with the uncrossed posture, in a frontoparietal network in the sighted group only. Psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed, however, that the congenitally blind showed enhanced functional connectivity between parietal and frontal regions in the crossed versus uncrossed hand postures. Our results demonstrate that visual experience scaffolds the neural implementation of the location of touch in space.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In daily life, we seamlessly localize touch in external space for action planning toward a stimulus making contact with the body. For efficient sensorimotor integration, the brain has therefore to compute the current position of our limbs in the external world. In the present study, we demonstrate that early visual deprivation alters the brain activity in a dorsal parietofrontal network typically supporting touch localization in the sighted. Our results therefore conclusively demonstrate the intrinsic role that developmental vision plays in scaffolding the neural implementation of touch perception.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10085?rss=1">Rubrocerebellar Feedback Loop Isolates the Interposed Nucleus as an Independent Processor of Corollary Discharge Information in Mice</a></h4>

<p>Understanding cerebellar contributions to motor coordination requires deeper insight into how the output structures of the cerebellum, the cerebellar nuclei, integrate their inputs and influence downstream motor pathways. The magnocellular red nucleus (RNm), a brainstem premotor structure, is a major target of the interposed nucleus (IN), and has also been described in previous studies to send feedback collaterals to the cerebellum. Because such a pathway is in a key position to provide motor efferent information to the cerebellum, satisfying predictions about the use of corollary discharge in cerebellar computations, we studied it in mice of both sexes. Using anterograde viral tracing, we show that innervation of cerebellum by rubrospinal neuron collaterals is remarkably selective for the IN compared with the cerebellar cortex. Optogenetic activation of the pathway in acute mouse brain slices drove IN activity despite small amplitude synaptic currents, suggesting an active role in IN information processing. Monosynaptic transsynaptic rabies tracing indicated the pathway contacts multiple cell types within the IN. By contrast, IN inputs to the RNm targeted a region that lacked inhibitory neurons. Optogenetic drive of IN inputs to the RNm revealed strong, direct excitation but no inhibition of RNm neurons. Together, these data indicate that the cerebellar nuclei are under afferent control independent of the cerebellar cortex, potentially diversifying its roles in motor control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The common assumption that all cerebellar mossy fibers uniformly collateralize to the cerebellar nuclei and cortex underlies classic models of convergent Purkinje influence on cerebellar output. Specifically, mossy fibers are thought to both directly excite nuclear neurons and drive polysynaptic feedforward inhibition via Purkinje neurons, setting up a fundamental computational unit. Here we present data that challenge this rule. A dedicated cerebellar nuclear afferent comprised of feedback collaterals from premotor rubrospinal neurons can directly modulate IN output independent of Purkinje cell modulation. In contrast to the IN-RNm pathway, the RNm-IN feedback pathway targets multiple cell types, potentially influencing both motor output pathways and nucleo-olivary feedback.</p>

<p>Visual stimuli can evoke waves of neural activity that propagate across the surface of visual cortical areas. The relevance of these waves for visual processing is unknown. Here, we measured the phase and amplitude of local field potentials (LFPs) in electrode array recordings from the motion-processing medial temporal (MT) area of anesthetized male marmosets. Animals viewed grating or dot-field stimuli drifting in different directions. We found that, on individual trials, the direction of LFP wave propagation is sensitive to the direction of stimulus motion. Propagating LFP patterns are also detectable in trial-averaged activity, but the trial-averaged patterns exhibit different dynamics and behaviors from those in single trials and are similar across motion directions. We show that this difference arises because stimulus-sensitive propagating patterns are present in the phase of single-trial oscillations, whereas the trial-averaged signal is dominated by additive amplitude effects. Our results demonstrate that propagating LFP patterns can represent sensory inputs at timescales relevant to visually guided behaviors and raise the possibility that propagating activity patterns serve neural information processing in area MT and other cortical areas.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Propagating wave patterns are widely observed in the cortex, but their functional relevance remains unknown. We show here that visual stimuli generate propagating wave patterns in local field potentials (LFPs) in a movement-sensitive area of the primate cortex and that the propagation direction of these patterns is sensitive to stimulus motion direction. We also show that averaging LFP signals across multiple stimulus presentations (trial averaging) yields propagating patterns that capture different dynamic properties of the LFP response and show negligible direction sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that sensory stimuli can modulate propagating wave patterns reliably in the cortex. The relevant dynamics are normally masked by trial averaging, which is a conventional step in LFP signal processing.</p>

<p>Dopaminergic modulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to play key roles in many cognitive functions and to be disrupted in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia. We have previously described a phenomenon whereby dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) activation elicits afterdepolarizations (ADPs) in subcortically projecting (SC) pyramidal neurons within L5 of the PFC. These D2R-induced ADPs only occur following synaptic input, which activates NMDARs, even when the delay between the synaptic input and ADPs is relatively long (e.g., several hundred milliseconds). Here, we use a combination of electrophysiological, optogenetic, pharmacological, transgenic, and chemogenetic approaches to elucidate cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in male and female mice. We find that knocking out D2Rs eliminates the ADP in a cell-autonomous fashion, confirming that this ADP depends on D2Rs. Hyperpolarizing current injection, but not AMPA receptor blockade, prevents synaptic stimulation from facilitating D2R-induced ADPs, suggesting that this phenomenon depends on the recruitment of voltage-dependent currents (e.g., NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx) by synaptic input. Finally, the D2R-induced ADP is blocked by inhibitors of cAMP/PKA signaling, insensitive to pertussis toxin or β-arrestin knock-out, and mimicked by G<sub>s</sub>-DREADD stimulation, suggesting that D2R activation elicits the ADP by stimulating cAMP/PKA signaling. These results show that this unusual physiological phenomenon, in which D2Rs enhance cellular excitability in a manner that depends on synaptic input, is mediated at the cellular level through the recruitment of signaling pathways associated with G<sub>s</sub>, rather than the G<sub>i/o</sub>-associated mechanisms that have classically been ascribed to D2Rs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are thought to play important roles in behaviors, including working memory and cognitive flexibility. Variation in D2Rs has also been implicated in schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder. Recently, we described a new mechanism through which D2R activation can enhance the excitability of pyramidal neurons in the PFC. Here, we explore the underlying cellular mechanisms. Surprisingly, although D2Rs are classically assumed to signal through G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled G-proteins and/or scaffolding proteins, such as β-arrestin, we find that the effects of D2Rs on prefrontal pyramidal neurons are actually mediated by pathways associated with G<sub>s</sub>-mediated signaling. Furthermore, we show how, via this D2R-dependent phenomenon, synaptic input can enhance the excitability of prefrontal neurons over timescales on the order of seconds. These results elucidate cellular mechanisms underlying a novel signaling pathway downstream of D2Rs that may contribute to prefrontal function under normal and pathological conditions.</p>

<p>Circadian rhythm disturbances are well established in neurological diseases. However, how these disruptions cause homeostatic imbalances remains poorly understood. Brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) is a major circadian clock transcriptional activator, and Bmal1 deficiency in male <i>Bmal1</i><sub><i>nestin</i></sub><sup>–/–</sup> mice induced marked astroglial activation without affecting the number of astrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. Bmal1 deletion caused blood–brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability with an age-dependent loss of pericyte coverage of blood vessels in the brain. Using Nestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice, we determined that pericytes are Nestin-GFP<sup>+</sup> in the adult brain. Bmal1 deletion caused Nestin-GFP<sup>+</sup> pericyte dysfunction, including the downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), a protein necessary for maintaining BBB integrity. Knockdown of Bmal1 downregulated PDGFRβ transcription in the brain pericyte cell line. Thus, the circadian clock component Bmal1 maintains BBB integrity via regulating pericytes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circadian rhythm disturbances may play a role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Our results revealed that one of the circadian clock components maintains the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) by regulating vascular-embedded pericytes. These cells were recently identified as a vital component for the control of BBB permeability and cerebral blood flow. Our present study demonstrates the involvement of circadian clock component Bmal1 in BBB homeostasis and highlights the role of Bmal1 dysfunction in multiple neurological diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/42/10038?rss=1">Conditional Deletion of the L-Type Calcium Channel Cav1.2 in NG2-Positive Cells Impairs Remyelination in Mice</a></h4>

<p>Exploring the molecular mechanisms that drive the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) during the remyelination process is essential to developing new therapeutic tools to intervene in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. To determine whether L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs) are required for OPC development during remyelination, we generated an inducible conditional knock-out mouse in which the L-VGCC isoform Cav1.2 was deleted in NG2-positive OPCs (Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup>). Using the cuprizone (CPZ) model of demyelination and mice of either sex, we establish that Cav1.2 deletion in OPCs leads to less efficient remyelination of the adult brain. Specifically, Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup> OPCs mature slower and produce less myelin than control oligodendrocytes during the recovery period after CPZ intoxication. This reduced remyelination was accompanied by an important decline in the number of myelinating oligodendrocytes and in the rate of OPC proliferation. Furthermore, during the remyelination phase of the CPZ model, the corpus callosum of Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup> animals presented a significant decrease in the percentage of myelinated axons and a substantial increase in the mean g-ratio of myelinated axons compared with controls. In addition, in a mouse line in which the Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup> OPCs were identified by a <i>Cre</i> reporter, we establish that Cav1.2<sup>KO</sup> OPCs display a reduced maturational rate through the entire remyelination process. These results suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by L-VGCCs in oligodendroglial cells is necessary for normal remyelination and is an essential Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel for OPC maturation during the remyelination of the adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ion channels implicated in oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation may induce positive signals for myelin recovery. Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) are important for normal myelination by acting at several critical steps during oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) development. To determine whether voltage Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination, we used a conditional knockout mouse for VGCCs in OPCs. Our results indicate that VGCCs can modulate oligodendrocyte maturation in the demyelinated brain and suggest that voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in OPCs is critical for remyelination. These findings could lead to novel approaches for obtaining a better understanding of the factors that control OPC maturation in order to stimulate this pool of progenitors to replace myelin in demyelinating diseases.</p>

<p>Hippocampal cognitive map---a neuronal representation of the spatial
environment---is broadly discussed in the computational neuroscience literature
for decades. More recent studies point out that hippocampus plays a major role
in producing yet another cognitive framework that incorporates not only
spatial, but also nonspatial memories---the memory space. However, unlike
cognitive maps, memory spaces have been barely studied from a theoretical
perspective. Here we propose an approach for modeling hippocampal memory spaces
as an epiphenomenon of neuronal spiking activity. First, we suggest that the
memory space may be viewed as a finite topological space---a hypothesis that
allows treating both spatial and nonspatial aspects of hippocampal function on
equal footing. We then model the topological properties of the memory space to
demonstrate that this concept naturally incorporates the notion of a cognitive
map. Lastly, we suggest a formal description of the memory consolidation
process and point out a connection between the proposed model of the memory
spaces to the so-called Morris' schemas, which emerge as the most compact
representation of the memory structure.

<p>How choices are made within noisy environments is a central question in the
neuroscience of decision making. Previous work has characterized temporal
accumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However,
real-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change
over time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the
current state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a
dynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence
by adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing
results about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the
optimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus
statistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these
components were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted
evidence almost optimally. Furthermore, we found that by changing the dynamics
of the environment, experimenters could control the rats' accumulation
timescale, switching them from accumulating over short timescales to
accumulating over long timescales and back. The theoretical framework also
makes quantitative predictions regarding the timing of changes of mind in the
dynamic environment. This study establishes a quantitative behavioral framework
to control and investigate neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive nature of
evidence accumulation timescales and changes of mind.

<p>We develop a unified theory that encompasses the macroscopic dynamics of
recurrent interactions of binary units within arbitrary network architectures.
Using the martingale theory, our mathematical analysis provides a complete
description of nonequilibrium fluctuations in networks with finite size and
finite degree of interactions. Our approach allows the investigation of systems
for which a deterministic mean-field theory breaks down. To demonstrate this,
we uncover a novel dynamic state in which a recurrent network of binary units
with statistically inhomogeneous interactions, along with an asynchronous
behavior, also exhibits collective nontrivial stochastic fluctuations in the
thermodynamical limit.

Drug naive animals given a single dose of ethanol show changed responses to subsequent doses, including the development of ethanol tolerance and ethanol preference. These simple forms of behavioral plasticity are due in part to changes in gene expression and neuronal properties. Surprisingly little is known about how ethanol initiates changes in gene expression or what the changes do. Here we demonstrate a role in ethanol plasticity for Hr38, the sole Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Nr4a1/2/3 class of immediate early response transcription factors. Acute ethanol exposure induces transient expression of Hr38 and other immediate early neuronal activity genes. Ethanol activates the Mef2 transcriptional activator to induce Hr38, and the Sirt1 histone/protein deacetylase terminates Hr38 induction. Loss of Hr38 decreases ethanol tolerance and causes precocious but short-lasting ethanol preference. Similarly, reduced Mef2 activity in all neurons or specifically in the mushroom body /{beta} neurons decreases ethanol tolerance; Sirt1 promotes ethanol tolerance in these same neurons. Genetically decreasing Hr38 expression levels in Sirt1 null mutants restores ethanol tolerance, demonstrating that both induction and termination of Hr38 expression are important for behavioral plasticity to proceed. These data demonstrate that Hr38 functions as an immediate early transcription factor that promotes ethanol behavioral plasticity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/205476v1?rss=1">Default Mode Network patterns and its interactions with memory performance in patients with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and controls</a></h4>

Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) have cognitive dysfunctions not fully explained by the temporal seizure focus. Abnormal functional connectivity in the resting-state default mode network (DMN) appear to be related to these cognitive impairments. Studies showed DMN abnormalities in MTLE, but most combined patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) with other underlying etiologies. We enrolled 122 MTLE patients divided into right-HS (n=42), left-HS (n=49), MRI-negative MTLE (n=31) and controls (n=69). All underwent resting-state seed-based connectivity fMRI, with a seed placed at the posterior cingulate cortex, an essential node for the DMN. In addition, patients and 41 controls were tested for verbal and visual memory, estimated intelligence coefficient and delayed recall. Both right-HS and MRI-negative group presented the poorest visual memory scores. Also right-HS and left-HS had a worse performance in verbal memory compared to controls and MRI-negative groups. Overall, the presence of HS in the left hemisphere had more impact on verbal memory, which was not found when the seizure focus is in the left hemisphere in the absence of HS. MTLE patients presented an intricate pattern of increased and decreased connectivity regardless the presence or side of HS. As expected, hippocampus was less connected than controls in all groups of patients. Although EEGs indicated that 64.5% of MRI-negative patients were lateralized to the left, this group showed activations similar to the right-HS. Patients with left and right-HS presented similar, increased and decreased connectivity in the ipsilateral hemisphere; however, left-HS had abnormal decreased connectivity in the contralateral hemisphere.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/205310v1?rss=1">Bipolar oscillations between positive and negative mood states in a computational model of Basal Ganglia</a></h4>

Bipolar disorder is characterized by mood swings -- oscillations between manic and depressive states. The swings (oscillations) mark the length of an episode in a patients mood cycle (period), and can vary from hours to years. The proposed modeling study uses decision making framework to investigate the role of basal ganglia network in generating bipolar oscillations. In this model, the basal ganglia system performs a two-arm bandit task in which one of the arms leads to a positive outcome, while the other leads to a negative outcome. In healthy conditions, the model chooses positive action and avoids negative one, whereas under bipolar conditions, the model exhibits slow oscillations in its choice of positive or negative outcomes, reminiscent of bipolar oscillations. The model is cast at three levels of abstraction: 1) a two-dimensional dynamical system model, 2) a phenomenological basal ganglia model, 3) a detailed network model of basal ganglia. Phase-plane analyses on the simple reduced dynamical system with two variables reveal the essential parameters that generate pathological bipolar-like oscillations. Phenomenological and network models of the basal ganglia extend that logic, and interpret bipolar oscillations in terms of the activity of dopaminergic and serotonergic projections on the cortico-basal ganglia network dynamics. The network dysfunction, specifically in terms of reward and risk sensitivity, is shown to be responsible for the pathological bipolar oscillations. The study proposes a computational model that explores the effects of impaired serotonergic neuromodulation on the dynamics of the cortico basal ganglia network, and relates this impairment to abstract mood states (manic and depressive episodes) and oscillations of bipolar disorder.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/205039v1?rss=1">Organizing principles of pulvino-cortical connectivity in humans</a></h4>

The pulvinar regulates information transmission to cortex and communication between cortical areas. The way the pulvinar interacts with cortex is governed by its intrinsic organization. Here, we show using fMRI that the human pulvinar is functionally heterogeneous, broadly separated into dorsal and ventral subdivisions based on characterization of response properties and functional connectivity with cortex. These differences mirrored the organization of the dorsal and ventral streams of visual cortex. The ventral subdivision of the pulvinar was functionally coupled with occipital and temporal cortex. The dorsal subdivision of the pulvinar was functionally coupled with frontal and parietal cortex. The dorsal subdivision was also coupled with the human-specific tool network and to the default mode network. The spatial organization of pulvino-cortical coupling reflected both the functional similarities and anatomical distances between cortical areas. Together, the human pulvinar appears to represent the entire visual system and the principles that govern its organization, though in a spatially compressed form.

Information transfer rate (ITR), measured in bits/s, can be applied to evaluate motor performance, including the capacity of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) to control external actuators. In a 2013 article entitled Transfer of Information by BMI and published in Neuroscience, Tehovnik and his colleagues utilized ITR to assess the performance of several BMIs reported in the literature. We examined these analyses closely and found several fundamental flaws in their evaluation of ITR. Here we discuss the pitfalls in measurements of ITR by Tehovnik, as well as several other issues raised in Transfer of Information by BMI, including the claim that BMIs cannot be a reasonable option for paralyzed patients.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204966v1?rss=1">Speed tuning in the macaque posterior parietal cortex</a></h4>

Neurons in the macaque posterior parietal cortex are known to encode the direction of self-motion. But do they also encode one's speed? To test this, we performed neural recordings from area 7a while monkeys were passively translated or rotated at various speeds. Visual stimuli were delivered as optic flow fields and vestibular stimuli were generated by a motion platform. Under both conditions, the responses of a fraction of neurons scaled linearly with self-motion speed, and speed-selective neurons were not localized to specific layers or columns. We analyzed ensembles of simultaneously recorded neurons and found that the precision of speed representation was sufficient to support path integration over modest distances. Our findings describe a multisensory neural code for linear and angular self-motion speed in the posterior parietal cortex of the macaque brain, and suggest a potential role for this representation.

Background: Tic suppression is the primary target of tic disorder treatment, but factors that influence voluntary tic inhibition are not well understood. Several studies using the Tic Suppression Task have demonstrated significant inter-individual variability in tic suppressibility but have individually been underpowered to address correlates of tic suppression. The present study explored patterns and clinical correlates of tic suppression in youth with tic disorders using a large, pooled dataset. Methods: Individual-level data from 9 studies using the Tic Suppression Task were pooled, yielding a sample of 99 youth with tic disorders. Analyses examined patterns of tic suppressibility and the relationship between tic suppressibility and demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: A large majority of youth demonstrated a high degree of tic suppression, but heterogeneous patterns of tic suppressibility were also observed. Better tic suppressibility was related to older age and more frequent tics but unrelated to other clinical variables, including presence of psychiatric comorbidity, psychotropic medication status, and tic and premonitory urge severity. Conclusions: The mechanisms underlying the observed heterogeneity in tic suppressibility warrant further investigation. The Tic Suppression Task is a promising method for testing mechanistic hypotheses related to tic suppression.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204917v1?rss=1">Neurobehavioural Correlates of Obesity are Largely Heritable</a></h4>

Recent molecular genetic studies have shown that the majority of genes associated with obesity are expressed in the nervous system. In other studies, obesity has been associated with various neurobehavioural factors like brain morphology, cognitive performance, and personality. Here, we tested whether these neurobehavioural factors were associated with the heritable variance in obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) in the Human Connectome Project (N=895). We found that obesity was associated with various neurobehavioural factors: cortical thickness findings supported the "right brain hypothesis" for obesity by Alonso-Alonso and Pascual-Leone. Increased BMI associated with decreased cortical thickness in right frontal lobes and increased thickness in the left frontal lobes. In addition, lower thickness and volume in entorhinal-parahippocampal structures, and increased thickness in parietal-occipital structures in obese subjects supported the role of visuospatial function in obesity. Also, cognitive tests revealed that obesity was associated with reduced visuospatial function, in addition to reduced cognitive flexibility and increased impulsivity. Personality-obesity correlations were small. We then aggregated the effects for each neurobehavioural factor for behavioural genetics analysis and demonstrated their genetic overlap with obesity. Namely, all aforementioned neurobehavioural factors had 0.22-0.52 genetic correlations with obesity and the phenotypic correlations were 80%-100% explained by genetic factors. In a separate analysis, brain morphology effects were partly represented by the aggregated personality and cognitive factors, as they mediated 8-12% of brain morphology effects on obesity. In summary, the genetic vulnerability to obesity is expressed in various neurobehavioural factors, which can inform intervention strategies.

The integration of multiple sensory modalities is one of the key aspects of brain function, allowing animals to take advantage of concurrent sources of information to make more accurate perceptual judgments. For many years, it was thought that multisensory integration in the cerebral cortex only occurs in high-level "polysensory" association areas, but recent studies have demonstrated cross-modal influences in regions that were traditionally designated as unimodal. In particular, several human neuroimaging studies have reported that extrastriate areas involved in visual motion perception are also activated by auditory motion, and may integrate audio-visual motion cues. However, the exact nature and extent of the effects of auditory motion on the visual cortex have not been studied at the single neuron level. We recorded the spiking activity of neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anesthetized marmoset monkeys upon presentation of unimodal stimuli (moving auditory or visual patterns), as well as bimodal stimuli (concurrent audio-visual motion). Despite robust, direction selective responses to visual motion, none of the sampled neurons responded to auditory motion stimuli. Moreover, concurrent moving auditory stimuli had no significant effect on the ability of single MT and MST neurons, or populations of simultaneously recorded neurons, to discriminate the direction of motion of visual stimuli (moving random dot patterns with varying levels of motion noise). Our findings suggest that MT and MST neurons do not process or integrate moving auditory cues.

How a system represents information tightly constrains the kinds of problems it can solve. Humans routinely solve problems that appear to require structured representations of stimulus properties and relations. Answering the question of how we acquire these representations has central importance in an account of human cognition. We propose a theory of how a system can learn invariant responses to instances of similarity and relative magnitude, and how structured relational representations can be learned from initially unstructured inputs. We instantiate that theory in the DORA (Discovery of Relations by Analogy) computational framework. The result is a system that learns structured representations of relations from unstructured flat feature vector representations of objects with absolute properties. The resulting representations meet the requirements of human structured relational representations, and the model captures several specific phenomena from the literature on cognitive development. In doing so, we address a major limitation of current accounts of cognition, and provide an existence proof for how structured representations might be learned from experience.

<p>by Nan Lin, Yun Zhu, Ruzong Fan, Momiao Xiong</p>

Investigating the pleiotropic effects of genetic variants can increase statistical power, provide important information to achieve deep understanding of the complex genetic structures of disease, and offer powerful tools for designing effective treatments with fewer side effects. However, the current multiple phenotype association analysis paradigm lacks breadth (number of phenotypes and genetic variants jointly analyzed at the same time) and depth (hierarchical structure of phenotype and genotypes). A key issue for high dimensional pleiotropic analysis is to effectively extract informative internal representation and features from high dimensional genotype and phenotype data. To explore correlation information of genetic variants, effectively reduce data dimensions, and overcome critical barriers in advancing the development of novel statistical methods and computational algorithms for genetic pleiotropic analysis, we proposed a new statistic method referred to as a quadratically regularized functional CCA (QRFCCA) for association analysis which combines three approaches: (1) quadratically regularized matrix factorization, (2) functional data analysis and (3) canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Large-scale simulations show that the QRFCCA has a much higher power than that of the ten competing statistics while retaining the appropriate type 1 errors. To further evaluate performance, the QRFCCA and ten other statistics are applied to the whole genome sequencing dataset from the TwinsUK study. We identify a total of 79 genes with rare variants and 67 genes with common variants significantly associated with the 46 traits using QRFCCA. The results show that the QRFCCA substantially outperforms the ten other statistics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o8lOFnQ0TmI" width="1" />

Understanding how and why language subsystems differ in their evolutionary dynamics is a fundamental question for historical and comparative linguistics. One key dynamic is the rate of language change. While it is commonly thought that the rapid rate of change hampers the reconstruction of deep language relationships beyond 6,000–10,000 y,...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/-INgklZa9wQ" width="1" />

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 using renewable sources of electrical energy holds promise for converting CO2 to fuels and chemicals. Since this process is complex and involves a large number of species and physical phenomena, a comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling product distribution is required.

In our recent article (1), we proposed that Fermiology measurements can be used as a complementary probe for determining the low-temperature state of Li.

Elatresh et al. (1) (ECAHDB) claim that the low-temperature martensitic structure of lithium “is not the heretofore assigned 9R.” This is based on comparing results of Fermi surface calculations to de Haas–van Alphen (dHvA) data from Springford and coworkers (2, 3).

<p>Musical rhythms performed by humans typically show temporal fluctuations.
While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open
question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians
perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. To study such fluctuations
in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without
metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of
cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. Analyzing the inter-beat
interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated
processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. One
process dominates on short timescales ($t &lt; 8$ beats) and reflects microtiming
variability in the generation of single beats. The other dominates on longer
timescales and reflects slow tempo variations. Whereas the latter did not show
differences between musical genres (jazz vs. rock/pop), the process on short
timescales showed higher variability for jazz recordings, indicating that jazz
makes stronger use of microtiming fluctuations within a measure than rock/pop.
Our results elucidate principles of rhythmic performance and can inspire
algorithms for artificial music generation. By studying microtiming
fluctuations in original music recordings, we bridge the gap between
minimalistic tapping paradigms and expressive rhythmic performances.

<p>The structure of human sleep changes across development as it consolidates
from the polyphasic sleep of infants to the single nighttime sleep period
typical in adults. Across this same developmental period, time scales of the
homeostatic sleep drive, the physiological drive to sleep that increases with
time spent awake, also change and presumably govern the transition from
polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior. Using a physiologically-based,
sleep-wake regulatory network model for human sleep, we investigated the
dynamics of wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep
during this transition by varying the homeostatic sleep drive time constants.
Previously, we introduced an algorithm for constructing a one-dimensional
circle map that represents the dynamics of the full sleep-wake network model.
By tracking bifurcations in the piecewise continuous circle map as the
homeostatic sleep drive time constants are varied, we establish evidence for a
border collision bifurcation that results in period-adding-like behavior in the
number of sleep cycles per day. Interestingly, this bifurcation is preceded by
bifurcations in the number of REM bouts per sleep cycle that exhibit truncated
period-adding-like behavior. The interaction of these bifurcations in numbers
of sleep episodes and numbers of REM bouts per sleep episode generate
non-monotonic variation in sleep cycle patterns as well as quasi-periodic
patterns during the transition from polyphasic to monophasic sleep behavior.
This analysis may have implications for understanding changes in sleep in early
childhood when preschoolers transition from napping to non-napping behavior,
and the wide interindividual variation observed during this transition.

<p>Despite the recent advances in developing more effective thresholding methods
to convert weighted networks to unweighted counterparts, there are still
several limitations that need to be addressed. One such limitation is the
inability of the most existing thresholding methods to take into account the
topological properties of the original weighted networks during the
binarization process, which could ultimately result in unweighted networks that
have drastically different topological properties than the original weighted
networks. In this study, we propose a new thresholding method based on the
percolation theory to address this limitation. The performance of the proposed
method was validated and compared to the existing thresholding methods using
simulated and real-world functional connectivity networks in the brain.
Comparison of macroscopic and microscopic properties of the resulted unweighted
networks to the original weighted networks suggest that the proposed
thresholding method can successfully maintain the topological properties of the
original weighted networks.

<p>The CamCAN Lifespan Neuroimaging Dataset, Cambridge (UK) Centre for Ageing

(MEG) recordings during eyes closed rest (560 sec), a simple task (540 sec),
and passive listening/viewing (140 sec). The data were collected from 619
neurologically normal individuals, ages 18-87. The processed results from the
resting recordings are completed and available online. These constitute 1.7
TBytes of data including the location within the brain (1 mm resolution), time
stamp (1 msec resolution), and 80 msec time course for each of 3.7 billion
validated neuroelectric events, i.e. mean 6.1 million events for each of the
619 participants.

<p>The referee consensus solver provides high yield (mean 11,000 neuroelectric

fields are detected in the MEG recordings. We describe the solver, the
implementation of the solver deployed on the Open Science Grid, the workflow
management system, the opportunistic use of high performance computing (HPC)
resources to add computing capacity to the Open Science Grid reserved for this
project, and our initial findings from the recently completed processing of the
resting recordings. This required 14 million core hours, i.e. 40 core hours per

<p>The balance between excitation and inhibition is crucial for neuronal
computation. It is observed that the balanced state of neuronal networks exists
in many experiments, yet its underlying mechanism remains to be fully
clarified. Theoretical studies of the balanced state mainly focus on the
analysis of the homogeneous Erd$\ddot{\text{o}}$s-R\'enyi network. However,
neuronal networks have been found to be inhomogeneous in many cortical areas.
In particular, the connectivity of neuronal networks can be of the type of
scale-free, small-world, or even with specific motifs. In this work, we examine
the questions of whether the balanced state is universal with respect to
network topology and what characteristics the balanced state possesses in
inhomogeneous networks such as scale-free and small-world networks. We discover
that, for a sparsely but strongly connected inhomogeneous network, despite that
the whole network receives external inputs, there is a small active subnetwork
(active core) inherently embedded within it. The neurons in this active core
have relatively high firing rates while the neurons in the rest of the network
are quiescent. Surprisingly, the active core possesses a balanced state and
this state is independent of the model of single-neuron dynamics. The dynamics
of the active core can be well predicted using the Fokker-Planck equation with
the mean-field assumption. Our results suggest that, in the presence of
inhomogeneous network connectivity, the balanced state may be ubiquitous in the
brain, and the network connectivity in the active core is essentially close to
the Erd$\ddot{\text{o}}$s-R\'enyi structure. The existence of the small active
core embedded in a large network may provide a potential dynamical scenario
underlying sparse coding in neuronal networks.

<p>We introduce a graphical method originating from the computer graphics domain
that is used for the arbitrary and intuitive placement of cells over a
two-dimensional manifold. Using a bitmap image as input, where the color
indicates the identity of the different structures and the alpha channel
indicates the local cell density, this method guarantees a discrete
distribution of cell position respecting the local density function. This
method scales to any number of cells, allows to specify several different
structures at once with arbitrary shapes and provides a scalable and versatile
alternative to the more classical assumption of a uniform non-spatial
distribution. Furthermore, several connection schemes can be derived from the
paired distances between cells using either an automatic mapping or a
user-defined local reference frame, providing new computational properties for
the underlying model. The method is illustrated on a discrete homogeneous
neural field, on the distribution of cones and rods in the retina and on a
coronal view of the basal ganglia.

<p>Recent years have seen dramatic progress in the development of techniques for
measuring the activity and connectivity of large populations of neurons in the
brain. However, as these techniques grow ever more powerful---allowing us to
even contemplate measuring every neuron in entire brain---a new problem arises:
how do we make sense of the mountains of data that these techniques produce?
Here, we argue that the time is ripe for building an intermediate or
"mesoscale" computational theory that can bridge between single-cell
(microscale) accounts of neural function and behavioral (macroscale) accounts
of animal cognition and environmental complexity. Just as digital accounts of
computation in conventional computers abstract away the non-essential dynamics
of the analog circuits that implementing gates and registers, so too a
computational account of animal cognition can afford to abstract from the
non-essential dynamics of neurons. We argue that the geometry of neural
circuits is essential in explaining the computational limitations and
technological innovations inherent in biological information processing. We
propose a blueprint for how to employ tools from modern machine learning to
automatically infer a satisfying mesoscale account of neural computation that
combines functional and structural data, with an emphasis on learning and
exploiting regularity and repeating motifs in neuronal circuits. Rather than
suggest a specific theory, we present a new class of scientific instruments
that can enable neuroscientists to design, propose, implement and test
mesoscale theories of neural computation.

<p>The interaction between excitation and inhibition is crucial for brain
computation. To understand synaptic mechanisms underlying brain function, it is
important to separate excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a target neuron. In
the traditional method, after applying somatic current or voltage clamp, the
excitatory and inhibitory conductances are determined from the synaptic
current-voltage (I-V) relation --- the slope corresponds to the total
conductance and the intercept corresponds to the reversal current. Because of
the space clamp effect, the measured conductance in general deviates
substantially from the local conductance on the dendrite. Therefore, the
interpretation of the conductance measured by the traditional method remains to
be clarified. In this work, based on the investigation of an idealized
ball-and-stick neuron model and a biologically realistic pyramidal neuron
model, we first demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the
conductance determined by the traditional method has no clear biological
interpretation due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction between the clamp
current and the synaptic current across the spatial dendrites. As a
consequence, the traditional method can induce an arbitrarily large error of
conductance measurement, sometimes even leads to unphysically negative
conductance. To circumvent the difficulty of elucidating synaptic impact on
neuronal computation using the traditional method, we then propose a framework
to determine the effective conductance that reflects directly the functional
impact of synaptic inputs on action potential initiation and thereby neuronal
information processing. Our framework has been further verified in realistic
neuron simulations, thus greatly improves upon the traditional approach by
providing a reliable and accurate assessment of the role of synaptic activity
in neuronal computation.

<p>The interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons imparts rich
functions of the brain. To understand the underlying synaptic mechanisms, a
fundamental approach is to study the dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory
conductances of each neuron. The traditional method of determining conductance
employs the synaptic current-voltage (I-V) relation obtained via voltage clamp.
Using theoretical analysis, electrophysiological experiments, and realistic
simulations, here we demonstrate that the traditional method conceptually fails
to measure the conductance due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction
between the clamp current and the synaptic current. Consequently, it incurs
substantial measurement error, even giving rise to unphysically negative
conductance as observed in experiments. To elucidate synaptic impact on
neuronal information processing, we introduce the concept of effective
conductance and propose a framework to determine it accurately. Our work
suggests re-examination of previous studies involving conductance measurement
and provides a reliable approach to assess synaptic influence on neuronal
computation.

<p>The brain has no direct access to physical stimuli, but only to the spiking
activity evoked in sensory organs. It is unclear how the brain can structure
its representation of the world based on differences between those noisy,
correlated responses alone. Here we show how to build a distance map of
responses from the structure of the population activity of retinal ganglion
cells, allowing for the accurate discrimination of distinct visual stimuli from
the retinal response. We introduce the Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine to
learn the spatiotemporal structure of the population activity, and use this
model to define a distance between spike trains. We show that this metric
outperforms existing neural distances at discriminating pairs of stimuli that
are barely distinguishable. The proposed method provides a generic and
biologically plausible way to learn to associate similar stimuli based on their
spiking responses, without any other knowledge of these stimuli.

<p>Bias in perceptual decisions comes to pass when the advance knowledge
colludes with the current sensory evidence in support of the final choice. The
literature on decision making suggests two main hypotheses to account for this
kind of bias: internal bias signals are derived from (a) the residual of motor
response-related signals, and (b) the sensory information residues of the
decisions that we made in the past. Beside these hypotheses, a credible
hypothesis proposed by this study to explain the cause of decision biasing,
suggests that the decision-related neuron can make use of the residual
information of the previous decision for the current decision. We demonstrate
the validity of this assumption, first by performing behavioral experiments
based on the two-alternative forced-choice (TAFC) discrimination of motion
direction paradigms and then, we modified the pure drift-diffusion model (DDM)
based on accumulation to the bound mechanism to account for the sequential
effect. In both cases, the trace of the previous trial influences the current
decision. Results indicate that the probability of being correct in a current
decision increases if it is in line with the previously made decision. Also,
the model that keeps the previous decision information provides a better fit to
the behavioral data. Our findings suggest that the state of a decision variable
which is represented in the activity of decision-related neurons after crossing
the bound (in the previous decision) can accumulate with the decision variable
for the current decision in consecutive trials.

Goal-directed behavior requires integrating action selection processes with learning systems that adapt control using environmental feedback. These functions intersect in the basal ganglia (BG), which has at least two targets of plasticity: a dopaminergic modulation of striatal pathways and cortical modulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Dual learning mechanisms suggests that feedback signals have a multifaceted impact on BG-dependent decisions. Using a hybrid of accumulation-to-bound decision models and reinforcement learning, we modeled the performance of humans in a stop-signal task where participants (N=75) learned the prior distribution of the timing of a stop signal through trial-and-error feedback. Changes in the drift-rate of the action execution process were driven by errors in action timing, whereas adaptation in the boundary height served to increase caution following failed stops. These findings highlight two interactive learning mechanisms for adapting the control of goal-directed actions based on dissociable dimensions of feedback error.

The present study is designed to identify the influences of genetic background to optic nerve regeneration using the two parental strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J and 7 BXD recombinant inbred strains. To study regeneration in the optic nerve, Pten was knocked down in the retinal ganglion cells using AAV, and a mild inflammatory response was induced by an intravitreal injection of zymosan with CPT-cAMP, and the axons were damaged by optic nerve crush (ONC). Regenerating axons were labeled by Cholera Toxin B and quantified 14 days after ONC. The number of axons at 0.5 mm and 1 mm from the crush site were counted. In addition, we measured the distance that 5 axons had grown down the nerve and the longest distance a single axon reached. Results showed a considerable amount of differential axonal growth across all 9 BXD strains. There was a significant difference (P=0.014 Mann-Whitney U test) in the regenerative capacity in the number of axons reaching 0.5 mm from a low of 1487.6 {+/-} 264.9 axons in BXD102 to a high of 4175.8 {+/-} 648.6 axons in BXD29. There were also significant differences (P=0.014 Mann-Whitney U test) in the distance axons traveled, looking at a minimum of 5 axons with the shortest distance was 787.2 {+/-} 46.5m in BXD102 to a maximum distance of 2025.5 {+/-} 223.3m in BXD29. These results reveal that genetic background can modulate axonal regeneration and that the BXD strains are a particularly well-suited model system.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204818v1?rss=1">Estimation of neuronal firing rate using Bayesian Adaptive Kernel Smoother (BAKS)</a></h4>

Neurons use sequences of action potentials (spikes) to convey information across neuronal networks. In neurophysiology experiments, information about external stimuli or behavioral tasks has been frequently characterized in term of neuronal firing rate. The firing rate is conventionally estimated by averaging spiking responses across multiple similar experiments (or trials). However, there exist a number of applications in neuroscience research that require firing rate to be estimated on a single trial basis. Estimating firing rate from a single trial is a challenging problem and current state-of-the-art methods do not perform well. To address this issue, we develop a new method for estimating firing rate based on kernel smoothing technique that considers the bandwidth as a random variable with prior distribution that is adaptively updated under a Bayesian framework. By carefully selecting the prior distribution together with Gaussian kernel function, an analytical expression can be achieved for the kernel bandwidth. We refer to the proposed method as Bayesian Adaptive Kernel Smoother (BAKS). We evaluate the performance of BAKS using synthetic spike train data generated by biologically plausible models: inhomogeneous Gamma (IG) and inhomogeneous inverse Gaussian (IIG). We also apply BAKS to real spike train data from non-human primate (NHP) motor and visual cortex. We benchmark the proposed method against the established and previously reported methods. These include: optimized kernel smoother (OKS), variable kernel smoother (VKS), local polynomial fit (Locfit), and Bayesian adaptive regression splines (BARS). Results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared to competing methods. This suggests that the proposed method could be useful for understanding the encoding mechanism of neurons in cognitive-related tasks. The proposed method could also potentially improve the performance of brain-machine interface (BMI) decoder that relies on estimated firing rate as the input.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204701v1?rss=1">Conservation of differentiation but transformation of initiation in hippocampal neurogenesis</a></h4>

The dentate gyrus in the hippocampal formation is one of few regions in the brain where neurogenesis persists in the adult, and is therefore studied in the context of neurodevelopment and regenerative medicine. However, the relationship between developmental and adult neurogenesis has not been studied in detail. Here, we used extensive and unbiased single-cell RNA-seq to reveal the molecular dynamics and diversity of cell types in perinatal, juvenile and adult mice. We found clearly distinct quiescent and proliferating progenitor cell types, linked by transient intermediate states to neuroblast stages and fully mature granule cells. The molecular identity of quiescent and proliferating radial glia shifted after postnatal day 5, and was then maintained through postnatal and adult stages. A similar shift was observed for granule cells at P20. In contrast, intermediate progenitor cells, neuroblasts and immature granule cells were nearly indistinguishable at all ages. These findings demonstrate the fundamental continunity of postnatal and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and pinpoint the early postnatal transformation of radial glia from embryonic progenitors to adult quiescent stem cells.

Understanding how neuronal signals propagate in local network is an important step in understanding information processing. As a result, spike trains recorded with Multi-electrode Arrays (MEAs) have been widely used to study behaviors of neural connections. Studying the dynamics of neuronal networks requires the identification of both excitatory and inhibitory connections. The detection of excitatory relationships can robustly be inferred by characterizing the statistical relationships of neural spike trains. However, the identification of inhibitory relationships is more difficult: distinguishing endogenous low firing rates from active inhibition is not obvious. In this paper, we propose an in silico interventional procedure that makes predictions about the effect of stimulating or inhibiting single neurons on other neurons, and thereby gives the ability to accurately identify inhibitory causal relationships. To experimentally test these predictions, we have developed a Neural Circuit Probe (NCP) that delivers drugs transiently and reversibly on individually identified neurons to assess their contributions to the neural circuit behavior. With the help of NCP, three inhibitory connections identified by our in silico modeling were validated through real interventional experiments. Together, these methods provide a basis for mapping complete neural circuits.

Adequate protein intake is crucial for animals. Despite the recent progress in understanding protein hunger and satiety in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, how fruit flies assess prospective dietary protein sources and ensure protein consumption remains elusive. We show here that three specific amino acids, L-glutamate (L-Glu), L-alanine (L-Ala), and L-aspartate (L-Asp), rapidly promote food consumption in fruit flies when present in food. The effect of dietary amino acids to promote food consumption is independent of mating experience and internal nutritional status. Genetic analysis identifies six brain neurons expressing diuretic hormone 44 (DH44) as a sensor of dietary amino acids. DH44+ neurons can be directly activated by these three amino acids, and are both necessary and sufficient for dietary amino acids to promote food consumption. By conducting single cell RNAseq analysis, we also identify an amino acid transporter, CG13248, which is highly expressed in DH44+ neurons and is required for dietary amino acids to promote food consumption. Therefore, these data suggest that dietary amino acids may enter DH44+ neurons via CG13248 and modulate their activity and hence food consumption. Taken together, these data identify an internal amino acid sensor in the fly brain that evaluate food sources post-ingestively and facilitates adequate protein intake.

Sexual dimorphism has been reported in the prevalence, onset and progression of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesize that immunological signaling in the developing brain, notably the complement cascade underlying microglial synaptic pruning, could be one mechanism for this dimorphism. Here we show that genes differentially expressed between male and female normal cortical development are enriched for pathways associated with the activation of the innate immune system, complement cascade and phagocytic processes. Specifically, the male brain is enriched for the expression of genes associated with phagocytic function of microglia through complement-dependent synaptic pruning especially at the developmental stages before birth. Our results suggest the existence of a common regulatory module involved in both prenatal immune activation in males and postnatal immune activation in females. The activation of immune pruning pathways at different stages of normal male and female development could provide valuable insights about critical periods of plasticity and refinement in the human cortex that could explain the different vulnerabilities of males and females to neurological disorders.

<p>by Shiran Abadi, Winston X. Yan, David Amar, Itay Mayrose</p>

The adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a genome editing technique has generated much excitement in recent years owing to its ability to manipulate targeted genes and genomic regions that are complementary to a programmed single guide RNA (sgRNA). However, the efficacy of a specific sgRNA is not uniquely defined by exact sequence homology to the target site, thus unintended off-targets might additionally be cleaved. Current methods for sgRNA design are mainly concerned with predicting off-targets for a given sgRNA using basic sequence features and employ elementary rules for ranking possible sgRNAs. Here, we introduce CRISTA (CRISPR Target Assessment), a novel algorithm within the machine learning framework that determines the propensity of a genomic site to be cleaved by a given sgRNA. We show that the predictions made with CRISTA are more accurate than other available methodologies. We further demonstrate that the occurrence of bulges is not a rare phenomenon and should be accounted for in the prediction process. Beyond predicting cleavage efficiencies, the learning process provides inferences regarding patterns that underlie the mechanism of action of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We discover that attributes that describe the spatial structure and rigidity of the entire genomic site as well as those surrounding the PAM region are a major component of the prediction capabilities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GOLPfmV6XL8" width="1" />

<p>by Evelina Gabasova, John Reid, Lorenz Wernisch</p>

Integrative clustering is used to identify groups of samples by jointly analysing multiple datasets describing the same set of biological samples, such as gene expression, copy number, methylation etc. Most existing algorithms for integrative clustering assume that there is a shared consistent set of clusters across all datasets, and most of the data samples follow this structure. However in practice, the structure across heterogeneous datasets can be more varied, with clusters being joined in some datasets and separated in others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic clustering method to identify groups across datasets that do not share the same cluster structure. The proposed algorithm, Clusternomics, identifies groups of samples that share their global behaviour across heterogeneous datasets. The algorithm models clusters on the level of individual datasets, while also extracting global structure that arises from the local cluster assignments. Clusters on both the local and the global level are modelled using a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture model to identify structure on both levels. We evaluated the model both on simulated and on real-world datasets. The simulated data exemplifies datasets with varying degrees of common structure. In such a setting Clusternomics outperforms existing algorithms for integrative and consensus clustering. In a real-world application, we used the algorithm for cancer subtyping, identifying subtypes of cancer from heterogeneous datasets. We applied the algorithm to TCGA breast cancer dataset, integrating gene expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation and proteomics. The algorithm extracted clinically meaningful clusters with significantly different survival probabilities. We also evaluated the algorithm on lung and kidney cancer TCGA datasets with high dimensionality, again showing clinically significant results and scalability of the algorithm.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dGbVYIyHTbc" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: We tested the hypothesis that somatosensory system injury would more strongly affect movement than motor system injury in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (USCP). This hypothesis was based on how somatosensory and corticospinal circuits adapt to injury during development: while the motor system can maintain connections to the impaired hand from the uninjured hemisphere, this doesn't occur in the somatosensory system. As a corollary, cortical injury strongly impairs sensory function, so we hypothesized that cortical lesions would impair hand function more than subcortical lesions.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Twenty-four children with unilateral CP had physiological and anatomical measures of the motor and somatosensory systems and lesion classification. Motor physiology was performed with transcranial magnetic stimulation and somatosensory physiology with vibration-evoked EEG potentials. Tractography of the corticospinal tract and the medial lemniscus were performed with diffusion tensor imaging, and lesions were classified by MRI. Anatomical and physiological results were correlated with measures of hand function using two independent statistical methods.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Children with disruptions in the somatosensory connectivity, and cortical lesions had the most severe upper extremity impairments, particularly somatosensory function. Motor system connectivity was significantly correlated with bimanual function, but not unimanual function or somatosensory function.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Both sensory and motor connectivity impact hand function in children with USCP. Somatosensory connectivity could be an important target for recovery of hand function in children with USCP. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<p>We explore a combinatorial framework which efficiently quantifies the
asymmetries between minima and maxima in local fluctuations of time series. We
firstly showcase its performance by applying it to a battery of synthetic
cases. We find rigorous results on some canonical dynamical models (stochastic
processes with and without correlations, chaotic processes) complemented by
extensive numerical simulations for a range of processes which indicate that
the methodology correctly distinguishes different complex dynamics and
outperforms state of the art metrics in several cases. Subsequently, we apply
this methodology to real-world problems emerging across several disciplines
including cases in neurobiology, finance and climate science. We conclude that
differences between the statistics of local maxima and local minima in time
series are highly informative of the complex underlying dynamics and a
graph-theoretic extraction procedure allows to use these features for
statistical learning purposes.

<p>Neural-network models of high-level brain functions such as memory recall and
reasoning often rely on the presence of stochasticity. The majority of these
models assumes that each neuron in the functional network is equipped with its
own private source of randomness, often in the form of uncorrelated external
noise. However, both in vivo and in silico, the number of noise sources is
limited due to space and bandwidth constraints. Hence, neurons in large
networks usually need to share noise sources. Here, we show that the resulting
shared-noise correlations can significantly impair the performance of
stochastic network models. We further demonstrate that this problem can be
overcome by using deterministic recurrent neural networks as sources of
stochasticity, exploiting the decorrelating effect of inhibitory feedback.
Consequently, even a single recurrent network of a few hundred neurons can
serve as a natural noise source for large ensembles of functional networks,
each comprising thousands of units. We test the proposed framework for a
diverse set of networks with different dimensionalities and entropies. A
network reproducing handwritten digits with distinct predefined frequencies
demonstrates the practical relevance. Finally, we show that the same design
transfers to functional networks of spiking neurons.

<p>An autoassociative network of Potts units, coupled via tensor connections,
has been proposed and analysed as an effective model of an extensive cortical
network with distinct short- and long-range synaptic connections, but it has
not been clarified in what sense it can be regarded as an effective model. We
draw here the correspondence between the two, which indicates the need to
introduce a local feedback term in the reduced model, i.e., in the Potts
network. Complementary to previous work, we study the storage capacity of the
Potts network with this additional term, the local feedback $w$, which
contributes to drive the activity of the network towards one of the stored
patterns. The storage capacity calculation, performed using replica tools, is
limited to fully connected networks, for which a Hamiltonian can be defined. To
extend the results to the case of intermediate partial connectivity, we also
derive the self-consistent signal-to-noise analysis for the Potts network; and
finally we discuss implications for semantic memory in humans.

Natural environments feature mixtures of odorants of diverse quantities, qualities and complexities. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are the first layer in the sensory pathway and transmit the olfactory signal to higher regions of the brain. Yet, the response of ORNs to mixtures is strongly non-additive, and exhibits antagonistic interactions among odorants. Here, we model the processing of mixtures by mammalian ORNs, focusing on the role of inhibitory mechanisms. Theoretically predicted response curves capture experimentally determined glomerular responses imaged by a calcium indicator expressed in ORNs of live, breathing mice. Antagonism leads to an effective "normalization" of the ensemble glomerular response, which arises from a novel mechanism involving the distinct statistical properties of receptor binding and activation, without any recurrent neuronal circuitry. Normalization allows our encoding model to outperform non-interacting models in odor discrimination tasks, and to explain several psychophysical experiments in humans.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204271v1?rss=1">A control theoretic model of adaptive behavior in dynamic environments</a></h4>

In order to behave adaptively in environments that are noisy and non-stationary, humans and other animals must monitor feedback from their environment and adjust their predictions and actions accordingly. An under-studied approach for modeling these adaptive processes comes from the engineering field of control theory, which provides general principles for regulating dynamical systems, often without requiring a generative model. The proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is one of the most popular models of industrial process control. The proportional term is analogous to the "delta rule" in psychology, adjusting estimates in proportion to each successive error in prediction. The integral and derivative terms augment this update to simultaneously improve accuracy and stability. Here, we tested whether the PID algorithm can describe how people sequentially adjust their predictions in response to new information. Across three experiments, we found that the PID controller was an effective model of participants' decisions in noisy, changing environments. In Experiment 1, we re-analyzed a change-point detection experiment, and showed that participants' behavior incorporated elements of PID updating. Experiments 2-3 employed a gradual change-point task that was optimized to detect PID-like adjustments. In both experiments, the PID model offered better descriptions of behavioral adjustments than the classical delta-rule model. We further examined how participants weighted different PID terms in response to salient environmental events. Across experiments, we found that the weights on these control terms were modulated by reward, surprise, and outcome entropy. These experiments provide preliminary evidence that adaptive behavior in dynamic environments resembles PID control.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/204248v1?rss=1">Rats optimally accumulate and discount evidence in a dynamic environment</a></h4>

How choices are made within noisy environments is a central question in the neuroscience of decision making. Previous work has characterized temporal accumulation of evidence for decision-making in static environments. However, real-world decision-making involves environments with statistics that change over time. This requires discounting old evidence that may no longer inform the current state of the world. Here we designed a rat behavioral task with a dynamic environment, to probe whether rodents can optimally discount evidence by adapting the timescale over which they accumulate it. Extending existing results about optimal inference in a dynamic environment, we show that the optimal timescale for evidence discounting depends on both the stimulus statistics and noise in sensory processing. We found that when both of these components were taken into account, rats accumulated and temporally discounted evidence almost optimally. Furthermore, we found that by changing the dynamics of the environment, experimenters could control the rats accumulation timescale, switching them from accumulating over short timescales to accumulating over long timescales and back. The theoretical framework also makes quantitative predictions regarding the timing of changes of mind in the dynamic environment. This study establishes a quantitative behavioral framework to control and investigate neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive nature of evidence accumulation timescales and changes of mind.

<div class="section" id="ana25044-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a rare condition characterized by a reduced cerebral cortex accompanied with intellectual disability. Mutations in 17 genes have been shown to cause this phenotype. Recently, mutations in <em>CIT,</em> encoding CRIK (citron rho-interacting kinase)—a component of the central spindle matrix—were added. We aimed at identifying novel MCPH-associated genes and exploring their functional role in pathogenesis.</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25044-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>We identified homozygous mutations in <em>KIF14</em> (NM_014875.2;c.263T&gt;A;pLeu88*, c.2480_2482delTTG; p.Val827del, and c.4071G&gt;A;p.Gln1357=) as the likely cause in 3 MCPH families. Furthermore, in a patient presenting with a severe form of primary microcephaly and short stature, we identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in <em>KIF14</em> (NM_014875.2;c.2545C&gt;G;p.His849Asp and c.3662G&gt;T;p.Gly1221Val). Three of the 5 identified mutations impaired splicing, and 2 resulted in a truncated protein. Intriguingly, <em>Kif14</em> knockout mice also showed primary microcephaly. Human kinesin-like protein KIF14, a microtubule motor protein, localizes at the midbody to finalize cytokinesis by interacting with CRIK. We found impaired localization of both KIF14 and CRIK at the midbody in patient-derived fibroblasts. Furthermore, we observed a large number of binucleated and apoptotic cells—signs of failed cytokinesis that we also observed in experimentally KIF14-depleted cells.</p></div></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Oral Anticoagulation Treatment (OAT) resumption is a therapeutic dilemma in Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) care, particularly for lobar hemorrhages related to amyloid angiopathy. We sought to determine whether OAT resumption after ICH is associated with long-term outcome, accounting for ICH location (i.e. lobar vs. non-lobar).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We meta-analyzed individual patient data from: 1) the multi-center RETRACE study (n=542); 2) a US-based single-center ICH study (n=261); 3) the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study (n=209). We determined whether, within one year from ICH, OAT resumption was associated with: 1) mortality; 2) favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-3); stroke incidence. We separately analyzed non-lobar and lobar ICH cases using propensity score matching and Cox regression models.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: We included 1012 OAT-related ICH survivors (633 non-lobar and 379 lobar). Among non-lobar ICH survivors 178/633 (28%) resumed OAT, while 86/379 (23%) lobar ICH survivors did. In multivariable analyses OAT resumption after non-lobar ICH was associated with decreased mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.25, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]=0.14-0.44, p&lt;0.0001) and improved functional outcome (HR=4.22, 95% CI=2.57-6.94, p&lt;0.0001). OAT resumption after lobar ICH was also associated with decreased mortality (HR=0.29, 95% CI=0.17-0.45, p&lt;0.0001) and favorable functional outcome (HR=4.08, 95% CI=2.48-6.72, p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, OAT resumption was associated with decreased all-cause stroke incidence in both lobar and non-lobar ICH (both p&lt;0.01).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: These results suggest novel evidence of an association between OAT resumption and outcome following ICH, regardless of hematoma location. These findings support conducting randomized trials to explore risks and benefits of OAT resumption after ICH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<p>Causality testing, the act of determining cause and effect from measurements,
is widely used in physics, climatology, neuroscience, econometrics and other
disciplines. As a result, a large number of causality testing methods based on
various principles have been developed. Causal relationships in complex systems
are typically accompanied by entropic exchanges which are encoded in patterns
of dynamical measurements. A data compression algorithm which can extract these
encoded patterns could be used for inferring these relations. This motivates us
to propose, for the first time, a generic causality testing framework based on
data compression. The framework unifies existing causality testing methods and
enables us to innovate a novel Compression-Complexity Causality measure. This
measure is rigorously tested on simulated and real-world time series and is
found to overcome the limitations of Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy,
especially for noisy and non-synchronous measurements. Additionally, it gives
insight on the `kind' of causal influence between input time series by the
notions of positive and negative causality.

<p>Evaluating human brain potentials during watching different images can be
used for memory evaluation, information retrieving, guilty-innocent
identification and examining the brain response. In this study, the effects of
watching images, with different levels of familiarity, on subjects'
Electroencephalogram (EEG) have been studied. Three different groups of images
with three familiarity levels of "unfamiliar", "familiar" and "very familiar"
have been considered for this study. EEG signals of 21 subjects (14 men) were
recorded. After signal acquisition, pre-processing, including noise and
artifact removal, were performed on epochs of data. Features, including
spatial-statistical, wavelet, frequency and harmonic parameters, and also
correlation between recording channels, were extracted from the data. Then, we
evaluated the efficiency of the extracted features by using p-value and also an
orthogonal feature selection method (combination of Gram-Schmitt method and
Fisher discriminant ratio) for feature dimensional reduction. As the final step
of feature selection, we used 'add-r take-away l' method for choosing the most
discriminative features. For data classification, including all two-class and
three-class cases, we applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the extracted
features. The correct classification rates (CCR) for "unfamiliar-familiar",
"unfamiliar-very familiar" and "familiar-very familiar" cases were 85.6%,
92.6%, and 70.6%, respectively. The best results of classifications were
obtained in pre-frontal and frontal regions of brain. Also, wavelet, frequency
and harmonic features were among the most discriminative features. Finally, in
three-class case, the best CCR was 86.8%.

<p>We study dynamics of a reverberating neural net by means of computer
simulation. The net, which is composed of 9 leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)
neurons arranged in a square lattice, is fully connected with interneuronal
communication delay proportional to the corresponding distance. The network is
initially stimulated with different stimuli and then goes freely. For each
stimulus, in the course of free evolution, activity either dies out completely
or the network converges to a periodic trajectory, which may be different for
different stimuli. The latter is observed for a set of 285290 initial stimuli
which constitutes 83% of all stimuli applied. By applying each stimulus from
the set, we found 102 different periodic end-states. By analyzing the
trajectories, we conclude that neuronal firing is the necessary prerequisite
for merging different trajectories into a single one, which eventually
transforms into a periodic regime. Observed phenomena of self-organization in
the time domain are discussed as a possible model for processes taking place
during perception. The repetitive firing in the periodic regimes could underpin
memory formation.

<p>by Niklas Hübel, Mahshid S. Hosseini-Zare, Jokūbas Žiburkus, Ghanim Ullah</p>

Simultaneous changes in ion concentrations, glutamate, and cell volume together with exchange of matter between cell network and vasculature are ubiquitous in numerous brain pathologies. A complete understanding of pathological conditions as well as normal brain function, therefore, hinges on elucidating the molecular and cellular pathways involved in these mostly interdependent variations. In this paper, we develop the first computational framework that combines the Hodgkin–Huxley type spiking dynamics, dynamic ion concentrations and glutamate homeostasis, neuronal and astroglial volume changes, and ion exchange with vasculature into a comprehensive model to elucidate the role of glutamate uptake in the dynamics of spreading depolarization (SD)—the electrophysiological event underlying numerous pathologies including migraine, ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hematoma, and trauma. We are particularly interested in investigating the role of glutamate in the duration and termination of SD caused by K<sup>+</sup> perfusion and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our results demonstrate that glutamate signaling plays a key role in the dynamics of SD, and that impaired glutamate uptake leads to recovery failure of neurons from SD. We confirm predictions from our model experimentally by showing that inhibiting astrocytic glutamate uptake using TFB-TBOA nearly quadruples the duration of SD in layers 2-3 of visual cortical slices from juvenile rats. The model equations are either derived purely from first physical principles of electroneutrality, osmosis, and conservation of particles or a combination of these principles and known physiological facts. Accordingly, we claim that our approach can be used as a future guide to investigate the role of glutamate, ion concentrations, and dynamics cell volume in other brain pathologies and normal brain function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AsuHPRHYqL0" width="1" />

The analysis of the mutational landscape of cancer, including mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations, has been instrumental in studying the disease. We hypothesized that exploring the interplay between co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and functional interactions between genes will further improve our understanding of the disease and help to uncover new relations between cancer driving genes and pathways. To this end, we designed a general framework, BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations of mutation and interaction patterns. We focused on three different settings of the BeWith schema: (i) BeME-WithFun, in which the relations between modules are enriched with mutual exclusivity, while genes within each module are functionally related; (ii) BeME-WithCo, which combines mutual exclusivity between modules with co-occurrence within modules; and (iii) BeCo-WithMEFun, which ensures co-occurrence between modules, while the within module relations combine mutual exclusivity and functional interactions. We formulated the BeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find optimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of BeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes, and pathways. In particular, BeME-WithFun helped identify functionally coherent modules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding previously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to other novel findings such as the interaction between NCOR2 and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an application of the BeME-WithCo setting revealed that gene groups differ with respect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us to uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergistic effects, including a potential synergy between mutations in TP53 and the metastasis related DCC gene. Overall, BeWith not only helped us uncover relations between potential driver genes and pathways, but also provided additional insights on patterns of the mutational landscape, going beyond cancer driving mutations.

<p>by Kevin Drew, Christian L. Müller, Richard Bonneau, Edward M. Marcotte</p>

Determining the three dimensional arrangement of proteins in a complex is highly beneficial for uncovering mechanistic function and interpreting genetic variation in coding genes comprising protein complexes. There are several methods for determining co-complex interactions between proteins, among them co-fractionation / mass spectrometry (CF-MS), but it remains difficult to identify directly contacting subunits within a multi-protein complex. Correlation analysis of CF-MS profiles shows promise in detecting protein complexes as a whole but is limited in its ability to infer direct physical contacts among proteins in sub-complexes. To identify direct protein-protein contacts within human protein complexes we learn a sparse conditional dependency graph from approximately 3,000 CF-MS experiments on human cell lines. We show substantial performance gains in estimating direct interactions compared to correlation analysis on a benchmark of large protein complexes with solved three-dimensional structures. We demonstrate the method’s value in determining the three dimensional arrangement of proteins by making predictions for complexes without known structure (the exocyst and tRNA multi-synthetase complex) and by establishing evidence for the structural position of a recently discovered component of the core human EKC/KEOPS complex, GON7/C14ORF142, providing a more complete 3D model of the complex. Direct contact prediction provides easily calculable additional structural information for large-scale protein complex mapping studies and should be broadly applicable across organisms as more CF-MS datasets become available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pvQ962AXtfg" width="1" />

<p>by Bo Wang, Lin Huang, Yuke Zhu, Anshul Kundaje, Serafim Batzoglou, Anna Goldenberg</p>

Biological networks entail important topological features and patterns critical to understanding interactions within complicated biological systems. Despite a great progress in understanding their structure, much more can be done to improve our inference and network analysis. Spectral methods play a key role in many network-based applications. Fundamental to spectral methods is the Laplacian, a matrix that captures the global structure of the network. Unfortunately, the Laplacian does not take into account intricacies of the network’s local structure and is sensitive to noise in the network. These two properties are fundamental to biological networks and cannot be ignored. We propose an alternative matrix <i>Vicus</i>. The Vicus matrix captures the local neighborhood structure of the network and thus is more effective at modeling biological interactions. We demonstrate the advantages of Vicus in the context of spectral methods by extensive empirical benchmarking on tasks such as single cell dimensionality reduction, protein module discovery and ranking genes for cancer subtyping. Our experiments show that using Vicus, spectral methods result in more accurate and robust performance in all of these tasks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N-68mvTRJW4" width="1" />

A large fraction of the proteins that are being identified as key tumor dependencies represent poor pharmacological targets or lack clinically-relevant small-molecule inhibitors. Availability of fully generalizable approaches for the systematic and efficient prioritization of tumor-context specific protein activity inhibitors would thus have significant translational value. Unfortunately, inhibitor effects on protein activity cannot be directly measured in systematic and proteome-wide fashion by conventional biochemical assays. We introduce OncoLead, a novel network based approach for the systematic prioritization of candidate inhibitors for arbitrary targets of therapeutic interest. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> validation confirmed that OncoLead analysis can recapitulate known inhibitors as well as prioritize novel, context-specific inhibitors of difficult targets, such as <i>MYC</i> and <i>STAT3</i>. We used OncoLead to generate the first unbiased drug/regulator interaction map, representing compounds modulating the activity of cancer-relevant transcription factors, with potential in precision medicine.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VxPfG32FVlU" width="1" />

Network propagation is an important and widely used algorithm in systems biology, with applications in protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and patient stratification. However, up to this point it has required significant expertise to run. Here we extend the popular network analysis program Cytoscape to perform network propagation as an integrated function. Such integration greatly increases the access to network propagation by putting it in the hands of biologists and linking it to the many other types of network analysis and visualization available through Cytoscape. We demonstrate the power and utility of the algorithm by identifying mutations conferring resistance to Vemurafenib.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UR4nnjuvuFI" width="1" />

<p>by Aziz M. Mezlini, Anna Goldenberg</p>

Discovering genetic mechanisms driving complex diseases is a hard problem. Existing methods often lack power to identify the set of responsible genes. Protein-protein interaction networks have been shown to boost power when detecting gene-disease associations. We introduce a Bayesian framework, Conflux, to find disease associated genes from exome sequencing data using networks as a prior. There are two main advantages to using networks within a probabilistic graphical model. First, networks are noisy and incomplete, a substantial impediment to gene discovery. Incorporating networks into the structure of a probabilistic models for gene inference has less impact on the solution than relying on the noisy network structure directly. Second, using a Bayesian framework we can keep track of the uncertainty of each gene being associated with the phenotype rather than returning a fixed list of genes. We first show that using networks clearly improves gene detection compared to individual gene testing. We then show consistently improved performance of Conflux compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion network-based method Hotnet2 and a variety of other network and variant aggregation methods, using randomly generated and literature-reported gene sets. We test Hotnet2 and Conflux on several network configurations to reveal biases and patterns of false positives and false negatives in each case. Our experiments show that our novel Bayesian framework Conflux incorporates many of the advantages of the current state-of-the-art methods, while offering more flexibility and improved power in many gene-disease association scenarios.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kUw0rxsgQDw" width="1" />

<p>by Emine Guven-Maiorov, Chung-Jung Tsai, Ruth Nussinov</p>

Hundreds of different species colonize multicellular organisms making them “metaorganisms”. A growing body of data supports the role of microbiota in health and in disease. Grasping the principles of host-microbiota interactions (HMIs) at the molecular level is important since it may provide insights into the mechanisms of infections. The crosstalk between the host and the microbiota may help resolve puzzling questions such as how a microorganism can contribute to both health and disease. Integrated superorganism networks that consider host and microbiota as a whole–may uncover their code, clarifying perhaps the most fundamental question: how they modulate immune surveillance. Within this framework, structural HMI networks can uniquely identify potential microbial effectors that target distinct host nodes or interfere with endogenous host interactions, as well as how mutations on either host or microbial proteins affect the interaction. Furthermore, structural HMIs can help identify master host cell regulator nodes and modules whose tweaking by the microbes promote aberrant activity. Collectively, these data can delineate pathogenic mechanisms and thereby help maximize beneficial therapeutics. To date, challenges in experimental techniques limit large-scale characterization of HMIs. Here we highlight an area in its infancy which we believe will increasingly engage the computational community: predicting interactions across kingdoms, and mapping these on the host cellular networks to figure out how commensal and pathogenic microbiota modulate the host signaling and broadly cross-species consequences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I1eNXPCZnzk" width="1" />

<p>by Kevin S. Bonham, Melanie I. Stefan</p>

While women are generally underrepresented in STEM fields, there are noticeable differences between fields. For instance, the gender ratio in biology is more balanced than in computer science. We were interested in how this difference is reflected in the interdisciplinary field of computational/quantitative biology. To this end, we examined the proportion of female authors in publications from the PubMed and arXiv databases. There are fewer female authors on research papers in computational biology, as compared to biology in general. This is true across authorship position, year, and journal impact factor. A comparison with arXiv shows that quantitative biology papers have a higher ratio of female authors than computer science papers, placing computational biology in between its two parent fields in terms of gender representation. Both in biology and in computational biology, a female last author increases the probability of other authors on the paper being female, pointing to a potential role of female PIs in influencing the gender balance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6WjygxNvj58" width="1" />

<div class="para"><p>Biallelic <em>DNAJC12</em> mutations were described in children with hyperphenylalaninemia, neurodevelopmental delay, and dystonia. We identified <em>DNAJC12</em> homozygous null variants (c.187A&gt;T;p.K63* and c.79-2A&gt;G;p.V27Wfs*14) in two kindreds with early-onset parkinsonism. Both probands had mild intellectual disability, mild nonprogressive, motor symptoms, sustained benefit from small dose of levodopa, and substantial worsening of symptoms after levodopa discontinuation. Neuropathology (Proband-A) revealed no alpha-synuclein pathology, and substantia nigra depigmentation with moderate cell loss. <em>DNAJC12</em> transcripts were reduced in both patients. Our results suggest that <em>DNAJC12</em> mutations (absent in 500 early-onset patients with Parkinson's disease) rarely cause dopa-responsive nonprogressive parkinsonism in adulthood, but broaden the clinical spectrum of <em>DNAJC12</em> deficiency.

We tested how this information impacts data-driven classification between unresponsive and minimally conscious patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25045-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>A cohort of 127 patients in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS; n = 70) and minimally conscious state (MCS; n = 57) were presented with the local–global auditory oddball paradigm, which distinguishes 2 levels of processing: short-term deviation of local auditory regularities and global long-term rule violations. In addition to previously validated markers of consciousness extracted from electroencephalograms (EEG), we computed autonomic cardiac markers, such as heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV), and cardiac cycle phase shifts triggered by the processing of the auditory stimuli.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25045-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>HR and HRV were similar in patients across groups. The cardiac cycle was not sensitive to the processing of local regularities in either the VS/UWS or MCS patients. In contrast, global regularities induced a phase shift of the cardiac cycle exclusively in the MCS group. The interval between the auditory stimulation and the following R peak was significantly shortened in MCS when the auditory rule was violated. When the information for the cardiac cycle modulations and other consciousness-related EEG markers were combined, single patient classification performance was enhanced compared to classification with solely EEG markers.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25045-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Our work shows a link between residual cognitive processing and the modulation of autonomic somatic markers.

A long-standing question has been how presynaptic NMDA receptors influence high-frequency evoked neurotransmission but spontaneous release at low rates. Providing resolution, Abrahamsson et al. show that these receptors regulate evoked and spontaneous release via distinct RIM1αβ- and JNK2-dependent mechanisms, respectively.

<p>by Mark L. Ioffe, Michael J. Berry II</p>

Recent advances in experimental techniques have allowed the simultaneous recordings of populations of hundreds of neurons, fostering a debate about the nature of the collective structure of population neural activity. Much of this debate has focused on the empirical findings of a phase transition in the parameter space of maximum entropy models describing the measured neural probability distributions, interpreting this phase transition to indicate a critical tuning of the neural code. Here, we instead focus on the possibility that this is a first-order phase transition which provides evidence that the real neural population is in a ‘structured’, collective state. We show that this collective state is robust to changes in stimulus ensemble and adaptive state. We find that the pattern of pairwise correlations between neurons has a strength that is well within the strongly correlated regime and does not require fine tuning, suggesting that this state is generic for populations of 100+ neurons. We find a clear correspondence between the emergence of a phase transition, and the emergence of attractor-like structure in the inferred energy landscape. A collective state in the neural population, in which neural activity patterns naturally form clusters, provides a consistent interpretation for our results.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B5PqSxk57oU" width="1" />

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: To retrospectively analyze the effect of plasma exchange (PLEX, yes=PLEX+, no=PLEX-) and steroids administration timing (prophylactically –proST- or therapeutically –therST-) on the longitudinal clinical course of patients with natalizumab related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and full blown immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Clinical and radiological data of 42 Italian patients with PML were analyzed. Patient's data are available until 12 months after PML diagnosis. PLEX and steroids treatment as time-dependent covariates were entered in: i) a Cox model to investigate their impact on full blown PML-IRIS latency; ii) an ANOVA to investigate their impact on IRIS duration; iii) a linear mixed model to assess their impact on the longitudinal clinical course (measured by means of EDSS).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Treatment with PLEX was not associated to PML-IRIS latency (HR=1.05, p=0.92), but once IRIS emerged, its duration was significantly longer in patients who underwent PLEX (101 vs 54 days in PLEX+ and PLEX- patients, p=0.028). Receiving proST vs therST was not associated to IRIS latency (HR=0.67, p=0.39) or duration (p=0.95). Patients who underwent proST had a significant higher EDSS increase during PML (0.09 EDSS points per month, p=0.04) as compared to those who had therST.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: this study highlights that: i) caution on the use of PLEX should be considered as the current data do not support a beneficial effect of PLEX; ii) caution on the early use of steroids is suggested since their prophylactic use to prevent full blown PML-IRIS seems to negatively impact on the longitudinal disability course.

Neuroscience as a broad and growing discipline encompasses many fields of study, from molecular to systems-level, including cognitive and theoretical domains. These are exciting times for neuroscience, when many of these traditionally separate efforts are beginning to converge, and one can envision the day we may be able to respond to some fundamental questions, such as how molecules, cells, and circuits interplay to make us feel, act, and ultimately understand who we are. I am delighted to be the new Editor-in-Chief of Neuron, whose mission is to continue to disseminate the highest quality work in neuroscience.

How nuclear architecture contributes to transcriptional regulation in neural progenitor cells (NeuPCs) is poorly understood. A study by Toda et al. (2017) now shows that the nuclear pore protein Nup153 associates with the Sox2 transcription factor in the regulation of NeuPC maintenance and neural fate.

Astrocytes are important regulators of synapse formation. Farhy-Tselnicker et al. identify the molecular pathway of active neuronal synapse formation induced by astrocyte-secreted glypican 4. These data functionally link astrocytes to signaling cascades activated in both pre- and postsynaptic neurons.

Kupferschmidt et al. probe real-time activity dynamics of associative and sensorimotor cortical projections to striatum during skill learning. They reveal substantive co-engagement and dissociable disengagement of the two pathways across learning and find that associative pathway disengagement predicts subsequent skill learning.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>:To detect and quantify peripheral nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) by magnetic resonance neurography (MRN).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: 36 patients diagnosed with MS based on the 2010 McDonald criteria (34 with the relapsing-remitting form, 2 with clinically isolated syndrome) with and without disease modifying treatment were compared to 35 healthy age/sex-matched volunteers. All patients underwent detailed neurological and electrophysiological examinations. 3T MRN with large anatomical coverage of both legs and the lumbosacral plexus was performed by using 2D fat-saturated, T2-weighted and dual echo turbo-spin-echo sequences as well as a 3D T2-weighted, fat-saturated SPACE sequence. Besides qualitative visual nerve assessment, a T2w-signal quantification was performed by calculation of proton-spin-density and T2-relaxation time. Nerve diameter was measured as a morphometric criterion.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>:T2w-hyperintense nerve lesions were detectable in all MS patients with a mean lesion number at thigh level of 151.5±5.7 vs. 19.1±2.4 in controls (p&lt;0.0001). Nerve proton-spin-density was higher in MS (tibial/peroneal: 371.8±7.7/368.9±8.2) vs. controls (tibial/peroneal: 266.0±11.0/276.8±9.7;p&lt;0.0001). In contrast, T2-relaxation time was significantly higher in controls (tibial/peroneal:82.0±2.1/78.3±1.7) vs. MS (tibial/peroneal:64.3±1.0/61.2±0.9; p&lt;0.0001). Proximal tibial and peroneal nerve caliber was higher in MS (tibial:52.4±2.1mm<sup>2</sup>; peroneal:25.4±1.3mm<sup>2</sup>) vs. controls (tibial:45.2±1.4mm<sup>2</sup>; p&lt;0.0015; peroneal:21.3±0.7mm<sup>2</sup>; p=0.0049).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>:Peripheral nerve lesions could be visualized and quantified in MS <em>in vivo</em> by high resolution MRN. Lesions are defined by an increase of proton-spin-density and a decrease of T2-relaxation time, indicating changes in the microstructural organization of the extracellular matrix in peripheral nerve tissue in MS. By showing involvement of the peripheral nervous system in MS, this proof-of-concept study may offer new insights into the pathophysiology and treatment of MS. This article is protected by copyright.

<p>by Jiawen Chen, Steven C. Almo, Yinghao Wu</p>

The interactions between membrane receptors and extracellular ligands control cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, and environmental responsiveness by representing the initial steps of cell signaling pathways. These interactions can be spatial-temporally regulated when different extracellular ligands are tethered. The detailed mechanisms of this spatial-temporal regulation, including the competition between distinct ligands with overlapping binding sites and the conformational flexibility in multi-specific ligand assemblies have not been quantitatively evaluated. We present a new coarse-grained model to realistically simulate the binding process between multi-specific ligands and membrane receptors on cell surfaces. The model simplifies each receptor and each binding site in a multi-specific ligand as a rigid body. Different numbers or types of ligands are spatially organized together in the simulation. These designs were used to test the relation between the overall binding of a multi-specific ligand and the affinity of its cognate binding site. When a variety of ligands are exposed to cells expressing different densities of surface receptors, we demonstrated that ligands with reduced affinities have higher specificity to distinguish cells based on the relative concentrations of their receptors. Finally, modification of intramolecular flexibility was shown to play a role in optimizing the binding between receptors and ligands. In summary, our studies bring new insights to the general principles of ligand-receptor interactions. Future applications of our method will pave the way for new strategies to generate next-generation biologics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-8iK-8w2t8" width="1" />

<p>by Alex D. M. Dewar, Antoine Wystrach, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

All organisms wishing to survive and reproduce must be able to respond adaptively to a complex, changing world. Yet the computational power available is constrained by biology and evolution, favouring mechanisms that are parsimonious yet robust. Here we investigate the information carried in small populations of visually responsive neurons in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. These so-called ‘ring neurons’, projecting to the ellipsoid body of the central complex, are reported to be necessary for complex visual tasks such as pattern recognition and visual navigation. Recently the receptive fields of these neurons have been mapped, allowing us to investigate how well they can support such behaviours. For instance, in a simulation of classic pattern discrimination experiments, we show that the pattern of output from the ring neurons matches observed fly behaviour. However, performance of the neurons (as with flies) is not perfect and can be easily improved with the addition of extra neurons, suggesting the neurons’ receptive fields are not optimised for recognising abstract shapes, a conclusion which casts doubt on cognitive explanations of fly behaviour in pattern recognition assays. Using artificial neural networks, we then assess how easy it is to decode more general information about stimulus shape from the ring neuron population codes. We show that these neurons are well suited for encoding information about size, position and orientation, which are more relevant behavioural parameters for a fly than abstract pattern properties. This leads us to suggest that in order to understand the properties of neural systems, one must consider how perceptual circuits put information at the service of behaviour.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DGYmgqBhDFo" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective: Previous work measures spinal cord thinning in chronic progressive myelopathies, including HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Quantitative measurements of spinal cord atrophy are important in fully characterizing these and other spinal cord diseases. We aimed to investigate patterns of spinal cord atrophy and correlations with clinical markers.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods: Spinal cord cross sectional area was measured in individuals (24 healthy controls (HC), 17 asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1 (AC), 47 HAM/TSP, 74 RRMS, 17 SPMS, and 40 PPMS) from C1 to T10. Clinical disability scores, viral markers, and immunological parameters were obtained for patients and correlated with representative spinal cord cross sectional area regions at the C2-C3, C4-C5, and T4-T9 levels. In two HAM/TSP patients, spinal cord cross sectional area was measured over three years.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results: All spinal cord regions are thinner in HAM/TSP (56 mm<sup>2</sup> [SD 10], 59 [10], 23 [5]) than in HC (76 [7], 83 [8], 38 [4]) and AC (71 [7], 78 [9], 36 [7]). SPMS (62 [9], 66 [9], 32 [6]) and PPMS (65 [11], 68 [10], 35 [7]) have thinner cervical cords than HC and RRMS (73 [9], 77 [10], 37 [6]). Clinical disability scores (EDSS (p=0.009) and IPEC(p=0.03)) and CD8+ T cell frequency (p=0.04) correlate with T4-T9 spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP. Higher CSF HTLV-1 proviral load (p=0.01) was associated with thinner spinal cord cross sectional area. Both HAM/TSP patients followed longitudinally showed thoracic thinning followed by cervical thinning.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation: Group average spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP and progressive MS show spinal cord atrophy. We further hypothesize that is possible that neuroglial loss from a thoracic inflammatory process results in anterograde and retrograde degeneration of axons, leading to the temporal progression of thoracic to cervical atrophy described here.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Cardiac diseases are established risk factors for ischemic stroke incidence and severity. Conversely, there is increasing evidence that brain ischemia can cause cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this neurogenic heart disease are incompletely understood. While it is established that ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial damage, elevated cardiac enzymes and plasma catecholamines in the acute phase, nothing is known about the delayed consequences of ischemic stroke on cardiovascular function.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: To determine the long-term cardiac consequences of a focal cerebral ischemia, we subjected young and aged mice to a 30-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and analyzed cardiac function by serial transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements up to week 8 after surgery. Finally, animals were treated with metoprolol to evaluate a pharmacologic treatment option to prevent the development of heart failure.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Focal cerebral ischemia induced a long-term cardiac dysfunction with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular volumes; this development was associated with higher peripheral sympathetic activity. Metoprolol treatment prevented the development of chronic cardiac dysfunction by decelerating extracellular cardiac remodeling and inhibiting sympathetic signaling relevant to chronic autonomic dysfunction.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Focal cerebral ischemia in mice leads to the development of chronic systolic dysfunction driven by increased sympathetic activity. If these results can be confirmed in a clinical setting, treating physicians should be attentive to clinical signs of heart failure in every patient after ischemic stroke. Therapeutically, the successful β-blockade with metoprolol in mice could also have future clinical implications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Studies suggest a greater risk of Parkinson disease (PD) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it is possible that the risk of TBI is greater in the prodromal period of PD. We aimed to examine the time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period compared to population-based controls.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We identified 89,790 incident PD cases and 118,095 comparable controls &gt; 65 years of age in 2009 using Medicare claims data. Using data from the preceding five years, we compared time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period to controls. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for TBI in a Cox regression, while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, modified Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and alcohol use.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Risk of TBI was greater in PD patients in their prodromal period across all age and sex groups, with HRs consistently increasing with proximity to PD diagnosis. HRs ranged from 1.64 (95% CI 1.52, 1.77) five years prior to diagnosis to 3.93 (95% CI 3.74, 4.13) in the year prior. The interaction between PD, TBI, and time was primarily observed for TBI attributed to falls. Motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggested by corresponding ICD-9 codes, partially mediated the PD-TBI association.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: There is a strong association between PD and a recent TBI in the prodromal period of PD. This association strengthens as PD diagnosis approaches and may be a result of undetected non-motor and motor symptoms, but confirmation will be required. This article is protected by copyright.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>OBJECTIVE</b>: To investigate the associations between age, vascular health, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging biomarkers in an elderly sample.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>METHODS</b>: We identified 430 individuals along the cognitive continuum aged&gt;60 years with amyloid-PET, Tau-PET, and MRI scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. A subset of 329 individuals had FDG-PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from healthcare records and used the summation of presence/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac-arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from PiB-PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake (ERC-tau) from Tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC=0 (CMC-) vs. CMC&gt;0 (CMC+) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEM), we assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and APOE effects.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>RESULTS</b>: CMC+ participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC- participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEM models showed that i) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and ii) vascular health specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>INTERPRETATION</b>: Vascular health had quantifiably greater impact on neurodegeneration in AD regions than on amyloid deposition. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between tau deposition and vascular health. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><em>Objective</em>: Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA or Sanfilippo disease type A is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder presenting in early childhood, caused by an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase sulfamidase. New missense mutations, for which genotype-phenotype correlations are currently unknown, are frequently reported, hampering early prediction of phenotypic severity and efficacy assessment of new disease-modifying treatments. We aimed to design a method to determine phenotypic severity early in the disease course. <em>Methods</em>: Fifty-three patients were included of whom skin fibroblasts and data on disease course and mutation analysis were available. Patients were phenotypically characterized on clinical data as ‘rapidly progressing' or ‘slowly progressing'. Sulfamidase activity was measured in fibroblasts cultured at 37°C and at 30°C. <em>Results</em>: Sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a combination of known severe mutations remained below the limit of quantification under both culture conditions. In contrast, sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a known mild mutation increased above the limit of quantification when cultured at 30°C. With division on the basis of the patients phenotype, fibroblasts from ‘slowly progressing' patients could be separated from ‘rapid progressing' patients by increase in sulfamidase activity when cultured at 30°C (p&lt;0.001, sensitivity 96%, specificity 93%). <em>Interpretation</em>: Phenotypic severity strongly correlates with the potential to increase sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts cultured at 30°C, allowing reliable distinction between patients with ‘rapidly progressing' or ‘slowly progressing' phenotypes. This method may provide an essential tool for assessment of treatment effects and for healthcare and life planning decisions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Freezing of gait is a poorly understood symptom of Parkinson disease, and can severely disrupt the locomotion of affected patients. However, bicycling ability remains surprisingly unaffected in most patients suffering from freezing, suggesting functional differences in the motor network. The purpose of this study was to characterize and contrast the oscillatory dynamics underlying bicycling and walking in the basal ganglia.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We present the first local field potential recordings directly comparing bicycling and walking in Parkinson disease patients with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Low (13–22Hz) and high (23–35Hz) beta power changes were analyzed in 22 subthalamic nuclei from 13 Parkinson disease patients (57.5 ± 5.9 years old, 4 female). The study group consisted of 5 patients with and 8 patients without freezing of gait.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>In patients without freezing of gait, both bicycling and walking led to a suppression of subthalamic beta power (13–35Hz), and this suppression was stronger for bicycling. Freezers showed a similar pattern in general. Superimposed on this pattern, however, we observed a movement-induced, narrowband power increase around 18Hz, which was evident even in the absence of freezing.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>These results indicate that bicycling facilitates overall suppression of beta power. Furthermore, movement leads to exaggerated synchronization in the low beta band specifically within the basal ganglia of patients susceptible to freezing. Abnormal ∼18Hz oscillations are implicated in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait, and suppressing them may form a key strategy in developing potential therapies. Ann Neurol 2017</p></div></div>

<p>by Peter Ashcroft, Markus G. Manz, Sebastian Bonhoeffer</p>

Hematopoietic stem cells in mammals are known to reside mostly in the bone marrow, but also transitively passage in small numbers in the blood. Experimental findings have suggested that they exist in a dynamic equilibrium, continuously migrating between these two compartments. Here we construct an individual-based mathematical model of this process, which is parametrised using existing empirical findings from mice. This approach allows us to quantify the amount of migration between the bone marrow niches and the peripheral blood. We use this model to investigate clonal hematopoiesis, which is a significant risk factor for hematologic cancers. We also analyse the engraftment of donor stem cells into non-conditioned and conditioned hosts, quantifying the impact of different treatment scenarios. The simplicity of the model permits a thorough mathematical analysis, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of both the model and of the real-world system. We predict the time taken for mutant clones to expand within a host, as well as chimerism levels that can be expected following transplantation therapy, and the probability that a preconditioned host is reconstituted by donor cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXyJusEBHNY" width="1" />

A dramatic maturational process ongoing in adolescence is prefrontal cortex development, including its dopamine innervation. Dopamine axons grow from the striatum to the prefrontal cortex, the only known case of long-distance axon growth during adolescence. This is coordinated by the Netrin-1 guidance cue receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), which in turn controls the intrinsic development of the prefrontal cortex itself. Stimulant drugs in adolescence alter DCC in dopamine neurons and, in turn prefrontal cortex maturation, impacting cognitive abilities.

The hippocampus community, and the wider groups of neuroscientists studying learning and memory, were shocked to learn of the sudden and unexpected death of Dr Howard Eichenbaum on 21 July 2017. An immensely respected and well-liked figure, Howard made major contributions to our understanding of the neurobiology of memory at a systems level. In addition to his scientific contributions, he was also a diligent member and steward of the neuroscience community as Editor of the journal Hippocampus and in many other ways.

Inhibitory interneurons comprise a diverse subpopulation of cells that are critical to circuit function. How distinct inhibitory microcircuits control long-range projections remains poorly understood. A recent study by Lu and colleagues uncovered a unidirectional microcircuit of prefrontal chandelier cells that preferentially innervate and suppress long-range amygdala-projecting pyramidal cells.

Self representation is fundamental to mental functions. While the self has mostly been studied in traditional psychophilosophical terms (‘self as subject’), recent laboratory work suggests that the self can be measured quantitatively by assessing biases towards self-associated stimuli (‘self as object’). Here, we summarize new quantitative paradigms for assessing the self, drawn from psychology, neuroeconomics, embodied cognition, and social neuroscience. We then propose a neural model of the self as an emerging property of interactions between a core ‘self network’ (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC), a cognitive control network [e.g., dorsolateral (dl)PFC], and a salience network (e.g., insula).

While clues have existed that endosomal trafficking is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), whether it plays a central role in the disease and if so how has remained unknown. Here we rely on recent genetic and cellular findings to construct a model proposing that traffic jams in the early endosome can act as an upstream pathogenic hub in AD. We also rely on an independent series of findings to suggest how the traffic jams can act as a unified mediator of downstream pathophysiology. The model predicts, therefore, that interventions designed to unjam the endosome carry high therapeutic promise.

Over the past few years our understanding of estrogen signaling in the brain has expanded rapidly. Estrogens are synthesized in the periphery and in the brain, acting on multiple receptors to regulate gene transcription, neural function, and behavior. Various estrogen-sensitive signaling pathways often operate in concert within the same cell, increasing the complexity of the system. In females, estrogen concentrations fluctuate over the estrous/menstrual cycle, dynamically modulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression, activity, and trafficking.
