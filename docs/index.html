                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD), as a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, particularly affects the elderly population, and is clinically identified by resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Pathophysiologically, PD is characterized by an early loss of dopaminergic neurons in the <i>Substantia nigra pars compacta</i>, accompanied by the extensive aggregation of alpha-synuclein (<i>α-Syn</i>) in the form of Lewy bodies. The onset of PD has been reported to be influenced by multiple biological molecules. In this context, circular RNAs (circRNAs), as tissue-specific noncoding RNAs with closed structures, have been recently demonstrated to involve in a set of PD's pathogenic processes. These RNA molecules can either up- or downregulate the expression of <i>α-Syn</i>, as well as moderating its accumulation through different regulatory mechanisms, in which targeting microRNAs (miRNAs) is considered the most common pathway. Since circRNAs have prominent structural and biological characteristics, they could also be considered as promising candidates for PD diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, PD has become a global health concern, and a large number of its pathogenic processes are still unclear; thus, it is crucial to elucidate the ambiguous aspects of PD pathophysiology to improve the efficiency of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. In line with this fact, the current review aims to highlight the interplay between circRNAs and PD pathogenesis, and then discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of circRNAs in PD progression. This study will thus be the first of its kind reviewing the relationship between circRNAs and PD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational Identification of Ligand-Receptor Pairs that Drive Human Astrocyte Development</a></h4>

              
                Extrinsic signaling between diverse cell types is crucial to nervous system development. Ligand binding is a key driver of developmental processes, but it remains a significant challenge to disentangle how collections of these signals act cooperatively to affect changes in recipient cells. In the developing human brain, cortical progenitors transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis in a stereotyped progression that is influenced by extrinsic ligands. Therefore, we sought to use the wealth of published genomic data in the developing human brain to identify and then test novel ligand combinations that act synergistically to drive gliogenesis. Using computational tools, we identified ligand-receptor pairs that are expressed at appropriate developmental stages, in relevant cell types, and whose activation is predicted to cooperatively stimulate complimentary astrocyte gene signatures. We then tested a group of five neuronally-secreted ligands and validated their synergistic contributions to astrocyte development within both human cortical organoids and primary fetal tissue. We confirm cooperative capabilities of these ligands far greater than their individual capacities and discovered that their combinatorial effects converge on AKT/mTOR signaling to drive transcriptomic and morphological features of astrocyte development. This platform provides a powerful agnostic framework to identify and test how extrinsic signals work in concert to drive developmental processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular specification of cortico-brainstem versus corticospinal projection neurons in development</a></h4>

              
                Skilled motor control requires precise connections between subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) in the cerebral cortex and their appropriate subcerebral targets in the brainstem or spinal cord. The brainstem is an important motor control center and cortical projections to the brainstem serve distinct motor control functions than corticospinal projections. However, mechanisms controlling cortico-brainstem versus corticospinal projections during development remain unknown. Here, we show that the transition between the brainstem and cervical cord distinguishes cortico-brainstem from corticospinal neurons from the earliest stages of SCPN axon extension in white matter. We used high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing of FACS-purified SCPN, retrogradely labeled from either the cerebral peduncle (labeling both cortico-brainstem and corticospinal neurons) or the cervical cord (labeling corticospinal neurons only) at critical times of axon extension. We identify that cortico-brainstem and corticospinal neurons are molecularly distinct: We establish Neuropeptide Y (Npy) as specifically enriched in cortico-brainstem neurons in lateral cortex, while CART prepropeptide (Cartpt) delineates cervical-projecting corticospinal neurons. Our results highlight molecular specification of cortico-brainstem vs. corticospinal projections well before these axons reach their appropriate segmental target and suggest a broad molecular program over SCPN axon targeting to distinct subcerebral targets early in development. These findings are likely to inform future investigations of motor circuit development, as well as approaches aimed at enhancing motor recovery after central nervous system damage.

	<p>The analysis of resting-state fMRI signals usually focuses on the low-frequency range/band (0.01&amp;amp;ndash;0.1 Hz), which does not cover all aspects of brain activity. Studies have shown that distinct frequency bands can capture unique fluctuations in brain activity, with high-frequency signals (&amp;amp;gt;0.1 Hz) providing valuable information for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. We hypothesized that it is meaningful to study the dynamic reconfiguration of schizophrenia through different frequencies. Therefore, this study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance (RS-fMRI) data from 42 schizophrenia and 40 normal controls to investigate dynamic network reconfiguration in multiple frequency bands (0.01&amp;amp;ndash;0.25 Hz, 0.01&amp;amp;ndash;0.027 Hz, 0.027&amp;amp;ndash;0.073 Hz, 0.073&amp;amp;ndash;0.198 Hz, 0.198&amp;amp;ndash;0.25 Hz). Based on the time-varying dynamic network constructed for each frequency band, we compared the dynamic reconfiguration of schizophrenia and normal controls by calculating the recruitment and integration. The experimental results showed that the differences between schizophrenia and normal controls are observed in the full frequency, which is more significant in slow3. In addition, as visual network, attention network, and default mode network differ a lot from each other, they can show a high degree of connectivity, which indicates that the functional network of schizophrenia is affected by the abnormal brain state in these areas. These shreds of evidence provide a new perspective and promote the current understanding of the characteristics of dynamic brain networks in schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Auditory Cortex Neurons Show Task-Related and Learning-Dependent Selectivity toward Sensory Input and Reward during the Learning Process of an Associative Memory Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The activity of primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons is modulated not only by sensory inputs but also by other task-related variables in associative learning. However, it is unclear how A1 neural activity changes dynamically in response to these variables during the learning process of associative memory tasks. Therefore, we developed an associative memory task using auditory stimuli in rats. In this task, rats were required to associate tone frequencies (high and low) with a choice of ports (right or left) to obtain a reward. The activity of A1 neurons in the rats during the learning process of the task was recorded. A1 neurons increased their firing rates either when the rats were presented with a high or low tone (frequency-selective cells) before they chose either the left or right port (choice-direction cells), or when they received a reward after choosing either the left or right port (reward-direction cells). Furthermore, the proportion of frequency-selective cells and reward-direction cells increased with task acquisition and reached the maximum level in the last stage of learning. These results suggest that A1 neurons have task- and learning-dependent selectivity toward sensory input and reward when auditory tones and behavioral responses are gradually associated during task training. This selective activity of A1 neurons may facilitate the formation of associations, leading to the consolidation of associative memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Hypothalamic TRH Mediates Anorectic Effects of Serotonin in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>Among the modulatory functions of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), an anorectic behavior in rodents is observed when centrally injected. Hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons receive serotonergic inputs from dorsal raphe nucleus and express serotonin (5HT) receptors such as 5HT<SUB>1A</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>2A/2C</SUB>, 5HT<SUB>6</SUB>, which are involved in 5HT-induced feeding regulation. Rats subjected to dehydration-induced anorexia (DIA) model show increased PVN TRH mRNA expression, associated with their decreased food intake. We analyzed whether 5HT input is implicated in the enhanced PVN TRH transcription that anorectic rats exhibit, given that 5HT increases TRH expression and release when studied <I>in vitro</I>. By using mHypoA-2/30 hypothalamic cell cultures, we found that 5HT stimulated TRH mRNA, pCREB, and pERK1/2 levels. By inhibiting basal PKA or PKC activities or those induced by 5HT, pCREB or pERK1/2 content did not increase suggesting involvement of both kinases in their phosphorylation. 5HT effect on TRH mRNA was not affected by PKA inhibition, but it diminished in the presence of PKCi suggesting involvement of PKC in 5HT-induced TRH increased transcription. This likely involves 5HT<SUB>2A/2C</SUB> and the activation of alternative transduction pathways than those studied here. In agreement with the <I>in vitro</I> data, we found that injecting 5HT<SUB>2A/2C</SUB> antagonists into the PVN of DIA rats reversed the increased TRH expression of anorectic animals, as well as their decreased food intake; also, the agonist reduced food intake of hungry restricted animals along with elevated PVN TRH mRNA levels. Our results support that the anorectic effects of serotonin are mediated by PVN TRH in this model.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Histochemical Characterization of the Dorsal Raphe-Periaqueductal Grey Dopamine Transporter Neurons Projecting to the Extended Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus contains many tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons which are regarded as dopaminergic (DA) neurons. These DA neurons in the DR and periaqueductal gray (PAG) region (DA<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons) are a subgroup of the A10 cluster, which is known to be heterogeneous. This DA population projects to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and has been reported to modulate various affective behaviors. To characterize, the histochemical features of DA<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons projecting to the CeA and BNST in mice, the current study combined retrograde labeling with Fluoro-Gold (FG) and histological techniques, focusing on TH, dopamine transporter (DAT), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2). To identify putative DA neurons, DAT-Cre::Ai14 mice were used. It was observed that DAT<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons consisted of the following two subpopulations: TH+/VIP&ndash; and TH&ndash;/VIP+ neurons. The DAT+/TH&ndash;/VIP+ subpopulation would be non-DA noncanonical DAT neurons. Anterograde labeling of DAT<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons with AAV in DAT-Cre mice revealed that the fibers exclusively innervated the lateral part of the CeA and the oval nucleus of the BNST. Retrograde labeling with FG injections into the CeA or BNST revealed that the two subpopulations similarly innervated these regions. Furthermore, using VGlut2-Cre::Ai14 mice, it was turned out that the TH&ndash;/VIP+ subpopulations innervating both CeA and BNST were VGlut2-positive neurons. These two subpopulations of DAT<sup>DR-PAG</sup> neurons, TH+/VIP&ndash; and TH&ndash;/VIP+, might differentially interfere with the extended amygdala, thereby modulating affective behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elastic network modeling of cellular networks unveils sensor and effector genes that control information flow</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Omer Acar, She Zhang, Ivet Bahar, Anne-Ruxandra Carvunis</p>

The high-level organization of the cell is embedded in indirect relationships that connect distinct cellular processes. Existing computational approaches for detecting indirect relationships between genes typically consist of propagating abstract information through network representations of the cell. However, the selection of genes to serve as the source of propagation is inherently biased by prior knowledge. Here, we sought to derive an unbiased view of the high-level organization of the cell by identifying the genes that propagate and receive information most effectively in the cell, and the indirect relationships between these genes. To this aim, we adapted a perturbation-response scanning strategy initially developed for identifying allosteric interactions within proteins. We deployed this strategy onto an elastic network model of the yeast genetic interaction profile similarity network. This network revealed a superior propensity for information propagation relative to simulated networks with similar topology. Perturbation-response scanning identified the major distributors and receivers of information in the network, named effector and sensor genes, respectively. Effectors formed dense clusters centrally integrated into the network, whereas sensors formed loosely connected antenna-shaped clusters and contained genes with previously characterized involvement in signal transduction. We propose that indirect relationships between effector and sensor clusters represent major paths of information flow between distinct cellular processes. Genetic similarity networks for fission yeast and human displayed similarly strong propensities for information propagation and clusters of effector and sensor genes, suggesting that the global architecture enabling indirect relationships is evolutionarily conserved across species. Our results demonstrate that elastic network modeling of cellular networks constitutes a promising strategy to probe the high-level organization and cooperativity in the cell.

With the frenetic growth of high-dimensional datasets in different biomedical domains, there is an urgent need to develop predictive methods able to deal with this complexity. Feature selection is a relevant strategy in machine learning to address this challenge. We introduce a novel feature selection algorithm for linear regression called BOSO (Bilevel Optimization Selector Operator). We conducted a benchmark of BOSO with key algorithms in the literature, finding a superior accuracy for feature selection in high-dimensional datasets. Proof-of-concept of BOSO for predicting drug sensitivity in cancer is presented. A detailed analysis is carried out for methotrexate, a well-studied drug targeting cancer metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mutational analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern reveals key tradeoffs between receptor affinity and antibody escape</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Emily K. Makowski, John S. Schardt, Matthew D. Smith, Peter M. Tessier</p>

SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility represent a serious threat to global health. Here we report machine learning models that can predict the impact of receptor-binding domain (RBD) mutations on receptor (ACE2) affinity, which is linked to infectivity, and escape from human serum antibodies, which is linked to viral neutralization. Importantly, the models predict many of the known impacts of RBD mutations in current and former Variants of Concern on receptor affinity and antibody escape as well as novel sets of mutations that strongly modulate both properties. Moreover, these models reveal key opposing impacts of RBD mutations on transmissibility, as many sets of RBD mutations predicted to increase antibody escape are also predicted to reduce receptor affinity and vice versa. These models, when used in concert, capture the complex impacts of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on properties linked to transmissibility and are expected to improve the development of next-generation vaccines and biotherapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Genome-wide cross-cancer analysis illustrates the critical role of bimodal miRNA in patient survival and drug responses to PI3K inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura Moody, Guanying Bianca Xu, Yuan-Xiang Pan, Hong Chen</p>

Heterogeneity of cancer means many tumorigenic genes are only aberrantly expressed in a subset of patients and thus follow a bimodal distribution, having two modes of expression within a single population. Traditional statistical techniques that compare sample means between cancer patients and healthy controls fail to detect bimodally expressed genes. We utilize a mixture modeling approach to identify bimodal microRNA (miRNA) across cancers, find consistent sources of heterogeneity, and identify potential oncogenic miRNA that may be used to guide personalized therapies. Pathway analysis was conducted using target genes of the bimodal miRNA to identify potential functional implications in cancer. <i>In vivo</i> overexpression experiments were conducted to elucidate the clinical importance of bimodal miRNA in chemotherapy treatments. In nine types of cancer, tumors consistently displayed greater bimodality than normal tissue. Specifically, in liver and lung cancers, high expression of miR-105 and miR-767 was indicative of poor prognosis. Functional pathway analysis identified target genes of miR-105 and miR-767 enriched in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and analysis of over 200 cancer drugs <i>in vitro</i> showed that drugs targeting the same pathway had greater efficacy in cell lines with high miR-105 and miR-767 levels. Overexpression of the two miRNA facilitated response to PI3K inhibitor treatment. We demonstrate that while cancer is marked by considerable genetic heterogeneity, there is between-cancer concordance regarding the particular miRNA that are more variable. Bimodal miRNA are ideal biomarkers that can be used to stratify patients for prognosis and drug response in certain types of cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A spectrum of free software tools for processing the VCF variant call format: vcflib, bio-vcf, cyvcf2, hts-nim and slivar</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik Garrison, Zev N. Kronenberg, Eric T. Dawson, Brent S. Pedersen, Pjotr Prins</p>

Since its introduction in 2011 the variant call format (VCF) has been widely adopted for processing DNA and RNA variants in practically all population studies—as well as in somatic and germline mutation studies. The VCF format can represent single nucleotide variants, multi-nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions, and simple structural variants called and anchored against a reference genome.
Here we present a spectrum of over 125 useful, complimentary free and open source software tools and libraries, we wrote and made available through the multiple vcflib, bio-vcf, cyvcf2, hts-nim and slivar projects. These tools are applied for comparison, filtering, normalisation, smoothing and annotation of VCF, as well as output of statistics, visualisation, and transformations of files variants. These tools run everyday in critical biomedical pipelines and countless shell scripts. Our tools are part of the wider bioinformatics ecosystem and we highlight best practices.
We shortly discuss the design of VCF, lessons learnt, and how we can address more complex variation through pangenome graph formats, variation that can not easily be represented by the VCF format.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Recommendations for improving statistical inference in population genomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Parul Johri, Charles F. Aquadro, Mark Beaumont, Brian Charlesworth, Laurent Excoffier, Adam Eyre-Walker, Peter D. Keightley, Michael Lynch, Gil McVean, Bret A. Payseur, Susanne P. Pfeifer, Wolfgang Stephan, Jeffrey D. Jensen</p>

The field of population genomics has grown rapidly in response to the recent advent of affordable, large-scale sequencing technologies. As opposed to the situation during the majority of the 20th century, in which the development of theoretical and statistical population genetic insights outpaced the generation of data to which they could be applied, genomic data are now being produced at a far greater rate than they can be meaningfully analyzed and interpreted. With this wealth of data has come a tendency to focus on fitting specific (and often rather idiosyncratic) models to data, at the expense of a careful exploration of the range of possible underlying evolutionary processes. For example, the approach of directly investigating models of adaptive evolution in each newly sequenced population or species often neglects the fact that a thorough characterization of ubiquitous nonadaptive processes is a prerequisite for accurate inference. We here describe the perils of these tendencies, present our consensus views on current best practices in population genomic data analysis, and highlight areas of statistical inference and theory that are in need of further attention. Thereby, we argue for the importance of defining a biologically relevant baseline model tuned to the details of each new analysis, of skepticism and scrutiny in interpreting model fitting results, and of carefully defining addressable hypotheses and underlying uncertainties.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Learning-related congruent and incongruent changes of excitation and inhibition in distinct cortical areas</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vahid Esmaeili, Anastasiia Oryshchuk, Reza Asri, Keita Tamura, Georgios Foustoukos, Yanqi Liu, Romain Guiet, Sylvain Crochet, Carl C. H. Petersen</p>

Excitatory and inhibitory neurons in diverse cortical regions are likely to contribute differentially to the transformation of sensory information into goal-directed motor plans. Here, we investigate the relative changes across mouse sensorimotor cortex in the activity of putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons—categorized as regular or fast spiking (FS) according to their action potential (AP) waveform—comparing before and after learning of a whisker detection task with delayed licking as perceptual report. Surprisingly, we found that the whisker-evoked activity of regular versus FS neurons changed in opposite directions after learning in primary and secondary whisker motor cortices, while it changed similarly in primary and secondary orofacial motor cortices. Our results suggest that changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition in local circuits concurrent with changes in the long-range synaptic inputs in distinct cortical regions might contribute to performance of delayed sensory-to-motor transformation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A novel class of antimicrobial drugs selectively targets a Mycobacterium tuberculosis PE-PGRS protein</a></h4>

The continued spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis is one of the most pressing and complex challenges facing tuberculosis management worldwide. Therefore, developing a new class of drugs is necessary and urgently needed to cope with the increasing threat of drug-resistant tuberculosis. This study aims to discover a potential new class of tuberculosis drug candidates different from existing tuberculosis drugs. By screening a library of compounds, methyl (S)-1-((3-alkoxy-6,7-dimethoxyphenanthren-9-yl)methyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (PP) derivatives with antitubercular activity were discovered. MIC ranges for PP1S, PP2S, and PP3S against clinically isolated drug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> strains were 0.78 to 3.13, 0.19 to 1.56, and 0.78 to 6.25 μg/ml, respectively. PPs demonstrated antitubercular activities in macrophage and tuberculosis mouse models, showing no detectable toxicity in all assays tested. PPs specifically inhibited <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> without significantly changing the intestinal microbiome in mice. Mutants selected in vitro suggest that the drug targets the PE-PGRS57, which has been found only in the genomes of the <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i> complex, highlighting the specificity and safety potency of this compound. As PPs show an excellent safety profile and highly selective toxicity specific to <i>M</i>. <i>tuberculosis</i>, PPs are considered a promising new candidate for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis while maintaining microbiome homeostasis.

Ensuring high vaccination and even booster vaccination coverage is critical in preventing severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among the various COVID-19 vaccines currently in use, the mRNA vaccines have shown remarkable effectiveness. However, systemic adverse events (AEs), such as postvaccination fatigue, are prevalent following mRNA vaccination, and the underpinnings of which are not understood. Herein, we found that higher baseline expression of genes related to T and NK cell exhaustion and suppression were positively correlated with the development of moderately severe fatigue after Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination; increased expression of genes associated with T and NK cell exhaustion and suppression reacted to vaccination were associated with greater levels of innate immune activation at 1 day postvaccination. We further found, in a mouse model, that altering the route of vaccination from intramuscular (i.m.) to subcutaneous (s.c.) could lessen the pro-inflammatory response and correspondingly the extent of systemic AEs; the humoral immune response to BNT162b2 vaccination was not compromised. Instead, it is possible that the s.c. route could improve cytotoxic CD8 T-cell responses to BNT162b2 vaccination. Our findings thus provide a glimpse of the molecular basis of postvaccination fatigue from mRNA vaccination and suggest a readily translatable solution to minimize systemic AEs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">P2P Lending platforms in Malaysia: the awareness among Malaysian adults [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background - Since 2016, the Securities Commission (SC) in Malaysia has given licenses to only eleven P2P lending platforms. Such lending platforms are expected to disrupt the lending services of traditional lenders in the coming years. However, being still in their infant stages, it is essential to know the extent to which such platforms are made known to potential investors out there. This study aims to examine the awareness level of the eleven P2P lending platforms among Malaysian adults. The study also explores if past investment experience and financial knowledge would influence such awareness from Malaysian adults.  Methods - A sample of 335 Malaysian individuals was used for this study. An online questionnaire was designed with three main parts: demographic, financial literacy, and P2P lending awareness. Using IBM SPSS Statistics 26, frequency, descriptive, normality, Pearson coefficients and multiple regression analyses were carried out.  Results - Although seven out of ten respondents have good knowledge in three areas of finance: compounding rate, inflation and diversification, only 14.33% had a good and excellent awareness level of P2P lending. Thus, one would expect lesser awareness about P2P lending among Malaysian adults whose financial literacy is poor or zero. Test results from multiple regression analysis suggest that past lending experiences positively affect the awareness of P2P lending in Malaysia, but not the financial literacy. Conclusions - the awareness about P2P lending among Malaysian adults is too low, despite their high level of education and financial literacy. No investing experience and not knowing any existing P2P lending in the country may be the reason for this low awareness. Therefore, for P2P lending to thrive in Malaysia, the eleven P2P lending platforms need to be promoted aggressively in various social media outlets.

                Exercise is an effective strategy in the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases. Alterations in the skeletal muscle proteome, including post-translational modifications, regulate its metabolic adaptations to exercise. Here, we examined the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the proteome and acetylome of human skeletal muscle, revealing the response of 3168 proteins and 1263 lysine acetyl-sites on 464 acetylated proteins. We identified global protein adaptations to exercise training involved in metabolism, excitation-contraction coupling, and myofibrillar calcium sensitivity. Furthermore, HIIT increased the acetylation of mitochondrial proteins, particularly those of complex V. We also highlight the regulation of exercise-responsive histone acetyl-sites. These data demonstrate the plasticity of the skeletal muscle proteome and acetylome, providing insight into the regulation of contractile, metabolic and transcriptional processes within skeletal muscle. Herein, we provide a substantial hypothesis-generating resource to stimulate further mechanistic research investigating how exercise improves metabolic health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Timely coupling of sleep spindles and slow waves is linked to early amyloid-β burden and predicts memory decline</a></h4>

              
                Sleep alteration is a hallmark of ageing and emerges as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the fine-tuned coalescence of sleep microstructure elements may influence age-related cognitive trajectories, its association with AD processes is not fully established. Here, we investigated whether the coupling of spindles and slow waves is associated with early amyloid-beta (Aβ) brain burden, a hallmark of AD neuropathology, and cognitive change over 2 years in 100 healthy individuals in late-midlife (50-70y; 68 women). We found that, in contrast to other sleep metrics, earlier occurrence of spindles on slow-depolarisation slow waves is associated with higher medial prefrontal cortex Aβ burden (p=0.014, r²<sub>β*</sub>=0.06), and is predictive of greater longitudinal memory decline in a large subsample (p=0.032, r²<sub>β*</sub>=0.07, N=66). These findings unravel early links between sleep, AD-related processes and cognition and suggest that altered coupling of sleep microstructure elements, key to its mnesic function, contributes to poorer brain and cognitive trajectories in ageing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Target binding triggers hierarchical phosphorylation of human Argonaute-2 to promote target release</a></h4>

              
                Argonaute (Ago) proteins play a central role in post-transcriptional gene regulation through RNA interference (RNAi). Agos bind small RNAs (sRNAs) including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) to form the functional core of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The sRNA is used as a guide to target mRNAs containing either partially or fully complementary sequences, ultimately leading to downregulation of the corresponding proteins. It was previously shown that the kinase CK1α phosphorylates a cluster of residues in the eukaryotic insertion (EI) of Ago, leading to the alleviation of miRNA-mediated repression through an undetermined mechanism. We show that binding of miRNA-loaded human Ago2 to target RNA with complementarity to the seed and 3’ supplementary regions of the miRNA primes the EI for hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1α. The added negative charges electrostatically promote target release, freeing Ago to seek out additional targets once it is dephosphorylated. The high conservation of potential phosphosites in the EI suggests that such a regulatory strategy may be a shared mechanism for regulating miRNA-mediated repression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proposing a neural framework for the evolution of elaborate courtship displays</a></h4>

              
                In many vertebrates, courtship occurs through the performance of elaborate behavioral displays that are as spectacular as they are complex. The question of how sexual selection acts upon these animals’ neuromuscular systems to transform a repertoire of pre-existing movements into such remarkable (if not unusual) display routines has received relatively little research attention. This is a surprising gap in knowledge, given that unraveling this extraordinary process is central to understanding the evolution of behavioral diversity and its neural control. In many vertebrates, courtship displays often push the limits of neuromuscular performance, and often in a ritualized manner. These displays can range from songs that require rapid switching between two independently controlled ‘voice boxes’ to precisely choreographed acrobatics. Here, we propose a framework for thinking about how the brain might not only control these displays, but also shape their evolution. Our framework focuses specifically on a major midbrain area, which we view as a likely important node in the orchestration of the complex neural control of behavior used in the courtship process. This area is the periaqueductal grey (PAG), as studies suggest that it is both necessary and sufficient for the production of many instinctive survival behaviors, including courtship vocalizations. Thus, we speculate about why the PAG, as well as its key inputs, might serve as targets of sexual selection for display behavior. In doing so, we attempt to combine core ideas about the neural control of behavior with principles of display evolution. Our intent is to spur research in this area and bring together neurobiologists and behavioral ecologists to more fully understand the role that the brain might play in behavioral innovation and diversification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Amoeboid-like migration ensures correct horizontal cell layer formation in the developing vertebrate retina</a></h4>

              
                Migration of cells in the developing brain is integral for the establishment of neural circuits and function of the central nervous system. While migration modes during which neurons employ predetermined directional guidance of either preexisting neuronal processes or underlying cells have been well explored, less is known about how cells featuring multipolar morphology migrate in the dense environment of the developing brain. To address this, we here investigated multipolar migration of horizontal cells in the zebrafish retina. We found that these cells feature several hallmarks of amoeboid-like migration that enable them to tailor their movements to the spatial constraints of the crowded retina. These hallmarks include cell and nuclear shape changes, as well as persistent rearward polarization of stable F-actin. Interference with the organization of the developing retina by changing nuclear properties or overall tissue architecture, hampers efficient horizontal cell migration and layer formation showing that cell-tissue interplay is crucial for this process. In view of the high proportion of multipolar migration phenomena observed in brain development, the here uncovered ameboid-like migration mode might be conserved in other areas of the developing nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Humanization of wildlife gut microbiota in urban environments</a></h4>

              
                Urbanization is rapidly altering Earth’s environments, demanding investigation of the impacts on resident wildlife. Here, we show that urban populations of coyotes (<i>Canis latrans</i>), crested anole lizards (<i>Anolis cristatellus</i>), and white-crowned sparrows (<i>Zonotrichia leucophrys</i>) acquire gut microbiota constituents found in humans, including gut bacterial lineages associated with urbanization in humans. Comparisons of urban and rural wildlife and human populations revealed significant convergence of gut microbiota among urban populations relative to rural populations. All bacterial lineages overrepresented in urban wildlife relative to rural wildlife and differentially abundant between urban and rural humans were also overrepresented in urban humans relative to rural humans. Remarkably, the bacterial lineage most overrepresented in urban anoles was a <i>Bacteroides</i> sequence variant that was also the most significantly overrepresented in urban human populations. These results indicate parallel effects of urbanization on human and wildlife gut microbiota and suggest spillover of bacteria from humans into wildlife in cities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Syntaxin-1A modulates vesicle fusion in mammalian neurons via juxtamembrane domain dependent palmitoylation of its transmembrane domain</a></h4>

              
                SNAREs are undoubtedly one of the core elements of synaptic transmission. Contrary to the well characterized function of their SNARE domains bringing the plasma and vesicular membranes together, the level of contribution of their juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and the transmembrane domain (TMD) to the vesicle fusion is still under debate. To elucidate this issue, we analyzed three groups of STX1A mutations in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons: 1) elongation of STX1A's JMD by three amino acid insertions in the junction of SNARE-JMD or JMD-TMD; 2) charge reversal mutations in STX1A's JMD; and 3) palmitoylation deficiency mutations in STX1A's TMD. We found that both JMD elongations and charge reversal mutations have position dependent differential effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release. Importantly, we show that STX1A's JMD regulates the palmitoylation of STX1A's TMD and loss of STX1A palmitoylation either through charge reversal mutation K260E or by loss of TMD cysteines inhibits spontaneous vesicle fusion. Interestingly, the retinal ribbon specific STX3B has a glutamate in the position corresponding to the K260E mutation in STX1A and mutating it with E259K acts as a molecular on-switch. Furthermore, palmitoylation of post-synaptic STX3A can be induced by the exchange of its JMD with STX1A's JMD together with the incorporation of two cysteines into its TMD. Forced palmitoylation of STX3A dramatically enhances spontaneous vesicle fusion suggesting that STX1A regulates spontaneous release through two distinct mechanisms: one through the C-terminal half of its SNARE domain and the other through the palmitoylation of its TMD.

                A longstanding goal in protein science and clinical genetics is to develop quantitative models of sequence, structure, and function relationships and delineate the mechanisms by which mutations cause disease. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) is a promising strategy to map how amino acids contribute to protein structure and function and to advance clinical variant interpretation. Here, we introduce 7,429 single residue missense mutations into the Inward Rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir2.1 and determine how this affects folding, assembly, and trafficking, as well as regulation by allosteric ligands and ion conduction. Our data provide high-resolution information on a cotranslationally-folded biogenic unit, trafficking and quality control signals, and segregated roles of different structural elements in fold-stability and function. We show that Kir2.1 surface trafficking mutants are underrepresented in variant effect databases, which has implications for clinical practice. By comparing fitness scores with expert-reviewed variant effects, we can predict the pathogenicity of 'variants of unknown significance' and disease mechanisms of known pathogenic mutations. Our study in Kir2.1 provides a blueprint for how multiparametric DMS can help us understand the mechanistic basis of genetic disorders and the structure-function relationships of proteins.

                The lives of microbes unfold at the micron scale, and their molecular machineries operate at the nanoscale. Their study at these resolutions is key towards achieving a better understanding of their ecology. We focus on cellulose degradation of the canonical <i>Clostridium thermocellum</i> system to comprehend how microbes build and use their cellulosomal machinery at these nanometer scales. Degradation of cellulose, the most abundant organic polymer on Earth, is instrumental to the global carbon cycle. We reveal that bacterial cells form 'cellulosome capsules' driven by catalytic product-dependent dynamics, which can increase the rate of hydrolysis. Biosynthesis of this energetically costly machinery and cell growth are decoupled at the single-cell level, hinting at a division-of-labor strategy through phenotypic heterogeneity. This novel observation highlights intra-population interactions as key to understanding rates of fiber degradation.

                Dysfunction in sodium channels and their ankyrin scaffolding partners have both been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In particular, the genes SCN2A, which encodes the sodium channel NaV1.2, and ANK2, which encodes ankyrin-B, have strong ASD association. Recent studies indicate that ASD-associated haploinsufficiency in Scn2a impairs dendritic excitability and synaptic function in neocortical pyramidal cells, but how NaV1.2 is anchored within dendritic regions is unknown. Here, we show that ankyrin-B is essential for scaffolding NaV1.2 to the dendritic membrane of mouse neocortical neurons, and that haploinsufficiency of Ank2 phenocopies intrinsic dendritic excitability and synaptic deficits observed in Scn2a+/- conditions. Thus, these results establish a direct, convergent link between two major ASD risk genes and reinforce an emerging framework suggesting that neocortical pyramidal cell dendritic dysfunction can be etiological to neurodevelopmental disorder pathophysiology.

                The cell bodies of hypothalamic magnocellular neurones are densely packed in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) whereas their axons project to the anatomically discrete posterior pituitary gland. We have taken advantage of this unique anatomical structure to establish proteome and phosphoproteome dynamics in neuronal cell bodies and axonal terminals in response to physiological stimulation. We have found that proteome and phosphoproteome responses are very different between somatic and axonal neuronal compartments, indicating the need of each cell domain to differentially adapt. In particular, changes in the phosphoproteome in the cell body are involved in the reorganisation of the cytoskeleton and in axonal terminals the regulation of synaptic and secretory processes. We have identified that prohormone precursors including vasopressin and oxytocin are phosphorylated in axonal terminals and become hyperphosphorylated following stimulation. By multi-omic integration of transcriptome and proteomic data we identify changes to proteins present in afferent inputs to this nucleus.

                Language is central to human life; however, how our brains derive meaning from language is still not well understood. A commonly studied electrophysiological measure of on-line meaning related processing is the N400 component, the computational basis of which is still actively debated. Here, we test one of the recently proposed, computationally explicit hypotheses on the N400 - namely, that it reflects surprise with respect to a probabilistic representation of the semantic features of the current stimulus in a given context. We devise a Bayesian sequential learner model to derive trial-by-trial semantic surprise in a semantic oddball like roving paradigm experiment, where single nouns from different semantic categories are presented in sequences. Using experimental data from 40 subjects, we show that model-derived semantic surprise significantly predicts the N400 amplitude, substantially outperforming a non-probabilistic baseline model. Investigating the temporal signature of the effect, we find that the effect of semantic surprise on the EEG is restricted to the time window of the N400. Moreover, comparing the topography of the semantic surprise effect to a conventional ERP analysis of predicted vs. unpredicted words, we find that the semantic surprise closely replicates the N400 topography. Our results make a strong case for the role of probabilistic semantic representations in eliciting the N400, and in language comprehension in general.

                Individuals that initiate alcohol use at younger ages and binge drink during adolescence are more susceptible to developing alcohol use disorder. Adolescents are relatively insensitive to the aversive effects of alcohol and tend to consume significantly more alcohol per occasion than adults, an effect that is conserved in rodent models. Adolescent typical insensitivity to the aversive effects of alcohol may promote greater alcohol intake by attenuating internal cues that curb its consumption. Attenuated sensitivity to the aversive effects of alcohol is also retained into adulthood following protracted abstinence from adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. Despite these effects, much remains unknown regarding the neural contributors. In the present study, we used a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm to investigate neuronal activation in late-developing forebrain structures of male adolescents and adult cFos-LacZ transgenic rats as well as in AIE adults following consumption of 0.9% sodium chloride previously paired with an intraperitoneal injection of 0, 1.5 or 2.5g/kg of ethanol.. Unlike adults that were non-manipulated or received water exposure during adolescence, adolescents as well as adults who experienced AIE did not display CTA to a 1.5 g/kg ethanol dose. Adults displayed increased neuronal activation indexed via number of {beta}-galactosidase positive ({beta}-gal+) cells in the prefrontal and insular cortex that was absent in adolescents, whereas adolescents but not adults had reduced number of {beta}-gal+ cells in the central amygdala. Adults also displayed greater cortical-insular functional connectivity than adolescents as well as insular-amygdalar and prefrontal cortex-accumbens core functional connectivity. Like adolescents, adults previously exposed to AIE displayed reduced prefrontal-insular cortex and prefrontal-accumbal core functional connectivity. Taken together, these results suggest that attenuated sensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol is related to a loss of an insular-prefrontal cortex-accumbens core circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visuomotor learning promotes visually evoked activity in the medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is necessary for executing many learned associations between stimuli and movement. It is unclear, however, whether activity in the mPFC reflects sensory or motor aspects of sensorimotor associations and whether it evolves gradually during learning. To address these questions, we recorded cortical activity with widefield calcium imaging while mice learned a visuomotor task. The task involved associating a visual stimulus with a forelimb movement. After learning, the mPFC showed stimulus-evoked activity both during task performance and during passive viewing, when the stimulus evoked no action. This stimulus-evoked activity closely tracked behavioral performance across training, exhibiting jumps between training days. Electrophysiological recordings localized this activity to the secondary motor and anterior cingulate cortex. We conclude that learning a visuomotor task promotes a route for visual information to reach the prefrontal cortex, which develops responses to the relevant visual stimuli even outside the context of the task.

                Perception is often the expected outcome of our actions, while at other times it emerges from unexpected changes in the scene. During spatial navigation, animals must differentiate between cues generated by self-motion from motion that originated externally. To reveal the neural basis of this perceptual ability, we examined the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), which contains an egocentric map of sensorimotor space. By simulating whisker-guided navigation through a dynamic landscape, we discovered a transient neural response that selectively emerged for unexpected, externally generated tactile motion. This transient response only emerged when external motion engaged different whiskers, arguing that sensorimotor predictions are specific to a somatotopic location. When external motion engaged the same whiskers, neurons encoded surface motion with shifts in spike timing correlated to self-generated tactile features. Thus, a persistent representation of self-generated touch may be necessary to encode spatial features finer than the receptor array. In conclusion, the SC contains complementary rate and temporal codes to differentiate external from self-generated spatial features during tactile localization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diminished motor neuron activity driven by abnormal astrocytic GLAST glutamate transporter activity in spinal muscular atrophy is not fully restored after lentiviral SMN delivery</a></h4>

              
                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a pediatric neuromuscular disease characterized by the loss of the lower spinal motor neurons due to survival motor neuron (SMN) deficiency. Motor neuron dysfunction at the glutamatergic afferent synapse is observed during early stages of SMA disease progression, which could be targeted therapeutically prior to cell death. However, the motor neuron cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous disease mechanisms driving this phenotype remain unclear. Our study reveals a non-cell autonomous SMN-associated disease mechanism affecting glutamate transporter (GLAST) activity in astrocytes that contributes to human motor neuron dysfunction in SMA. Transcriptomic analysis of SMA patient human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes identified a significant downregulation of genes associated with astrocytic regulation of the synapse, including glutamate neurotransmission. This finding was substantiated by our microelectrode array analysis of motor neuron activity, which was severely diminished specifically in the presence of patient-derived astrocytes. Co-culturing patient-derived motor neurons with healthy-derived astrocytes showed comparable firing rates and bursting activity to healthy-derived motor neurons, suggesting diminished neural activity is an astrocyte-mediated phenotype in this system. Towards defining astrocyte-intrinsic defects that could induce motor neuron dysfunction, we identified abnormally low levels of excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT1/GLAST) in patient-derived astrocytes, which when selectively inhibited in healthy co-cultures could phenocopy the diminished neural activity previously observed in patient-derived co-cultures. Caveolin-1, an SMN-interacting lipid raft protein associated with glutamate transporter regulation, showed increased protein levels and accumulation in patient astrocytes. Both GLAST and caveolin-1 phenotypes could be partially rescued via lentiviral-mediated SMN re-expression in patient astrocytes. Together, our work defines a novel SMN-associated disease mechanism involving abnormal glutamate transporter activity and regulation in astrocytes that can directly diminish motor neuron function in SMA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous Variations in Arousal Modulate Subsequent Visual Processing and Local Field Potential Dynamics in the Ferret during Quiet Wakefulness</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral states affect neuronal responses throughout the cortex and influence visual processing. Quiet wakefulness (QW) is a behavioral state during which subjects are quiescent, but awake and connected to the environment. Here, we examined the effects of pre-stimulus arousal variability on post-stimulus neural activity in primary visual cortex (V1) and posterior parietal cortex (PPc) in awake ferrets, using the pupil diameter as an indicator of arousal. We observed that during low arousal, low- frequency power increases during visual stimulation, and that the peak alpha frequency shifted depending on the arousal state. High arousal increased gamma power as well as low-frequency inter- and intra-areal coherence. Using a simplified model of laminar circuits, we show that this connectivity pattern is compatible with feedback signals targeting infragranular layers in area PPc and supragranular layers in V1. Neurons in V1 displayed higher firing rates at their preferred orientations on high-arousal trials. Broad-spiking cells in V1 entrained to high-frequency oscillations (>80 Hz), whereas narrow-spiking neurons phase-locked to low (12-18 Hz) and high-frequency (>80 Hz) rhythms. These results indicate that the variability and sensitivity of post-stimulus cortical responses and coherence depend on the pre-stimulus behavioral state and account for the neuronal response variability observed during repeated stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Top-down information flow drives lexical access when listening to continuous speech</a></h4>

              
                Speech is noisy, ambiguous and complex. Here we study how the human brain uses high-order linguistic structure to guide comprehension. Twenty-one participants listened to spoken narratives while magneto-encephalography (MEG) was recorded. Stories were annotated for word class (specifically: noun, verb, adjective) under two hypothesised sources of information: (i) "bottom-up": the most common word class given by the word's phonology; (ii) "top-down": the true word class given the syntactic context. We trained a classifier on trials where the two hypotheses matched (about 90%), and tested the classifier on trials where they mismatched. The classifier predicted only the syntactic word class labels, in line with the top-down hypothesis. These effects peaked around 400ms after word offset over frontal MEG sensors. Our results support that when processing continuous speech, lexical representations are quickly built in a context-sensitive manner. We showcase the utility of multivariate analyses in teasing apart subtle representational distinctions from neural time series.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perception of self- and externally-generated visual stimuli: Evidence from EEG and behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Efference copy-based forward model mechanisms may help us to distinguish between self- and externally-generated sensory consequences. Previous studies have shown that neural activity and perception associated with self-initiated sensory consequences are reduced (sensory suppression). For example, event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by tones that follow a button press are reduced in amplitude relative to ERPs elicited by passively attended tones. However, previous EEG studies investigating visual stimuli in this context are rare, provide inconclusive results, and lack adequate control conditions with passive movements. Furthermore, although self-initiation is known to modulate behavioural responses, it is not known whether differences in the amplitude of ERPs also reflect differences in perception of sensory outcomes. In this study, we presented to participants visual stimuli consisting of grey discs following either active button presses, or passive button presses, in which an electromagnet moved the participant's finger. Two discs presented visually 500-1250 ms apart followed each button press, and participants judged which of the two was more intense. Early components of the primary visual response (N1 and P2) over the occipital electrodes were suppressed in the active condition. Interestingly, suppression in the intensity judgement task was only correlated with suppression of the visual P2 component. These data support the notion of efference copy-based forward model predictions in the visual sensory modality, but especially later processes (P2) seem to be perceptually relevant. Taken together, the results challenge the assumption that N1 differences reflect perceptual suppression and emphasise the relevance of the P2 ERP component.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conserved transcriptional programming across sex and species after peripheral nerve injury predicts treatments for neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain is a devastating problem affecting 1 in 5 individuals around the globe, with neuropathic pain the most debilitating and poorly treated type of chronic pain. Advances in transcriptomics and data mining have contributed to cataloging diverse cellular pathways and transcriptomic alterations in response to peripheral nerve injury but have focused on phenomenology and classifying transcriptomic responses. Here, with the goal of identifying new types of pain-relieving agents, we compared transcriptional reprogramming changes in the dorsal spinal cord after peripheral nerve injury cross-sex and cross-species and imputed commonalities, as well as differences in cellular pathways and gene regulation. We identified 93 transcripts in the dorsal horn that were increased by peripheral nerve injury in male and female mice and rats. Following gene ontology and transcription factor analyses, we constructed a pain interactome for the proteins encoded by the differentially expressed genes, discovering new, conserved signaling nodes. We interrogated the interactome with the Drug-Gene database to predict FDA-approved medications that may modulate key nodes within the network. The top hit from the analysis was fostamatinib, the molecular target of which is the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk, which our analysis had identified as a key node in the interactome. We found that intrathecally administrating the active metabolite of fostamatinib, R406, significantly reversed pain hypersensitivity in both sexes. Thus, we have identified and shown the efficacy of an agent that could not have been previously predicted to have analgesic properties.

                Substance misuse is a major burden for not only patients but the healthcare system. Understanding how substance misuse alters a patient's genome, proteome, and neurocircuitry is an important step toward identifying targets for treatments. In this exploratory study, we performed a proteomic analysis of postmortem brain from individuals with substance misuse disorder (n=29), including alcohol (n=11) and opioid misuse disorder (n=12), or comorbidity with both disorders (n=6), compared to controls (n=12). The results demonstrate that these substances affect both common and different biological pathways compared to controls. Alcohol misuse affects primarily protein translation, rRNA processing, and energy metabolism pathways, while opioid influences G-protein signaling, protein translation, rRNA processing, energy metabolism, and angiogenesis pathways. Alcohol and opioid misuse combined appears to have a synergistic effect on protein expression of the TCA cycle, respiratory transport, mitochondrial function, LGI-ADAM interactions, interleukin signaling, neuronal system changes, and actin polymerization. These findings offer new insights into how substance misuse leads to protein alterations and how combined substance misuse leads to different protein changes compared to single substance misuse.

                In a recent paper entitled, An implicit memory of errors limits human sensorimotor adaptation, Albert and colleagues presented a model in which the adaptive response of the sensorimotor system is flexibly modulated by recent experience, or what they refer to as a memory of errors. This hypothesis stands in contrast to prevailing models in which automatic and implicit responses to movement errors are relatively insensitive to the statistical properties of the environment. A prime example of this rigidity is that the adaptation system exhibits a saturated response to large errors, resulting in a non-linear motor correction function, a feature that is independent of experience. Here we show that the key results reported in Albert et al. are fully explained by presupposing this rigid motor correction function without reference to memory-dependent changes in error sensitivity. As such, the evidence presented in Albert et. al. does not support the claim that the history of errors modulates implicit adaptation.

                In networks of neurons, the connections are heavy-tailed, with a small number of neurons connected much more strongly than the vast majority of pairs. Yet it remains unclear whether, and how, such heavy-tailed connectivity emerges from simple underlying mechanisms. Here we propose a minimal model of synaptic self-organization: connections are pruned at random, and the synaptic strength rearranges under a mixture of Hebbian and random dynamics. Under these generic rules, networks evolve to produce scale-free distributions of connectivity strength, with a power-law exponent {gamma} = 1 + 1/p that depends only on the probability p of Hebbian (rather than random) growth. By extending our model to include correlations in neuronal activity, we find that clustering--another ubiquitous feature of neuronal networks--also emerges naturally. We confirm these predictions in the connectomes of several animals, suggesting that heavy-tailed and clustered connectivity may arise from general principles of self-organization, rather than the biophysical particulars of individual neural systems.

                Speech imagery (the ability to generate internally quasi-perceptual experiences of speech events) is a fundamental ability tightly linked to important cognitive functions such as inner speech, phonological working memory, and predictive processing. Speech imagery is also considered an ideal tool to test theories of overt speech. Despite its pervasive nature, the study and use of speech imagery for clinical or basic research has been tremendously challenging, primarily because of the lack of behavioral outputs and the difficulty in temporally aligning imagery events across trials and individuals. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) paired with time-resolved decoding and a novel behavioral protocol to map out the processing stages underlying speech imagery. We monitored participants' upper lip and jaw micromovements during imagery using electromyography. Decoding of participants' imagined syllables revealed a rapid sequence of representations from visual encoding to the imagined speech event. Importantly, participants' micromovements did not discriminate between the syllables. The neural correlates of the decoded sequence maps neatly onto the predictions of current computational models of speech motor control and provide some evidence for hypothesized internal and external feedback loops for speech planning and production, respectively. Additionally, a windowed multinomial classification (WMC) analysis revealed the presence of two nested and concurrent levels of representation (syllable and consonant-vowel transition) and the compressed nature of representations during planning. It is assumed that the same sequence underlies the motor-based generation of sensory predictions that modulate speech perception and the articulatory loop of phonological working memory. The results highlight the potential of speech imagery for different research domains, based on these new experimental approaches and analytical methods, and further pave the way for successful non-invasive brain-computer interfaces.

	<p>The Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) was developed to be responsive to small treatment-related changes in the impact of tinnitus. Yet, no studies have integrated anchor-based and distribution-based techniques to produce a single Minimal Important Change (MIC) score. Here, we evaluated the responsiveness and interpretability of the TFI, determining for the first time a robust MIC score in a UK clinical population. Two-hundred and fifty-five patients with tinnitus participated in this prospective longitudinal validation study. Distribution-based estimates (Standard Error of Measurement, Smallest Detectable Change and Effect size) and anchor-based estimates of important change (minimal clinically important difference and Receiver Operator Curve optimal value) were calculated and then integrated using a visual anchor-based MIC distribution plot. A reduction in score of &amp;amp;ndash;14 was determined as the MIC estimate that exceeds the measurement error, most of the variability and reliably identifies patients demonstrating true improvement. It is therefore recommended that a reduction of 14 points should be used as a minimum change required when calculating statistical power and sample size in tinnitus intervention studies and assessing patients in clinical practice.</p>

	<p>Purpose: This one-group pretest&amp;amp;ndash;posttest, designed within a subject study, looks to compare the effects of an outdoor nature walk (ONW) to those of a virtual nature walk (VRW) on memory and cognitive function. Implications are discussed for education as well as for the world of virtual reality. Methods: Sixty-four healthy university students were asked to complete an ONW and a VRW, which was created using 3D video of the same nature trail used for the ONW. The VRW condition involved a five-minute walk on a treadmill, while wearing a virtual reality mask (Oculus, San Francisco) that projected a previously recorded three-dimensional capture of the same nature walk they experienced outdoors. Both experimental conditions lasted approximately 5 min and were counterbalanced between participants. A Digit Span Test (Digit) for working memory and a Trail Test (TMT) for executive function were administered to all study participants, immediately before and after each type of walk. Results: For executive function testing (Trail Making Test), our results demonstrate that both the ONW and VRW condition improved the TMT time, when compared to a baseline (ONW 37.06 1.31 s vs. 31.75 1.07 s, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01 and VRW 36.19 1.18 s vs. 30.69 1.11 s, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference between the ONW and VRW groups. Similarly, for the Digit memory task, both conditions improved compared to the baseline (ONW 54.30 3.01 vs. 68.4 2.66, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01 and VRW 58.1 3.10 vs. 67.4 2.72, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). There was a difference at the baseline between the ONW and VRW conditions (54.3 3.01 vs. 58.1 3.10, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), but this baseline difference in memory performance was no longer significant post exercise, between groups at follow-up (68.4 2.66 vs. 67.4 2.72, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.08). Conclusions: Our results suggest that both a virtual reality protocol and a nature walk can have positive outcomes on memory and executive function in younger adults.</p>

	<p>Damage to the visual cortex structures after high altitude exposure has been well clarified. However, changes in the neuronal activity and functional connectivity (FC) of the visual cortex after hypoxia/reoxygenation remain unclear. Twenty-three sea-level college students, who took part in 30 days of teaching at high altitude (4300 m), underwent routine blood tests, visual behavior tests, and magnetic resonance imaging scans before they went to high altitude (Test 1), 7 days after they returned to sea level (Test 2), as well as 3 months (Test 3) after they returned to sea level. In this study, we investigated the hematological parameters, behavioral data, and spontaneous brain activity. There were significant differences among the tests in hematological parameters and spontaneous brain activity. The hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and red blood cell count were significantly increased in Test 2 as compared with Tests 1 and 3. As compared with Test 1, Test 3 increased amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the right calcarine gyrus; Tests 2 and 3 increased ALFF in the right supplementary motor cortex, increased regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the left lingual gyrus, increased the voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) value in the motor cortex, and decreased FC between the left lingual gyrus and left postcentral gyrus. The color accuracy in the visual task was positively correlated with ALFF and ReHo in Test 2. Hypoxia/reoxygenation increased functional connection between the neurons within the visual cortex and the motor cortex but decreased connection between the visual cortex and motor cortex.</p>

	<p>Interleukin-37 (IL-37) is an effective anti-inflammatory factor and acts through intracellular and extracellular pathways, inhibiting the effects of other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-&amp;amp;alpha; (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), thereby exerting powerful anti-inflammatory effects. In numerous recent studies, the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-37 have been described in many autoimmune diseases, colitis, and tumors. However, the current research on IL-37 in the field of the central nervous system (CNS) is not only less, but mainly for clinical research and little discussion of the mechanism. In this review, the role of IL-37and its associated inflammatory factors in common CNS diseases are summarized, and their therapeutic potential in CNS diseases identified.</p>

	<p>Research shows that stress, a common problem in densely populated cities, can be relieved by exposure to the natural environment. As great significance has been attached to the relationship between the urban environment and public health, this paper aims to study the relationship and interaction between the perceived sensory dimensions of urban park green space, attention restoration, and state empathy. Therefore, we conducted an on-site questionnaire (PSD Scale) survey in four typical parks in Chengdu and recorded age, sex, daily stress, frequency of visits to parks, and other basic information from the respondents. In the survey and visit, we found that the group structure in the recreation area comprises chiefly of a few transient unfamiliar travelers and most long-haul neighborhood sightseers. Among long-haul vacationers, the greater part of them are moderately aged and older individuals in the encompassing local locations, whose lives are, for the most part, quick and proficient. Hence, to mirror the populace attributes of high-thickness metropolitan parks and to feature the agent bunches that have lived in the parks from here onward, indefinitely quite a while, the chosen bunches are somewhere in the range of 35 and 65 years old (half male and half female), so make sure there are no ailments, no drinking, and no late evenings in the earlier days, so a specific actual fundamental belief is kept up with. The main part of the exercise focused on the perceived dimension, state empathy, and attention restoration. The software SPSS24.0 was applied to the test of the validity and reliability of the perceived sensory dimension (PSD) Scale, and then the important correlation between the perceived sensory dimensions in the parks and visitors&amp;amp;rsquo; attention restoration was analyzed through multiple linear regression. Finally, the moderating effect of state empathy was tested by PROCESS. The findings show that (1) only seven dimensions in the PSD Scale are effective; (2) Serene and Refuge in the perceived sensory dimensions have a significant effect on the restorative components of attention. (3) Except for the dimensions of Rich in Species and Refuge, empathy enhanced the moderation effect in the interaction between the other five dimensions of the Perceived Restorative Scale (PRS), especially in the interaction between the Social and PRS dimensions. However, this topic needs to be further explored to provide a scientific basis and design strategy for research on the restoration potential of urban park green space in high-density urban areas.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) was recently defined as a biological construct to reflect neuropathologic status, and both abnormal amyloid and tau are required for a diagnosis of AD. We aimed to determine the proton MR spectroscopic (1H-MRS) patterns of the posterior cingulate in biologically defined AD. A total of 68 participants were included in this study, comprising 37 controls, 16 early AD, and 15 late AD, who were classified according to their amyloid and tau status and presence of hippocampal atrophy. Compared with controls, early AD showed lower N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) (p = 0.003), whereas late AD showed lower NAA/Cr and higher myoInositol (mI)/Cr (all with p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Lower NAA/Cr correlated with a greater global amyloid load (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.47, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and tau load (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.51, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and allowed a discrimination of early AD from controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that NAA/Cr also allowed a differentiation of early AD from controls in the cognitively unimpaired subjects, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.96, 100%, and 83.8%, respectively. Lower posterior cingulate NAA levels may help to inform underlying neuropathologic changes in the early stage of AD.</p>

	<p>Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common genetic tumor predisposition syndromes, affecting up to 1 in 2500 individuals. Up to half of patients with NF1 develop benign nerve sheath tumors called plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), characterized by biallelic NF1 loss. PNs can grow to immense sizes, cause extensive morbidity, and harbor a 15% lifetime risk of malignant transformation. Increasingly, molecular sequencing and drug screening data from various preclinical murine and human PN cell lines, murine models, and human PN tissues are available to help identify salient treatments for PNs. Despite this, Selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, is the only currently FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for symptomatic and inoperable PNs in pediatric NF1 patients. The discovery of alternative and additional treatments has been hampered by the rarity of the disease, which makes prioritizing drugs to be tested in future clinical trials immensely important. Here, we propose a gene regulatory network-based integrated analysis to mine high-throughput cell line-based drug data combined with transcriptomes from resected human PN tumors. Conserved network modules were characterized and served as drug fingerprints reflecting the biological connections among drug effects and the inherent properties of PN cell lines and tissue. Drug candidates were ranked, and the therapeutic potential of drug combinations was evaluated via computational predication. Auspicious therapeutic agents and drug combinations were proposed for further investigation in preclinical and clinical trials.</p>

	<p>Ever since the discovery of tumor-associated immune cells, there has been growing interest in the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between these cells and tumor cells. A &amp;amp;ldquo;seed and soil&amp;amp;rdquo; approach has been recently introduced to describe the glioblastoma (GBM) landscape: tumor microenvironments act as fertile &amp;amp;ldquo;soil&amp;amp;rdquo; and interact with the &amp;amp;ldquo;seed&amp;amp;rdquo; (glial and stem cells compartment). In the following article, we provide a systematic review of the current evidence pertaining to the characterization of glioma-associated macrophages and microglia (GAMs) and microglia and macrophage cells in the glioma tumor microenvironment (TME). Methods: An online literature search was launched on PubMed Medline and Scopus using the following research string: &amp;amp;ldquo;((Glioma associated macrophages OR GAM OR Microglia) AND (glioblastoma tumor microenvironment OR TME))&amp;amp;rdquo;. The last search for articles pertinent to the topic was conducted in February 2022. Results: The search of the literature yielded a total of 349 results. A total of 235 studies were found to be relevant to our research question and were assessed for eligibility. Upon a full-text review, 58 articles were included in the review. The reviewed papers were further divided into three categories based on their focus: (1) Microglia maintenance of immunological homeostasis and protection against autoimmunity; (2) Microglia crosstalk with dedifferentiated and stem-like glioblastoma cells; (3) Microglia migratory behavior and its activation pattern. Conclusions: Aggressive growth, inevitable recurrence, and scarce response to immunotherapies are driving the necessity to focus on the GBM TME from a different perspective to possibly disentangle its role as a fertile &amp;amp;lsquo;soil&amp;amp;rsquo; for tumor progression and identify within it feasible therapeutic targets. Against this background, our systematic review confirmed microglia to play a paramount role in promoting GBM progression and relapse after treatments. The correct and extensive understanding of microglia&amp;amp;ndash;glioma crosstalk could help in understanding the physiopathology of this complex disease, possibly opening scenarios for improvement of treatments.</p>

	<p>This study investigated the effect of broadband amplification (125 Hz to 10 kHz) as tinnitus treatment for participants with high-frequency hearing loss and compared these effects with an active placebo condition using band-limited amplification (125 Hz to 3&amp;amp;ndash;4 kHz). A double-blinded crossover study. Twenty-three participants with high-frequency (&amp;amp;ge;3 kHz) hearing loss and chronic tinnitus were included in the study, and 17 completed the full treatment protocol. Two different hearing aid treatments were provided for 3 months each: Broadband amplification provided gain in the frequency range from 125 Hz to 10 kHz and band-limited amplification only provided gain in the low-frequency range (&amp;amp;le;3&amp;amp;ndash;4 kHz). The effect of the two treatments on tinnitus distress was evaluated with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) questionnaires. The effect of the treatment on tinnitus loudness was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) for loudness and a psychoacoustic loudness measure. Furthermore, the tinnitus annoyance was evaluated with a VAS for annoyance. The tinnitus pitch was evaluated based on the tinnitus likeness spectrum. A statistically significant difference was found between the two treatment groups (broadband vs. band-limited amplification) for the treatment-related change in THI and TFI with respect to the baseline. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference was found between the two treatment conditions for the annoyance measure. Regarding the loudness measure, no statistically significant differences were found between the treatments, although there was a trend towards a lower VAS-based loudness measure resulting from the broadband amplification. No changes were observed in the tinnitus pitch between the different conditions. Overall, the results from the present study suggest that tinnitus patients with high-frequency hearing loss can experience a decrease in tinnitus-related distress and annoyance from high-frequency amplification.</p>

	<p>Background: One of the main symptoms of COVID-19 is hyposmia or even anosmia. Olfactory identification is most often affected. In addition, some cognitive disorders tend to appear following the infection, particularly regarding executive functions, attention, and memory. Olfaction, and especially olfactory identification, is related to semantic memory which manages general knowledge about the world. The main objective of this study was to determine whether semantic memory is impaired in case of persistent post COVID-19 olfactory disorders. Methods: 84 patients (average age of 42.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.6 years) with post COVID-19 olfactory loss were included after consulting to the ENT department. The clinical evaluation was carried out with the Pyramid and Palm Tree Test, the word-retrieval task from the Gr&amp;amp;eacute;mots, the Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks Test and the Computerised Olfactory Test for the Diagnosis of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease. Results: Semantic memory was impaired in 20% (n = 17) of patients, especially in the 19&amp;amp;ndash;39 age-group. The olfactory threshold was only significantly correlated with the semantic memory scores. Conclusions: Similar to all cognitive disorders, semantic disorders can have a negative impact on quality of life if left untreated. It is essential to carry out specific assessments of post COVID-19 patients to accurately determine their disorders and to put in place the best possible rehabilitation, such as speech and language therapy, to avoid quality-of-life impairment.</p>

	<p>In the present study we investigated whether and how age group, dimensions of well-being and their interactions predicted the phenomenological properties of semantic self-images, taking also into account the different levels of accessibility of self-images (i.e., order of generation). Results on the first self-image revealed that, independently of age, higher levels of life satisfaction predicted higher likelihood of positive than negative statement and higher levels of negative affect and life satisfaction predicted higher levels of personal relevance of the self-image. When all self-images were considered, for higher levels of life satisfaction neutral and positive self-images were more likely than negative ones, and for lower levels of positive affect, neutral images were more likely than negative ones. Moreover, young adults were more likely than older adults to report neutral rather than negative self-images and, for higher levels of positive affect, they were more likely to report neutral and positive images instead of negative ones. These results suggest that the accessibility of semantic self-images should be taken into account in the investigation of the complex association between well-being and semantic self-images. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.</p>

	<p>Strokes often lead to a deficit in motor control that contributes to a reduced balance function. Impairments in the balance function severely limit the activities of daily living (ADL) in stroke survivors. The present systematic review and meta-analysis primarily aims to explore the efficacy of overground robot-assisted gait training (o-RAGT) on balance recovery in individuals with stroke. In addition, the efficacy on ADL is also investigated. This systematic review identified nine articles investigating the effects of o-RAGT on balance, four of which also assessed ADL. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that o-RAGT does not increase balance and ADL outcomes more than conventional therapy in individuals after stroke. The data should not be overestimated due to the low number of studies included in the meta-analysis and the wide confidence intervals. Subgroup analyses to investigate the influence of participant&amp;amp;rsquo;s characteristics and training dosage were not performed due to lack of data availability. Further well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the efficacy of o-RAGT on balance in individuals with stroke.</p>

	<p>Pre-competition anxiety is very prevalent in novice athletes, causing stress and drastic decreases in their performances. Cortisol plays a central role in the psychosomatic responses to stress and also in the physiology of strenuous exercise. Growing evidence links uric acid, an endogenous antioxidant, with oxidative stress and anxiety, as observed in many depressive-related disorders. We here compared anxiety inventory scores (BAI and CSAI-2), cortisol and biomarkers of oxidative stress in the plasma of novice combat athletes (white and blue belts) before and after their first official national competition, when levels of stress are presumably high. Although the novice fighters did not reveal high indexes of anxiety on questionnaires, significant correlations were confirmed between cortisol and cognitive anxiety (Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s r = 0.766, p-value = 0.002, and a &amp;amp;lsquo;strong&amp;amp;rsquo; Bayesian inference; BF10 = 22.17) and between pre-post changes of plasmatic uric acid and somatic anxiety (r = 0.804, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, and &amp;amp;lsquo;very strong&amp;amp;rsquo; inference; BF10 = 46.52). To our knowledge, this is the first study to report such strong correlations between uric acid and pre-competition anxiety in novice combat athletes. The cause-consequence association between these indexes cannot be directly inferred here, although the interplay between uric acid and anxiety deserves further investigation.</p>

                Background: Several studies have resulted in controversial data about the recurrence or new incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C who were treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).   Aim: This observational study aimed to assess the occurrence rate of HCC in patients who developed a sustained virological response (SVR).. METHOD:  A six-month prospective study was done at the National Hepatology and Tropical Medicine Research Institute [NHTMRI] in Cairo, Egypt on 150 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients treated with sofosbuvir and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin. Patients were assigned into two groups according to their laboratory values to either receive sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (S/D/R) or receive only sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (S/D). The main outcome measure was the occurrence of HCC. Results: SVR-12 was 100%. 8.5% of patients developed HCC in the S/D/R group, while 0% in the S/D group. Conclusion:  New incidence or recurrence of HCC may occur in CHC genotype 4 cirrhotic patients receiving sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and ribavirin (difficult to treat) although achieving SVR. The cause of HCC development in this study is cirrhosis, not the administered DAAs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bacterial and fungal co-infections among ICU COVID-19 hospitalized patients in a Palestinian hospital: a retrospective cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diagnosis of co-infections with multiple pathogens among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients can be jointly challenging and essential for appropriate treatment, shortening hospital stays and preventing antimicrobial resistance. This study proposes to investigate the burden of bacterial and fungal co-infections outcomes on COVID-19 patients. It is a single center cross-sectional study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at Beit-Jala hospital in Palestine. Methods: The study included 321 hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU between June 2020 and March 2021 aged ≥20 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay conducted on a nasopharyngeal swab. The patient's information was gathered using graded data forms from electronic medical reports. Results: The diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infection was proved through the patient’s clinical presentation and positive blood or sputum culture results. All cases had received empirical antimicrobial therapy before the intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and different regimens during the ICU stay. The rate of bacterial co-infection was 51.1%, mainly from gram-negative isolates (Enterobacter species and K.pneumoniae). The rate of fungal co-infection caused by A.fumigatus was 48.9%, and the mortality rate was 8.1%. However, it is unclear if it had been attributed to SARS-CoV-2 or coincidental. Conclusions: Bacterial and fungal co-infection is common among COVID-19 patients at the ICU in Palestine, but it is not obvious if these cases are attributed to SARS-CoV-2 or coincidental, because little data is available to compare it with the rates of secondary infection in local ICU departments before the pandemic. Comprehensively, those conclusions present data supporting a conservative antibiotic administration for severely unwell COVID-19 infected patients. Our examination regarding the impacts of employing antifungals to manage COVID-19 patients can work as a successful reference for future COVID-19 therapy.

                The aim of the present study is to report the indirect evaluation of cervical stimulation considering the effect of the duration of the stimulus on the control of intraocular pressure in a patient with bilateral glaucoma with important ocular edema.  A 47-year-old woman reported the onset of pain and bilateral tearing in the eyes at 35 years of age and was diagnosed with glaucoma. The patient began clinical treatment, but intraocular pressure remained 35 to 40 mmHg even with the use of four eye medications in the form of drops. The patient reported that her vision was always blurred despite the use of the eyedrops. The patient was submitted to the Godoy & Godoy method of cervical lymphatic therapy to reduce the edema. The ophthalmologist measured her intraocular pressure every two and three days. We found that the pressure was maintained below 20 mmHg when lymphatic therapy was performed every two days, but intraocular pressure increased and the vision became blurred when therapy was performed every three days. The Godoy & Godoy method of cervical lymphatic therapy constitutes a novel lymphatic system stimulation strategy that maintains its effect on intraocular pressure for approximately 48 hours, as demonstrated through an indirect evaluation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of selected semen parameters and biomarkers of male infertility – preliminary study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Because the etiopathogenesis of male infertility is multifactorial our study was designed to clarify the relationship between standard semen parameters, testicular volume, levels of reproductive hormones and the fragmentation of sperm nuclear DNA (SDF). Methods: Patients (n = 130) were clustered as subjects: 1) with an abnormal volume (utrasonography) of at least one testis (<12 mL) or with a normal volume of testes and 2) with abnormal levels of at least one of the reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, PRL, TSH, total T – electrochemiluminescence method) or with normal hormonal profiles and 3) with high level of SDF (>30%), moderate (>15–30%) or low (≤15%) (sperm chromatin dispersion test). Results: In subjects with a decreased testicular volume and in subjects with abnormal levels of reproductive hormones, decreased basic semen parameters were found. Participants with abnormal testicular volume had a higher percentage of SDF and a higher level of FSH (Mann–Whitney U test). In turn, men with a high level of SDF had lower testicular volume and conventional sperm parameters than men with a low level of SDF (Kruskal–Wallis test). Conclusions: We showed that spermatogenesis disorders coexisted with decreased testicular volume and increased FSH levels. The disorders of spermatogenesis were manifested by reduced basic sperm characteristics and a high level of sperm nuclear DNA damage.

Among adolescents, associated symptoms of dysmenorrhea impact the general health status, negatively influence the quality of life, resulting in school absenteeism and decreased academic performance. This study protocol was developed to estimate the prevalence of dysmenorrhea and evaluate the effectiveness of Meditation and Yoga intervention on dysmenorrhea among adolescent girls. In phase I, data will be collected from adolescent girls (N» 5000) aged between 13 and 18 years to estimate the prevalence of dysmenorrhea and in the second phase, Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted to evaluate the impact of Meditation and Yoga on dysmenorrhea. From the first phase, those adolescent girls (N=400) with high pain intensity (numerical pain rating scale ≥ 4) from each school, with schools as clusters, will be assigned to the interventional and control arm. The interventional arm will receive the proposed Meditation and Yoga intervention for 12 weeks under supervision and the control arm will continue with standard routine care.  The outcomes such as pain intensity, stress, academic performance, self-efficacy and biomarker levels (Hb, Progesterone, Estrogen, Prostaglandins F2α and E2) will be assessed at baseline and 12 weeks after the intervention. Yoga's popularity and medical benefits have grown with the growing interest in alternative and complementary medicine. There is insufficient evidence to support yoga as a treatment for dysmenorrhea symptoms. This research contributes to the evidence on the impact of meditation and yoga on primary dysmenorrhea among adolescent girls.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Duration of dry and humidified incubation of single-step embryo culture medium and oxygen tension during sham culture do not alter medium composition. [version 4; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extended embryo culture using single-step medium gained popularity in clinical in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, there are concerns about the degradation of unstable medium components and their negative effects on the developing embryos. Further, dry-incubation can increase osmolality, which can in-turn enhance the concentration of constituents of the media and their stability. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the immediate changes in the culture media constituents in relation to clinically comparable situations such as single-step extended embryo culture and use of dry and humidified-incubation in two-different gaseous conditions. Methods: Commercially available single-step medium was sham-cultured in droplets under oil in two different conditions viz. dry (37°C; 6%CO 2; 5%O 2) and humidified (37°C; 6% CO 2; atmospheric O 2) for 0h, 72h, and 120h intervals. Droplets were subjected to the sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based profiling using 800 MHz NMR equipped with a cryogenically cooled micro-coil (1.7mm) probe. NMR profile of the embryo culture medium between the two groups were comprehensively assessed. Results: A total of ten amino acids and four energy substrates were identified from the culture medium. The medium constituents identified showed a non-significant increase in the dry-incubation group at 72h and then declined at 120h. Humidified incubation had no effects on the level of the identified medium constituents until 120h. No significant differences in the levels of medium constituents identified were observed between the dry and humidified-groups at various time-points tested. Conclusions: A non-significant variation in the levels of medium constituents observed in the dry-incubation of single-step medium most unlikely to influence a clinical outcome. However, the impact of these subtle changes on the (epi)genetic integrity of the embryos in a clinical set-up to be addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of electrocardiogram: numerical vs. image data for emotion recognition system [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a physiological signal used to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular disease, usually using 2- D ECG. Numerous studies have proven that ECG can be used to detect human emotions using 1-D ECG; however, ECG is typically captured as 2-D images rather than as 1-D data. There is still no consensus on the effect of the ECG input format on the accuracy of the emotion recognition system (ERS). The ERS using 2-D ECG is still inadequately studied. Therefore, this study compared ERS performance using 1-D and 2-D ECG data to investigate the effect of the ECG input format on the ERS. Methods: This study employed the DREAMER dataset, which contains 23 ECG recordings obtained during audio-visual emotional elicitation. Numerical data was converted to ECG images for the comparison. Numerous approaches were used to obtain ECG features. The Augsburg BioSignal Toolbox (AUBT) and the Toolbox for Emotional feature extraction from Physiological signals (TEAP) extracted features from numerical data. Meanwhile, features were extracted from image data using Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB), Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), KAZE, Accelerated-KAZE (AKAZE), Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Keypoints (BRISK), and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). Dimension reduction was accomplished using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and valence and arousal were classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results: The experimental results show 1-D ECG-based ERS achieved 65.06% of accuracy and 75.63% of F1 score for valence, and 57.83% of accuracy and 44.44% of F1-score for arousal. For 2-D ECG-based ERS, the highest accuracy and F1-score for valence were 62.35% and 49.57%; whereas, the arousal was 59.64% and 59.71%. Conclusions: The results indicate that both inputs work comparably well in classifying emotions, which demonstrates the potential of 1-D and 2-D as input modalities for the ERS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">GRAPE: genomic relatedness detection pipeline [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Classifying the degree of relatedness between pairs of individuals has both scientific and commercial applications. As an example, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) may suffer from high rates of false positive results due to unrecognized population structure. This problem becomes especially relevant with recent increases in large-cohort studies. Accurate relationship classification is also required for genetic linkage analysis to identify disease-associated loci. Additionally, DNA relatives matching service is one of the leading drivers for the direct-to-consumer genetic testing market. Despite the availability of scientific and research information on the methods for determining kinship and the accessibility of relevant tools, the assembly of the pipeline, that stably operates on a real-world genotypic data, requires significant research and development resources. Currently, there is no open source end-to-end solution for relatedness detection in genomic data, that is fast, reliable and accurate for both close and distant degrees of kinship, combines all the necessary processing steps to work on real data, and is ready for production integration. To address this, we developed GRAPE: Genomic RelAtedness detection PipelinE. It combines data preprocessing, identity-by-descent (IBD) segments detection, and accurate relationship estimation. The project uses software development best practices, as well as Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) standards and tools. Pipeline efficiency is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets. GRAPE is available from: https://github.com/genxnetwork/grape.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">ApoB and non‐HDL cholesterol versus LDL cholesterol for ischemic stroke risk</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Conflicting results have been reported on the association between lipids and risk of ischemic stroke. We tested the hypothesis that the burden of ischemic stroke attributable to either elevated apolipoprotein B (apoB) or non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol is higher than that attributable to elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 104 618 individuals from an ongoing cohort study, the Copenhagen General Population Study. The associations of quintiles of apoB, non-HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol with risk of ischemic stroke were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regressions with 95% confidence intervals. With 1<sup>st</sup> quintile as reference, the proportion of ischemic stroke attributable to the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> quintiles of apoB, non-HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol were estimated by population attributable fractions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Higher quintiles of apoB and non-HDL cholesterol were associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (both trends: P&lt;0.0001), whereas for LDL cholesterol this association was somewhat attenuated (trend: P=0.0005). A similar pattern was seen for population attributable fraction values. Compared to individuals in the 1<sup>st</sup> quintile, the combined proportion of ischemic stroke attributable to individuals in the 2<sup>nd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> quintiles was 16.3% for apoB (levels &gt;82mg/dL), 14.7% for non-HDL cholesterol (&gt;3.0mmol/L; &gt;117mg/dL), and 6.8% for LDL cholesterol (&gt;2.4mmol/L; &gt;94mg/dL).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The proportion of ischemic stroke attributable to either elevated apoB or non-HDL cholesterol was double that attributable to elevated LDL cholesterol.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The spatiotemporal patterns of major human admixture events during the European Holocene</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that admixture has been pervasive throughout human history. While several methods exist for dating admixture in contemporary populations, they are not suitable for sparse, low coverage ancient genomic data. Thus, we developed <i>DATES </i>that leverages ancestry covariance patterns across the genome of a single individual to infer the timing of admixture. <i>DATES</i> provides reliable estimates under various demographic scenarios and outperforms available methods for ancient DNA applications. Using <i>DATES</i> on ~1,100 ancient genomes, we reconstruct major gene flow events during European Holocene. By studying the genetic formation of Anatolian farmers, we infer that gene flow related to Iranian Neolithic farmers occurred before 9,600 BCE, predating the advent of agriculture in Anatolia. Contrary to the archaeological evidence, we estimate that early Steppe pastoralist groups (Yamnaya and Afanasievo) were genetically formed more than a millennium before the start of steppe pastoralism. Using time transect samples across sixteen regions, we provide a fine-scale chronology of the Neolithization of Europe and the rapid spread of Steppe pastoralist ancestry across Europe. Our analyses provide new insights on the origins and spread of farming and Indo-European languages, highlighting the power of genomic dating methods to elucidate the legacy of human migrations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptional regulation of Cyclophilin D by BMP/SMAD signaling and its role in osteogenic differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Cyclophilin D (CypD) promotes opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) which plays a key role in both cell physiology and pathology. It is, therefore, beneficial for cells to tightly regulate CypD and MPTP but little is known about such regulation. We have reported before that CypD is downregulated and MPTP deactivated during differentiation in various tissues. Herein, we identify BMP/Smad signaling, a major driver of differentiation, as a transcriptional regulator of the CypD gene, <i>Ppif</i>. Using osteogenic induction of mesenchymal lineage cells as a BMP/Smad activation-dependent differentiation model, we show that CypD is in fact transcriptionally repressed during this process. The importance of such CypD downregulation is evidenced by the negative effect of CypD 'rescue' via gain-of-function on osteogenesis both <i>in vitro</i> and in a mouse model . In sum, we characterized BMP/Smad signaling as a regulator of CypD expression and elucidated the role of CypD downregulation during cell differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The geometry of robustness in spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Neural systems are remarkably robust against various perturbations, a phenomenon that still requires a clear explanation. Here, we graphically illustrate howneural networks can become robust. We study spiking networks that generate low-dimensional representations, and we show that the neurons; subthreshold voltages are confined to a convex region in a lower-dimensional voltage subspace, which we call a 'bounding box'. Any changes in network parameters (such as number of neurons, dimensionality of inputs, firing thresholds, synapticweights, or transmission delays) can all be understood as deformations of this bounding box. Using these insights, we showthat functionality is preserved as long as perturbations do not destroy the integrity of the bounding box. We suggest that the principles underlying robustness in these networks-low-dimensional representations, heterogeneity of tuning, and precise negative feedback-may be key to understanding the robustness of neural systems at the circuit level.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA-damage induced cell death in yap1;wwtr1 mutant epidermal basal cells</a></h4>

              
                In a previous study, it was reported that Yap1 and Wwtr1 in zebrafish regulates the morphogenesis of the posterior body and epidermal fin fold (Kimelman, D., et al. 2017). We report here that DNA damage induces apoptosis of epidermal basal cells (EBCs) in zebrafish <i>yap1<sup>-/-</sup>;wwtr1<sup>-/-</sup></i> embryos. Specifically, these mutant EBCs exhibit active Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and γH2AX, consistent with DNA damage serving as a stimulus of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in epidermal cells. Live imaging of zebrafish epidermal cells reveals a steady growth of basal cell size in the developing embryo, but this growth is inhibited in mutant basal cells followed by apoptosis, leading to the hypothesis that factors underscoring cell size play a role in this DNA damage-induced apoptosis phenotype. We tested two of these factors using cell stretching and substrate stiffness assays, and found that HaCaT cells cultured on stiff substrates exhibit more numerous γH2AX foci compared to ones cultured on soft substrates. Thus, our experiments suggest that substrate rigidity may modulate genomic stress in epidermal cells, and that Yap1 and Wwtr1 promotes their survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibitory control of frontal metastability sets the temporal signature of cognition</a></h4>

              
                Cortical dynamics are organized over multiple anatomical and temporal scales. The mechanistic origin of the temporal organization and its contribution to cognition remain unknown. Here we demonstrate the cause of this organization by studying a specific temporal signature (time constant and latency) of neural activity. In monkey frontal areas, recorded during flexible decisions, temporal signatures display specific area-dependent ranges, as well as anatomical and cell-type distributions. Moreover, temporal signatures are functionally adapted to behaviorally relevant timescales. Fine-grained biophysical network models, constrained to account for experimentally observed temporal signatures, reveal that after-hyperpolarization potassium and inhibitory GABA-B conductances critically determine areas’ specificity. They mechanistically account for temporal signatures by organizing activity into metastable states, with inhibition controlling state stability and transitions. As predicted by models, state durations non-linearly scale with temporal signatures in monkey, matching behavioral timescales. Thus, local inhibitory-controlled metastability constitutes the dynamical core specifying the temporal organization of cognitive functions in frontal areas.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Constitutive loss of DNMT3A causes morbid obesity through misregulation of adipogenesis</a></h4>

              
                DNA Methyltransferase 3 A (DNMT3A) is an important facilitator of differentiation of both embryonic and hematopoietic stem cells. Heterozygous germline mutations in <i>DNMT3A</i> lead to Tatton-Brown-Rahman Syndrome (TBRS), characterized by obesity and excessive height. While DNMT3A is known to impact feeding behavior via the hypothalamus, here we investigated a role in adipocyte progenitors utilizing heterozygous knockout mice that recapitulate cardinal TBRS phenotypes. These mice become morbidly obese due to adipocyte enlargement and tissue expansion. Adipose tissue in these mice exhibited defects in preadipocyte maturation and precocious activation of inflammatory gene networks, including interleukin-6 signaling. Adipocyte progenitor cell lines lacking DNMT3A exhibited aberrant differentiation. Furthermore, mice in which <i>Dnmt3a</i> was specifically ablated in adipocyte progenitors showed enlarged fat depots and increased progenitor numbers, partly recapitulating the TBRS obesity phenotypes. Loss of DNMT3A led to constitutive DNA hypomethylation, such that the DNA methylation landscape of young adipocyte progenitors resemble that of older wild-type mice. Together, our results demonstrate that DNMT3A coordinates both the central and local control of energy storage required to maintain normal weight and prevent inflammatory obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Invariant representation of physical stability in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Successful engagement with the world requires the ability to predict what will happen next. Here, we investigate how the brain makes a fundamental prediction about the physical world: whether the situation in front of us is stable, and hence likely to stay the same, or unstable, and hence likely to change in the immediate future. Specifically, we ask if judgments of stability can be supported by the kinds of representations that have proven to be highly effective at visual object recognition in both machines and brains, or instead if the ability to determine the physical stability of natural scenes may require generative algorithms that simulate the physics of the world. To find out, we measured responses in both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the brain (using fMRI) to natural images of physically stable versus unstable scenarios. We find no evidence for generalizable representations of physical stability in either standard CNNs trained on visual object and scene classification (ImageNet), or in the human ventral visual pathway, which has long been implicated in the same process. However, in frontoparietal regions previously implicated in intuitive physical reasoning we find both scenario-invariant representations of physical stability, and higher univariate responses to unstable than stable scenes. These results demonstrate abstract representations of physical stability in the dorsal but not ventral pathway, consistent with the hypothesis that the computations underlying stability entail not just pattern classification but forward physical simulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A generalized cortical activity pattern at internally-generated mental context boundaries during unguided narrative recall</a></h4>

              
                Current theory and empirical studies suggest that humans segment continuous experiences into events based on the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory inputs; detection of these 'event boundaries' evokes transient neural responses. However, boundaries can also occur at transitions between internal mental states, without relevant external input changes. To what extent do such 'internal boundaries' share neural response properties with externally-driven boundaries? We conducted an fMRI experiment where subjects watched a series of short movies and then verbally recalled the movies, unprompted, in the order of their choosing. During recall, transitions between movies thus constituted major boundaries between internal mental contexts, generated purely by subjects' unguided thoughts. Following the offset of each recalled movie, we observed stereotyped spatial activation patterns in the default mode network, especially the posterior medial cortex, consistent across different movie contents and even across the different tasks of movie watching and recall. Surprisingly, the between-movie boundary patterns did not resemble patterns at boundaries between events within a movie. Thus, major transitions between mental contexts elicit neural phenomena shared across internal and external modes and distinct from within-context event boundary detection, potentially reflecting a cognitive state related to the flushing and reconfiguration of situation models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibition of the sodium-dependent HCO3- transporter SLC4A4, produces a cystic fibrosis-like airway disease phenotype</a></h4>

              
                Bicarbonate secretion is a fundamental process involved in maintaining acid-base homeostasis. Disruption of bicarbonate entry into airway lumen, as has been observed in cystic fibrosis, produces several defects in lung function due to thick mucus accumulation. Bicarbonate is critical for correct mucin deployment and there is increasing interest in understanding its role in airway physiology, particularly in the initiation of lung disease in children affected by cystic fibrosis, in the absence of detectable bacterial infection. The current model of anion secretion in mammalian airways consists of CFTR and TMEM16A as apical anion exit channels, with limited capacity for bicarbonate transport compared to chloride. However, both channels can couple to SLC26A4 anion exchanger to maximise bicarbonate secretion. Nevertheless, current models lack any details about the identity of the basolateral protein(s) responsible for bicarbonate uptake into airway epithelial cells. We report herein that the electrogenic, sodium-dependent, bicarbonate cotransporter, SLC4A4, is expressed in the basolateral membrane of human and mouse airways, and that it's pharmacological inhibition or genetic silencing reduces bicarbonate secretion. In fully differentiated primary human airway cells cultures, SLC4A4 inhibition induced an acidification of the airways surface liquid and markedly reduced the capacity of cells to recover from an acid load. Studies in the <i>Slc4a4</i>-null mice revealed a previously unreported lung phenotype, characterized by mucus accumulation and reduced mucociliary clearance. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the reduction of SLC4A4 function induced a CF-like phenotype, even when chloride secretion remained intact, highlighting the important role SLC4A4 plays in bicarbonate secretion and mammalian airway function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">When the head does not know what the eyes do: Head and eye movement planning differ in access to information during visual search</a></h4>

              
                To characterize the process of visual search, reaction time is measured relative to stimulus onset, when the whole search field is presented in view simultaneously. Salient objects are found faster, suggesting that they are detected using peripheral vision (rather than each object being fixated in turn). This work investigated how objects are detected in the periphery when onset in the visual field is due to head movement. Is the process of target detection similarly affected by salience? We test this in 360 degree view with free head and eye movement, using a virtual reality headset with eye tracking. We presented letters and Gabor patches as stimuli in separate experiments. Four clusters were arranged horizontally such that two clusters were visible at onset either side of a fixation cross (near location) while the other two entered the field of view (FoV) when the participant made an appropriate head movement (far location). In both experiments we varied whether the target was less or more salient. We found an interesting discrepancy in that across both tasks and locations the first eye movement to land near a cluster was closer to the salient target, even though salience did not lead to a faster head movement towards a cluster at the far locations. We also found that the planning of head movement changed the landing of gaze position to be targeted more towards the centres of the clusters at the far locations, leading to more accurate initial gaze positions relative to target, regardless of salience. This suggests that the spatial information available for targeting of eye movements within a given FoV is not always available for the planning of head movements and how a target appears in view affects gaze targeting accuracy.

                The general understanding of hippocampal circuits is that the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex (EC) are topographically connected through parallel identical circuits along the dorsoventral axis. Our anterograde tracing and in vitro electrophysiology data, however, show a markedly different dorsoventral organization of the hippocampal projection to the medial EC (MEC). Whereas dorsal hippocampal projections are confined to the dorsal MEC and preferentially target layer Vb (LVb) over layer Va (LVa) neurons, the ventral hippocampus innervates the entire dorsoventral extent of MEC. In the ventral MEC, these projections innervate neurons in both LVa and LVb. In contrast, in the dorsal MEC, ventral hippocampal projections target mainly LVa neurons. As LVa neurons project to telencephalic structures, our findings indicate that the ventral hippocampus regulates LVa-mediated entorhinal-neocortical output from both the dorsal and ventral MEC. Overall, the marked dorsoventral differences in hippocampal-entorhinal connectivity impose important constraints on signal flow in hippocampal-neocortical circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fixational eye movements enable robust edge detection</a></h4>

              
                Human vision relies on mechanisms that respond to luminance edges in space and time. Most edge models use orientation-selective mechanisms on multiple spatial scales and operate on static inputs assuming that edge processing occurs within a single fixational instance. Recent studies, however, demonstrate functionally relevant temporal modulations of the sensory input due to fixational eye movements. Here we propose a spatiotemporal model of human edge detection which combines elements of spatial and active vision. The model augments a spatial vision model by temporal filtering and shifts the input images over time mimicking an active sampling scheme via fixational eye movements. The first model test was White's illusion, a lightness effect that has been shown to depend on edges. The model reproduced the spatial-frequency-specific interference with the edges by superimposing narrowband noise (1-5 cpd), similar to the psychophysical interference observed in White's effect. Second, we compare the model's edge detection performance in natural images in the presence and absence of Gaussian white noise with human-labeled contours for the same (noise-free) images. Notably, the model detects edges robustly against noise in both test cases without relying on orientation-selective processes. Eliminating model components, we demonstrate the relevance of multiscale spatiotemporal filtering and scale-specific normalization for edge detection. The proposed model facilitates efficient edge detection in (artificial) vision systems and challenges the notion that orientation-selective mechanisms are required for edge detection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-synaptic boutons are a feature of CA1 hippocampal connections that may underlie network synchrony</a></h4>

              
                Excitatory synapses are typically described as single synaptic boutons (SSBs), where one presynaptic bouton contacts a single postsynaptic spine. Using serial section block face scanning electron microscopy, we found that this textbook definition of the synapse does not fully apply to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Roughly half of all excitatory synapses in the stratum oriens involved multi-synaptic boutons (MSBs), where a single presynaptic bouton containing multiple active zones contacted many postsynaptic spines (from 2 to 7) on the basal dendrites of different cells. The fraction of MSBs increased during development (from P21 to P100) and decreased with distance from the soma. Curiously, synaptic properties such as active zone (AZ) or postsynaptic density (PSD) size exhibited less within-MSB variation when compared to neighbouring SSBs, features that were confirmed by super-resolution light microscopy. Computer simulations suggest that these properties favour synchronous activity in CA1 networks.

                Reproducing high-acuity vision with an epiretinal implant will likely require inferring the natural light responses of diverse RGC types in the implanted retina, without measuring them directly. Here we demonstrate an approach that exploits intrinsic electrical features of primate RGCs. First, ON-parasol and OFF-parasol RGCs were identified with 95% accuracy using electrical features. Then, the somatic electrical footprint, predicted cell type, and average linear-nonlinear-Poisson model parameters of each cell type were used to infer a light response model for each cell. Across five retinas, these models achieved an average correlation with measured firing rates of 0.49 for white noise visual stimuli and 0.50 for natural scenes stimuli, compared to 0.65 and 0.58 respectively for models fitted to recorded light responses, an upper bound. This finding, and linear decoding of images from predicted RGC activity, suggested that the inference approach may be useful for high-fidelity sight restoration.

                The brain is a frustrated system that contains conflictual link arrangements named frustration. The frustration as a source of disorder prevents the system from settling into low energy states and provides flexibility for brain network organization. In this research, we tried to identify the pattern of frustration formation in the brain at the levels of region, connection, canonical network, and hemisphere. We found that frustration formation has not a uniform pattern. Some subcortical elements have an active role in frustration formation, despite many low contributed cortical elements. Frustrating connections are mostly between-network types and triadic frustrations are mainly formed between three regions from three distinct canonical networks. Although there were no significant differences between brain hemispheres. We also did not find any robust differences between the frustration formation patterns of various lifespan stages. Our results may be interesting for those who study the organization of brain links and promising for those who want to manipulate brain networks.

                To maintain balance during walking, the central nervous system must adjust the base of support (i.e., modulation of step length and step width) to the center of mass displacement in every step. We aimed to explore age and concurrent cognitive attention-demanding task effects on lower limb muscle fiber type recruitment in response to unexpected loss of balance during walking i.e., perturbation. Twenty young (YA) and 18 older adults (OA), (mean:27.00, SD:2.79 and mean:70.13, SD:3.95 years old, respectively) were exposed to unexpected perturbations, while walking on a treadmill, in virtual reality environment. Surface electromyography (sEMG) total spectral power for frequency bands associated with muscle fibers type I (40-60Hz), type IIa (60-150Hz) and type IIb (150-250Hz), from tibialis-anterior and vastus-lateralis muscles were analyzed. Four Generalized Estimating Equations models assessed age and cognitive attention-demanding task's load association with lower-limb muscle activation patterns resulting from perturbation in single- and double-support phases of the gait cycle. Results show that OA employ a muscle fiber type IIa dominant increase strategy while YA show muscle fiber type IIb dominant increase in muscle fiber type recruitment in response to unexpected perturbations during walking. This suggests that the ability to recruit fast-twitch muscle fibers is deteriorated with age and thus may be related to insufficient balance recovery response.

                Although spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease caused by the loss of survival of motor neuron proteins, there is growing evidence that lesions in nonmotor neuron cells are involved in SMA pathogenesis. Transcriptome alterations occurring at the single-cell level in SMA spinal cord are unknown. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of the spinal cord of a severe SMA mouse model, and characterized ten cell types as well as their differentially expressed genes. Using CellChat, we found that cellular communication between different cell types in the spinal cord of SMA mice is substantially reduced. A dimensionality reduction analysis revealed 29 cell subtypes and differentially expressed genes for each subtype. Among them, the most significant change in the SMA spinal cord at the single-cell level was observed in a subpopulation of vascular fibroblasts. This subpopulation was greatly reduced, which may be responsible for vascular defects in SMA mice and may lead to widespread reductions in protein synthesis and energy metabolism. This study is the first to report a single-cell atlas of the spinal cord of mice with severe SMA, providing new insights into SMA pathogenesis.

                Altruism is critical for cooperation and productivity in human societies, but is known to vary strongly across contexts and individuals. The origin of these differences is largely unknown, but may in principle reflect variations in different types of neurocognitive processes that temporally unfold during altruistic decision making (ranging from initial perceptual processing via value computations to final integrative choice mechanisms). Here, we address this question by examining altruistic choices in different inequality contexts with computational modeling and EEG. Our results show that across all contexts and individuals, wealth distribution choices recruit a similar late decision process evident in model-predicted evidence accumulation signals over parietal regions. Contextual and individual differences in behavior related instead to initial processing of stimulus-locked inequality-related value information in centroparietal and centrofrontal sensors, as well as to gamma-band synchronization of these value-related signals with parietal response-locked evidence-accumulation signals. Our findings suggest separable biological bases for individual and contextual differences in altruism and emphasize that these reflect differences in processing of choice-relevant information.

                Age-related cortical plasticity reveals insights into the mechanisms underlying the stability and flexibility of neuronal circuits. Classical parcellation has long demonstrated the importance of microstructural features yet 3D approaches have rarely been applied to human brain organization in-vivo. We acquired functional and structural 7T-MRI and behavioral data of living younger and older adults to investigate human primary motor cortex (M1) aging, employing 3D parcellation techniques. We identify distinct cortical fields in M1 based on quantitative tissue contrast, which are, along with the myelin-poor borders between them, stable with age. We also show age-related iron accumulation, particularly in the output layer 5b and the lower limb field. Our data offers a new model of human M1 with distinct cortical fields, a mechanistic explanation for the stability of topographic organization in the context of aging and plasticity, and highlights the specific vulnerability of output signal flows to cortical plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Defining specific cell states of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease by single-nucleus RNA sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disease with the impairment of movement execution that is related to age, genetic and environmental factors. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyri-dine (MPTP) is a neurotoxin widely used to induce PD models, but the effect of MPTP on cell-gene of PD has not been fully elucidated. By single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we uncovered the PD-specific cells and revealed remarkable changes in their cellular states, including astrocytosis, endothelial cells absence, as well as a cluster of PD-exclusive medium spiny neuron cells. Furthermore, trajectory analysis of astrocyte and endothelial cells populations predicted candidate target gene sets that might be associated with PD. Notably, the detailed regulatory roles of astrocyte-specific transcription factors Dbx2 and Sox13 in PD were first revealed in our work. Finally, we characterized the cell-cell communications of PD-specific cells and found that the overall communication strength was enhanced in PD compared with matched control, especially the signaling pathways of NRXN and NEGR. Our work provides comprehensive overview on the changes of cellular states of the MPTP-induced mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glycolysis-derived alanine from glia fuels neuronal mitochondria for memory in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain. However, it remains controversial whether, upon neuronal activation, glucose is primarily used by neurons for ATP production, or if it is partially oxidized in astrocytes, as proposed by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle model for glutamatergic neurons. Thus, an in vivo picture of glucose metabolism during cognitive processes is missing. Here, we uncover in Drosophila a glia-to-neuron alanine transfer that sustains memory formation. Following associative conditioning, glycolysis in glial cells produces alanine, which is back-converted into pyruvate in mushroom body cholinergic neurons to uphold their increased mitochondrial needs. Alanine, as a mediator of glia-neuron coupling, could be an alternative to lactate in cholinergic systems. In parallel, a dedicated glial glucose transporter imports glucose specifically for long-term memory, by directly transferring it to neurons for use by the pentose phosphate pathway. Our results demonstrate in vivo the compartmentalization of glucose metabolism between neurons and glial cells during memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early microglial response, myelin deterioration and lethality in mice deficient for very long chain ceramide synthesis in oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The sphingolipids galactosylceramide (GalCer), sulfatide (ST) and sphingomyelin (SM) are essential for myelin stability and function. GalCer and ST are synthesized mostly from C22-C24 ceramides, generated by Ceramide Synthase 2 (CerS2). To clarify the requirement for C22-C24 sphingolipid synthesis in myelin lipid biosynthesis and stability, we generated mice lacking CerS2 specifically in myelinating cells (CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O). At 6 weeks of age, normal-appearing myelin had formed in CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice, however there was a reduction in myelin thickness and the percentage of myelinated axons. Pronounced loss of C22-C24 sphingolipids in myelin of CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice was compensated by greatly increased levels of C18 sphingolipids. A distinct microglial population expressing high levels of activation and phagocytic markers such as CD64, CD11c, MHC class II, and CD68 was apparent at 6 weeks of age in CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice, and had increased by 10 weeks. Increased staining for denatured myelin basic protein was also apparent in 6-week-old CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice. By 16 weeks, CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice showed pronounced myelin atrophy, motor deficits, and axon beading, a hallmark of axon stress. 90% of CerS2{Delta}O/{Delta}O mice died between 16 and 26 weeks of age. This study highlights the importance of sphingolipid acyl chain length for the structural integrity of myelin, demonstrating how a modest reduction in lipid chain length causes exposure of a denatured myelin protein epitope and expansion of phagocytic microglia, followed by axon pathology, myelin degeneration, and motor deficits. Understanding the molecular trigger for microglial activation should aid the development of therapeutics for demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases.

	<p>There have been increasing reports of Guillain&amp;amp;ndash;Barr&amp;amp;eacute; syndrome (GBS), a rare but debilitating neurological disease, occurring post-COVID-19 vaccination. However, the outcomes and relationships between patient demographics and clinical outcomes of post-COVID-19 vaccination GBS remain unclear. To bridge this gap, our study investigates the outcomes and clinical factors associated with poorer GBS outcomes following COVID-19 vaccination. We conducted a review and pooled analysis of detailed data extracted from 57 published cases with the relevant search strategies and criteria. The groups compared included male versus female patients, 1st dose versus 2nd dose and early onset versus late onset of GBS. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to compare the vaccine type, clinical severity and post-treatment outcomes between these groups of patients. Our results highlight for the first time that females were significantly more likely to have severe clinical presentation and poorer outcomes compared to males. Additionally, viral vector vaccines were the predominant vaccine type administered in early-onset post-COVID-19-vaccination GBS and GBS occurring after the 1st vaccination dose. It was also shown that reported cases of post-vaccination GBS generally displayed a positive response to conventional treatment and had favourable post-treatment outcomes. Through this study, we have established important links and provided assuring evidence for treatment response and post-treatment outcomes of GBS occurring post-COVID-19 vaccination. While the COVID-19 vaccination brings about much greater benefits than risks, our findings provide further impetus for greater vigilance in certain patient groups and more studies to explore the mechanisms behind these links.</p>

	<p>Gliomas make up nearly 40% of all central nervous system tumors, with over 50% of those being high-grade gliomas. Emerging data suggests that electrophysiologic events in the peri-tumoral region may play a role in the behavior and progression of high-grade gliomas. While seizures in the peri-tumoral zone are well described, much larger and slowly propagating waves of spreading depolarization (SD) may potentially have roles in both non-epileptic transient neurologic deficits and tumor progression. SD has only recently been observed in pre-clinical glioma models and it is not known whether these events occur clinically. We present a case of SD occurring in a human high-grade glioma using gold-standard subdural DC ECoG recordings. This finding could have meaningful implications for both clinical symptomatology and potentially for disease progression in these patients. Our observations and hypotheses are based on analogy with a large body of evidence in stroke and acute neurological injury that have recently established SD as cause of transient neurological deficits as well as a fundamental mechanism of ischemic expansion. Whether SD could represent a mechanistic target in this process to limit such progression is a high priority for further clinical investigations.</p>

	<p>The microbiota-gut-brain axis has attracted significant attention with respect to studying the mechanisms of brain aging; however, the specific connection between gut microbiota and aging remains unclear. The abnormal expression and mutation of proteins belonging to the P4-ATPase family, including Atp11b, results in a variety of neurological diseases. The results of our analysis demonstrate that there was a shift in the abundance of certain gut microbiota in Atp11b-knockout (KO) mice. Specifically, there was an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria that accelerate aging and a decrease in probiotics that delay aging. Consequently, an enhanced oxidative stress response was observed, which was characterized by a reduction in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In addition, our data demonstrate that there was a decrease in the number of cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus, and aggravation of aging-related pathological features such as senescence &amp;amp;beta;-galactosidase (SA-&amp;amp;beta;-Gal), p-HistoneH2AX (Ser139), and p16INK4. Moreover, KO mice show typical aging-associated behavior, such as memory impairment and slow pain perception. Taken together, we demonstrate a possible mechanism of aging induced by gut microbiota in Atp11b-KO mice, which provides a novel perspective for the treatment of aging through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.</p>

	<p>There exist extensive animal research and lesion studies in humans demonstrating a tight association between the hypothalamus and socioemotional behavior. However, human neuroimaging literature in this direction is still rather limited. In order to reexamine the functional role of this region in regulating human social behavior, we here provided a synthesis of neuroimaging studies showing hypothalamic activation during affiliative, cooperative interactions, and in relation to ticklish laughter and humor. In addition, studies reporting involvement of the hypothalamus during aggressive and antisocial interactions were also considered. Our systematic review revealed a growing number of investigations demonstrating that the evolutionary conserved hypothalamic neural circuity is involved in multiple and diverse aspects of human socioemotional behavior. On the basis of the observed heterogeneity of hypothalamus-mediated socioemotional responses, we concluded that the hypothalamus might play an extended functional role for species survival and preservation, ranging from exploratory and approaching behaviors promoting social interactions to aggressive and avoidance responses protecting and defending the established social bonds.</p>

	<p>It is well known that inflammation is crucial in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic central nervous system (CNS) injuries, and that microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) play a pivotal role in neuroinflammation. Therefore, the exploration of molecular signaling pathways that are involved in the microglia/macrophage response might help us to shed light on their eventual therapeutic modulation. Interestingly, there is growing evidence showing that the Wnt family of proteins is involved in different neuropathologies that are characterized by a dysregulated neuroinflammatory response, including spinal cord injury (SCI). Here, we aimed to validate a methodology with competence to assess the physiologically relevant Wnt expression patterns of active microglia and MDMs in a rat model of SCI. For that purpose, we have selected and adapted an in vitro system of primary microglia culture that were stimulated with a lesioned spinal cord extract (SCE), together with an ex vivo protocol of flow cytometry sorting of rat microglia/MDMs at different time-points after contusive SCI. Our study demonstrates that the expression profile of Wnt-related genes in microglia/MDM cells exhibit important differences between these particular scenarios which would be in line with previous studies where similar discrepancies have been described for other molecules. Moreover, our results provide for a first experimental report of the Wnt transcriptome in rat microglia and MDMs after SCI which, together with the research platform that was used in the study, and considering its limitations, we expect might contribute to foster the research on Wnt-driven immunomodulatory therapies.</p>

	<p>Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a common facial neuropathic pain that is mainly characterized by spontaneous or induced needling or electric shock pain in the innervation area of the trigeminal nerve. It is also referred to as &amp;amp;ldquo;the cancer that never dies&amp;amp;rdquo;. The olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) is a special glial cell in the nervous system that has a strong supportive function in nerve regeneration. Cell transplantation therapy is a useful treatment modality that we believe can be applied in TN management. In this study, OECs were transplanted into the ligation site of the infraorbital nerve of rats. We found that after the OEC transplantation, mechanical pain threshold in the face of the rats was significantly increased. Western blotting, immunofluorescence assay, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed on the trigeminal ganglia (TG) of model rats. The results revealed a decrease in the expression of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in the trigeminal ganglia. Our findings show that OEC transplantation has a good therapeutic effect on TN in rats, and that can reduce the expression of P2X7R in trigeminal ganglia. Therefore, we think that OEC transplantation may be a suitable treatment for TN.</p>

	<p>We present a rare case of intracranial solitary plasmacytoma arising in brain parenchyma in the basal nuclei. Clinical management and autopsy results of the case are described. Background: Intracranial plasmacytomas arising from brain parenchyma are extremely rare, and data from the literature are limited. Primary intracranial plasmacytomas are rare because plasma cells are not found in the brain in normal conditions. Commonly, intracranial plasmacytoma is associated with multiple myeloma, which is why multiple myeloma must be ruled out to diagnose solitary intracranial plasmacytoma. Considering that solitary plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma have some histopathological similarities, it is important to differentiate them because their respective treatments and prognoses are different. Imaging features of primary extramedullary plasmacytoma are nonspecific but are compatible with solid tumors with invariable enhancement. Plasmacytoma was aggressive because it was not diagnosed after the first MRI, but 1.5 months later, MRI showed a large object. We present a rare case of intracranial solitary plasmacytoma arising in brain parenchyma in the basal nuclei.</p>

	<p>The Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by a difficulty in expressing and interpreting others&amp;amp;rsquo; emotions. In particular, people with ASD have difficulties when interpreting emotions encoded in facial expressions. In the past, music interventions have been shown to improve autistic individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; emotional and social skills. The present study describes a pilot study to explore the usefulness of music as a tool for improving autistic children&amp;amp;rsquo;s emotion recognition in facial expressions. Twenty-five children (mean age = 8.8 y, SD = 1.24) with high-functioning ASD and normal hearing participated in the study consisting of four weekly sessions of 15 min each. Fifteen participants were randomly divided into an experimental group (N = 14) and a control group (N = 11). During each session, participants in the experimental group were exposed to images of facial expressions for four emotions (happy, sad, angry, and fear). Images were shown in three conditions, with the second condition consisting of music of congruent emotion with the shown images. Participants in the control group were shown only images in all three conditions. For six participants in each group, EEG data were acquired during the sessions, and instantaneous emotional responses (arousal and valence values) were extracted from the EEG data. Inter- and intra-session emotion identification improvement was measured in terms of verbal response accuracy, and EEG response differences were analyzed. A comparison of the verbal responses of the experimental group pre- and post-intervention showed a significant (p = 0.001) average improvement in emotion identification accuracy responses of 26% (SD = 3.4). Furthermore, emotional responses of the experimental group at the end of the study showed a higher correlation with the emotional stimuli being presented, compared with their emotional responses at the beginning of the study. No similar verbal responses improvement or EEG-stimuli correlation was found in the control group. These results seem to indicate that music can be used to improve both emotion identification in facial expressions and emotion induction through facial stimuli in children with high-functioning ASD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connecting Covert Attention and Visual Perception to the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Alpha Band Activity, Cross-Frequency Coupling (CFC), and Functional Connectivity using Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA)</a></h4>

              
                Some evidence suggests that alpha activity is directly related to the baseline firing rate of sensory neurons which alters the probability of responding to a stimulus. Other evidence points to alpha indirectly modulating cortical excitability through its interactions with gamma oscillations. A third possibility is that alpha-based functional connectivity better explains attentional modulation and perceptual responses. To test this, alpha amplitude, CFC, and functional connectivity measures were extracted from EEG data recorded while participants performed a cued orientation perception task. Using pre-target data, the spatiotemporal activity of each metric was submitted to a SVM classifier to determine which activity pattern best distinguished trials with covert attention from trials without. The same metrics were submitted to SVR to find the activity that best predicted task performance. Results indicate the best metric for classifying trials with and without covert attention was alpha amplitude. This indicates that, prior to target onset, alpha amplitude alone is most sensitive to the presence of covert attention. In contrast, none of the metrics were strong predictors of task performance. Overall, our results support the idea that alpha activity is directly related to changes in the baseline firing rate of sensory neurons which changes responsiveness but not performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peripheral ghrelin administration prevents the behavioral effects of restraint stress in mice: possible implication of PVNCRH neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Ghrelin is a gut-derived hormone that is secreted during conditions of negative caloric balance and acts as a key modulator of feeding, increasing food intake and affecting several physiological systems such as metabolism, behavior and the control of endocrine and autonomic functions. Previous studies showed that ghrelin participates in the stress response, acting on hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PVNCRH neurons). In the present study, we investigated the effects of ghrelin administration on the behavioral responses to restraint stress in mice. In their homecage, C57Bl6 mice in basal conditions expressed the behaviors of surveying, walking, rearing, grooming and, to a lesser extent, digging, climbing and freezing. Restraint stress increased the time spent in grooming without significant changes in other behaviors. Ghrelin administration did not affect behavior in control mice, but it reversed the effect of restraint stress on grooming. Chemogenetic activation of PVNCRH neurons by clozapine N-Oxide (CNO) administration in hM3Dq DREADD mice increased grooming, while ghrelin mitigated this effect. In addition, CNO administration decreased walking and rearing, both in the presence or absence of ghrelin. Food intake was increased by ghrelin administration, however, it was not affected by stress or CNO. These results indicate that ghrelin decreases the activity of PVNCRH neurons, partially preventing the behavioral effects of restraint stress. The inhibitory input to PVNCRH neurons probably arrives from other nuclei, since GABAergic neurons were not identified in the PVN neurons of these mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing social: A neural signature for conscious perception of social interactions</a></h4>

              
                Percepts of ambiguous information are subjective and depend on observers traits and mental states. Social information is some of the most ambiguous content we encounter in our daily lives, yet in experimental contexts, percepts of social interactions--i.e., whether an interaction is present and if so, the nature of that interaction--are often dichotomized as correct or incorrect based on experimenter-assigned labels. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of conscious social perception using a large dataset in which neurotypical individuals viewed animations of geometric shapes during fMRI and indicated whether they perceived a social interaction or random motion. Critically, rather than experimenter-assigned labels, we used observers own reports of "Social" or "Non-social" to classify percepts and characterize brain activity, including leveraging a particularly ambiguous animation perceived as "Social" by some observers but "Non-social" by others to control for visual input. Observers were biased toward perceiving information as social (versus non-social), and activity across much of the brain was higher during animations ultimately perceived as social. Using "Unsure" reports, we identified several regions that responded parametrically to perceived socialness. Neural responses to social versus nonsocial content diverged early both in time and in the cortical hierarchy. Lastly, individuals with higher internalizing trait scores showed both a higher response bias towards social and an inverse relationship with activity in default-mode and limbic regions while scanning for social information. Findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of using observer reports to study percepts of social interactions.

Significance StatementSimple animations involving two or more geometric shapes have been used as a gold standard to understand social cognition and impairments thereof. Yet experimenter-assigned labels of what is social versus non-social are frequently used as a ground truth, despite the fact that percepts of such ambiguous social stimuli are highly subjective. Here, we used behavioral and fMRI data from a large sample of neurotypical individuals to show that participants responses reveal subtle behavioral biases, help us study neural responses to social content more precisely, and covary with internalizing trait scores. Our findings underscore the subjective nature of social perception and the importance of considering observer reports in studying its behavioral and neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The encoding of touch by somatotopically aligned dorsal column subdivisions</a></h4>

              
                The somatosensory system decodes a range of tactile stimuli to generate a coherent sense of touch. Discriminative touch of the body depends on signals conveyed from peripheral mechanoreceptors to the brain via the spinal cord dorsal column and its brainstem target the dorsal column nuclei (DCN). Models of somatosensation emphasize that fast-conducting low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) innervating the skin drive the DCN. However, post-synaptic dorsal column neurons (PSDCs) within the spinal cord dorsal horn also collect mechanoreceptor signals and form a second major input to the DCN. The significance of PSDCs and their contributions to the coding of touch have remained unclear since their discovery. Here, we show that direct LTMR inputs to the DCN convey vibrotactile stimuli with high temporal precision, whereas PSDCs primarily encode touch onset and the intensity of sustained contact into the high force range. LTMR and PSDC signals topographically re-align in the DCN to preserve precise spatial detail. Different DCN neuron subtypes have specialized responses that are generated by unique combinations of LTMR and PSDC inputs. Thus, signals encoding different tactile features are conveyed by subdivisions of the dorsal column pathway and differentially converge in the DCN to generate unique ascending signals suited to distinct sensory processing streams.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A developmental pathway for epithelial-to-motoneuron transformation in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Motoneurons and motoneuron-like pancreatic beta cells arise from radial glia and ductal cells, both tube-lining progenitors that share molecular regulators. To uncover programs underlying motoneuron formation, we studied a similar, cell-division-independent transformation of the C. elegans tube-lining Y cell into the PDA motoneuron. We find that lin-12/Notch acts through ngn-1/Ngn and its regulator hlh-16/Olig to control transformation timing. lin-12 loss blocks transformation, while lin-12(gf) promotes precocious PDA formation. Early basal expression of both ngn-1/Ngn and hlh-16/Olig depends on sem-4/Sall and egl-5/Hox. Later, coincident with Y-cell morphological changes, ngn-1/Ngn expression is upregulated in a sem-4/Sall and egl-5/Hox-dependent but hlh-16/Olig-independent manner. Subsequently, Y-cell retrograde extension forms an anchored process priming PDA axon extension. Extension requires ngn-1-dependent expression of the cytoskeleton organizers UNC-119, UNC-44/ANK, and UNC-33/CRMP, which also, unexpectedly, activate PDA terminal-gene expression. Our findings reveal key cell-division-independent regulatory events leading to motoneuron generation, suggesting a conserved pathway for epithelial-to-motoneuron/motoneuron-like differentiation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption of place cell remapping by scopolamine during aversive learning</a></h4>

              
                We performed in-vivo calcium imaging of hippocampal place cells in freely behaving rats (n=14) to investigate whether the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist scopolamine, which is known to impair aversive learning, also disrupts place cell remapping that occurs during such learning. CA1 neurons were imaged using a large-field-of view version of the UCLA miniscope (MiniLFOV) while rats performed a shock avoidance task on a rectangular maze. Drug-free avoidance training and extinction caused place cells to remap near the shocked location, in accordance with prior studies. Systemic pre-training injections of scopolamine (1 mg/kg) did not impair immediate shock avoidance, and also did not disrupt spatial tuning properties or shock-evoked responses of place cells during training. However, the drug impaired 48 h retention of avoidance and also prevented place cells from remapping near the shocked location. In addition, when rats navigated the maze on scopolamine, CA1 population vectors showed degraded between-session similarity with drug-free maze visits on prior days, suggesting that mAChR antagonism acutely degraded the fidelity with which stored hippocampal representations were retrieved. Based upon these results, we propose that scopolamine causes amnesia by degrading the dynamics of hippocampal memory retrieval at the population level, thereby shielding stored memory representations from being modified by experience to encode new memories of events that occur under the influence of the drug.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Dynamics of Interoceptive Attention and Awareness: A Within-Participant fMRI Study</a></h4>

              
                Interoception, the representation of the body's internal state, serves as a foundation for emotion, motivation, and wellbeing. Yet despite its centrality in human experience, the neural mechanisms of interoception are poorly understood. The Interoceptive/Exteroceptive Attention Task (IEAT) is a novel neuroimaging paradigm that compares behavioral tracking of the respiratory cycle (Active Interoception) to tracking of a visual stimulus (Active Exteroception). Twenty-two healthy participants attended two separate scanning sessions (N=44 scans) during a randomized control trial of Mindful Awareness in Body-oriented Therapy (MABT). Compared to Active Exteroception, Active Interoception led to widespread cortical deactivation. Greater self-reported interoceptive awareness (MAIA scale) predicted sparing from deactivation along the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left lateral prefrontal cortex. The right insula- typically described as a primary interoceptive cortex- was only specifically implicated by its deactivation during a paced respiration condition (Active Matching), relative to both Active Exteroception and Interoception. Instead, psychophysiological interaction analysis characterized Active Interoception as promoting greater ACC connectivity with lateral frontal and parietal regions commonly referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network. By comparing attention between highly accessible interoceptive and exteroceptive stimuli, these findings recast interoceptive attention as broadly inhibitory, linking greater interoceptive awareness to spared cortical inhibition within well-characterized attentional networks. In contrast to a literature that relates detection of liminal signals such as the heartbeat to anterior insula activity, attention towards accessible body sensations such as the breath may lead to a context of cortical inhibition in which sensory signals from the body may be better discerned.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Surrounding Traffic Matters: Increases in Traffic Volume Are Related to Changes in EEG Rhythms in Urban Cyclists.</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we used an oddball EEG bicycle paradigm to study how changes in urban environments elicit changes in EEG markers. Participants completed an auditory oddball task while riding in three different cycling lane environments. A low traffic condition where participants rode in a fully separated bike lane alongside a quiet residential street, an intermediate traffic condition where participants rode alongside a busy residential street in a painted lane, and a heavy traffic condition where participants rode alongside fast/heavy traffic on a shared-use path. Relative to the low traffic, heavy traffic was associated with faster reaction time and a trend towards reduced accuracy, and increased N1 amplitude evoked by the standard tones. We attribute this difference in N1 amplitude to different attentional demands evoked by the different traffic conditions. In this fashion, heavy traffic requires greater auditory filtering. Furthermore, we found no differences in P3 amplitude associated with the traffic conditions. We discuss the implications of mobile paradigms to study attention in real-world settings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transmembrane protein 184B (TMEM184B) promotes expression of synaptic gene networks in the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimers Disease (AD) and other dementias, hippocampal synaptic dysfunction and loss contribute to the progression of memory impairment. Recent analysis of human AD transcriptomes has provided a list of gene candidates that may serve as drivers of disease. One such candidate is the membrane protein TMEM184B. To evaluate whether TMEM184B contributes to neurological impairment, we asked whether loss of TMEM184B in mice causes gene expression or behavior alterations, focusing on the hippocampus. Because one major risk factor for AD is age, we compared young adult (5-month-old) and aged (15-month-old) wild type and Tmem184b-mutant mice to assess the dual contributions of age and genotype. TMEM184B loss altered expression of pre- and post-synaptic transcripts by 5 months and continued through 15 months, specifically affecting genes involved in synapse assembly and neural development. Wnt-activated enhancer elements were enriched among differentially expressed genes, suggesting an intersection with this pathway. Few differences existed between young adult and aged mutants, suggesting that transcriptional effects of TMEM184B loss are relatively constant. To understand how TMEM184B disruption may impact behaviors, we evaluated memory using the novel object recognition test and anxiety using the elevated plus maze. Young adult Tmem184b-mutant mice show normal object discrimination, suggesting a lack of memory impairment at this age. However, mutant mice showed decreased anxiety, a phenotype seen in neurodevelopmental disorders. Taken together, our data suggest that TMEM184B is required for proper synaptic gene expression and function but may not be causal for AD and related dementias.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gcm: a novel anti-inflammatory transcriptional cascade conserved from flies to humans</a></h4>

              
                Innate immunity is an ancestral process that can induce pro- and anti-inflammatory states. A major challenge is to characterise the transcriptional cascades that modulate the response to chronic and acute inflammatory challenges. The Drosophila melanogaster Gcm transcription factor represents an interesting candidate for its potential anti-inflammatory role. Here we explore its evolutionary conservation and its mode of action. We found that the murine ortholog Gcm2 (mGcm2) is expressed upon aging, which is considered as a state of chronic inflammation. mGcm2 is found in a subpopulation of microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Its expression is also induced by a lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced CNS demyelination (acute inflammation) and mGcm2 conditional knock out mice show an increased inflammatory phenotype upon aging or LPC injection. In agreement with the role of this transcriptional cascade in inflammation, the human ortholog hGCM2 is expressed in active demyelinating lesions of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Finally, Drosophila gcm expression is induced upon aging as well as during an acute inflammatory response and its overexpression decreases the inflammatory phenotype. Altogether, our data show that the inducible Gcm pathway is highly conserved from flies up to humans and represents a potential therapeutic anti-inflammatory target in the control of the inflammatory response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prominent astrocytic alpha-synuclein pathology with unique post-translational modification signatures unveiled across Lewy body disorders</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a pre-synaptic monomeric protein that can form aggregates in neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and in oligodendrocytes in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Although the accumulation of aSyn in astrocytes has previously been described in PD, PDD and DLB, the biochemical properties of aSyn in this type of pathology and its topographical distribution have not been studied in detail. Here, we present a systematic investigation of aSyn astrocytic pathology, using an expanded toolset of antibodies covering the entire sequence and known post-translational modifications (PTMs) of aSyn in Lewy body (LB) disorders, including sporadic PD, PDD, DLB, familial PD with SNCA G51D mutation and SNCA duplication, and in MSA. Astrocytic aSyn was mainly detected in the limbic cortical regions of LB disorders, but were absent in key pathological regions of MSA. These astrocytic aSyn accumulations were detected only with aSyn antibodies against the mid N-terminal and non-amyloid component (NAC) regions covering aSyn residues 34-99. The astroglial accumulations were negative to canonical aSyn aggregation markers, including p62, ubiquitin and aSyn pS129, but positive for phosphorylated and nitrated forms of aSyn at Tyrosine 39 (Y39), and mostly not resistant to proteinase K. Our findings suggest that astrocytic aSyn accumulations are a major part of aSyn pathology in LB disorders, and possess a distinct sequence and PTM signature that is characterized by both N- and C-terminal truncations and modifications at Y39. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of aSyn accumulation made solely from N- and C-terminally cleaved aSyn species and the first report demonstrating that astrocytic aSyn exists as a mixture of Y39 phosphorylated and nitrated species. These observations underscore the critical importance of systematic characterization of aSyn accumulation in different cell types as a necessary step to capturing the diversity of aSyn species and pathology in the brain. Our findings combined with further studies on the role of astrocytic pathology in the progression of LB disorders can pave the way towards identifying novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plasticity-induced actin polymerization in the dendritic shaft regulates intracellular AMPA receptor trafficking</a></h4>

              
                AMPA-type receptors (AMPARs) are rapidly inserted into synapses undergoing long-term potentiation (LTP) to increase synaptic transmission, but how AMPAR-containing vesicles are selectively trafficked to these synapses during LTP is not known. Here we developed a strategy to label AMPAR GluA1 subunits expressed from the endogenous loci of rat hippocampal neurons such that the motion of GluA1-containing vesicles in time-lapse sequences can be characterized using single-particle tracking and mathematical modeling. We find that GluA1-containing vesicles are confined and concentrated near sites of stimulation-induced plasticity. We show that confinement is mediated by actin polymerization, which hinders the active transport of GluA1-containing vesicles along the length of the dendritic shaft by modulating the rheological properties of the cytoplasm. Actin polymerization also facilitates myosin-mediated transport of GluA1-containing vesicles to exocytic sites. We conclude that neurons utilize F-actin to increase vesicular GluA1 reservoirs and promote exocytosis proximal to the sites of neuronal activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Syntaxin1 Ser14 Phosphorylation is Required for Non-Vesicular Dopamine Release</a></h4>

              
                Amphetamine (AMPH), a psychostimulant commonly prescribed for the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, has a high liability for abuse. The abuse and psychomotor stimulant properties of AMPH are primarily associated with its ability to increase dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. This increase is mediated, in large part, by non-vesicular DA release (DA efflux). DA efflux is the result of reversal of the DA transporter (DAT) promoted by AMPH. Syntaxin 1 (Stx1) is a SNARE protein that plays a pivotal role in vesicular release. Previously, we have shown that Stx1 also interacts with the distal DAT N-terminus, an event promoted by AMPH. Stx1 is phosphorylated at Ser14 by casein kinase II (CK2). Using Drosophila Melanogaster as an animal model, we show that this phosphorylation event is critical for non-vesicular DA release and regulates the expression of AMPH preference as well as the ability of AMPH to promote mating drive. We also show that reverse transport of DA mediated by DAT underlies these complex behaviors promoted by AMPH. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the phosphorylated DAT/Stx1 complex demonstrate that the phosphorylation state of these proteins plays a key role in allowing DAT to dwell in an efflux-willing state. This state also supports constitutive DA efflux (CDE), an event that occurs in the absence of AMPH. The DAT-Stx1 phosphorylated complex is characterized by the breakdown of two key salt bridges in DAT, K66-D345 and E428-R445, which are critical for the formation of the intracellular (IC) gate and for transport function. The breaking of these salt bridges leads to an opening and hydration of the DAT intracellular vestibule, allowing DA to bind from the cytosol, a mechanism that we hypothesize leads to CDE. We further determine the importance of Stx1 phosphorylation in CDE by pharmacologically inhibiting CK2 with CX-4945, a molecule currently in phase II clinical trials for cancer treatment. CX-4945 treatment prevented the expression of CDE in isolated Drosophila Melanogaster brains as well as behaviors associated with CDE. Thus, our results suggest that Stx1 phosphorylation is a possible pharmacological target for the treatment of AMPH abuse.

                Sensory neurons gather information about mechanical forces from both the environment and internal organs to regulate physiology. PIEZO2 is a mechanosensory ion channel critical for touch, proprioception and bladder stretch sensation, yet its broad expression in sensory neurons and elsewhere suggests it may have undiscovered physiological roles. To fully understand mechanosensory physiology, we must know where and when PIEZO2-expressing neurons detect force. The fluorescent styryl dye FM 1-43 was shown to permeate several ion channels in cell culture and label sensory neurons. Surprisingly, we find that the vast majority of FM 1-43 somatosensory neuron labeling in vivo is dependent on PIEZO2-activity within nerve endings. We illustrate the potential of FM 1-43 by using it to identify novel Piezo2-expressing urethral neurons that are engaged by urination. These data reveal that FM 1-43 is a functional probe for mechanosensitivity via PIEZO2 activation in vivo and will facilitate the characterization of known and novel mechanosensory processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Seeing and Extrapolating motion trajectories share common informative activation patterns in primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The natural environment is dynamic and moving objects become constantly occluded, engaging the brain in a challenging completion process to estimate where and when the object might reappear. Although motion extrapolation is critical in daily life - imagine crossing the street while an approaching car is occluded by a larger standing vehicle - its neural underpinnings are still not well understood. While the engagement of low-level visual cortex during dynamic occlusion has been postulated, most of the previous group-level fMRI-studies failed to find evidence for an involvement of low-level visual areas during occlusion. In this fMRI-study, we therefore used individually-defined retinotopic maps and multivariate pattern analysis to characterize the neural basis of visible and occluded motion in humans. To this end, participants learned velocity-direction pairings (slow motion-upwards; fast motion-downwards or vice versa) during a training phase without occlusion and judged the stimulus direction, based on its velocity, during a following test phase with occlusion. We find that occluded motion direction can be predicted from the activity patterns during visible motion within low-level visual areas, supporting the notion of a mental representation of motion trajectory in these regions during occlusion.

Highlights* Dynamically occluded information is processed in low-level visual cortex
* Specific regions inside low-level visual areas encode visible and dynamically occluded information
* Overlap of visible and occluded informative activity patterns in the visual field suggest shared computational circuits in primary visual cortex

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional imaging and quantification of multi-neuronal olfactory responses in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Many animals perceive odorant molecules by collecting information from ensembles of olfactory neurons. These neurons employ receptors that are tuned to recognize odorant molecules by chemical binding affinity. Olfactory systems are able, in principle, to detect and discriminate large numbers of odorants by using combinatorial coding strategies. Multineuronal imaging, combined with high-throughput stimulus delivery, allow for the comprehensive measurement of ensemble-level sensory representations. Here, we used microfluidics and multineuronal imaging to study olfactory representations at the sensory periphery of the nematode C. elegans. The collective activity of chemosensory neurons in C. elegans reveals high-dimensional representations of olfactory information across a broad space of odorant molecules. We reveal diverse tuning properties and dose-response curves across chemosensory neurons and across odorant molecules. We describe the unique contribution of each sensory neuron to an ensemble-level olfactory code, and show how the encoding of a set of natural stimuli, nematode pheromones, differs from the encoding of small volatile organic molecules. The integrated activity of the sensory periphery of C. elegans contains sufficient information to robustly encode the intensity and identity of a broad panel of odorants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Orientation control strategies and adaptation to a visuomotor perturbation in rotational hand movements</a></h4>

              
                Computational approaches to biological motor control are used to discover the building blocks of human motor behavior. Models explaining features of human hand movements have been studied thoroughly, yet only a few studies attempted to explain the control of the orientation of the hand; instead, they mainly focus on the control of hand translation, predominantly in a single plane. In this study, we aimed to establish a basic understanding of the way humans control the orientation of their hands. We developed a quaternion-based score that quantifies the geodicity of rotational hand movements and evaluated it experimentally. In the first experiment participants performed a simple orientation-matching task with a robotic manipulator. We found that rotations are generally performed by following a geodesic in the quaternion hypersphere, which suggests that, similarly to translation, the orientation of the hand is centrally controlled. We also established a baseline for the study of human response to perturbed visual feedback of the orientation of the hand. In the subsequent second experiment we studied the adaptation of participants to visuomotor rotation that is applied on the hand's rotation, and the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation. We observed partial adaptation to the perturbation. The patterns of the transfer of the adaptation to a different initial orientation were consistent with the representation of the orientation in extrinsic coordinates. The results of the two experiments raise questions regarding the nature of central control of hand orientation. Discussion and intuitions from these results can be of benefit for many applications that involve fine manipulation of rigid bodies, such as teleoperation and neurorehabilitation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Response of sleep slow oscillations to acoustic stimulation is evidenced by distinctive synchronization processes</a></h4>

              
                Closed loop acoustic stimulation (CLAS) during sleep has shown to boost slow wave (SW) amplitude and spindle power. Moreover, sleep SW are suggested to be classified based on different processes of neuronal synchronization. Following this, different types of SW events may have distinct functional roles and be differentially affected by external stimuli. However, the SW synchronization processes affected by CLAS are not well understood. Here, we studied the effect of CLAS on the dissociation of SW events based on two features of neuronal synchronization in the EEG (topological spread and wave slope). We evaluated and classified individual SW events of fourteen healthy subjects during a CLAS stimulated (STM) and a control night (CNT). Three main categories of SW events were found denoting (C1) steep-slope SW with global spread, (C2) flat-slope waves with localized spread and homeostatic regulation, and (C3) multipeaked flat-slope events with global spread. Comparing between conditions, we found a consistent increase of event proportion and trough amplitudes for C1 events during the time of stimulation. Furthermore, we found similar increases in post-stimulus spectral power in {theta}, {beta} and {sigma} frequencies for CNT vs STIM condition independently of sleep stage or SW categories. However, topological analysis showed differentiated spatial dynamics in N2 and N3 for SW categories and the co-occurrence with spindle events. Our findings reveal the nature of post-stimulus SW and suggest that CLAS boosts SW amplitudes by increasing neuronal synchronization of wave troughs, leading thus the post-stimulus SW-spindle co-occurrence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Secretin modulates appetite via brown adipose tissue - brain axis</a></h4>

              
                Secretin activates brown adipose tissue (BAT) and induces satiation in both mice and humans. However, the exact brain mechanism of this satiety inducing, secretin-mediated gut-BAT-brain axis is unknown. In this placebo-controlled, single-blinded neuroimaging study, firstly using [18F]FDG-PET measures (n = 15), we established that secretin modulated brain glucose consumption through the BAT-brain axis. Predominantly, we found that BAT and caudate glucose uptake levels were negatively correlated (r = -0.54, p = 0.037) during secretin but not placebo condition. Then, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 14), we found that secretin down-regulated the brain response to appetizing food images and improved inhibitory control. Finally, in a PET-fMRI fusion analysis (n = 10), we disclosed the patterned correspondence between caudate glucose uptake and neuroactivity to reward and inhibition, showing that the secretin-induced neurometabolic coupling pattern promoted satiation. These findings suggest that secretin modulates the BAT-brain metabolic crosstalk and subsequent neurometabolic coupling to induce satiation, bearing potential clinical benefits for treating eating disorders.

Significance of the studySecretin activates brown adipose tissue and induces satiation, but the underlying brain mechanisms are still unclear. This placebo-controlled PET-fMRI study uses brain metabolic and BOLD measures to dissect the modulatory effects of secretin on brain functions associative to satiation. Findings show that secretin i) modulates caudate glucose metabolism via the BAT-brain axis, ii) enhances BOLD response in inhibitory control, and iii) reduces reward-related BOLD response. Further evidence shows that these measured effects are tightly linked via the secretin-mediated brain neurometabolic coupling. This study significantly advances our knowledge on how secretin leads to satiation and highlights the potential role of secretin in treating eating disorders and obesity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gaze onsets during naturalistic infant-caregiver interaction associate with 'sender' but not 'receiver' neural responses, and do not lead to changes in inter-brain synchrony.</a></h4>

              
                Temporal coordination during infant-caregiver social interaction is thought to be crucial for supporting early language acquisition and cognitive development. Despite a growing prevalence of theories suggesting that increased inter-brain synchrony associates with many key aspects of social interactions such as mutual gaze, little is known about how this arises during development. Here, we investigated the role of mutual gaze onsets as a potential driver of inter-brain synchrony. We extracted dual EEG activity around naturally occurring gaze onsets during infant-caregiver social interactions in N=55 dyads (mean age 12 months). We differentiated between two types of gaze onset, depending on each partners role.  Sender gaze onsets were defined at a time when either the adult or the infant made a gaze shift towards their partner at a time when their partner was either already looking at them (mutual) or not looking at them (non-mutual).  Receiver gaze onsets were defined at a time when their partner made a gaze shift towards them at a time when either the adult or the infant was already looking at their partner (mutual) or not (non-mutual). Contrary to our hypothesis we found that, during a naturalistic interaction, both mutual and non-mutual gaze onsets were associated with changes in the sender, but not the receivers brain activity and were not associated with increases in inter-brain synchrony above baseline. Further, we found that mutual, compared to non-mutual gaze onsets were not associated with increased inter brain synchrony. Overall, our results suggest that the effects of mutual gaze are strongest at the intra-brain level, in the  sender but not the  receiver of the mutual gaze.

                There are often sudden changes in the state of environment. For a decision maker, accurate prediction and detection of change points are crucial for optimizing performance. Still unclear, however, is whether rodents are simply reactive to reinforcements, or if they can be proactive to estimate future change points during value-based decision making. In this study, we characterize head-fixed mice performing a two-armed bandit task with probabilistic reward reversals. Choice behavior deviates from classic reinforcement learning, but instead suggests a strategy involving belief updating, consistent with the anticipation of change points to exploit the task structure. Excitotoxic lesion and optogenetic inactivation implicate the anterior cingulate and premotor regions of medial frontal cortex. Specifically, over-estimation of hazard rate arises from imbalance across frontal hemispheres during the time window before the choice is made. Collectively, the results demonstrate that mice can capitalize on their knowledge of task regularities, and this estimation of future changes in the environment may be a main computational function of the rodent dorsal medial frontal cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Human ability to initiate reflexive eye movements towards unseen targets without the primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Blindsight patients who have a visual field loss due to a lesion in primary visual cortex (V1) can shift their gaze to stimuli presented in their blind visual field, but the extent to which this is a residual capacity that is not affected by the lesion or caused by neural reorganization is open. Using retinotopically navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of primary visual cortex (V1; Experiment 1, N = 9) and metacontrast masking (Experiment 2, N = 13), we examined the ability of neurologically healthy individuals to make saccadic eye movements to visual stimuli they report being unconscious of. In both experiments we observed that participants could initiate saccades towards targets they reported not seeing, but in TMS experiment, this happened only on a small proportion ([~]8%) of unconscious trials. Because saccades towards reportedly unconscious stimuli could be initiated despite V1 TMS, the results suggest that the process may be independent of V1. That said, signal detection theoretic measures suggested that in the TMS experiment, saccades towards reportedly unconscious stimuli may have been based on weak conscious experiences. With both TMS and metacontrast masking, reduced visibility of stimuli was associated with slower and less precise gaze shift. Our results indicate that in neurologically healthy individuals, visual stimuli can trigger saccadic gaze shifts even when the target is reported not consciously perceived, although the reliability, accuracy, and speed of such saccades is inferior when compared to saccades initiated in response to consciously perceived targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signal Transformations and New Timing Rules of Hippocampal CA3 to CA1 Synapses</a></h4>

              
                The synapse is the fundamental unit of communication in the nervous system. Determining how information is transferred across the synaptic interface is one of the most complex endeavors in neuroscience, owing to the large number of contributing factors and events. An approach to solving this problem involves collapsing across these complexities to derive concise mathematical formulas that fully capture the governing dynamics of synaptic transmission. We investigated the feasibility of deriving such a formula - an input-output transformation function for the CA3 to CA1 node of the hippocampus -- using the Volterra expansion technique for nonlinear system identification. The entirety of the field EPSP in the apical dendrites of mouse brain slices was described with >94% accuracy by a 2nd order equation that captured the linear and nonlinear influence of past inputs on current outputs. This function generalized to cases not included in its derivation and uncovered previously undetected timing rules. The basal dendrites expressed a substantially different transfer function and evidence was obtained that, unlike the apical system, a 3rd order system or higher will be needed for complete characterization. Collectively, these results describe a readily implemented and unusually sensitive means for evaluating the effects of pharmacological treatments and disease related conditions on synaptic dynamics. At scale, the approach will also provide information needed for the construction of biologically realistic models of brain networks.

	<p>Our brain continuously interacts with the body as we engage with the world. Although we are mostly unaware of internal bodily processes, such as our heartbeats, they may be influenced by and in turn influence our perception and emotional feelings. Although there is a recent focus on understanding cardiac interoceptive activity and interaction with brain activity during emotion processing, the investigation of cardiac&amp;amp;ndash;brain interactions with more ecologically valid naturalistic emotional stimuli is still very limited. We also do not understand how an essential aspect of emotions, such as context familiarity, influences affective feelings and is linked to statistical interaction between cardiac and brain activity. Hence, to answer these questions, we designed an exploratory study by recording ECG and EEG signals for the emotional events while participants were watching emotional movie clips. Participants also rated their familiarity with the stimulus on the familiarity scale. Linear mixed effect modelling was performed in which the ECG power and familiarity were considered as predictors of EEG power. We focused on three brain regions, including prefrontal (PF), frontocentral (FC) and parietooccipital (PO). The analyses showed that the interaction between the power of cardiac activity in the mid-frequency range and the power in specific EEG bands is dependent on familiarity, such that the interaction is stronger with high familiarity. In addition, the results indicate that arousal is predicted by cardiac&amp;amp;ndash;brain interaction, which also depends on familiarity. The results support emotional theories that emphasize context dependency and interoception. Multimodal studies with more realistic stimuli would further enable us to understand and predict different aspects of emotional experience.</p>

	<p>Inter-brain synchronization is primarily investigated during social interactions but had not been examined during coupled muscle action between two persons until now. It was previously shown that mechanical muscle oscillations can develop coherent behavior between two isometrically interacting persons. This case study investigated if inter-brain synchronization appears thereby, and if differences of inter- and intrapersonal muscle and brain coherence exist regarding two different types of isometric muscle action. Electroencephalography (EEG) and mechanomyography/mechanotendography (MMG/MTG) of right elbow extensors were recorded during six fatiguing trials of two coupled isometrically interacting participants (70% MVIC). One partner performed holding and one pushing isometric muscle action (HIMA/PIMA; tasks changed). The wavelet coherence of all signals (EEG, MMG/MTG, force, ACC) were analyzed intra- and interpersonally. The five longest coherence patches in 8&amp;amp;ndash;15 Hz and their weighted frequency were compared between real vs. random pairs and between HIMA vs. PIMA. Real vs. random pairs showed significantly higher coherence for intra-muscle, intra-brain, and inter-muscle-brain activity (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001 to 0.019). Inter-brain coherence was significantly higher for real vs. random pairs for EEG of right and central areas and for sub-regions of EEG left (p = 0.002 to 0.025). Interpersonal muscle-brain synchronization was significantly higher than intrapersonal one, whereby it was significantly higher for HIMA vs. PIMA. These preliminary findings indicate that inter-brain synchronization can arise during muscular interaction. It is hypothesized both partners merge into one oscillating neuromuscular system. The results reinforce the hypothesis that HIMA is characterized by more complex control strategies than PIMA. The pilot study suggests investigating the topic further to verify these results on a larger sample size. Findings could contribute to the basic understanding of motor control and is relevant for functional diagnostics such as the manual muscle test which is applied in several disciplines, e.g., neurology, physiotherapy.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Human genomics established that pathogenic variation in diverse genes can underlie a single disorder. For example, hereditary spastic paraplegia is associated with &gt;80 genes, with frequently only few affected individuals described for each gene. Herein, we characterize a large cohort of individuals with biallelic variation in <i>ENTPD1</i>, a gene previously linked to spastic paraplegia 64 (Mendelian Inheritance in Man # 615683).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individuals with biallelic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants were recruited worldwide. Deep phenotyping and molecular characterization were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 27 individuals from 17 unrelated families were studied; additional phenotypic information was collected from published cases. Twelve novel pathogenic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants are described (NM 001776.6): c.398_399delinsAA; p.(Gly133Glu), c.540del; p.(Thr181Leufs*18), c.640del; p.(Gly216Glufs*75), c.185 T &gt; G; p.(Leu62*), c.1531 T &gt; C; p.(*511Glnext*100), c.967C &gt; T; p.(Gln323*), c.414-2_414-1del, and c.146 A &gt; G; p.(Tyr49Cys) including 4 recurrent variants c.1109 T &gt; A; p.(Leu370*), c.574-6_574-3del, c.770_771del; p.(Gly257Glufs*18), and c.1041del; p.(Ile348Phefs*19). Shared disease traits include childhood onset, progressive spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability (ID), dysarthria, and white matter abnormalities. <i>In vitro</i> assays demonstrate that <i>ENTPD1</i> expression and function are impaired and that c.574-6_574-3del causes exon skipping. Global metabolomics demonstrate <i>ENTPD1</i> deficiency leads to impaired nucleotide, lipid, and energy metabolism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The <i>ENTPD1</i> locus trait consists of childhood disease onset, ID, progressive spastic paraparesis, dysarthria, dysmorphisms, and white matter abnormalities, with some individuals showing neurocognitive regression. Investigation of an allelic series of <i>ENTPD1</i> (1) expands previously described features of <i>ENTPD1</i>-related neurological disease, (2) highlights the importance of genotype-driven deep phenotyping, (3) documents the need for global collaborative efforts to characterize rare autosomal recessive disease traits, and (4) provides insights into disease trait neurobiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-range alpha-synchronisation as control signal for BCI: A feasibility study</a></h4>

              
                Shifts in spatial attention are associated with variations in alpha-band (, 8-14 Hz) activity, specifically in inter-hemispheric imbalance. The underlying mechanism is attributed to local -synchronisation, which regulates local inhibition of neural excitability, as well as fronto-parietal synchronisation reflecting long-range communication. The direction-specific nature of this neural correlate brings forward its potential as a control signal in brain-computer interfaces (BCI). In the present study we explored whether long-range -synchronisation presents lateralised patterns dependent on voluntary attention orienting, and whether these patterns can be picked up at single-trial level to provide a control signal for active BCI. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from a cohort of healthy adults (n = 10) while performing a covert visuospatial attention (CVSA) task. The data show lateralised patterns of -band phase coupling between frontal and parieto-occipital regions after target presentation, replicating previous findings. This pattern, however, was not evident during the cue-target orienting interval, the ideal time window for BCI. Furthermore, decoding the direction of attention trial-by-trial from cue-locked synchronisation with support vector machine (SVM) was at chance-level. The present findings suggest limitations of EEG to detect long-range -synchronisation in attentional orienting at the single-trial and, thus, its limitation as a reliable signal for BCI control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Taste cues elicit prolonged modulation of feeding behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Taste cues regulate immediate feeding behavior, but their ability to modulate future behavior has been less well-studied. Pairing one taste with another can modulate subsequent feeding responses through associative learning, but this requires simultaneous exposure to both stimuli. We investigated whether exposure to one taste modulates future responses to other tastes even when they do not overlap in time. Using Drosophila, we found that brief exposure to sugar enhanced future feeding responses, whereas bitter exposure suppressed them. This modulation relies on neural pathways distinct from those that acutely regulate feeding or mediate learning-dependent changes. Sensory neuron activity was required not only during initial taste exposure but also afterward, suggesting that ongoing sensory activity may maintain experience-dependent changes in downstream circuits. Thus, the brain stores a memory of each taste stimulus after it disappears, enabling animals to integrate information as they sequentially sample different taste cues that signal local food quality.

                Microelectrode arrays (MEA) hold great promise for a broad range of applications that require reliable char-acterization of the growth and function of neurons in culture. Widespread adoption of this platform depends on analytical methods to extract meaning from highly variable and noisy observations. In analyzing a comprehensive database of MEA recordings, we discovered that 22% of the electrodes presented systematic patterns of under- or non-detection of spike activity. Going undetected, principal components analysis (PCA) of these data reveal trends that would have lead to incorrect biological interpretations. We fully document these defective or biased electrodes, and distinguish two forms of defectiveness, via rep-resentations that aid in detecting them. We also showcase our approach for analyzing these data that permit for post-analytic review and correction. Repeating our PCA on cleaned data, we discover a more complex interplay of biological variability. Finally, we make a case for transparency in data reporting and propose best practices for experimental and analysis phases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differences in non-linearities determine retinal cell types</a></h4>

              
                Classifying neurons in different types is still an open challenge. In the retina, recent works have taken advantage of the ability to record a large number of cells to classify ganglion cells into different types based on functional information. While the first attempts in this direction used the receptive field properties of each cell to classify them, more recent approaches have proposed to cluster ganglion cells directly based on their response to standard stimuli. These two approaches have not been compared directly. Here we recorded the responses of a large number of ganglion cells and compared two methods for classifying them into types, one based on the receptive field properties, and the other one using their responses to standard stimuli. We show that the stimulus based approach allows separating more types than the receptive field-based method, leading to a better classification. This better granularity is due to the fact that the stimulus-based method takes into account not only the linear part of ganglion cell function, but also non-linearities. A careful characterization of non-linear processing is thus key to allow functional classification of sensory neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unifying model for three forms of contextual modulation including feedback input from higher visual areas</a></h4>

              
                Neural responses to a localized visual stimulus are modulated by the content of its surrounding. This phenomenon manifests in several forms of contextual modulation, including three interrelated properties of the visual cortex: surround suppression, inverse response and surround facilitation. We devise a unified biologically realistic circuit model accounting for all these phenomena and show that i) surround suppression in L2/3 is only partially due to the recruitment of lateral inhibition; ii) long-range feedback projections are necessary for inverse response and iii) the width of the response profile in the feedback layer determines inverse size tuning. The model predicts the modulations induced by silencing somatostatin-expressing cells or higher visual areas or changing the stimulus contrast. These predictions are consistent with the experimental observations when available and can be tested in existing setups otherwise. We then show the robustness of the identified mechanisms in a model with three interneuron subclasses, built to fit the classical responses and able to predict inverse size-tuning curves.

                Recent work has shown great interest in understanding individual differences in complex brain function under naturalistic viewing (NV) conditions. However, methods specifically designed for achieving this goal remain limited. Here, we propose a novel approach, called TOpography-based Predictive Framework (TOPF), to investigate individual differences in evoked brain activity on NV fMRI data. Specifically, TOPF identifies individual-specific evoked activity topographies in a data-driven manner and examines their behavioural relevance using a machine learning predictive framework. Our results show that these topographies successfully predict individual phenotypes across cognition, emotion and personality on unseen subjects, and the identified predictive brain regions are neurobiologically interpretable. Further, the prediction accuracy exceeds that of the commonly-used functional connectivity-based features. Conceptually, we highlight the importance of examining multivariate evoked activity patterns for studying brain-behaviour relationships. In summary, we provide a powerful tool for understanding individual differences and brain-behaviour relationships on NV fMRI data.

                Growing evidence indicates decreased fidelity of mnemonic representations to play a role in age-related episodic memory deficits, yet the brain mechanisms underlying such reductions remain unexplored. Using functional and structural neuroimaging and a continuous report task we examined how changes in two key nodes of the posterior-medial memory network, the hippocampus and the angular gyrus, might underpin loss of memory precision in older age. An age-related reduction in activity reflecting successful memory retrieval was observed in the hippocampus, whereas activity associated with graded variation in memory precision was decreased in the angular gyrus. Grey matter volume of the angular gyrus further predicted individual differences in memory precision in older age, beyond variation in successful memory retrieval. These findings highlight the importance of functional and structural integrity of the angular gyrus in constraining memory precision in older age, advancing current understanding of hippocampal and parietal contributions to age-related episodic memory decline.

                Background: Previous work indicated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens shell in male rats attenuated reinstatement of cocaine seeking, an animal model of craving. However, the potential differential impact of DBS on specific populations of neurons to drive the suppression of cocaine seeking is unknown. Medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens are differentiated by expression of dopamine D1 receptors (D1DRs) or D2DRs, activation of which promotes or inhibits cocaine-related behaviors, respectively. The advent of transgenic rat lines expressing Cre recombinase selectively in D1DR-containing or D2DR-containing neurons, when coupled with Cre-dependent virally mediated gene transfer of channelrhodopsin (ChR2), enabled mimicry of DBS in a selective subpopulation of neurons during complex tasks. Hypothesis: We tested the hypothesis that high frequency DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of D1DR-containing neurons in the accumbens shell would potentiate, whereas stimulation of D2DR-containing neurons in the accumbens shell would attenuate, cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Results: Results indicated that high frequency, DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of D2DR-containing neurons attenuated reinstatement of cocaine seeking in male rats, whereas DBS-like optogenetic stimulation of D1DR-containing neurons did not alter cocaine-primed reinstatement. Surprisingly, DBS-like optogenetic stimulation did not alter reinstatement of cocaine seeking in female rats. In rats which only expressed eYFP, intra-accumbens optogenetic stimulation did not alter cocaine reinstatement relative to sham stimulation, indicating that the effect of DBS-like stimulation to attenuate cocaine reinstatement is mediated specifically by ChR2 rather than consequent to prolonged light delivery. Conclusions: These results suggest that DBS of the accumbens attenuates cocaine-primed reinstatement in male rats through the selective manipulation of D2DR-containing neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An essential experimental control for functional connectivity mapping with optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                To establish functional connectivity between two candidate neurons that might form a circuit element, a common approach is to activate an optogenetic tool such as Chrimson in the candidate pre-synaptic neuron and monitor fluorescence of the calcium-sensitive indicator GCaMP in a candidate post-synaptic neuron. While performing such experiments, we found that low levels of leaky Chrimson expression can lead to strong artifactual GCaMP signals in presumptive postsynaptic neurons even when Chrimson is not intentionally expressed in any particular neurons. Withholding all-trans retinal, the chromophore required as a co-factor for Chrimson response to light, eliminates GCaMP signal but does not provide an experimental control for leaky Chrimson expression. Leaky Chrimson expression appears to be an inherent feature of current Chrimson transgenes, since artifactual connectivity was detected with Chrimson transgenes integrated into three different genomic locations (two insertions tested in larvae; a third insertion tested in the adult fly). These false-positive signals may complicate the interpretation of functional connectivity experiments. We illustrate how a no-Gal4 negative control improves interpretability of functional connectivity assays. We also propose a simple but effective procedure to identify experimental conditions that minimize potentially incorrect interpretations caused by leaky Chrimson expression.

                The involvement of specific basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in response inhibition has been extensively mapped in animal models. However, the pivotal nodes and directed casual regulation within this inhibitory circuit in humans remains controversial. Here, we capitalize on the recent progress in robust and biologically plausible directed causal modelling (DCM-PEB) and a large response inhibition dataset (n=218; 104 males) acquired with concomitant functional fMRI to determine key nodes, their causal regulation and modulation via biological variables (sex) and inhibitory performance in the inhibitory circuit encompassing the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG), caudate nucleus (rCau), globus pallidum (rGP) and thalamus (rThal). The entire neural circuit exhibited high intrinsic connectivity and response inhibition critically increased causal projections from the rIFG to both rCau and rThal. Direct comparison further demonstrated that response inhibition induced an increasing rIFG inflow and increased the causal regulation of this region over the rCau and rThal. In addition, sex and performance influenced the architecture of the regulatory circuits such that women displayed increased rThal self-inhibition and decreased rThal to GP modulation, while better inhibitory performance was associated with stronger rThal to rIFG communication. Furthermore, control analyses did not reveal a similar key communication in a left lateralized model. Together these findings indicate a pivotal role of the rIFG as input and causal regulator of subcortical response inhibition nodes.
