              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-203/v2?src=rss">Effectiveness of a multidimensional collaborative approach versus usual care in the treatment of adult depression in primary care in Chile: study protocol for a single blinded cluster randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 appr</a></h4>

              
                Background Major depression (MD) is a prevalent and disabling condition in Chile, with most cases being treated at the primary care level. In Chilean primary care, the authors have identified key factors associated with more complex presentations of MD and a poorer prognosis, such as a history of childhood trauma, suicidality, and comorbidities. These findings underscore the need for a multidimensional, trauma-informed, and interprofessional approach to the treatment of depression. Methods This protocol is a two-arm, single-blinded, cluster RCT to compare the effectiveness of a collaborative multidimensional approach for depression (CMAD) versus usual care to treat MD in primary care clinics in Chile. In total, 394 depressed adults from 18 to 65 years of age in twelve clinics located in Chile’s Maule Region will be consented to participate in the study. Patients and care teams from each clinic will be randomized to the intervention or to the control arm. Interprofessional teams in the intervention arm will attend 27 hours of didactic and active learning sessions focused on clinical competences to effectively engage, treat and follow up patients with the factors associated to the complex presentation of MD. Team in the control arm will receive 27 didactic sessions on current clinical guidelines for MD. Patients of both arms will be blindly assessed at baseline, three months, and six months. The primary outcome will be the reduction in depressive symptoms, with secondary outcomes including improvements in anxiety symptoms, interpersonal and social functioning, and treatment adherence. Discussion This protocol proposes the evaluation of an intervention designed to improve depression symptoms by enhancing the clinical competencies of primary care teams. These competencies are structured around collaborative care and trauma-informed practices. Trial registration NCT05016388, registered on 16 August 2021 at ClinicalTrials.gov.

                Background Maternal mortality is the main indicator of maternal health worldwide. The aims of your study were to determine the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in the governorate of Tunis and to identify the main causes of maternal death. Methods We included all maternal deaths between January 2017 and December 2023, reported to the Tunis Regional Health Directorate. The data collected included the MMR per 100000 live birth, sociodemographic characteristics, causes of death, circumstances of death, autopsy findings, and preventability. Results Sixty one maternal deaths were recorded. The average of MMR was 46, 88 per 100000 live births. Two peaks in the MMR were noted in 2017 and 2020. The average age of the patients was 34, 1 years (±5.1). We noted that 43, 75 % of the patients were not residents of the governorate of Tunis. The postpartum period was the most critical. In fact, 83, 33 % of maternal deaths occurred postpartum. Hemorrhage was the main etiology in 20.8% of cases. The second cause was COVID- 19complicationsin 16, 6% of cases. Conclusion This study of maternal mortality in Tunis opens the debate on the effectiveness of maternal health policies in Tunisia and the areas for improvement.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1217/v1?src=rss">The usefulness of a rehabilitation programme for people with stress-related disorders - A case from a rehabilitation center in Estonia. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Rehabilitation programs help to improve people’s lives and reduce turnover rates in organisations. The current analysis revealed that dissatisfaction occurred among practitioners, doctors’ overlapping services, and fragmented plans. No comprehensive assessment and rehabilitation program currently exists for stress-related disorders in Estonia indicating an urgent need to conduct research and development programs for clients to reduce stress (Bugarski, Z, et al., 2016). This study research aimed to determine the usefulness of rehabilitation programs for individuals people with stress-related disorders. Method A qualitative approach was used. Methodology The sample included 10 individuals recruited from various rehabilitation centers in Estonia. Convenience sampling was used to select participants for this research. Open- and closed-ended questions were formulated using the 12 questions enclosed in this research. All transcribed interviews were formatted using the code. Extract codes within participant interviews were compared to identify similarities, differences, and closeness, and therefore formulated categories. Results The findings revealed that rehabilitation programs contribute to quality services, self-motivation, daily activities plan, self-control, recovery, attention and concentration, and coping skills, whereas traditional treatment can reduce symptoms but not change people’s lives. Conclusion This study suggests that rehabilitation programs are useful for individuals with stress disorders in the context of the Estonian healthcare system. The rehabilitation program is a useful intervention method revealed in the context of Estonia’s healthcare system, as it improves quality services, increases coping skills, self-control, and cognitive skills, and enhances recovery.

                Eosinophilia serves as an indicator of allergy and parasite infestation. Eosinophil granules are believed to have adverse effects on cells and contribute to oxidative stress. In our current study, we investigated the relationship between eosinophilia and healthy subjects in terms of nuclear DNA damage in peripheral leukocytes. The comet assay was employed to test whole blood samples from 52 subjects in each group. The results revealed that eosinophilia subjects exhibited significantly higher levels of nuclear DNA damage in leukocytes compared to healthy subjects. Additionally, a weak positive association was observed between eosinophil counts and DNA damage. Our findings suggest that eosinophilia is linked to systemic oxidative DNA damage.

                Background Tunisia was one of the most affected nations with COVID-19 disease. The clinical features of this illness range from asymptomatic illness to death. Aim To analyse the survival of patients admitted to a Tunisian tertiary care center (Sahloul University Hospital) and identify independent predictive factors for hospital COVID-19 mortality. Methods A longitudinal study was conducted among confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Sahloul University Hospital between September 2020 and September 2022. Cox univariate regression was used to calculate the Hazard Ratio (HR) of death for patient characteristics regarding the time at risk. Risk factors with a p value of 0.2 or less in the univariate analysis were initially included in the multivariate Cox regression models. Results During the study at Sahloul Hospital, 1978 patients were hospitalized, averaging 55.65 years in age (± 21.39). Among them, 417 deaths occurred, with a median survival of 30 days (± 3.11) [23.904-36.096]. Factors significantly affecting the survival curve were: Age, male gender, comorbidities, diabetes, hypertension, endocrine diseases, obesity, intubation, and ICU admission Multilevel survival analyses revealed that hypertension (aHR 1.24; CI [1.02-1.52]; p=0.028), ICU admission (aHR 12.20- CI [9.56-15.57]; p<10-3), and male gender (HR 1.19; CI [0.98-1.46]; p=0.076) were independent factors associated with COVID-19 mortality. Conclusion Our study concluded the importance of the early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients to decrease this virus mortality. A good understanding of the possible clinical factors associated with COVID-19 severity is helpful for clinicians in identifying patients who are at high risk and require prioritized treatment to minimize death.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1213/v1?src=rss">Preterm birth: associated risk factors in the tertiary care center [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The study aimed at identifying the prevalence of preterm labor and the associated risk factors. Design A quantitative approach using a retrospective case-control study. Setting Tertiary care hospital of Udupi district Karnataka. Population or Sample Women delivered in tertiary care Hospital of Udupi district, Karnataka, were the sample; among them, the cases (250) were the records of the women who had delivered before 37 weeks of gestation, and controls (500) were the records of women who delivered after 37 weeks of gestation and without any complications. Method The study was conducted using a retrospective case-control design by reviewing the case records of women who had delivered in a tertiary care hospital. Main Outcome Measures Women delivered in tertiary care Hospital of Udupi district, Karnataka, and their inpatient records were assessed for risk factors during the antenatal and delivery periods. Results The study revealed that the prevalence of preterm labor was 356 (14.86%) Out of 2402 deliveries. Among them, only 250 were assessed. It was significantly correlated with age, place of residence, degree of education, occupation, marital status, gravid para, number of deliveries, type of deliveries, gap between births, blood type, and religion. Pregnant women who had been exposed or had a risk for preterm labor included those who had been diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension, medication during pregnancy, history of abortion, intense physical labor, and conception dates older than 30 years. Conclusion The preterm labor prevalence can be minimized if the modifiable risk factors are in control. Non-modifiable risk factors require keen supervision. Thus, health professionals must be alert to all modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

                Background Molecular hybridization in drug design is proved to be very successful approach to provide new chemical entities with potential activities and desirable physicochemical properties. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are involved in controlling the behavior and acetylation of histone and non-histone proteins and their inhibition causes block of cell growth, differentiation, changes in gene expression, and death. Consequently, HDAC inhibitors may lead to anticytotoxic activity. An approach of synthesizing hybrid molecules of benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid via an amino acid or aminoalkanoic acid was considered. This approach is expected to optimize the anticytotoxic activity of the proposed compounds. Methods Hybrid molecules of benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid (2A-E) were synthesized and their chemical structures were confirmed by spectral analyses (FT-IR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR). These were subjected to molecular docking on HDAC8 (PDB ID: 1T69). Computational methods were employed using the SwissADME server to predict the ADME parameters and other physicochemical properties. The cytotoxicity evaluation was performed using MTT colorimetric assay. Results Hybrids (2A-E) recorded lower ΔG (-6.322 to - 9.46) than Vorinostat (SAHA, -5.375). ΔG is an affinity scoring function (kcal/mol) and is employed to rank the candidate poses as the sum of the electrostatic and Van der Waals energies. Benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid by a p-aminobenzoic acid (2E) has recorded the lowest docking score of -9.460 and this may refer to the possibility of high inhibitory activity. The hybrids showed no violation from Lipinski’s rule and complied with parameters with low possible passive oral absorption and no penetration into BBB. Hybrid molecules of benzothiazole recorded very interesting results, particularly, 2D and 2E which showed significant and remarkable activity. Conclusions Hybrid molecules of benzothiazole cross-linked with hydroxamic acid recorded very interesting results, particularly, compounds 2D and 2E which showed significant and remarkable activity on lung cancer cell line type A549.

                Background: Considering the importance of exploring the development of reasoning skills during preschool period and the suitability of using a culturally linguistically relevant story-based approach for the same, the present research intended to profile the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children between 36 and 72 months using a story-based approach. The specific objectives were to develop explanation, prediction, and inference based reasoning tasks around a story and assess the reasoning skills in typically developing Indian preschool children using the same. Method: Reasoning tasks across explanation, prediction, and inference domains were developed based on a story and evaluated for its psychometric properties. The developed tasks were then administered to 63 typically developing Indian preschool children attending English medium schools in Mangalore. The preschoolers were equally divided into three age groups, and the responses obtained across the age groups were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Results: The developed tasks were confirmed to have good psychometric properties like content validity and reliability. The age comparisons of reasoning abilities using one-way ANOVA suggested an increase in reasoning abilities with age during the preschool period. The qualitative analysis further suggested that with increasing age, the nature of reasoning changed from content-based reasoning to reasoning based on prior knowledge which was integrated with the story content. Conclusion: The study describes reasoning skill development using a story-based task in Indian preschoolers. The study findings further provide clinical and educational implications to assess and foster reasoning abilities among preschoolers.

                Background Academic achievement is the result of both effort and perseverance exerted by the students. This mixed-methods study aims to investigate the factors affecting the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities. Methods A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was utilized. In the quantitative phase, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 1008 students (773 females and 235 males) from 23 Syrian universities. A questionnaire consisting of 48 items was designed to be completed by pharmacy students using a 5-point Likert scale. In the qualitative phase, twelve questions were developed to interview thirty pharmacy students from five Syrian universities to obtain in-depth insights into the factors influencing their academic achievement. Results A significant number of students lacked effective time management skills, identified as a weakness among students. The majority of students faced challenges in maintaining a consistent study routine, averaging a score of (2.0). Motivation towards learning emerged as a crucial factor in enhancing academic performance. Lecturers in the pharmacy faculty employed traditional teaching methods (2.01), and the pharmacy curriculum was perceived as lacking modernity (1.92). Quantitative findings demonstrated that pharmacy students experienced exam-related anxiety (2.05), identified as a weakness in the qualitative phase. Factors associated with the Syrian crisis, like unreliable electricity (1.87) and transportation issues (1.83), could have an impact on academic achievement. Economic conditions were identified as challenging to students’ academic performance, negatively affecting the learning process (1.98). Conclusion The results of the study demonstrate that personal factors, lecturers, educational environment, exams, and the Syrian crisis influence the academic achievement of pharmacy students in Syrian universities.

                Background Neuropathy is common in both Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Leprosy, often resulting in neuropathic ulcers. Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers are frequently misdiagnosed as DM-related, causing delays in appropriate care. This case report underscores the importance of timely recognition and a better understanding of Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers to prevent misdiagnosis and improve patient outcomes. Methods The case report adopt the CARE Guidelines and was conducted at the Wound Care Specialist Clinic, Griya Afiat, Makassar, East Indonesia. Data were collected using a Minimum Data Sheet (MDS) to capture demographics, health history, and history of treatments. A head-to-toe assessment focused on the eyes, hands, and feet, with neuropathy, confirmed using the Semmes Weinstein Monofilament test, and angiopathy was assessed by palpating the dorsal pedis and posterior tibialis pulse. Wound care interventions consisted of cleansing, debridement, and dressing. Given the similarities between Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers and DM-related neuropathic ulcers, the DMIST (depth, maceration, inflammation/infection, size, tissue type of the wound bed, type of wound edge, and tunnelling/undermining) tool was used to evaluate wound healing progress. Results Anamnesis indicated patient has no DM, with normal blood glucose; however, the patient had neuropathic wounds on her feet, asymmetrical eyebrow distribution, and rashes on her hands and calves, with neuropathy confirmed by a monofilament test—initial treatment involved Cadexomer Iodine powder to control bacterial growth and Honey-based gel to promote granulation. Over 62 days, 11 treatments were administered, with an average dressing change every 5.6 days, which improved the DMIST score from 12 to 4 by the end of observation day. Conclusions This case report highlights the significance of distinguishing leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers from those associated with DM to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely treatment. By employing comprehensive assessment tools and targeted wound care interventions, significant improvements in wound healing were achieved, emphasizing the need for greater awareness and clinical vigilance in managing Leprosy-related neuropathic ulcers.

                <p>by Jessica L. Gaines, Kwang S. Kim, Ben Parrell, Vikram Ramanarayanan, Alvincé L. Pongos, Srikantan S. Nagarajan, John F. Houde</p>

Behavioral speech tasks have been widely used to understand the mechanisms of speech motor control in typical speakers as well as in various clinical populations. However, determining which neural functions differ between typical speakers and clinical populations based on behavioral data alone is difficult because multiple mechanisms may lead to the same behavioral differences. For example, individuals with cerebellar ataxia (CA) produce atypically large compensatory responses to pitch perturbations in their auditory feedback, compared to typical speakers, but this pattern could have many explanations. Here, computational modeling techniques were used to address this challenge. Bayesian inference was used to fit a state feedback control (SFC) model of voice fundamental frequency (<i>fo</i>) control to the behavioral pitch perturbation responses of speakers with CA and typical speakers. This fitting process resulted in estimates of posterior likelihood distributions for five model parameters (sensory feedback delays, absolute and relative levels of auditory and somatosensory feedback noise, and controller gain), which were compared between the two groups. Results suggest that the speakers with CA may proportionally weight auditory and somatosensory feedback differently from typical speakers. Specifically, the CA group showed a greater relative sensitivity to auditory feedback than the control group. There were also large group differences in the controller gain parameter, suggesting increased motor output responses to target errors in the CA group. These modeling results generate hypotheses about how CA may affect the speech motor system, which could help guide future empirical investigations in CA. This study also demonstrates the overall proof-of-principle of using this Bayesian inference approach to understand behavioral speech data in terms of interpretable parameters of speech motor control models.

                Background Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent antineoplastic agent used in treating various adult and pediatric cancers, but it tends to provoke dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Ezetimibe (EZE), a cholesterol-lowering drug, has been reported to possess defensive actions against oxidative stress and inflammation, which are two of the main proposed mechanisms underlying the development of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC), hence, we aimed to inspect the possible protective effect of EZE against DIC in rats. Methods 24 adult male Wistar rats were allocated into four groups of six: control, DOX, 10 mg/kg EZE plus DOX and 20 mg/kg EZE plus DOX. At the end of the study, the experimental rats were anesthetized and blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis, after which the hearts were excised and heart tissue samples were obtained for biochemical and gene expression analyses. Results Pretreatment with EZE at a dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg alleviated cardiac damage induced by DOX, as EZE blunted the rise in serum levels of cardiac injury biomarkers, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Additionally, pretreating rats with EZE at either dose mitigated DOX-induced oxidative stress by elevating the levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), with consequent reduction in the lipid peroxidation biomarker malondialdehyde (MDA) in cardiac tissues. Furthermore, pretreatment with either dose of EZE hindered DOX-mediated inflammation, where EZE suppressed cardiac nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and negatively regulated the gene expression of its downstream proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) with either dose and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) with the higher one. Conclusions Our findings indicate that EZE exhibited cardioprotection against DIC in rats, which makes EZE an interesting area for further investigations, animal- and human-wise, that can pave the way for a potential clinical application in preventing DIC in the future.

                Background Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are essential for assessing the health of patients with chronic venous disease (CVD). Therefore, we aimed to translate the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire into Thai language (AVVQ-Thai) and evaluate its reliability and validity. Minimal clinically important differences (MCID) of the AVVQ-Thai also be estimated. Methods International standards for PROM translation were followed including the forward-backwards translation of the AVVQ. Patients with Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) C2-C6 with truncal reflux were prospectively included. Venous interventions were used to treat reflux and varicosities. Patients’ characteristics, venous clinical severity scores (VCSS), EuroQol EQ-5D, and AVVQ-Thai were collected pre- and one-month post-intervention. AVVQ-Thai was also collected one to two weeks after the initial visit by reply-paid postal questionnaire. Results The study included 119 patients (30% C2, 29% C3, 28% C4, 11% C5, and 2% C6). The AVVQ-Thai had good internal consistency with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.783 and moderate reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.67 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.79). The AVVQ-Thai was significantly correlated with VCSS and was able to discriminate patients with different levels of health problems as assessed by EQ-5D at both pre-and post-intervention, demonstrating good construct and discriminative validity. The median AVVQ scores improved significantly after intervention from 15.4 (IQR 8.3, 24.2) to 4.2 (IQR 1.3, 8.4) in C2-C3, and 18.9 (IQR 14.1, 25.5) to 7.3 (IQR 4.6, 16.3) in C4-C6. The MCID of the AVVQ was 6.21 on the 0-100 scale, which equates to the level of difference necessary to be clinically meaningful. Conclusions AVVQ-Thai has satisfactory evidence for internal consistency, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to change and is recommended for application in Thailand.

                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>The study aimed to compare outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in pediatric patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA) versus cardioembolism (CE).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Save ChildS and KidClot cohorts were merged. Children with AIS because of FCA or CE that underwent MT were included. The study used the Childhood Arterial Ischemic Stroke Standardized Classification and Diagnostic Evaluation (CASCADE) for stroke cause assessment. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models were used to analyze final modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) scores, periprocedural complications, and functional outcomes assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 6 to 12 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 60 children with 14 FCA and 46 CE cases. CE etiology was associated with better revascularization (good to excellent thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scores) and shift toward better outcomes (common adjusted odds ratio of mRs for CE vs FCA: 0.27, 95% CI: [0.06–0.97], <i>p</i> = 0.039), with no difference in favorable outcome rates. FCA was associated with significantly lower rates of excellent revascularization (21% vs 65%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No difference in complications' rates was observed between the groups (7.2% in FCA vs 5.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.69).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found that pediatric AIS because of CE etiology has more favorable procedural outcomes compared to FCA following MT. This translated to mixed functional outcomes that may be more favorable in the CE group. These findings highlight the need for further research to refine treatment protocols for pediatric stroke, particularly in understanding and managing FCA in children.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pathological studies suggest that multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions endure multiple waves of damage and repair; however, the dynamics and characteristics of these processes are poorly understood in patients living with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 128 MS patients (75 relapsing–remitting, 53 progressive) and 72 healthy controls who underwent advanced magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination at baseline and 2 years later. Magnetization transfer saturation and multi-shell diffusion imaging were used to quantify longitudinal changes in myelin and axon volumes within MS lesions. Lesions were grouped into 4 classes (repair, damage, mixed repair damage, and stable). The frequency of each class was correlated to clinical measures, demographic characteristics, and levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stable lesions were the most frequent (<i>n</i> = 2,276; 44%), followed by lesions with patterns of “repair” (<i>n</i> = 1,352; 26.2%) and damage (<i>n</i> = 1,214; 23.5%). The frequency of “repair” lesion was negatively associated with disability (β = −0.04; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and sNfL (β = −0.16; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at follow-up. The frequency of the “damage” class was higher in progressive than relapsing–remitting patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and was related to disability (baseline: β = −0.078; follow-up: β = −0.076; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and age (baseline: β = −0.078; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Stable lesions were more frequent in relapsing–remitting than in progressive patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and in younger patients versus older (β = −0.07; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline. Further, “mixed” lesions were most frequent in older patients (β = 0.004; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings show that repair and damage processes within MS lesions occur across the entire disease spectrum and that their frequency correlates with patients disability, age, disease duration, and extent of neuroaxonal damage. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentless, fatal neurodegenerative disease. The progressive loss of voluntary muscle function, diagnostic delays, lack of effective treatments, and challenges accessing multidisciplinary care and resources have tremendous impact on quality of life. The congressionally directed ALS committee of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, in their 2024 report “Living with ALS,” recommends critical actions for specific United States stakeholders to make ALS a livable disease over the next decade. This review summarizes the context and recommendations of the report. Advocacy efforts are critical to make these recommendations a reality for the ALS community. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

Inhibiting OLFM4 therefore represents an attractive therapeutic strategy to accelerate skin wound closure.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96738">Regulatory genome annotation of 33 insect species</a></h4>

              
                Annotation of newly sequenced genomes frequently includes genes, but rarely covers important non-coding genomic features such as the <i>cis</i>-regulatory modules—e.g., enhancers and silencers—that regulate gene expression. Here, we begin to remedy this situation by developing a workflow for rapid initial annotation of insect regulatory sequences, and provide a searchable database resource with enhancer predictions for 33 genomes. Using our previously developed SCRMshaw computational enhancer prediction method, we predict over 2.8 million regulatory sequences along with the tissues where they are expected to be active, in a set of insect species ranging over 360 million years of evolution. Extensive analysis and validation of the data provides several lines of evidence suggesting that we achieve a high true-positive rate for enhancer prediction. One, we show that our predictions target specific loci, rather than random genomic locations. Two, we predict enhancers in orthologous loci across a diverged set of species to a significantly higher degree than random expectation would allow. Three, we demonstrate that our predictions are highly enriched for regions of accessible chromatin. Four, we achieve a validation rate in excess of 70% using in vivo reporter gene assays. As we continue to annotate both new tissues and new species, our regulatory annotation resource will provide a rich source of data for the research community and will have utility for both small-scale (single gene, single species) and large-scale (many genes, many species) studies of gene regulation. In particular, the ability to search for functionally related regulatory elements in orthologous loci should greatly facilitate studies of enhancer evolution even among distantly related species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92915">Heterozygous expression of a Kcnt1 gain-of-function variant has differential effects on somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing cortical GABAergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                More than 20 recurrent missense gain-of-function (GOF) mutations have been identified in the sodium-activated potassium (K<sub>Na</sub>) channel gene <i>KCNT1</i> in patients with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), most of which are resistant to current therapies. Defining the neuron types most vulnerable to KCNT1 GOF will advance our understanding of disease mechanisms and provide refined targets for precision therapy efforts. Here, we assessed the effects of heterozygous expression of a <i>Kcnt1</i> GOF variant (<i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup>) on K<sub>Na</sub> currents and neuronal physiology among cortical glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in mice, including those expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV), to identify and model the pathogenic mechanisms of autosomal dominant <i>KCNT1</i> GOF variants in DEEs. Although the <i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup> variant had no effects on glutamatergic or VIP neuron function, it increased subthreshold K<sub>Na</sub> currents in both SST and PV neurons but with opposite effects on neuronal output; SST neurons became hypoexcitable with a higher rheobase current and lower action potential (AP) firing frequency, whereas PV neurons became hyperexcitable with a lower rheobase current and higher AP firing frequency. Further neurophysiological and computational modeling experiments showed that the differential effects of the <i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup> variant on SST and PV neurons are not likely due to inherent differences in these neuron types, but to an increased persistent sodium current in PV, but not SST, neurons. The <i>Kcnt1</i><sup>Y777H</sup> variant also increased excitatory input onto, and chemical and electrical synaptic connectivity between, SST neurons. Together, these data suggest differential pathogenic mechanisms, both direct and compensatory, contribute to disease phenotypes, and provide a salient example of how a pathogenic ion channel variant can cause opposite functional effects in closely related neuron subtypes due to interactions with other ionic conductances.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85042">Cell-cell interaction determines cell fate of mesoderm-derived cell in tongue development through Hh signaling</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunction of primary cilia leads to genetic disorder, ciliopathies, which shows various malformations in many vital organs such as brain. Multiple tongue deformities including cleft, hamartoma, and ankyloglossia are also seen in ciliopathies, which yield difficulties in fundamental functions such as mastication and vocalization. Here, we found these tongue anomalies in mice with mutation of ciliary protein. Abnormal cranial neural crest-derived cells (CNCC) failed to evoke Hh signal for differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into myoblasts, which resulted in abnormal differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into adipocytes. The ectopic adipose subsequently arrested tongue swelling formation. Ankyloglossia was caused by aberrant cell migration due to lack of non-canonical Wnt signaling. In addition to ciliopathies, these tongue anomalies are often observed as non-familial condition in human. We found that these tongue deformities could be reproduced in wild-type mice by simple mechanical manipulations to disturb cellular processes which were disrupted in mutant mice. Our results provide hints for possible future treatment in ciliopathies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99026">Genome-wide mapping of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells</a></h4>

              
                The interplay between G4s and R-loops are emerging in regulating DNA repair, replication, and transcription. A comprehensive picture of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells is currently lacking. Here, we describe the development of HepG4-seq and an optimized HBD-seq methods, which robustly capture native G4s and R-loops, respectively, in living cells. We successfully employed these methods to establish comprehensive maps of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in human HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We discovered that co-localized G4s and R-loops are dynamically altered in a cell type-dependent manner and are largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptional active genes. We further demonstrated the helicase Dhx9 as a direct and major regulator that modulates the formation and resolution of co-localized G4s and R-loops. Depletion of Dhx9 impaired the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of mESCs by altering the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops -associated genes. Taken together, our work established that the endogenous co-localized G4s and R-loops are prevalently persisted in the regulatory regions of active genes and are involved in the transcriptional regulation of their linked genes, opening the door for exploring broader roles of co-localized G4s and R-loops in development and disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96224">Systematic evaluation of multifactorial causal associations for Alzheimer’s disease and an interactive platform MRAD developed based on Mendelian randomization analysis</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex degenerative disease of the central nervous system, and elucidating its pathogenesis remains challenging. In this study, we used the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) model as the major analysis method to perform hypothesis-free Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis on the data from MRC IEU OpenGWAS (18,097 exposure traits and 16 AD outcome traits), and conducted sensitivity analysis with six models, to assess the robustness of the IVW results, to identify various classes of risk or protective factors for AD, early-onset AD, and late-onset AD. We generated 400,274 data entries in total, among which the major analysis method of the IVW model consists of 73,129 records with 4840 exposure traits, which fall into 10 categories: Disease, Medical laboratory science, Imaging, Anthropometric, Treatment, Molecular trait, Gut microbiota, Past history, Family history, and Lifestyle trait. More importantly, a freely accessed online platform called MRAD (<a href="https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/">https://gwasmrad.com/mrad/</a>) has been developed using the Shiny package with MR analysis results. Additionally, novel potential AD therapeutic targets (CD33, TBCA, VPS29, GNAI3, PSME1) are identified, among which CD33 was positively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. TBCA and VPS29 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with both EOAD and LOAD. GNAI3 and PSME1 were negatively associated with the main outcome traits of AD, as well as with LOAD, but had no significant causal association with EOAD. The findings of our research advance our understanding of the etiology of AD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94001">Transcriptional inhibition after irradiation occurs preferentially at highly expressed genes in a manner dependent on cell cycle progression</a></h4>

              
                In response to DNA double-strand damage, ongoing transcription is inhibited to facilitate accurate DNA repair while transcriptional recovery occurs after DNA repair is complete. However, the mechanisms at play and the identity of the transcripts being regulated in this manner are unclear. In contrast to the situation following UV damage, we found that transcriptional recovery after ionizing radiation (IR) occurs in a manner independent of the HIRA histone chaperone. Sequencing of the nascent transcripts identified a programmed transcriptional response, where certain transcripts and pathways are rapidly downregulated after IR, while other transcripts and pathways are upregulated. Specifically, most of the loss of nascent transcripts occurring after IR is due to inhibition of transcriptional initiation of the highly transcribed histone genes and the rDNA. To identify factors responsible for transcriptional inhibition after IR in an unbiased manner, we performed a whole genome gRNA library CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Many of the top hits on our screen were factors required for protein neddylation. However, at short times after inhibition of neddylation, transcriptional inhibition still occurred after IR, even though neddylation was effectively inhibited. Persistent inhibition of neddylation blocked transcriptional inhibition after IR, and it also leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we uncovered that many inhibitors and conditions that lead to cell cycle arrest in G<sub>1</sub> or G<sub>2</sub> phase also prevent transcriptional inhibition after IR. As such, it appears that transcriptional inhibition after IR occurs preferentially at highly expressed genes in cycling cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97602">Cell class-specific long-range axonal projections of neurons in mouse whisker-related somatosensory cortices</a></h4>

              
                Long-range axonal projections of diverse classes of neocortical excitatory neurons likely contribute to brain-wide interactions processing sensory, cognitive and motor signals. Here, we performed light-sheet imaging of fluorescently labeled axons from genetically defined neurons located in posterior primary somatosensory barrel cortex and supplemental somatosensory cortex. We used convolutional networks to segment axon-containing voxels and quantified their distribution within the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas Common Coordinate Framework. Axonal density was analyzed for different classes of glutamatergic neurons using transgenic mouse lines selectively expressing Cre recombinase in layer 2/3 intratelencephalic projection neurons (Rasgrf2-dCre), layer 4 intratelencephalic projection neurons (Scnn1a-Cre), layer 5 intratelencephalic projection neurons (Tlx3-Cre), layer 5 pyramidal tract projection neurons (Sim1-Cre), layer 5 projection neurons (Rbp4-Cre), and layer 6 corticothalamic neurons (Ntsr1-Cre). We found distinct axonal projections from the different neuronal classes to many downstream brain areas, which were largely similar for primary and supplementary somatosensory cortices. Functional connectivity maps obtained from optogenetic activation of sensory cortex and wide-field imaging revealed topographically organized evoked activity in frontal cortex with neurons located more laterally in somatosensory cortex signaling to more anteriorly located regions in motor cortex, consistent with the anatomical projections. The current methodology therefore appears to quantify brain-wide axonal innervation patterns supporting brain-wide signaling.

">Investigating the Effects of Synbiotic Intervention on Working Memory performance in Healthy Young Women</a></h4>

              
                The gut brain axis (GBA) mediates communication between the gastrointestinal system and the brain, influencing cognitive functions and emotional well being, with gut microbiota playing a crucial role. While synbiotics and probiotics have shown potential to enhance cognitive function, results remain inconsistent. This study examines the effects of synbiotic supplementation on auditory performance metrics threshold, sensitivity, accuracy, and reaction time using a repeated measures design with a control group. Thirty young females (ages 18-32) completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and an auditory working memory task. Although no significant differences were found in auditory thresholds, sensitivity, or accuracy, the synbiotic group exhibited significantly faster reaction times than the control group (p < 0.00001), suggesting enhanced cognitive processing speed. These findings underscore the need for further research into the mechanisms through which synbiotics influence cognitive health.

">Activity in the peripheral representation within primate V1 is substantially modulated during running</a></h4>

              
                We recently investigated whether activity in primary visual cortex of a primate (Callithrix jacchus) is modulated during running, and found that the effects were small (and suppressive), a notable difference from the large and positive modulations observed in mice. In that first report, we noted that the majority of our data were collected from the retinotopic representation of the fovea, and surmised that running modulations might be different in the peripheral representation. Here, we report that running-correlated modulations of the peripheral representation in marmoset V1 are positive and substantial, on order of 30%. In light of both the small and negative modulations observed in foveal V1, and the large and positive modulations seen in mouse V1, these results suggest that the foveal representation in primates may be unique. In this domain, non-foveal V1 in primates appears more similar to that of rodents.

">T-scope V4: miniaturized microscope for optogenetic tagging in freely behaving animals</a></h4>

              
                A miniaturized microscope (i.e., miniscope) enables the imaging of neuronal activity using calcium sensors while simultaneously manipulating that activity using opsins in freely moving animals. However, many miniscopes use light-emitting diodes with broadband emission, leading to unintentional opsin stimulation by light intended solely for calcium sensor activation (a phenomenon referred to as "biological crosstalk"). To address this issue, we previously developed a miniscope including a port for chosen light sources, such as lasers, by restructuring the open-source UCLA Miniscope v3. However, targeting the same neuronal soma for both excitable opsin stimulation and calcium sensor imaging remained a challenge. Here, we integrated features from the UCLA Miniscope v4 into our new T-scope V4 miniscope. In optogenetic tagging experiments, we demonstrated that a 445-nm blue laser can be used to image neuronal activity with the calcium sensor GCaMP6s without inadvertently stimulating the ChrimsonR opsin, allowing for simultaneous neuronal activity imaging and manipulation in freely moving mice. Thus, the T-scope V4 can serve as a powerful tool for probing causal relationships between neuronal activity and its function in living animals.

">Long-Term Effects of Working Memory Retrieval From Prioritized and Deprioritized States</a></h4>

              
                Which factors determine whether information temporarily held in working memory (WM) is transferred to long-term memory (LTM)? Previous work has shown that retrieving ('testing') memories from LTM can benefit their future LTM recall. Here, we examined the extent to which a benefit for subsequent LTM may also occur after retrieval from WM, depending on whether the WM contents were retrieved from a prioritized or deprioritized state. In three experiments, we combined variants of a novel visual WM paradigm with a subsequent surprise LTM recall test. We found a LTM benefit of WM testing both for prioritized and deprioritized WM contents, which, interestingly, was stronger for the deprioritized information. This pattern showed similarly across experiments with different priority manipulations. Subsequent LTM benefits generally occurred after WM testing with a recall-like test format (continuous report), but not after simple WM comparisons against a probe. The surprisingly larger LTM benefit for deprioritized WM contents may reflect enhanced encoding of the participants' own subjective WM report - as opposed to the originally presented sample information - into LTM.

">Longitudinal multi-omics reveals pathogenic TSC2 variants disrupt developmental trajectories of human cortical organoids derived from Tuberous Sclerosis Complex</a></h4>

              
                Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant condition, is caused by heterozygous mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, manifesting in systemic growth of benign tumors. In addition to brain lesions, neurologic sequelae represent the greatest morbidity in TSC patients. Investigations utilizing TSC1/2-knockout animal or human stem cell models suggest that TSC deficiency-causing hyper-activation of mTOR signaling might precipitate anomalous neurodevelopmental processes. However, how the pathogenic variants of TSC1/2 genes affect the longitudinal trajectory of human brain development remains largely unexplored. Here, we employed 3-dimensional cortical organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from TSC patients harboring TSC2 variants, alongside organoids from age- and sex-matched healthy individuals as controls. Through comprehensively longitudinal molecular and cellular analyses of TSC organoids, we found that TSC2 pathogenic variants dysregulate neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and gliogenesis, particularly for reactive astrogliosis. The altered developmental trajectory of TSC organoids significantly resembles the molecular signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Intriguingly, single cell transcriptomic analyses on TSC organoids revealed that TSC2 pathogenic variants disrupt the neuron/reactive astrocyte crosstalk within the NLGN-NRXN signaling network. Furthermore, cellular and electrophysiological assessments of TSC cortical organoids, along with proteomic analyses of synaptosomes, demonstrated that the TSC2 variants precipitate perturbations in synaptic transmission, neuronal network activity, mitochondrial translational integrity, and neurofilament formation. Notably, similar perturbations were observed in surgically resected cortical specimens from TSC patients. Collectively, our study illustrates that disease-associated TSC2 variants disrupt the neurodevelopmental trajectories through perturbations of gene regulatory networks during early cortical development, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, aberrant neurofilament formation, impaired synaptic formation and neuronal network activity.

">Isotope Encoded Chemical Imaging Identifies Amyloid Plaque Age Dependent Structural Maturation, Synaptic Loss, and Increased Toxicity</a></h4>

              
                It is of critical importance to our understanding of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology to determine how key pathological factors are interconnected and implicated in nerve cell death, clinical symptoms, and disease progression. The formation of extracellular beta-amyloid plaques is the major pathological hallmark of AD and beta-amyloid has been suggested to be a critical inducer of AD, driving disease pathogenesis. Exactly how beta-amyloid plaque formation begins and how ongoing plaque deposition proceeds and initiates subsequent neurotoxic mechanisms is not well understood. The primary aim of our research is to elucidate the biochemical processes underlying early beta-amyloid plaque formation in brain tissue. We recently introduced a chemical imaging paradigm based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and metabolic isotope labelling to follow stable isotope labelling kinetics (iSILK) in vivo to track the in vivo build-up and deposition of beta-amyloid. Herein, knock-in beta-amyloid mouse models (AppNL-F) that develop beta-amyloid pathology gradually are metabolically labeled with stable isotopes. This chemical imaging approach timestamps amyloid plaques during the period of initial deposition allowing the fate of aggregating beta-amyloid species from before and during the earliest events of plaque pathology through plaque maturation to be tracked. To identify the molecular and cellular response to plaque maturation, we integrated iSILK with single plaque transcriptomics performed on adjacent tissue sections. This enabled changes in gene expression to be tracked as a function of plaque age (as encoded in the beta-amyloid peptide isotopologue pattern) distinct from changes due to the chronological age or pathological severity. This approach identified that plaque age correlates negatively with gene expression patterns associated with synaptic function as early as in 10-month-old animals but persists into 18 months. Finally, we integrated hyperspectral confocal microscopy into our multiomic approach to image amyloid structural isomers, revealing a positive correlation between plaque age and amyloid structural maturity. This analysis identified three categories of plaques, each with a distinct impact on the surrounding microenvironment. Here, we identified that older, more compact plaques were associated with the most significant synapse loss and toxicity. These data show how isotope-encoded MS imaging can be used to delineate beta-amyloid toxicity dynamics in vivo. Moreover, we show for the first time a functional integration of dynamic MSI, structural plaque imaging and whole genome-wide spatial transcriptomics at the single plaque level. This multiomic approach offers an unprecedented combination of temporal and spatial resolution enabling a description of the earliest events of precipitating amyloid pathology and how beta-amyloid modulates synaptotoxic mechanisms.

">Effects of oral contraceptive pills on brain networks: A replication and extension</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimaging research has identified significant effects of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) on brain networks. A wide variety of approaches have been employed, largely in observational samples, with few converging results. This study was designed to replicate and expand this previous work using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to investigate effects of OCPs on brain networks. Using functional MRI, we focused on brain regions identified in prior studies. Our analyses did not strictly replicate previously reported effects of OCPs on functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses suggest that traditional seed-based approaches may miss broader, network-level effects of OCPs on brain circuits. We applied data-driven, multivariate techniques to assess these network-level changes, A deeper understanding of neural effects of OCPs can be important in helping patients make informed decisions regarding contraception, mitigating unwanted side effects, and also in understanding the potentially confounding effects of OCPs in other neuroimaging investigations.

">Dopamine and cortical iPSC-derived neurons with different Parkinsonian mutations show variation in lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction: implications for protein deposition versus selective cell loss</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mutations causing Parkinson's disease (PD) give diverse pathological phenotypes whose cellular correlates remain to be determined. For example, those with PRKN loss of function mutations have significantly earlier selective vulnerability of dopamine neurons, those with SNCA mutations have increased alpha-synuclein deposition, while those with LRRK2 mutations have additional deposition of tau. Yet all three mutation types are implicated in mitochondrial and/or lysosomal dysfunction. Direct comparison of cell models with these mutations would clarify the relative cellular dysfunctions associated with these different pathological phenotypes. Methods: An unbiased high-content imaging platform using orthogonal probes to assess both lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction, along with alpha-synuclein and tau protein deposition was established using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived cortical and ventral midbrain neurons. Three mutation types, SNCA A53T, LRRK2 R1441G and PRKN loss of function (lof), were selected as exemplars of divergent PD pathological phenotypes and compared to each other, and to control iPSC from subjects without PD. Results: Different PD mutations caused cell type specific dysfunctions, likely to impact on both selective neuronal vulnerability and the pathologies observed in PD. Comparison of dopamine neurons identified that both lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction were predominant with PRKN lof mutations, whereas immunofluorescent staining revealed that SNCA A53T and LRRK2 R1441G mutations had increased tau deposition. In contrast, cortical neurons with SNCA and LRRK2 mutations both had mitochondrial and autophagy impairments without protein deposition, with LRRK2 cells additionally showing decreased glucocerebrosidase activity and increased alpha-synuclein phosphorylation. Conclusions: Lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction are predominant in dopamine neurons with PRKN lof mutations, and may drive the early selective loss of dopamine neurons in PRKN mutation carriers. More subtle cellular abnormalities in the SNCA A53T cell lines are likely to predispose to alpha-synuclein aggregation and tau protein deposition over time. The LRRK2 R1441G may also predispose to tau deposition, but despite substantial lysosomal dysfunction with increased alpha-synuclein phosphorylation, pathological alpha-synuclein accumulations were not observed. Understanding the mechanistic differences in how lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction impact on PD pathogenesis in different disease subtypes may be important for therapeutic development.

">Extending mathematical frameworks to investigate neuronal dynamics in the presence of microglial ensheathment</a></h4>

              
                Recent experimental evidence has shown that glial cells, including microglia and astrocytes, can ensheathe synapses, positioning them to disrupt neurotransmitter flow between pre- and post-synaptic terminals. This study extends micro- and network-scale theoretical models to explore how varying degrees of synaptic ensheathment affect synaptic communication and network dynamics. Consistent with previous studies, our microscale model shows that ensheathment accelerates synaptic transmission while reducing its strength and reliability, with the potential to effectively switch off synaptic connections. Building on these findings, we integrate an "effective" glial cell model into a large-scale neuronal network. Specifically, we analyze a network with highly heterogeneous synaptic strengths and time constants, where glial proximity parametrizes synaptic parameters. Unlike previous models that assumed normal parameter distributions, our model uses parameters drawn from distinct distributions. This framework is applied to large networks of exponential integrate-and-fire neurons, extending linear response theory to analyze not only firing rate distributions but also noise correlations across the network. Despite the significant heterogeneity in the system, a mean-field approximation accurately captures network statistics. We demonstrate the utility of our model by reproducing experimental findings, showing that microglial ensheathment leads to post-anesthesia hyperactivity in excitatory neurons of mice. Furthermore, we explore how glial ensheathment may be used in the visual cortex to target specific neuronal subclasses, tuning higher-order network statistics.

">An abstract relational map emerges in the human medial prefrontal cortex with consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the structure of a problem, such as the relationships between stimuli, supports fast learning and flexible reasoning. Recent theoretical suggestions have highlighted the usefulness of explicit structural representations that are fully divorced from sensory details for generalisation. Rodent work has suggested that abstraction of structure occurs gradually, over time, in cortex. However, direct evidence of such explicit relational representations in humans is scarce, and its relationship to consolidation mechanisms is underexplored. Here, we use a graph-learning paradigm to find such a relational map in the human medial prefrontal cortex. Importantly, this representation was absent early after learning but emerged on the time scale of days. These results shed new light on neural representations underlying the remarkable human ability to draw accurate inferences from little data.

">Multiple neural pathways to successful visual short-term memory across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive task performance can be supported through multiple neural pathways, a concept referred to as brain degeneracy. We used a novel approach to consider brain degeneracy during a visual short-term memory task (VSTM) across the adult lifespan in the Cam-CAN study (n = 113, 23-87 years old). Our main goal was to identify subgroups of participants whose VSTM performance was characterized by distinct brain activation patterns. First, we identified seven brain modules that responded similarly to the VSTM task and resembled previously identified functional networks (adjusted mutual information [aMI] = 0.45). Subsequently, latent profile analysis revealed four distinct subgroups of participants. Each subgroup was characterized by different recruitment patterns of these brain modules, predominantly in the frontal control module (FCM), visual module (VM), and default mode module (DMM). Subgroups did not differ in demographics or task performance. However, associations between brain activity and performance varied across subgroups, particularly in the FCM, suggesting that individuals may use different cognitive operations to perform the VSTM task. Further analyses revealed group differences in white matter integrity, mostly in the uncinate fasciculus, suggested that individual differences in structural brain properties may shape the different brain activation patterns. Altogether, our study contributes to our understanding of how multiple neural pathways could underlie cognitive performance.

">Fronto-motor circuits linked to subclinical apathy</a></h4>

              
                Apathy is a syndrome characterized by a disruption in effort-reward decision-making, accompanied by structural and functional changes in a related fronto-basal ganglia (BG) network. While activity changes in the primary motor cortex (M1) during effort and reward valuation have been repeatedly observed, previous work on apathy has largely overlooked the connections between the fronto-BG network and M1, potentially missing key circuits in the apathy network. This study addresses this gap by investigating structural and effective connectivity in fronto-M1, fronto-BG-M1, and intra-M1 circuits in relation to subclinical apathy in 45 healthy subjects. Behavior was assessed using a battery of apathy-related questionnaires and computational modeling of effort and reward valuation in a decision-making task. Fronto-motor circuits were examined through a combination of MRI-derived tractography and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, which probed structural and effective connectivity, respectively. The data reveal that apathy scores are associated with both structural and effective connectivity in fronto-M1 and fronto-BG-M1 circuits. Circuits originating from the supplementary motor area primarily index effort valuation, while connectivity in intra-M1 GABAergic circuits correlates exclusively with reward valuation. These findings suggest that distinct fronto-motor circuits are linked to different dimensions of motivated behavior and may constitute specific neuromodulation targets for patients suffering from apathy.

">Amygdala Subregion Volumes and Apportionment in Preadolescents -- Associations with Age, Sex, and Body Mass Index</a></h4>

              
                Importance: The amygdala, a key limbic structure, plays a critical role in emotional, social, and appetitive behaviors that develop throughout adolescence. Composed of a heterogeneous group of nuclei, questions remain about potential differences in the maturation of its subregions during development. Objective: To characterize the associations between developmental variables and amygdala subregion volumes during preadolescence. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD(R)) Study data was collected from 3,953 9- and 10-year-old children between September 1, 2016, and October 15, 2018. Data analysis was conducted between June 1, 2023, and July 30, 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures: Using the CIT168 Amygdala Atlas, nine amygdala subregion volumes were quantified from high-quality MRI scans. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of age, sex, pubertal stage, and body mass index z-score (BMIz) on subregion volumes and their relative apportionment within the amygdala. Results: The study population consisted of 3,953 preadolescents (mean [SD] age, 120 [7.41] months; 1,763 [44.6%] female; 57 [1.4%] Asian, 527 [13.3%] Black, 740 [18.7%] Hispanic, 2,279 [57.7%] white, and 350 [8.9%] from other racial/ethnic groups [identified by parents as American Indian/Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan, other Pacific Islander, or other race]). Distinct associations were observed between age, sex, and BMIz and whole amygdala volume, subregion volumes, and subregion apportionment. Pubertal stage was not related to amygdala subregion volumes. Age was associated with near-global expansion of amygdala subregions during this developmental period. Female sex was linked to smaller volumes in most amygdala subregions, with larger relative apportionment in dorsal amygdala subregions and smaller apportionment in the basolateral ventral paralaminar subregion. Higher BMIz was associated with smaller volumes in large laterobasal subregions, with increased relative apportionment in smaller subregions. Conclusions and Relevance: This cross-sectional study suggests that age, but not pubertal stage, is associated with near-global expansion of the amygdala at ages 9 and 10, while sex and BMIz are linked to distinct changes in amygdala subregions that explain observed differences in total volumes. These findings provide a foundational context for understanding how developmental variables influence amygdala structure in preadolescents, with implications for understanding future risk for brain disorders.

                <p>Autonoetic consciousness (ANC), the ability to re-experience personal past events links episodic memory and self-consciousness by bridging awareness of oneself in a past event (i.e., during its encoding) with awareness of oneself in the present (i.e., during the reliving of a past event). Recent neuroscience research revealed a bodily form of self-consciousness, including the sense of agency (SoA) and the sense of body ownership (SoO) that are based on the integration of multisensory bodily inputs and motor signals. However, the relation between SoA and/or SoO with ANC is not known. Here, we used immersive virtual reality technology and motion tracking and investigated the potential association of SoA/SoO with ANC. For this, we exposed participants to different levels of visuomotor and perspectival congruency, known to modulate SoA and SoO, during the encoding of virtual scenes and collected ANC ratings 1 week after the encoding session. In a total of 74 healthy participants, we successfully induced systematic changes in SoA and SoO during encoding and found that ANC depended on the level of SoA experienced during encoding. Moreover, ANC was positively associated with SoA, but only for the scene encoded with preserved visuomotor and perspectival congruency, and such SoA&ndash;ANC coupling was absent for SoO and control questions. Collectively, these data provide behavioral evidence in a novel paradigm that links a key subjective component of bodily self-consciousness during encoding, SoA, to the subjective reliving of those encoded events from one's past, ANC.</p>

                <p>Animals, humans included, navigate their environments guided by sensory cues, responding adaptively to potential dangers and rewards. Avoidance behaviors serve as adaptive strategies in the face of signaled threats, but the neural mechanisms orchestrating these behaviors remain elusive. Current circuit models of avoidance behaviors indicate that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the ventral striatum plays a key role in signaled avoidance behaviors, but the nature of this engagement is unclear. Evolving perspectives propose the NAc as a pivotal hub for action selection, integrating cognitive and affective information to heighten the efficiency of both appetitive and aversive motivated behaviors. To unravel the engagement of the NAc during active and passive avoidance, we used calcium imaging fiber photometry to examine NAc GABAergic neuron activity in <I>ad libitum</I> moving mice performing avoidance behaviors. We then probed the functional significance of NAc neurons using optogenetics and genetically targeted or electrolytic lesions. We found that NAc neurons code contraversive orienting movements and avoidance actions. However, direct optogenetic inhibition or lesions of NAc neurons did not impair active or passive avoidance behaviors, challenging the notion of their purported pivotal role in adaptive avoidance. The findings emphasize that while the NAc encodes avoidance movements, it is not required for avoidance behaviors, highlighting the distinction between behavior encoding or representation and mediation or generation.</p>

                Introduction In recent years, the number of cardiac surgeries has been on the rise. Several predictive models have been developed to assess the risk of mortality for these patients. EuroSCORE II, a widely used model, demonstrates good discrimination and calibration for the European population, but its accuracy may vary in the Indonesian population. The purpose of this study was to develop a scoring model tailored to Indonesian population, which may have better accuracy in assessing in-hospital mortality risk among adult cardiac surgery patients. Method A retrospective study was conducted using medical records of adult cardiac surgery patients from four participating hospitals. Potential risk factors were included as variables and analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with the L-backward method. Bootstrapping was applied to enhance the model’s validity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for each model, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to assess discrimination ability, while the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to evaluate calibration. Results We extracted data from 4,875 patients, with a mean age of 50.41 years, and most patients were men (63.1%). The majority of patients were in NYHA class I-II. The in-hospital mortality rate was 6.5%. From 62 potential variables, 13 variables were included in the final model. Our new model demonstrated strong discrimination and calibration (AUC 0.7564; Hosmer-Lemeshow p = 0.9510). Conclusion The newly developed scoring model exhibited good discrimination and calibration, making it a promising tool for predicting in-hospital mortality in adult cardiac surgery patients in Indonesia.

                Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has underscored the need for resilient health systems. However, Ghana does not seem to achieve commensurate results, suggesting potential gaps in critical interventions. This study examines these gaps by drawing on global experiences to guide Ghana's preparedness for future emergencies. Methods A scoping review based on the synthesis of published journal articles and grey literature was used to gather relevant evidence to address the study’s objective. Peer-reviewed literature searches were conducted in databases, including Medline, Scopus, and Health Sources, supplemented by searches on organizational websites to identify grey literature. We adopted the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) framework to explore how health systems responded to the COVID-19 pandemic globally and draw lessons for strengthening Ghana's health system resilience. We analyzed policy responses in three main areas: pandemic preparedness, crisis management, and response and recovery. Results Ten strategies emerged from the study as critical in strengthening health system resilience against future pandemics. These strategies include whole-of-government engagement, financing for preparedness, community engagement and trust, robust surveillance systems, emergency medical care, diverse workforce development, digital health integration, critical health infrastructure, well-planned commodities/products, and social capital. Each strategy plays a vital role in enhancing preparedness, response, and recovery efforts, highlighting the multifaceted approach needed to mitigate the impact of future pandemics on health systems. Conclusions The identified strategies align with the attributes of a resilient healthcare system. By adopting these strategies, Ghana can build a resilient healthcare system that effectively addresses future challenges, guided by global insights and experiences.

However, there is no clear consensus on the definitions and methods used to handle and report DAOH in perioperative care studies. Objective We aim to identify, describe, and summarize the available research on DAOH to understand how it is being conceptualized and utilized in clinical studies on perioperative care. Methods We will conduct a scoping review to analyze and synthesize the existing studies using DAOH to measure clinical results on perioperative care. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and CENTRAL. Screening, eligibility, inclusion and data extraction processes will be performed by two reviewers, with a third reviewer solving disagreements. We will present our results descriptively. Conclusions We expect to provide a comprehensive overview of how DAOH is conceptualized and utilized in clinical studies on perioperative care, with particular attention to methodological approaches and the role of electronic health-care records (EHRs) among the different regions.

                <p>by Giacomo Barzon, Ettore Ambrosini, Antonino Vallesi, Samir Suweis</p>

The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions. Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance, manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation, distraction inhibition, and behavioral adaptation. Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks. Therefore, developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance. In this study, we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The methodology relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states (EEG microstates) and optimal transport theory. To validate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test in which participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. The Stroop task is a cognitive test where participants must respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort, thus confirming the framework’s effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions. By utilizing a fully data-driven method, this research opens up fresh perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain.

<i>Vitis vinifera</i>, also known as grapevine, is widely cultivated and commercialized, particularly to produce wine. As wine quality is directly linked to fruit quality, studying grapevine metabolism is important to understand the processes underlying grape composition. Genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) have been used for the study of plant metabolism and advances have been made, allowing the integration of omics datasets with GSMMs. On the other hand, Machine learning (ML) has been used to analyze and integrate omics data, and while the combination of ML with GSMMs has shown promising results, it is still scarcely used to study plants. Here, the first GSSM of <i>V</i>. <i>vinifera</i> was reconstructed and validated, comprising 7199 genes, 5399 reactions, and 5141 metabolites across 8 compartments. Tissue-specific models for the stem, leaf, and berry of the Cabernet Sauvignon cultivar were generated from the original model, through the integration of RNA-Seq data. These models have been merged into diel multi-tissue models to study the interactions between tissues at light and dark phases. The potential of combining ML with GSMMs was explored by using ML to analyze the fluxomics data generated by green and mature grape GSMMs and provide insights regarding the metabolism of grapes at different developmental stages. Therefore, the models developed in this work are useful tools to explore different aspects of grapevine metabolism and understand the factors influencing grape quality.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012492">De novo sensorimotor learning through reuse of movement components</a></h4>

              
                <p>by George Gabriel, Faisal Mushtaq, J. Ryan Morehead</p>

From tying one’s shoelaces to driving a car, complex skills involving the coordination of multiple muscles are common in everyday life; yet relatively little is known about how these skills are learned. Recent studies have shown that new sensorimotor skills involving re-mapping familiar body movements to unfamiliar outputs cannot be learned by adjusting pre-existing controllers, and that new task-specific controllers must instead be learned “de novo”. To date, however, few studies have investigated de novo learning in scenarios requiring continuous and coordinated control of relatively unpractised body movements. In this study, we used a myoelectric interface to investigate how a novel controller is learned when the task involves an unpractised combination of relatively untrained continuous muscle contractions. Over five sessions on five consecutive days, participants learned to trace a series of trajectories using a computer cursor controlled by the activation of two muscles. The timing of the generated cursor trajectory and its shape relative to the target improved for conditions trained with post-trial visual feedback. Improvements in timing transferred to all untrained conditions, but improvements in shape transferred less robustly to untrained conditions requiring the trained order of muscle activation. All muscle outputs in the final session could already be generated during the first session, suggesting that participants learned the new task by improving the selection of existing motor commands. These results suggest that the novel controllers acquired during de novo learning can, in some circumstances, be constructed from components of existing controllers.

                <p>by Alexis Bénichou, Jean-Baptiste Masson, Christian L. Vestergaard</p>

Physical and functional constraints on biological networks lead to complex topological patterns across multiple scales in their organization. A particular type of higher-order network feature that has received considerable interest is network motifs, defined as statistically regular subgraphs. These may implement fundamental logical and computational circuits and are referred to as “building blocks of complex networks”. Their well-defined structures and small sizes also enable the testing of their functions in synthetic and natural biological experiments. Here, we develop a framework for motif mining based on lossless network compression using subgraph contractions. This provides an alternative definition of motif significance which allows us to compare different motifs and select the collectively most significant set of motifs as well as other prominent network features in terms of their combined compression of the network. Our approach inherently accounts for multiple testing and correlations between subgraphs and does not rely on <i>a priori</i> specification of an appropriate null model. It thus overcomes common problems in hypothesis testing-based motif analysis and guarantees robust statistical inference. We validate our methodology on numerical data and then apply it on synaptic-resolution biological neural networks, as a medium for comparative connectomics, by evaluating their respective compressibility and characterize their inferred circuit motifs.

                <p>by Colby Fronk, Jaewoong Yun, Prashant Singh, Linda Petzold</p>

Symbolic regression with polynomial neural networks and polynomial neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are two recent and powerful approaches for equation recovery of many science and engineering problems. However, these methods provide point estimates for the model parameters and are currently unable to accommodate noisy data. We address this challenge by developing and validating the following Bayesian inference methods: the Laplace approximation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, and variational inference. We have found the Laplace approximation to be the best method for this class of problems. Our work can be easily extended to the broader class of symbolic neural networks to which the polynomial neural network belongs.

                <p>by Amanda Craine, Adarsh Krishnamurthy, Christopher T. Villongco, Kevin Vincent, David E. Krummen, Sanjiv M. Narayan, Roy C. P. Kerckhoffs, Jeffrey H. Omens, Francisco Contijoch, Andrew D. McCulloch</p>

In patients with dyssynchronous heart failure (DHF), cardiac conduction abnormalities cause the regional distribution of myocardial work to be non-homogeneous. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using an implantable, programmed biventricular pacemaker/defibrillator, can improve the synchrony of contraction between the right and left ventricles in DHF, resulting in reduced morbidity and mortality and increased quality of life. Since regional work depends on wall stress, which cannot be measured in patients, we used computational methods to investigate regional work distributions and their changes after CRT. We used three-dimensional multi-scale patient-specific computational models parameterized by anatomic, functional, hemodynamic, and electrophysiological measurements in eight patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block (LBBB) who received CRT. To increase clinical translatability, we also explored whether streamlined computational methods provide accurate estimates of regional myocardial work.
We found that CRT increased global myocardial work efficiency with significant improvements in non-responders. Reverse ventricular remodeling after CRT was greatest in patients with the highest heterogeneity of regional work at baseline, however the efficacy of CRT was not related to the decrease in overall work heterogeneity or to the reduction in late-activated regions of high myocardial work. Rather, decreases in early-activated regions of myocardium performing negative myocardial work following CRT best explained patient variations in reverse remodeling. These findings were also observed when regional myocardial work was estimated using ventricular pressure as a surrogate for myocardial stress and changes in endocardial surface area as a surrogate for strain. These new findings suggest that CRT promotes reverse ventricular remodeling in human dyssynchronous heart failure by increasing regional myocardial work in early-activated regions of the ventricles, where dyssynchrony is specifically associated with hypoperfusion, late systolic stretch, and altered metabolic activity and that measurement of these changes can be performed using streamlined approaches.

<p>Concluding Schema: Taken together with our previous reports, histaminergic neurons originating from the ventral tuberomammillary nucleus (VTM) project to the olfactory bulb (OB) without much branching prior to the OB. Their axons (orange lines) extended to the granule cell layer (GCL), the internal plexiform layer (IPL), the mitral cell layer (MCL), the external plexiform layer (EPL), the glomerular layer (GL), and the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) in the OB. The maximal density of histaminergic axions is observed in the GL, followed by the ONL and GCL. The glomerulus is enlarged to show a schematic diagram for synaptic transmission. The <span class="smallCaps">l</span>-histidine decarboxylase–immunoreactive (HDC-ir) profiles received asymmetrical synapses (red arrows) from olfactory nerves (ON) and indicate synapses (green arrow) containing pleomorphic vesicles with postsynaptic densities to nonolfactory nerve elements (non-ON), thus forming serial synapses. It also receives asymmetric transmission (red arrow) from a profile that appears to be mitral/tufted (M/T) cell.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Odor information is modulated by centrifugal inputs from other brain regions to the olfactory bulb (OB). Neurons containing monoamines, such as serotonin, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline, are well known as centrifugal inputs; however, the role of histamine, which is also present in the OB, is not well understood. In this study, we examined the histaminergic neurons projecting from the hypothalamus to the OB. We used an antibody against histidine decarboxylase (HDC), a synthesizing enzyme of histamine, to identify histaminergic neurons and assess their localization within the OB and the ultrastructure of their fibers and synapses using multiple immunostaining laser microscopy, ultra-high voltage electron microscopy (EM), and EM to confirm their relationships with other neurons. To further identify the origin nucleus of the histaminergic neurons projecting to the OB, we injected the retrograde tracer FluoroGold and analyzed the pathway to the OB anterogradely. HDC-immunoreactive (-ir) fibers were abundant in the olfactory nerve (ON) layer compared to other monoamines. HDC-ir neurons received asymmetrical synapses from ONs and formed synapses containing pleomorphic vesicles with variable postsynaptic densities to non-ON elements, thus forming serial synapses. We also confirmed that histaminergic neurons project from the rostral ventral tuberomammillary nucleus to the granule cell layer of the OB and, for the first time, successfully visualized their axons from the hypothalamus to the OB. These findings indicate that histamine may regulate odor discrimination in the OB, suggesting a regulatory relationship between hypothalamic function and olfaction. We thus elucidate morphological mechanisms with tuberomammillary nucleus–derived histaminergic neurons involved in olfactory information.</p>

<p>Expression of dopamine receptors (<i>Drd1</i>, <i>Drd2</i>, <i>Drd3—</i>green) was quantified via RNAScope in HVC, Area X, and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of testosterone treated canaries, along with colocalization of <i>VGlut2</i> (orange), <i>Gad2</i> (red), and <i>Egr1</i> (pink). Illustrated are nuclei studied, dopaminergic projections of PAG, and an example HVC section.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Highly sensitive in situ hybridization procedures (RNAScope) were used to quantify the expression of three dopamine receptors (Drd1, Drd2, and Drd3) in two song control nuclei (HVC and the Area X of the basal ganglia) that are known to receive dopaminergic inputs and in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) of male and female canaries. Both sexes were treated with testosterone to ensure they would sing actively. We also determined the excitatory versus inhibitory phenotype of the cells expressing these receptors as well as their activation following a period of song production. The three receptor types were identified in each brain area, with the exception of Drd3 in Area X. The density of cells expressing each receptor varied as a function of receptor type and brain area. Surprisingly few sex differences were detected; they do not seem to explain the sex differences in testosterone-induced song. Overall, the density of Drd-positive cells was much lower in PAG than in the two song control nuclei. In HVC, the majority of cells expressing the three receptor subtypes were VGlut2-positive, whereas colocalization with Vglut2 occurred in few cells in Area X and in an intermediate proportion of cells in PAG. The number of inhibitory cells expressing dopamine receptors was limited. Most dopaminoceptive cells in Area X did not express either excitatory or inhibitory markers. Finally, cellular activation during singing behavior, as measured by the expression of Egr1, was observed in cells expressing each of the three dopamine receptor subtypes, except Drd3 in the PAG.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After severe corticospinal tract damage poststroke in humans, some recovery of strength and movement proximally is evident. It is possible that alternate motor pathways, such as the reticulospinal tract, may be upregulated to compensate for the loss of corticospinal tract input. We investigated the extent of reticulospinal tract excitability modulation and its inter-dependence on the severity of corticospinal tract damage after stroke in humans.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a novel startle conditioned transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm to elicit ipsilateral motor evoked potentials, an index of reticulospinal tract excitability, in 22 chronic stroke participants with mild to severe corticospinal tract damage and 14 neurotypical age-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was higher in the paretic arm of people with severe corticospinal tract damage compared to their non-paretic arm, people with mild corticospinal tract damage, and age-matched controls. Interestingly, ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was correlated with motor impairment across the entire stroke cohort, whereby individuals with worse impairment exhibited more frequent ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (ie, higher reticulospinal tract excitability).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Following severe corticospinal tract damage, upregulated reticulospinal tract activity may compensate for a loss of corticospinal tract input, providing some proximal recovery of isolated and within-synergy movements, but deficits in performing out of synergy movements and finger fractionation remain. Interventions aimed at modulating the reticulospinal tract could be beneficial or detrimental to ameliorating motor impairment depending on the degree of reliance on this pathway for residual motor output.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1035/v2?src=rss">Role of Artificial intelligence model in prediction of low back pain using T2 weighted MRI of Lumbar spine [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Low back pain (LBP), the primary cause of disability, is the most common musculoskeletal disorder globally and the primary cause of disability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies are inconclusive and less sensitive for identifying and classifying patients with LBP. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the role of artificial intelligence (AI) models in the prediction of LBP using T2 weighted MRI image of the lumbar spine. Methods This was a prospective case-control study. A total of 200 MRI patients (100 cases and controls each) referred for lumbar spine and whole spine screening were included. The scans were performed using 3.0 Tesla MRI (United Imaging Healthcare). T2 weighted images of the lumbar spine were segmented to extract radiomic features. Machine learning (ML) models, such as random forest, decision tree, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, adaboost, and deep learning methods (DL), such as ResNet and GoogleNet, were used, and performance measures were calculated. Results Our study showed that Random forest and AdaBoost are the most reliable ML models for predicting LBP. Random forest showed high performance with area under curve (AUC) values from 0.83 to 0.88 across all lumbar vertebrae and L2-L3, L3-L4, and L4-L5 intervertebral discs (IVDs), with AUCs of 0.88 the highest at L5-S1 IVD (0.92). Adaboost demonstrated high performance at the L2-L5 vertebrae with AUC values of 0.82 to 0.90, with the highest AUC (0.97) at the L5-S1 IVD. Among the DL models, GoogleNet outperformed the other models at 30 epochs with an accuracy of 0.85, followed by ResNet 18 (30 epochs) with an accuracy of 0.84. Conclusion The study demonstrated that ML and DL models can effectively predict LBP from MRI T2 weighted image of the lumbar spine. ML and DL models could also enhance the diagnostic accuracy of LBP, potentially leading to better patient management and outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1187/v1?src=rss">Re-conceptualization of the learning environment as a dynamic system [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In Japanese language education, the term "learning environment" is used in various contexts. This paper investigates the term "learning environment" in previous studies and notes that traditional learning environments have been characterized as "morphological characteristics learning environments" focusing on static learners. However, since learning environments involve a dynamic, reciprocal relationship where learners and their surroundings interact and evolve, the paper advocates for a re-conceptualization of "experiential-ecological learning environments" that captures this dynamic nature. Furthermore, to enrich the experiential-ecological learning environment for learners, the presence of learning environment engineers and the meaningful valuing of environmental enrichments is essential. Lastly, the paper emphasizes that by combining various individual learning experiences, it is possible to create a sustainable and richer learning environment.

                Across species, navigation is crucial for finding both resources and shelter. In vertebrates, the hippocampus supports memory-guided goal-directed navigation, whereas in arthropods the central complex supports similar functions. A growing literature is revealing similarities and differences in the organization and function of these brain regions. We review current knowledge about how each structure supports goal-directed navigation by building internal representations of the position or orientation of an animal in space, and of the location or direction of potential goals. We describe input pathways to each structure – medial and lateral entorhinal cortex in vertebrates, and columnar and tangential neurons in insects – that primarily encode spatial and non-spatial information, respectively. Finally, we highlight similarities and differences in spatial encoding across clades and suggest experimental approaches to compare coding principles and behavioral capabilities across species. Such a comparative approach can provide new insights into the neural basis of spatial navigation and neural computation.

                Zhukovskaya et al. show that during social defeat, stress-susceptible mice have higher initial activity in LHb. Closed-loop LHb activation during defeat produces lasting behavioral and neural substrates of susceptibility. These results highlight the importance of activity levels in the LHb during the stress experience in determining stress outcomes.

                Wong et al. show that the serotonergic neurons of C. elegans secrete exosomes at the onset of the dauer stage. These exosomes contain miRNAs that are preloaded onto Argonaute proteins, which translocate to the germline. After their internalization, the miRNAs silence germline mRNA targets to preserve germ cell integrity.

In addition, a machine learning model was developed to predict human antibody polyreactivity, revealing key features relevant to antibody recognition and drug design.

                Zhu et al. report that hemozoin deposition in the bone marrow following Plasmodium infection induces a sustained myelopoiesis bias through a MyD88-dependent mechanism. This reprogramming results in monocytes producing increased reactive oxygen species, while the myelopoiesis bias enhances cytokine production, supporting emergency myelopoiesis and, ultimately, boosting antibacterial capacity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95774">The conserved genetic program of male germ cells uncovers ancient regulators of human spermatogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species, therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity. However, the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program. Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species, we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level. We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution. Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96831">Astrogliosis and neuroinflammation underlie scoliosis upon cilia dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Cilia defects lead to scoliosis in zebrafish, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood and may diverge depending on the mutated gene. Here, we dissected the mechanisms of scoliosis onset in a zebrafish mutant for the <i>rpgrip1l</i> gene encoding a ciliary transition zone protein. <i>rpgrip1l</i> mutant fish developed scoliosis with near-total penetrance but asynchronous onset in juveniles. Taking advantage of this asynchrony, we found that curvature onset was preceded by ventricle dilations and was concomitant to the perturbation of Reissner fiber polymerization and to the loss of multiciliated tufts around the subcommissural organ. Rescue experiments showed that Rpgrip1l was exclusively required in <i>foxj1a</i>-expressing cells to prevent axis curvature. Genetic interactions investigations ruled out Urp1/2 levels as a main driver of scoliosis in <i>rpgrip1</i> mutants. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies identified neuroinflammation associated with increased Annexin levels as a potential mechanism of scoliosis development in <i>rpgrip1l</i> juveniles. Investigating the cell types associated with <i>annexin2</i> over-expression, we uncovered astrogliosis, arising in glial cells surrounding the diencephalic and rhombencephalic ventricles just before scoliosis onset and increasing with time in severity. Anti-inflammatory drug treatment reduced scoliosis penetrance and severity and this correlated with reduced astrogliosis and macrophage/microglia enrichment around the diencephalic ventricle. Mutation of the <i>cep290</i> gene encoding another transition zone protein also associated astrogliosis with scoliosis. Thus, we propose astrogliosis induced by perturbed ventricular homeostasis and associated with immune cell activation as a novel pathogenic mechanism of zebrafish scoliosis caused by cilia dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95160">Sensory-memory interactions via modular structure explain errors in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                Errors in stimulus estimation reveal how stimulus representation changes during cognitive processes. Repulsive bias and minimum variance observed near cardinal axes are well-known error patterns typically associated with visual orientation perception. Recent experiments suggest that these errors continuously evolve during working memory, posing a challenge that neither static sensory models nor traditional memory models can address. Here, we demonstrate that these evolving errors, maintaining characteristic shapes, require network interaction between two distinct modules. Each module fulfills efficient sensory encoding and memory maintenance, which cannot be achieved simultaneously in a single-module network. The sensory module exhibits heterogeneous tuning with strong inhibitory modulation reflecting natural orientation statistics. While the memory module, operating alone, supports homogeneous representation via continuous attractor dynamics, the fully connected network forms discrete attractors with moderate drift speed and nonuniform diffusion processes. Together, our work underscores the significance of sensory-memory interaction in continuously shaping stimulus representation during working memory.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91304">Topological stress triggers persistent DNA lesions in ribosomal DNA with ensuing formation of PML-nucleolar compartment</a></h4>

              
                PML, a multifunctional protein, is crucial for forming PML-nuclear bodies involved in stress responses. Under specific conditions, PML associates with nucleolar caps formed after RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition, leading to PML-nucleolar associations (PNAs). This study investigates PNAs-inducing stimuli by exposing cells to various genotoxic stresses. We found that the most potent inducers of PNAs introduced topological stress and inhibited RNAPI. Doxorubicin, the most effective compound, induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the rDNA locus. PNAs co-localized with damaged rDNA, segregating it from active nucleoli. Cleaving the rDNA locus with I-PpoI confirmed rDNA damage as a genuine stimulus for PNAs. Inhibition of ATM, ATR kinases, and RAD51 reduced I-PpoI-induced PNAs, highlighting the importance of ATM/ATR-dependent nucleolar cap formation and homologous recombination (HR) in their triggering. I-PpoI-induced PNAs co-localized with rDNA DSBs positive for RPA32-pS33 but deficient in RAD51, indicating resected DNA unable to complete HR repair. Our findings suggest that PNAs form in response to persistent rDNA damage within the nucleolar cap, highlighting the interplay between PML/PNAs and rDNA alterations due to topological stress, RNAPI inhibition, and rDNA DSBs destined for HR. Cells with persistent PNAs undergo senescence, suggesting PNAs help avoid rDNA instability, with implications for tumorigenesis and aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98300">Benchmarking reveals superiority of deep learning variant callers on bacterial nanopore sequence data</a></h4>

              
                Variant calling is fundamental in bacterial genomics, underpinning the identification of disease transmission clusters, the construction of phylogenetic trees, and antimicrobial resistance detection. This study presents a comprehensive benchmarking of variant calling accuracy in bacterial genomes using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing data. We evaluated three ONT basecalling models and both simplex (single-strand) and duplex (dual-strand) read types across 14 diverse bacterial species. Our findings reveal that deep learning-based variant callers, particularly Clair3 and DeepVariant, significantly outperform traditional methods and even exceed the accuracy of Illumina sequencing, especially when applied to ONT’s super-high accuracy model. ONT’s superior performance is attributed to its ability to overcome Illumina’s errors, which often arise from difficulties in aligning reads in repetitive and variant-dense genomic regions. Moreover, the use of high-performing variant callers with ONT’s super-high accuracy data mitigates ONT’s traditional errors in homopolymers. We also investigated the impact of read depth on variant calling, demonstrating that 10× depth of ONT super-accuracy data can achieve precision and recall comparable to, or better than, full-depth Illumina sequencing. These results underscore the potential of ONT sequencing, combined with advanced variant calling algorithms, to replace traditional short-read sequencing methods in bacterial genomics, particularly in resource-limited settings.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97201">Resting natural killer cells promote the progress of colon cancer liver metastasis by elevating tumor-derived stem cell factor</a></h4>

              
                The abundance and biological contribution of natural killer (NK) cells in cancer are controversial. Here, we aim to uncover clinical relevance and cellular roles of NK cells in colon cancer liver metastasis (CCLM). Here, we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and bulk RNA-sequencing datasets to investigate NK cells’ biological properties and functions in the microenvironment of primary and liver metastatic tumors. Results were validated through an in vitro co-culture experiment based on bioinformatics analysis. Useing single-cell RNA-sequencing and ST, we mapped the immune cellular landscape of colon cancer and well-matched liver metastatic cancer. We discovered that GZMK+ resting NK cells increased significantly in tumor tissues and were enriched in the tumor regions of both diseases. After combining bulk RNA and clinical data, we observed that these NK cell subsets contributed to a worse prognosis. Meanwhile, KIR2DL4+ activated NK cells exhibited the opposite position and relevance. Pseudotime cell trajectory analysis revealed the evolution of activated to resting NK cells. In vitro experiments further confirmed that tumor-cell-co-cultured NK cells exhibited a decidual-like status, as evidenced by remarkable increasing CD9 expression. Functional experiments finally revealed that NK cells exhibited tumor-activating characteristics by promoting the dissociation of SCF (stem cell factor) on the tumor cells membrane depending on cell-to-cell interaction, as the supernatant of the co-culture system enhanced tumor progression. In summary, our findings revealed resting NK cells exhibited a clinical relevance with CCLM, which may be exploited for novel strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with CCLM.

">Sounds and Sights in Sequence Learning: Can Accessory Auditory Cues Enhance Motor Task Performance?</a></h4>

              
                Motor sequence learning, or the ability to learn and remember sequences of actions, such as the sequence of actions required to tie ones shoelaces, is ubiquitous to everyday life. Contemporary research on motor sequence learning has been largely unimodal, ignoring the possibility that our nervous system might benefit from sensory inputs from multiple modalities. In this study, we investigated the properties of motor sequence learning in response to auditory-visual stimuli. We found that sequence learning with auditory-visual stimuli showed a hallmark feature of traditional unimodal sequence learning tasks: sensitivity to stimulus timing, where lengthier interstimulus intervals of 500 ms improved sequence learning compared to briefer interstimulus intervals of 200 ms. Consistent with previous findings, we also found that auditory-visual stimuli improved learning compared to a unimodal visual-only condition. Furthermore, the informativeness of the auditory stimuli was important, as auditory stimuli which predicted the location of visual cues improved sequence learning compared to uninformative auditory stimuli which did not predict the location of the visual cues. Our findings suggest a potential utility of leveraging audio-visual stimuli in sequence learning interventions to enhance skill acquisition in education and rehabilitation contexts.

">Endogenous tagging of Munc13-1 with a SNAP tag as a tool for monitoring synapse nanoarchitecture</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic function is governed by highly regulated protein machineries, whose abundance and spatial localization change continually. Studies to determine the dynamic changes in synaptic proteins nanoarchitecture typically rely on immunolabeling, or on the expression of fluorescent proteins. The former employs chemical fluorophores and signal amplification, but re-quires fixation. The latter disturbs the cells minimally, but uses suboptimal fluorophores. Self-labeling tags have been introduced to combine the advantages of these approaches, and here we introduce a knock-in mouse line where the essential synaptic protein Munc13-1 is endogenously fused to the self-labeling SNAP tag. We demonstrate efficient Munc13-1-SNAP labeling in fixed neurons and brain sections by various SNAP dyes, as well as by a novel bright and far-red compound, SBG-SiR-d12, which we introduce here. SBG-SiR-d12 is designed as a membrane impermeable dye, but we repurposed it to stain cytosolic Munc13-1-SNAP in permeabilized, fixed cells and tissue, where we find it outperforms other dyes as evaluated by both conventional and super-resolution microscopy. Finally, we show that Munc13-1-SNAP can also be monitored by live cell imaging. We conclude that the Munc13-1SNAP mouse line is a useful tool for the analysis of Munc13-1 nanoarchitectural dynamics in synapses, with a potential for wide adoption.

">Temporal dynamics and readout latency in perception and iconic memory</a></h4>

              
                Following the offset of complex visual stimuli, rich stimulus information remains briefly available to the observer, reflecting a rapidly decaying iconic memory trace. Traditionally, iconic memory decay is assumed to begin with stimulus offset. Instead, here we found that available information begins decaying already when cues are presented in the final stage of stimulus presentation. Using closely spaced ('micro-timed') readout cues and a theoretical model of information availability, we observed that a cue has to be presented around 10-30 milliseconds before stimulus offset in order to access the full sensory information. We suggest that this does not reflect an early loss in sensory encoding, but instead it is a consequence of a latency in the processing of the cue which postpones the readout of the sensory representation by 10-30 milliseconds. Our analysis also shows that spatial proximity of items in complex arrays impacts sensory representation during both perceptual encoding and initial memory decay. Overall, these results provide a theoretical and empirical characterization of the readout from visual representations, and offer a detailed insight into the transition from perception into iconic memory.

">Thalamic Roles in Conscious Perception Revealed by Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Neuromodulation</a></h4>

              
                The neural basis of conscious perception remains incompletely understood. While cortical mechanisms of conscious content have been extensively investigated, the role of subcortical structures, including the thalamus, remains less explored. We aim to elucidate the causal contributions of different thalamic regions to conscious perception using transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) neuromodulation. We hypothesize that modulating different thalamic regions would result in distinct perceptual outcomes. We apply LIFU in human volunteers to investigate region-specific and sonication parameter-dependent effects. We target anterior (transmodal-dominant) and posterior (unimodal-dominant) thalamic regions, further divided into ventral and dorsal regions, while participants perform a near-threshold visual perception task. Task performance is evaluated using Signal Detection Theory metrics. We find that the high duty cycle stimulation of the ventral anterior thalamus enhanced object recognition sensitivity. We also observe a general (i.e., region-independent) effect of LIFU on decision bias (i.e., a tendency toward a particular response) and object categorization accuracy. Specifically, high duty cycle stimulation decreases categorization accuracy, whereas low duty cycle shifts decision bias towards a more conservative stance. In conclusion, our results provide causal insight into the functional organization of the thalamus in shaping human visual experience and highlight the unique role of the transmodal-dominant ventral anterior thalamus.

	<p>Background. The left and right temporoparietal junctions (TPJs) are two brain areas involved in several brain networks, largely studied for their diverse roles, from attentional orientation to theory of mind and, recently, predictive processing. In predictive processing, one crucial concept is prior precision, that is, the reliability of the predictions of incoming stimuli. This has been linked with modulations of alpha power as measured with electrophysiological techniques, but TPJs have seldom been studied in this framework. Methods. The present article investigates, using magnetoencephalography, whether spontaneous oscillations in pre-stimulus alpha power in the left and right TPJs can modulate brain responses during a linguistic task that requires predictive processing in literal and non-literal sentences. Results. Overall, results show that pre-stimulus alpha power in the rTPJ was associated with post-stimulus responses only in the left superior temporal gyrus, while lTPJ pre-stimulus alpha power was associated with post-stimulus activity in Broca&amp;amp;rsquo;s area, left middle temporal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Conclusions. We conclude that both the right and left TPJs have a role in linguistic prediction, involving a network of core language regions, with differences across brain areas and linguistic conditions that can be parsimoniously explained in the context of predictive processing.</p>

	<p>Objective: Research about the impact of acute stress on inhibitory control remains a contentious topic, with no consensus reached thus far. This study aims to investigate the effects of acute stress on an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s inhibitory control abilities and to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms by analyzing resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Methods: We recruited 32 male college students through participant recruitment information to undergo within-subject experiments under stress and non-stress conditions. Physiological indicators (cortisol and heart rate), self-report questionnaires, and behavioral data from the Stroop task were collected before, during, and after the experiment. Additionally, a five-minute eyes closed resting state EEG data collection was conducted during the Stroop task before. Results: (1) Acute stress led to a reduction in the conflict effect during the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; Stroop task in individuals. (2) Stress resulted in an increase in the power of the beta in the resting state EEG. (3) Acute stress caused an increase in the duration of class D and an increase in the transition probabilities from classes C and B to class D in the microstates of the resting state EEG. (4) Acute stress leads to an increase in beta power values in individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; resting state EEGs, which is significantly negatively correlated with the reduction of the conflict effect in the Stroop task under stress. Conclusions: Acute stress can enhance individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; attentional level, thereby promoting inhibitory control performance.</p>

                <p>Abnormal neuronal morphological features, such as dendrite branching, axonal branching, and spine density, are thought to contribute to the symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the role and molecular mechanisms of aberrant neuronal morphology in the regulation of mood disorders remain poorly characterized. Here, we show that neuritin, an activity-dependent protein, regulates the axonal morphology of serotonin neurons. Male <I>neuritin</I> knock-out (KO) mice harbored impaired axonal branches of serotonin neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex and basolateral region of the amygdala (BLA), and male <I>neuritin</I> KO mice exhibited depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. We also observed that the expression of neuritin was decreased by unpredictable chronic stress in the male mouse brain and that decreased expression of neuritin was associated with reduced axonal branching of serotonin neurons in the brain and with depressive and anxiety behaviors in mice. Furthermore, the stress-mediated impairments in axonal branching and depressive behaviors were reversed by the overexpression of neuritin in the BLA. The ability of neuritin to increase axonal branching in serotonin neurons involves fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, and neuritin contributes to FGF-2-mediated axonal branching regulation in vitro. Finally, the oral administration of an FGF inhibitor reduced the axonal branching of serotonin neurons in the brain and caused depressive and anxiety behaviors in male mice. Our results support the involvement of neuritin in models of stress-induced depression and suggest that neuronal morphological plasticity may play a role in controlling animal behavior.</p>

                <p>Neuronal cytotoxic edema is implicated in neuronal injury and death, yet mitigating brain edema with osmotic and surgical interventions yields poor clinical outcomes. Importantly, neuronal swelling and its downstream consequences during early brain development remain poorly investigated, and new treatment approaches are needed.

After different excitotoxic insults, cytosolic GCaMP6s translocated into the nucleus after a few minutes in a subpopulation of neurons, persisting for hours. We used an automated morphology-detection algorithm to detect neuronal soma and quantified the nuclear translocation of GCaMP6s as the nuclear to cytosolic intensity (<I>N</I>/<I>C</I> ratio). Elevated neuronal <I>N</I>/<I>C</I> ratios occurred concurrently with persistent elevation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads and could also occur independently from neuronal swelling. Electron microscopy revealed that the nuclear translocation was associated with the increased nuclear pore size. The nuclear accumulation of GCaMP6s in neurons led to neocortical circuit dysfunction, mitochondrial pathology, and increased cell death. Inhibiting calpains, a family of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated proteases, prevented elevated <I>N</I>/<I>C</I> ratios and neuronal swelling. In summary, in the developing brain, we identified a calpain-dependent alteration of nuclear transport in a subpopulation of neurons after disease-relevant insults leading to long-term circuit dysfunction and cell death. The nuclear translocation of GCaMP6 and other cytosolic proteins after acute excitotoxicity can be an early biomarker of brain injury in the developing brain.</p>

                <p>GABAergic neurons and GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) are critical elements of almost all neuronal circuits. Most GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs of the CNS are heteropentameric ion channels composed of two &alpha;, two &beta;, and one  subunits. These receptors serve as important drug targets for benzodiazepine (BDZ) site agonists, which potentiate the action of GABA at GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs. Most GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R classifications rely on the heterogeneity of the &alpha; subunit (&alpha;1&ndash;&alpha;6) included in the receptor complex. Heterogeneity of the  subunits (1&ndash;3), which mediate synaptic clustering of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs and contribute, together with &alpha; subunits, to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding site, has gained less attention, mainly because 2 subunits greatly outnumber the other  subunits in most brain regions. Here, we have investigated a potential role of non-2 GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in neural circuits of the spinal dorsal horn, a key site of nociceptive processing. Female and male mice were studied. We demonstrate that besides 2 subunits, 1 subunits are significantly expressed in the spinal dorsal horn, especially in its superficial layers. Unlike global 2 subunit deletion, which is lethal, spinal cord-specific loss of 2 subunits was well tolerated. GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R clustering in the superficial dorsal horn remained largely unaffected and antihyperalgesic actions of HZ-166, a nonsedative BDZ site agonist, were partially retained. Our results thus suggest that the superficial dorsal horn harbors functionally relevant amounts of 1 subunits that support the synaptic clustering of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in this site. They further suggest that 1 containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs contribute to the spinal control of nociceptive information flow.</p>

                <p>Serotonin modulates diverse phenotypes and functions including depressive, aggressive, impulsive, and feeding behaviors, all of which have reward-related components. To date, research has focused on understanding these effects by measuring and manipulating dorsal raphe serotonin neurons and using single-receptor approaches. These studies have led to a better understanding of the heterogeneity of serotonin actions on behavior; however, they leave open many questions about the timing and location of serotonin's actions modulating the neural circuits that drive these behaviors. Recent advances in genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, including the GPCR activation-based sensor for serotonin (GRAB-5-HT), enable the measurement of serotonin release in mice on a timescale compatible with a single rewarding event without corelease confounds. Given substantial evidence from slice electrophysiology experiments showing that serotonin influences neural activity of the striatal circuitry, and the known role of the dorsal medial striatal (DMS) in reward-directed behavior, we focused on understanding the parameters and timing that govern serotonin release in the DMS in the context of reward consumption, external reward value, internal state, and cued reward. Overall, we found that serotonin release is associated with each of these and encodes reward anticipation, value, approach, and consumption in the DMS.</p>

                <p>Emerging research in nonhuman animals implicates cerebellar projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in appetitive behaviors, but these circuits have not been characterized in humans. Here, we mapped cerebello-VTA white matter connectivity in a cohort of men and women using probabilistic tractography on diffusion imaging data from the Human Connectome Project. We uncovered the topographical organization of these connections by separately tracking from parcels of cerebellar lobule VI, crus I/II, vermis, paravermis, and cerebrocerebellum. Results revealed that connections between the cerebellum and VTA predominantly originate in the right cerebellar hemisphere, interposed nucleus, and paravermal cortex and terminate mostly ipsilaterally. Paravermal crus I sends the most connections to the VTA compared with other lobules. We discovered a mediolateral gradient of connectivity, such that the medial cerebellum has the highest connectivity with the VTA. Individual differences in microstructure were associated with measures of negative affect and social functioning. By splitting the tracts into quarters, we found that the socioaffective effects were driven by the third quarter of the tract, corresponding to the point at which the fibers leave the deep nuclei. Taken together, we produced detailed maps of cerebello-VTA structural connectivity for the first time in humans and established their relevance for trait differences in socioaffective regulation.</p>

                <p>Recent visual experience heavily influences our visual perception, but how neuronal activity is reshaped to alter and improve perceptual discrimination remains unknown. We recorded from populations of neurons in visual cortical area V4 while two male rhesus macaque monkeys performed a natural image change detection task under different experience conditions. We found that maximizing the recent experience with a particular image led to an improvement in the ability to detect a change in that image. This improvement was associated with decreased neural responses to the image, consistent with neuronal changes previously seen in studies of adaptation and expectation. We found that the magnitude of behavioral improvement was correlated with the magnitude of response suppression. Furthermore, this suppression of activity led to an increase in signal separation, providing evidence that a reduction in activity can improve stimulus encoding. Within populations of neurons, greater recent experience was associated with decreased trial-to-trial shared variability, indicating that a reduction in variability is a key means by which experience influences perception. Taken together, the results of our study contribute to an understanding of how recent visual experience can shape our perception and behavior through modulating activity patterns in the mid-level visual cortex.</p>

                <p>Targeting altered expression and/or activity of GABA (-aminobutyric acid) transporters (GATs) provide therapeutic benefit for age-related impairments, including cognitive dysfunction. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of GATs are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) upregulates GAT1 and GAT3 expression in the brain, which resulted in cognitive dysfunction. Genetic and pharmacological intervention of STING suppressed the expression of both GAT1 and GAT3, increased the ambient GABA concentration, and therefore, enhanced tonic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> inhibition of principal hippocampal neurons, resulting in spatial learning and working memory deficits in mice in a type I interferon-independent manner. Stimulation of the STING-&gt;GAT pathway efficiently restored cognitive dysfunction in STING-deficient mice models. Our study uncovered for the first time that the STING signaling pathway regulates GAT expression in a cell autonomous manner and therefore could be a novel target for GABAergic cognitive deficits.</p>

                <p>&alpha;-Neurexins are essential and highly expressed presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are frequently linked to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite their importance, how the elaborate extracellular sequences of &alpha;-neurexins contribute to synapse function is poorly understood. We recently characterized the presynaptic gain-of-function phenotype caused by a missense mutation in an evolutionarily conserved extracellular sequence of neurexin-3&alpha; (A687T) that we identified in a patient diagnosed with profound intellectual disability and epilepsy. The striking A687T gain-of-function mutation on neurexin-3&alpha; prompted us to systematically test using mutants whether the presynaptic gain-of-function phenotype is a consequence of the addition of side-chain bulk (i.e., A687V) or polar/hydrophilic properties (i.e., A687S). We used multidisciplinary approaches in mixed-sex primary hippocampal cultures to assess the impact of the neurexin-3&alpha;<sup>A687</sup> residue on synapse morphology, function and ligand binding. Unexpectedly, neither A687V nor A687S recapitulated the neurexin-3&alpha; A687T phenotype. Instead, distinct from A687T, molecular replacement with A687S significantly enhanced postsynaptic properties exclusively at excitatory synapses and selectively increased binding to neuroligin-1 and neuroligin-3 without changing binding to neuroligin-2 or LRRTM2. Importantly, we provide the first experimental evidence supporting the notion that the position A687 of neurexin-3&alpha; and the N-terminal sequences of neuroligins may contribute to the stability of &alpha;-neurexin&ndash;neuroligin-1 trans-synaptic interactions and that these interactions may specifically regulate the postsynaptic strength of excitatory synapses.</p>

                <p>As evidence mounts that the cardiac-sympathetic nervous system reacts to challenging cognitive settings, we ask if these responses are epiphenomenal companions or if there is evidence suggesting a more intertwined role of this system with cognitive function. Healthy male and female human participants performed an approach-avoidance paradigm, trading off monetary reward for painful electric shock, while we recorded simultaneous electroencephalographic and cardiac-sympathetic signals. Participants were reward sensitive but also experienced approach-avoidance "conflict" when the subjective appeal of the reward was near equivalent to the revulsion of the cost. Drift-diffusion model parameters suggested that participants managed conflict in part by integrating larger volumes of evidence into choices (wider decision boundaries). Late alpha-band (neural) dynamics were consistent with widening decision boundaries serving to combat reward sensitivity and spread attention more fairly to all dimensions of available information. Independently, wider boundaries were also associated with cardiac "contractility" (an index of sympathetically mediated positive inotropy). We also saw evidence of conflict-specific "collaboration" between the neural and cardiac-sympathetic signals. In states of high conflict, the alignment (i.e., product) of alpha dynamics and contractility were associated with a further widening of the boundary, independent of either signal's singular association. Cross-trial coherence analyses provided additional evidence that the autonomic systems controlling cardiac-sympathetics might influence the assessment of information streams during conflict by disrupting or overriding reward processing. We conclude that cardiac-sympathetic control might play a critical role, in collaboration with cognitive processes, during the approach-avoidance conflict in humans.</p>

                <p>During adolescence, cannabis experimentation is common, and its association with interindividual variations in brain maturation well studied. Cellular and molecular underpinnings of these system-level relationships are, however, unclear. We thus conducted a three-step study. First, we exposed adolescent male mice to -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or a synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) and assessed differentially expressed genes (DEGs), spine numbers, and dendritic complexity in their frontal cortex. Second, in human (male) adolescents, we examined group differences in cortical thickness in 34 brain regions, using magnetic resonance imaging, between those who experimented with cannabis before age 16 (<I>n</I> = 140) and those who did not (<I>n</I> = 327). Finally, we correlated spatially these group differences with gene expression of human homologs of mouse-identified DEGs. The spatial expression of 13 THC-related human homologs of DEGs correlated with cannabis-related variations in cortical thickness, and virtual histology revealed coexpression patterns of these 13 genes with cell-specific markers of astrocytes, microglia, and a type of pyramidal cells enriched in dendrite-regulating genes. Similarly, the spatial expression of 18 WIN-related human homologs of DEGs correlated with group differences in cortical thickness and showed coexpression patterns with the same three cell types. Gene ontology analysis indicated that 37 THC-related human homologs are enriched in neuron projection development, while 33 WIN-related homologs are enriched in processes associated with learning and memory. In mice, we observed spine loss and lower dendritic complexity in pyramidal cells of THC-exposed animals (vs controls). Experimentation with cannabis during adolescence may influence cortical thickness by impacting glutamatergic synapses and dendritic arborization.</p>

                <p>Decision bias influences estimates of the absolute visual threshold. However, most psychophysical estimates of the murine absolute visual threshold have not taken bias into account. Here we developed a one-alternative forced choice (1AFC) assay to assess the decision bias of mice at the absolute visual threshold via the theory of signal detection and compared our approach with the more conventional high-threshold theoretic approach. In the 1AFC assay, mice of both sexes were trained to signal whether they detected a flash stimulus. We directly measured both hit and false alarm rates, which were used to estimate <I>d'</I>. Using the theory of signal detection, we obtained absolute thresholds by interpolating the intensity where <I>d' </I>= 1 from <I>d'</I>-psychometric functions. This gave bias-independent estimates of the absolute visual threshold which ranged over sixfold, averaging ~1 R* in 1,000 rods (<I>n</I> = 7 mice). To obtain high-threshold theoretic estimates of the absolute visual threshold from the same mice, we estimated threshold intensities from the frequency of seeing curves, corrected for guessing. This gave us thresholds that were strongly correlated with decision bias, ranging over 13-fold and averaged ~1 R* in 2,500 rods. We conclude that the theory of signal detection uses false alarms to overcome decision bias and narrow the range of threshold estimates in mice, providing a powerful tool for understanding detection behavior near absolute visual threshold.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant global health issue. Despite historically higher rates among men, AUD prevalence and negative alcohol-related outcomes in women are rising. Loneliness in humans has been associated with increased alcohol use, and traditional rodent drinking models involve single housing, presenting challenges for studying social enrichment. We developed LIQ PARTI (Lick Instance Quantifier with Poly-Animal RFID Tracking Integration), an open-source tool to examine home cage continuous access two-bottle choice drinking behavior in a group-housed setting, investigating the influence of sex and social isolation on ethanol consumption and bout microstructure in C57Bl/6J mice. LIQ PARTI, based on our previously developed single-housed LIQ HD system, accurately tracks drinking behavior using capacitive-based sensors and RFID technology. Group-housed female mice exhibited higher ethanol preference than males, while males displayed a unique undulating pattern of ethanol preference linked to cage changes, suggesting a potential stress or novelty-related response. Chronic ethanol intake distinctly altered bout microstructure between male and female mice, highlighting sex and social environmental influences on drinking behavior. Social isolation with the LIQ HD system amplified fluid intake and ethanol preference in both sexes, accompanied by sex- and fluid-dependent changes in bout microstructure. However, these effects largely reversed upon resocialization, indicating the plasticity of these behaviors in response to social context. Utilizing a novel group-housed home cage lickometer device, our findings illustrate the critical interplay of sex and housing conditions in voluntary alcohol drinking behaviors in C57Bl/6J mice, facilitating nuanced insights into the potential contributions to AUD etiology.</p>

                Background Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were used or are being used in the manufacturing of products, including consumer-use products. The resulting environmental contamination has led to widespread human exposure. This review aimed to scope the characteristics of evidence covered and applied methodology of evidence to understand -- regardless of any results on the association of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and PFAS -- if a new systematic review would be justified. Methods We systematically identified reports investigating associations of PFAS with GDM following a pre-specified and pre-registered PECO framework and protocol. Results The previous systematic reviews included 8-11 reports and either conducted meta-analyses stratified by comparator, analyzed results based on only high and low exposure categories, or pooled results across comparators. Included 20 reports presented data on 24 PFAS with PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA being examined in almost all. The comparators employed were heterogeneous across the reports. Conclusions Because data from at least one new report on GDM is available since the previous systematic reviews and heterogeneous comparators, an updated systematic review using SWiM could add value to the literature.

                Objective To determine whether economic factors are crucial in empowering women, guiding them towards growth and development opportunities, achieving empowerment, and contributing to two sustainable development goals of the 2030 development agenda: ending poverty and achieving gender equality. Methodology The research was foundational, with a phenomenological and hermeneutic design. The applied technique was in-depth interviews with 12 women who had started a business within the last five years in a region of Peru. Results It is evident that economic factors are decisive in business experiences and decisions, highlighting the necessity of having contingency funds to prevent operational impacts. Through entrepreneurship, women achieved economic independence, enabling them to support their families and impacting their empowerment. It concludes that to promote economic opportunity equality, addressing financing needs, encouraging economic independence, strengthening family empowerment, improving customer management, and facilitating access to government funds are essential. Conclusions The narrative of the participants provides a solid foundation for designing specific policies and support programs that boost the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs and encourage their active participation in the business sphere.

                Introduction Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is characterized by seizures that are difficult to control for a long time and affect development in children who are previously normal or delayed. Therefore, children with DEE should be diagnosed promptly because certain types of the disease respond well to specific medications. In developing countries with limited universal coverage for whole exome sequencing (WES), identifying key clinical features in this patient group will help us make more accurate selections for investigations. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of WES and its common clinical features in children with epileptic encephalopathy. Methods Ten volunteers aged 0-15 years were diagnosed with epilepsy with two or more symptoms of drug-resistant epilepsy, developmental delays, and abnormal nervous system/or dysmorphic features, and their electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal background or specific patterns of epileptiform discharges. These were subjected to WES for the standard > 400 genes in the epilepsy panel. Results The established diagnosis was 4/10. Two known pathogenic variants, SCN2A and PCDH19. Two novel pathological variants, CHD2 and SCN1A. These are drug-resistant epilepsy, which is initially difficult to control and cannot stop antiseizure medications. Out of the 2/4 had moderate to severe intellectual disability. 3/4 had generalized epileptiform discharge activities. Conclusions This study showed a similar detection rate to that of a previous WES study. All the patients had difficult-to-treat epilepsy. For those who have not found abnormalities with the same clinical symptoms, further examinations using other methods should be conducted.

                <p>by Joshua G. Schraiber, Michael D. Edge, Matt Pennell</p>

In both statistical genetics and phylogenetics, a major goal is to identify correlations between genetic loci or other aspects of the phenotype or environment and a focal trait. In these 2 fields, there are sophisticated but disparate statistical traditions aimed at these tasks. The disconnect between their respective approaches is becoming untenable as questions in medicine, conservation biology, and evolutionary biology increasingly rely on integrating data from within and among species, and once-clear conceptual divisions are becoming increasingly blurred. To help bridge this divide, we lay out a general model describing the covariance between the genetic contributions to the quantitative phenotypes of different individuals. Taking this approach shows that standard models in both statistical genetics (e.g., genome-wide association studies; GWAS) and phylogenetic comparative biology (e.g., phylogenetic regression) can be interpreted as special cases of this more general quantitative-genetic model. The fact that these models share the same core architecture means that we can build a unified understanding of the strengths and limitations of different methods for controlling for genetic structure when testing for associations. We develop intuition for why and when spurious correlations may occur analytically and conduct population-genetic and phylogenetic simulations of quantitative traits. The structural similarity of problems in statistical genetics and phylogenetics enables us to take methodological advances from one field and apply them in the other. We demonstrate by showing how a standard GWAS technique—including both the genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) as well as its leading eigenvectors, corresponding to the principal components of the genotype matrix, in a regression model—can mitigate spurious correlations in phylogenetic analyses. As a case study, we re-examine an analysis testing for coevolution of expression levels between genes across a fungal phylogeny and show that including eigenvectors of the covariance matrix as covariates decreases the false positive rate while simultaneously increasing the true positive rate. More generally, this work provides a foundation for more integrative approaches for understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypes and how evolutionary processes shape it.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The introduction of disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) has led to a deceleration of disease course over the years. Although decreased relapse rate constitutes a factor, the role of relapse-associated worsening (RAW) and progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) in MS course deceleration is still unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively examined long-term Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression in patients referred to the MS Center of Montichiari (Italy) and diagnosed with relapsing–remitting MS from 1980 to 2022. To isolate PIRA, we deducted all EDSS changes associated with relapses from overall EDSS change. We compared the relative contribution of PIRA and RAW to EDSS progression in patients diagnosed in different periods using mixed-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,405 patients were included in the study, of whom 231 were diagnosed in 1980–1996 (pre-treatment era), 577 in 1997–2008 (injectable disease-modifying therapy era), and 597 after 2008 (oral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and anti-CD20 era). Across ages, both PIRA and RAW were reduced in patients diagnosed in more recent periods as compared with earlier periods. The average contribution of PIRA to overall EDSS progression was already predominant in patients diagnosed in 1980–1996 (78%) and in 1997–2008 (76%), but it was significantly increased (<i>p</i> = 0.0009) in patients diagnosed in later years (87%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The deceleration of MS course observed throughout the years is determined not only by fewer RAW events, but also by a reduction in PIRA. However, the shift toward a mostly relapse-independent progression highlights the importance of evaluating new therapies based on their effect on PIRA. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The utility of synthetic data in benchmark studies depends on its ability to closely mimic real-world conditions and to reproduce results obtained from experimental data. Here, we evaluate the performance of differential abundance tests for 16S metagenomic data. Building on the benchmark study by Nearing et al. (1), who assessed 14 differential abundance tests using 38 experimental datasets in a case-control design, we validate their findings by generating synthetic datasets that mimics the experimental data. We will employ statistical tests to rigorously assess the similarity between synthetic and experimental data and to validate the conclusions on the performance of these tests drawn by Nearing et al. (1). This protocol adheres to the SPIRIT guidelines and is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind in computational benchmark studies. Methods We replicate Nearing et al.’s (1) methodology, incorporating synthetic data simulated using two distinct tools, mirroring each of the 38 experimental datasets. Equivalence tests will be conducted on 43 data characteristics comparing synthetic and experimental data, complemented by principal component analysis for overall similarity assessment. The 14 differential abundance tests will be applied to both synthetic and experimental datasets, evaluating the consistency of significant feature identification and the number of significant features per tool. Correlation analysis and multiple regression will explore how differences between synthetic and experimental data characteristics may affect the results. Conclusions Synthetic data enables the validation of findings through controlled experiments. We assess how well synthetic data replicates experimental data, validate previous findings and delineate the strengths and limitations of synthetic data in benchmark studies. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first computational benchmark study to systematically incorporate synthetic data for validating differential abundance methods while strictly adhering to a pre-specified study protocol following SPIRIT guidelines, contributing significantly to transparency, reproducibility, and unbiased research.

                Abstract* Background Increased expression of signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 3 (SCUBE3) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) has been thought to influence the fibrosis process in many tissues. However, increased expression of these two factors has never been assessed in pleural fibrosis. Pleural fibrosis is a disease that usually results from various infectious processes, such as empyema. Fibrosis formation is recently known to be prevented by Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the most potent active substance found in Gambir (Uncaria gambir Roxb) leaves. Thus, further research is needed to determine the potential of EGCG to inhibit the process of pleural fibrosis caused by empyema. Methods An in vitro experimental study with post test-only controlled group was conducted on the pleural tissue of all patients who underwent decortication surgery due to empyema at Dr. M. Djamil Hospital, Padang, Indonesia between March 1st and April 30, 2024. Case samples were obtained by consecutive sampling, and three patients who met the inclusion criteria were obtained. Pleural tissue in each patient was then divided into several groups based on the treatment, namely the control group, 50 μg EGCG administration group, and 100 μg EGCG administration group. We used to determine SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression. Data were tested using ANOVA and Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests. Results There were significant differences in the SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression of 50 μg and 100 μg EGCG administration groups and the control groups in the 2 × 2 cm sample preparation (p=0.002) (p=0.014, respectively). Significant differences in TGF-β1 expression were also found between the groups treated with EGCG 50 μg and 100 μg and the control group in the 1 × 1 cm preparation (p=0.019). Conclusion EGCG can potentially decrease SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 expression in patients with pleural empyema.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1179/v1?src=rss">Mega corruptions in mega projects: Debating the dynamics of dam construction in Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study critically examines the dynamics of corruption within Ethiopia’s dam construction projects, focusing on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD the Gilgel Gibe series, and Genale Dawa. The research highlights how weak management practices, insufficient oversight, and centralized decision-making, resulting in contribute to inflated costs, project delays, and compromised construction quality. A comprehensive understanding of these issues is crucial for addressing the challenges that impede Ethiopia’s infrastructure development. Methods A qualitative research approach was employed, integrating both primary and secondary data sources. The study utilized four theoretical frameworks—Principal-Agent Theory, Rent-Seeking Theory, Institutional Theory, and Neo-Patrimonialism—to analyze the structural and behavioral factors enabling corruption in Ethiopia’s dam construction projects. Results The study found that corruption is largely driven by weak management practices, insufficient oversight, and centralized decision-making. These factors contribute to inflated project costs, significant delays, and compromised construction quality. The lack of transparency and inadequate monitoring exacerbate these issues, leading to inefficient resource use and undermining the projects’ intended benefits. Economic impacts include increased public debt and strained financial resources. Socially, corruption erodes public trust and adversely affects the communities involved. The findings also highlight how information asymmetry and misaligned incentives contribute to corruption, with weak governance structures and informal networks further exacerbating the problem. These issues lead to cost overruns, increased debt, and diminished public confidence, which negatively impacts development outcomes. Conclusions While corruption in Ethiopia’s dam construction projects poses significant challenges, it is not insurmountable. Strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks, enhancing institutional capacity, promoting community participation, and leveraging international cooperation are crucial for mitigating these risks. Recommendations include implementing e-procurement systems, establishing independent oversight bodies, and promoting transparency to ensure these mega projects achieve their intended economic and social benefits.

                The year 2023 marked the ten-year anniversary of Chinese President Xi Jinping inaugurating the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during his state visit to Kazakhstan. This article discusses China’s approach towards Central Asian countries under the BRI and their responses. While China has evidently profited from expanding connectivity along the ancient silk road and meeting its strategic interests, it is essential to understand whether Central Asian states have equally benefited from this initiative. Furthermore, the concern of debt-trap diplomacy has been prevalent in low-income countries where BRI has been operational. In this context, the article seeks to locate Central Asia in BRI, evaluating its impact on the region to determine if the BRI is a win-win for both the parties involved as touted by China. This article argues that despite differing interests and concerns about potential debt-traps, the BRI has been largely beneficial for both China and Central Asia given that BRI investments and projects remain crucial for the growth and development of these states and the region.

                Background Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococcus faecalis are pathogenic bacteria of the oral cavity that cause various diseases such as periodontitis and endodontics. These bacteria are easily resistant to antibiotics. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a method of inactivating microorganisms that utilizes light to activate a photosensitizer agent (PS) that produces reactive oxygen species causing cell lysis. Methods This study used the PDI method with a 405 nm diode laser at various energy density with the addition PS curcumin or chlorophyll Alfalfa, as much as 1.6 mg/ml on A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis bacteria. Results The study on E. faecalis bacteria showed that the energy density diode laser irradiation of 1.59 J/cm² gave the percentage of E. faecalis bacteria death 36.7% without PS, 69.30% with the addition of chlorophyll Medicago sativa L and 89.42% with the addition of curcumin. Meanwhile, the bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans showed that the energy density diode laser irradiation of 1.59 J/cm² gave the percentage of bacterial death 35.81% without PS, 64.39% with the addition of chlorophyll Medicago sativa L and 89.82% with the addition of curcumin. PS was critical to the success of the PDI. Conclusions The addition of PS curcumin increased the effectiveness of reducing bacteria E. faecalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans compared to chlorophyll Medicago sativa L.

                Background New methods for processing ‘touch’ or trace biological samples is an ongoing priority for forensic caseworking laboratories. These samples often contain materials from multiple individuals in varying quantities and/or degrees of degradation. Rapid characterization of cellular material before DNA profiling can allow laboratories to screen samples for the presence of multiple contributors or the amount of biological material present. Methods This dataset contains autofluorescence and morphological profiles of epidermal cell populations analyzed using Imaging Flow Cytometry. The epidermal samples were aged for varying amounts of time prior to analysis. Multiple samples from the same individual were also collected to assess profile variations within and across the contributors. Conclusions This data set may be used to investigate variability in epidermal cell populations from different individuals and potential forensic signatures contained within the non-genetic components that comprise touch biological evidence.

                We developed a new time-calibrated tree incorporating primarily endemic along with some cryptic Ryukyu islands cicada data, following the recent publication of global cicada data by Marshall et al. (2018), Łukasik et al. (2018), Simon et al. (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Hill et al. (2021).  A total of 352 specimens were analyzed using BEAST v1. X software with a relaxed clock model. Fossil calibrations as old as Triassic were adopted largely following Johnson et al. (2018) and Moulds (2018), and a Quaternary geological event calibration was adopted following Osozawa et al. (2012, 2021b) and input into BEAST v1. X. Our timetree suggests that Tettigarctidae had a cicada basal lineage as old as 200.63 Ma, with Derotettiginae the next oldest lineage at 99.2 Ma. Tibicininae is a sister of the remaining subfamilies of Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadidae, and their species level differentiation and radiation began at 40.57 Ma. The Cicadinae clade consists of specific tribes with paraphyletic relationship, and the vicariance and adaptive radiation generated many cryptic species in each tribe. We estimated base substitution rate as a function of age, and the result strongly indicates an exponential increase of base substitution rate in recent geologic time. The consequent increase in cicada biodiversity, including generation of cryptic species in the Ryukyu Islands and surroundings, may have been driven by the generation and spreading of C4 grasses and coeval Quaternary climate change.
