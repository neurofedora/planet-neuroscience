<p>by Osman N. Yogurtcu, Margaret E. Johnson</p>

Cell division, endocytosis, and viral budding would not function without the localization and assembly of protein complexes on membranes. What is poorly appreciated, however, is that by localizing to membranes, proteins search in a reduced space that effectively drives up concentration. Here we derive an accurate and practical analytical theory to quantify the significance of this dimensionality reduction in regulating protein assembly on membranes. We define a simple metric, an effective equilibrium constant, that allows for quantitative comparison of protein-protein interactions with and without membrane present. To test the importance of membrane localization for driving protein assembly, we collected the protein-protein and protein-lipid affinities, protein and lipid concentrations, and volume-to-surface-area ratios for 46 interactions between 37 membrane-targeting proteins in human and yeast cells. We find that many of the protein-protein interactions between pairs of proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human and yeast cells can experience enormous increases in effective protein-protein affinity (10–1000 fold) due to membrane localization. Localization of binding partners thus triggers robust protein complexation, suggesting that it can play an important role in controlling the timing of endocytic protein coat formation. Our analysis shows that several other proteins involved in membrane remodeling at various organelles have similar potential to exploit localization. The theory highlights the master role of phosphoinositide lipid concentration, the volume-to-surface-area ratio, and the ratio of 3D to 2D equilibrium constants in triggering (or preventing) constitutive assembly on membranes. Our simple model provides a novel quantitative framework for interpreting or designing <i>in vitro</i> experiments of protein complexation influenced by membrane binding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yfpDHZa0FNA" width="1" />

<p>by Hidetoshi Kono, Shun Sakuraba, Hisashi Ishida</p>

The eukaryotic genome is packaged into a nucleus in the form of chromatin. The fundamental structural unit of chromatin is a protein-DNA complex, the nucleosome, where 146 or 147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1.75 times around a histone core. To function in cellular processes, however, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped. Although this unwrapping has been experimentally investigated, details of the process at an atomic level are not yet well understood. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulation with an enhanced sampling method to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. A free energy change of about 11.5 kcal/mol for the unwrapping agrees well with values obtained in single molecule experiments. This simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating there are many potential paths to outer superhelicdal turn unwrapping, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. At one end of the DNA, the first five bps unwrap, after which a second five bps unwrap at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then starts at the other end of the DNA, where 10 bps are unwrapped. During further unwrapping of 15 bps, the unwrapping advances at one of the ends, after which the other end of the DNA unwraps to complete the unwrapping of the outer superhelical turn. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mW0whYOVxOU" width="1" />

Anatomically based procedures to ablate atrial fibrillation (AF) are often successful in terminating paroxysmal AF. However, the ability to terminate persistent AF remains disappointing. New mechanistic approaches use multiple-electrode basket catheter mapping to localize and target AF drivers in the form of rotors but significant concerns remain about their accuracy. We aimed to evaluate how electrode-endocardium distance, far-field sources and inter-electrode distance affect the accuracy of localizing rotors. Sustained rotor activation of the atria was simulated numerically and mapped using a virtual basket catheter with varying electrode densities placed at different positions within the atrial cavity. Unipolar electrograms were calculated on the entire endocardial surface and at each of the electrodes. Rotors were tracked on the interpolated basket phase maps and compared with the respective atrial voltage and endocardial phase maps, which served as references. Rotor detection by the basket maps varied between 35–94% of the simulation time, depending on the basket’s position and the electrode-to-endocardial wall distance. However, two different types of phantom rotors appeared also on the basket maps. The first type was due to the far-field sources and the second type was due to interpolation between the electrodes; increasing electrode density decreased the incidence of the second but not the first type of phantom rotors. In the simulations study, basket catheter-based phase mapping detected rotors even when the basket was not in full contact with the endocardial wall, but always generated a number of phantom rotors in the presence of only a single real rotor, which would be the desired ablation target. Phantom rotors may mislead and contribute to failure in AF ablation procedures.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/29VabiMChAQ" width="1" />

<p>by Rui Zhen Tan, Keng-Hwee Chiam</p>

Cell size is thought to play an important role in choosing between temporal and spatial sensing in chemotaxis. Large cells are thought to use spatial sensing due to large chemical difference at its ends whereas small cells are incapable of spatial sensing due to rapid homogenization of proteins within the cell. However, small cells have been found to polarize and large cells like sperm cells undergo temporal sensing. Thus, it remains an open question what exactly governs spatial versus temporal sensing. Here, we identify the factors that determines sensing choices through mathematical modeling of chemotactic circuits. Comprehensive computational search of three-node signaling circuits has identified the negative integral feedback (NFB) and incoherent feedforward (IFF) circuits as capable of adaptation, an important property for chemotaxis. Cells are modeled as one-dimensional circular system consisting of diffusible activator, inactivator and output proteins, traveling across a chemical gradient. From our simulations, we find that sensing outcomes are similar for NFB or IFF circuits. Rather than cell size, the relevant parameters are the 1) ratio of cell speed to the product of cell diameter and rate of signaling, 2) diffusivity of the output protein and 3) ratio of the diffusivities of the activator to inactivator protein. Spatial sensing is favored when all three parameters are low. This corresponds to a cell moving slower than the time it takes for signaling to propagate across the cell diameter, has an output protein that is polarizable and has a local-excitation global-inhibition system to amplify the chemical gradient. Temporal sensing is favored otherwise. We also find that temporal sensing is more robust to noise. By performing extensive literature search, we find that our prediction agrees with observation in a wide range of species and cell types ranging from <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> to human Fibroblast cells and propose that our result is universally applicable.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NoOcWYvItXw" width="1" />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu<br />  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. <br /><br />

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Alexandra   Krol, Guoping   Feng<br /> Developmental processes disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders occur rapidly and with temporal precision. During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Steffen BE   Wolff, Bence P   Ölveczky<br /> The development of increasingly sophisticated methods for recording and manipulating neural activity is revolutionizing neuroscience. By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li<br /> Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Andy   Zhou, Benjamin C   Johnson, Rikky   Muller<br /> Closed-loop and responsive neuromodulation systems improve open-loop neurostimulation by responding directly to measured neural activity and providing adaptive, on-demand therapy. To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. <br /><br />

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Miao   He, Z Josh   Huang<br /> Understanding brain circuit organization and function requires systematic dissection of its cellular components. With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Johannes   Kohl, Catherine   Dulac<br /> Parenting is a multicomponent social behavior that is essential for the survival of offspring in many species. Despite extensive characterization of individual brain areas involved in parental care, we do not fully understand how discrete aspects of this behavior are orchestrated at the neural circuit level. Recent progress in identifying genetically specified neuronal populations critical for parenting, and the use of genetic and viral tools for circuit-cracking now allow us to deconstruct the underlying circuitry and, thus, to elucidate how different aspects of parental care are controlled. Here we review the latest advances, outline possible organizational principles of parental circuits and discuss future challenges. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Ashley L   Juavinett, Jeffrey C   Erlich, Anne K   Churchland<br /> Rodent decision-making research aims to uncover the neural circuitry underlying the ability to evaluate alternatives and select appropriate actions. Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Remco   Bredewold, Alexa H   Veenema<br /> To understand how the brain regulates behavior, many variables must be taken into account, with sex as a prominent variable. In this review, we will discuss recent human and rodent studies showing the sex-specific involvement of the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in social and anxiety-related behaviors. We discuss that sex differences can be evident at pre-pubertal ages as seen in the sex-specific regulation of social recognition, social play, and anxiety by the vasopressin system in juvenile rats. We further discuss that the oxytocin system in humans and rodents alters brain activation, anxiety, and sociosexual motivation in sex-specific ways. Finally, we propose that knowledge of vasopressin and oxytocin mediated sex-specific brain mechanisms can provide essential insights into how these neuropeptide systems contribute to sex-specific vulnerability as well as resilience to perturbations, with subsequent relevance to social and emotional disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell<br /> When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Chao   Wang, Maria A   Telpoukhovskaia, Ben A   Bahr, Xu   Chen, Li   Gan<br /> Endo-lysosomal pathways are essential in maintaining protein homeostasis in the cell. Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini<br /> Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. <br /><br />

<p>Thalamus has traditionally been considered as only a relay source of cortical
inputs, with hierarchically organized cortical circuits serially transforming
thalamic signals to cognitively-relevant representations. Given the absence of
local excitatory connections within the thalamus, the notion of thalamic
`relay' seemed like a reasonable description over the last several decades.
Recent advances in experimental approaches and theory provide a broader
perspective on the role of the thalamus in cognitively-relevant cortical
computations, and suggest that only a subset of thalamic circuit motifs fit the
relay description. Here, we discuss this perspective and highlight the
potential role for the thalamus in dynamic selection of cortical
representations through a combination of intrinsic thalamic computations and
output signals that change cortical network functional parameters. We suggest
that through the contextual modulation of cortical computation, thalamus and
cortex jointly optimize the information/cost tradeoff in an emergent fashion.
We emphasize that coordinated experimental and theoretical efforts will provide
a path to understanding the role of the thalamus in cognition, along with an
understanding to augment cognitive capacity in health and disease.

<p>Interactions between brain signals are often measured in terms of information
flow. However, when solving the inverse problem -characterizing the structure
behind a specific functional link- there are many possibilities with very
different consequences. Excitation and inhibition, for instance, may each
produce a causal dependence by coordinating neuronal populations, but
inhibitory connections do not transmit information packages. Here, we introduce
the concept of synaptic Granger causality (sGC), an extension of the well-known
Granger causality approach that quantifies the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory
projections involved in a functional link on the basis of the analysis of time
series constructed using autoregressive models. The method is validated by
using the membrane potential obtained from numerical simulations of neuronal
motifs that mimic extracellular brain activity, similar to the experimentally
measured local field potential. When excitatory and inhibitory synapses are not
mixed, the method correctly predicts the type of synapses that participate in
the signaling. Moreover, when both inputs project on the same neuron or
population, the sGC estimates the proportion of both types of interaction. Our
results suggest that sGC allows for a better inference on the anatomical
structure underlying effective connectivity and its role in the information
process.

<p>Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FND) are carbon-based nanomaterials that can
efficiently incorporate optically active photoluminescent centers such as the
nitrogen-vacancy complex, thus making them promising candidates as optical
biolabels and drug-delivery agents. FNDs exhibit bright fluorescence without
photobleaching combined with high uptake rate and low cytotoxicity. Focusing on
FNDs interference with neuronal function, here we examined their effect on
cultured hippocampal neurons, monitoring the whole network development as well
as the electrophysiological properties of single neurons. We observed that FNDs
drastically decreased the frequency of inhibitory (from 1.81 Hz to 0.86 Hz) and
excitatory (from 1.61 Hz to 0.68 Hz) miniature postsynaptic currents, and
consistently reduced action potential (AP) firing frequency (by 36%), as
measured by microelectrode arrays. On the contrary, bursts synchronization was
preserved, as well as the amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory
events. Current-clamp recordings revealed that the ratio of neurons responding
with AP trains of high-frequency (fast-spiking) versus neurons responding with
trains of low-frequency (slow-spiking) was unaltered, suggesting that FNDs
exerted a comparable action on neuronal subpopulations. At the single cell
level, rapid onset of the somatic AP ("kink") was drastically reduced in
FND-treated neurons, suggesting a reduced contribution of axonal and dendritic
components while preserving neuronal excitability.

<p>Perceptual decision making is the subject of many experimental and
theoretical studies. Whereas most modeling analysis are based on statistical
processes of accumulation of evidence, less attention is being devoted to the
modeling with attractor network dynamics, even though they describe well
psychophysical and neurophysiological data. In particular, very few works
confront attractor models predictions with data from continuous sequences of
trials. Recently however, a biophysical competitive attractor network model has
been used to describe such sequences of decision trials, and has been shown to
reproduce repetition biases observed in perceptual decision experiments. Here
we propose an extension of the reduced attractor network model of Wong and Wang
(2006) to get more insights into such effects. We make explicit the conditions
under which such network can perform a succession of decisions, and show that
the model provides a mathematical framework for studying the effects of a trial
on the decision made on the next one. We study in details the reaction times
properties during a sequence of decision trials, and show that the model
reproduces behavioral data, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In
particular, we find that the decision made on the current trial is biased
toward the one made on the previous trial. More remarkably, we show that, in
the absence of any feedback about the correctness of the decision, the network
exhibits post-error slowing, a subtle effect in agreement with empirical data.

<p>Cross-correlations in the activity in neural networks are commonly used to
characterize their dynamical states and their anatomical and functional
organizations. Yet, how these latter network features affect the spatiotemporal
structure of the correlations in recurrent networks is not fully understood.
Here, we develop a general theory for the emergence of correlated neuronal
activity from the dynamics in strongly recurrent networks consisting of several
populations of binary neurons. We apply this theory to the case in which the
connectivity depends on the anatomical or functional distance between the
neurons. We establish the architectural conditions under which the system
settles into a dynamical state where correlations are strong, highly robust and
spatially modulated. We show that such strong correlations arise if the network
exhibits an effective feedforward structure. We establish how this feedforward
structure determines the way correlations scale with the network size and the
degree of the connectivity. In networks lacking an effective feedforward
structure correlations are extremely small and only weakly depend on the number
of connections per neuron. Our work shows how strong correlations can be
consistent with highly irregular activity in recurrent networks, two key
features of neuronal dynamics in the central nervous system.

As smartphone usage has become increasingly prevalent in our society, so have rates of depression, particularly among young adults. Individual differences in smartphone usage patterns have been shown to reflect individual differences in underlying affective processes such as depression (Wang et al., in press), where depressive symptoms and duration of phone usage were previously linked. In the current study, we identified a positive relationship between smartphone screen time (e.g. phone unlock duration) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the subgenual cingulate cortex (sgCC), a brain region implicated in depression and antidepressant treatment response, and regions of the ventromedial/orbitofrontal cortex, such that increased phone usage was related to stronger connectivity between these regions. We then used this cluster to constrain subsequent analyses looking at depressive symptoms in the same cohort and observed replication in a separate cohort. We believe the data and analyses presented here provide proof-of-concept analyses and a first step in combining functional brain activity and smartphone usage patterns to better understand issues related to mental health. Smartphones are a prevalent part of modern life and show promise in being a tool for mental health diagnostics and neuroscience research.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/276535v1?rss=1">Where and how our brain represents the temporal structure of observed action</a></h4>

Reacting faster to the behavior of others provides evolutionary advantages. Reacting to unpredictable events takes hundreds of milliseconds. Understanding where and how the brain represents what actions are likely to follow one another is therefore important. Everyday actions are predictable sequences of acts, yet neuroscientists focus on how brains responds to unexpected, individual motor acts. Using fMRI we show the brain encodes sequence-specific information in the motor system. Using EEG, we show visual responses were faster and smaller for predictable sequences that recruit the motor system. This study shifts the study of action observation from single acts to motor sequences, informs how we adapt to the actions of others and suggests the motor system may implement perceptual predictive coding.

Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein are the neuropathological hallmark of progressive disorders called synucleinopathies. Alpha-synuclein fibrils are associated with transmissive cell-to-cell propagation of pathology. We report the structure of an alpha-synuclein fibril (residues 1-121) determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.4 Angstrom resolution. Two protofilaments form a polar fibril composed of staggered {beta}-strands. The backbone of residues 38 to 95, including the fibril core and the non-amyloid component region, are well resolved in the EM map. Residues 50-57, containing three mutation sites associated with familial synucleinopathies, form the interface between the two protofilaments and contribute to fibril stability. A hydrophobic cleft may have implications for fibril elongation, and inform the rational design of molecules for diagnosis and treatment of synucleinopathies.

Understanding neural circuit function requires individually addressing their component parts: specific neuronal cell types. However, the precise genetic mechanisms specifying neuronal cell types remain obscure. While most genes are expressed in the brain, the vast majority are expressed in many different kinds of neurons, suggesting that promoters are not sufficiently specific to distinguish cell types. We therefore examined distal genetic cis-regulatory elements controlling transcription (i.e. enhancers) in closely related mouse cortical subregions. We identified thousands of novel putative enhancers, many unique to particular cortical subregions. Remarkably, following pronuclear injection of constructs containing such enhancers, we obtained transgenic lines driving expression in distinct sets of cells specifically in the targeted cortical subregions. This not only helps illuminate the genetic mechanisms underlying the specification of diverse neuronal cell types, it provides a general strategy for the development of genetic tools targeting any neuronal circuit of interest via Enhancer-Driven Gene Expression (EDGE).

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275768v1?rss=1">Individual Variation in Brain Network Topology and Social Cognitive Ability</a></h4>

Background: Social cognitive ability is a significant determinant of functional outcome and deficits in social cognition are a disabling symptom of psychotic disorders. The neurobiological underpinnings of social cognition are not well understood, hampering our ability to ameliorate these deficits. Objective: Using a data-driven approach, we sought to identify the brain network basis of social cognition using a combination of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and a validated measure of social cognition. Methods: Study participants included 60 participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 46 healthy comparison participants. All participants underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. Social cognition was measured using the MATRICS battery of cognitive tests. A data-driven, connectome-wide analysis of brain connectivity examined how each individual brain voxel's connectivity correlated with social cognitive performance using multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR). Results: We identified a region in the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) where individual network topology predicted social cognitive ability. Specifically, the association of this region with the Default Mode Network predicted higher social cognitive performance and association with the Dorsal Attention Network predicted poorer performance. This correlation was observed in both schizophrenia and healthy comparison participants. Conclusion: Previous studies have demonstrated individual variance in brain network topology but the cognitive or behavioral relevance of these differences was undetermined. We observe that the left SPL, a region of high individual variance at the cytoarchitectonic level, also demonstrates individual variance in its association with large scale brain networks and that network topology predicts complex cognitive ability.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/274779v1?rss=1">Uncertainpy: A Python toolbox for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis in computational neuroscience.</a></h4>

Computational models in neuroscience typically contain many parameters that are poorly constrained by experimental data. Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis provide rigorous procedures to quantify how the model output depends on this parameter uncertainty. Unfortunately, the application of such methods is not yet standard within the field of neuroscience. Here we present Uncertainpy, an open-source Python toolbox, tailored to perform uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of neuroscience models. Uncertainpy aims to make it easy and quick to get started with uncertainty analysis, without any need for detailed prior knowledge. The toolbox allows uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis to be performed on already existing models without needing to modify the model equations or model implementation. Uncertainpy bases its analysis on polynomial chaos expansions, which are more efficient than the more standard Monte-Carlo based approaches. Uncertainpy is tailored for neuroscience applications by its built-in capability for calculating characteristic features in the model output. The toolbox does not merely perform a point-to-point comparison of the "raw'' model output (e.g. membrane voltage traces), but can also calculate the uncertainty and sensitivity of salient model response features such as spike timing, action potential width, mean interspike interval, and other features relevant for various neural and neural network models. Uncertainpy comes with several common models and features built in, and including custom models and new features is easy. The aim of the current paper is to present Uncertainpy for the neuroscience community in a user-oriented manner. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we perform an uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis on three case studies relevant for neuroscience: the original Hodgkin-Huxley point-neuron model for action potential generation, a multi-compartmental model of a thalamic interneuron implemented in the NEURON simulator, and a sparsely connected recurrent network model implemented in the NEST simulator.

UBR1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase best known for its ability to target protein degradation by the N-end rule. The physiological functions of UBR family proteins, however, remain not fully understood. We found that the functional loss of C. elegans UBR-1 leads to a specific motor deficit: when adult animals generate reversal movements, A-class motor neurons exhibit synchronized activation, preventing body bending. This motor deficit is rescued by removing GOT-1, a transaminase that converts aspartate to glutamate. Both UBR-1 and GOT-1 are expressed and critically required in premotor interneurons of the reversal motor circuit to regulate the motor pattern. ubr-1 and got-1 mutants exhibit elevated and decreased glutamate level, respectively. These results raise an intriguing possibility that UBR proteins regulate glutamate metabolism, which is critical for neuronal development and signaling.

Addiction is a chronic disorder with an elevated risk of relapse, even after long periods of abstinence. Some of the neural mechanisms mediating addictions require protein synthesis, which could be relevant for the development of more effective treatments. The mTOR signaling pathway regulates protein synthesis processes that have recently been linked to the development of drug addiction. Thus, we have assessed the effects of morphine self-administration and its subsequent extinction on the expression of several genes that act in this pathway, and on the levels of some phosphoproteins in three brain areas related to reward learning and extinction: the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens, and the prefrontal cortex. We found an increase in Raptor and Eif4ebp2 gene expression in the amygdala of rats that self-administered morphine, and this persisted beyond the extinction period. The expression of Insr in the amygdala of control animals decreased over time while the opposite effect was seen in the rats that self-administered morphine. We also found a strong correlation between some of the biochemical variables measured and behavioral traits, suggesting a significant role for the genes and phosphoproteins identified, mostly in the amygdala, in the behavioral effects of morphine.

The global efforts towards the creation of a molecular census of the brain using single-cell transcriptomics is generating a large catalog of molecularly defined cell types lacking spatial information. Thus, new methods are needed to map a large number of cell-specific markers simultaneously on large tissue areas. Here, we developed a cyclic single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization methodology and defined the cellular organization of the somatosensory cortex using markers identified by single-cell transcriptomics.

As previously established, chronic agonistic interactions lead to the development of depression-like state under social defeat stress in the defeated mice and pathology of aggressive behavior in the winning mice. According to the numerous research data, these psychopathological states are accompanied by tremendous molecular and cellular changes in the brain. The paper aimed to study the influence of 20-day period of agonistic interactions on the expression mode of collagen family genes, encoding the proteins, which are basic components of extracellular matrix (ECM), in the different brain regions of mice using the RNA-Seq database. Most of the differentially expressed collagen genes were upregulated in the hypothalamus and striatum of chronically aggressive and defeated mice and in the hippocampus of the defeated mice. In the ventral tegmental area the most genes were downregulated in both experimental groups. It has been assumed that aberrant expression of collagen genes induced by long experience of agonistic interactions can indicate defects of ECM specific for brain regions in mice with alternative social experiences. This study first shows remodeling of molecular base in the ECM under development of experimental psychoneuropathologies.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275958v1?rss=1">Epiretinal stimulation with local return enhances selectivity at cellular resolution</a></h4>

Epiretinal prostheses are designed to restore vision in people blinded by photoreceptor degenerative diseases, by directly activating retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) using an electrode array implanted on the retina. In present-day clinical devices, current spread from the stimulating electrode to a distant return electrode often results in the activation of many cells, limiting the quality of artificial vision. In the laboratory, epiretinal activation of RGCs with cellular resolution has been demonstrated with small electrodes, but distant returns may still cause more current spread than necessary. In this study, the ability of local return stimulation to improve the selective activation of RGCs at cellular scale was evaluated. A custom multi-electrode array (512 electrodes, 10 m diameter, 60 m pitch) was used to simultaneously stimulate and record from RGCs in isolated primate retina. Stimulation with a single electrode and a distant return was compared to stimulation in which the return was provided by six neighboring electrodes. Local return stimulation enhanced the capability to activate cells near the central electrode (&lt;30 m) while avoiding cells farther away (&gt;30 m). These results suggest that a device that restricts the electric field through local returns could optimize activation of neurons at cellular resolution, improving the quality of artificial vision.

<div class="section" id="ana25165-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>In a multicenter registry-based study (Novel Oral Anticoagulants in Stroke Patients collaboration; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02353585) of patients with stroke while taking rivaroxaban, we compared RivLev in patients with AIS and ICH. We determined how many AIS patients had RivLev ≤ 100ng/ml, indicating possible eligibility for thrombolysis, and how many ICH patients had RivLev ≥ 75ng/ml, making them possibly eligible for the use of specific reversal agents. We explored factors associated with RivLev (Spearman correlation, regression models) and studied the sensitivity and specificity of international normalized ratio (INR) thresholds to substitute RivLev using cross tables and receiver operating characteristic curves.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25165-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Among 241 patients (median age = 80 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 73–84; median time from onset to admission = 2 hours, IQR = 1–4.5 hours; median RivLev = 89ng/ml, IQR = 31–194), 190 had AIS and 51 had ICH. RivLev was similar in AIS patients (82ng/ml, IQR = 30–202) and ICH patients (102ng/ml, IQR = 51–165; <em>p</em> = 0.24). Trough RivLev<sub>(≤137ng/ml)</sub> occurred in 126/190 (66.3%) AIS and 34/51 (66.7%) ICH patients. Among AIS patients, 108/190 (56.8%) had RivLev ≤ 100ng/ml. In ICH patients, 33/51 (64.7%) had RivLev ≥ 75ng/ml. RivLev was associated with rivaroxaban dosage, and inversely with renal function and time since last intake (each <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05). INR ≤ 1.0 had a specificity of 98.9% and a sensitivity of 25.7% to predict RivLev ≤ 100ng/ml. INR ≥ 1.4 had a sensitivity of 59.3% and specificity of 90.1% to predict RivLev ≥ 75ng/ml.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25165-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>RivLev did not differ between patients with AIS and ICH. Half of the patients with AIS under rivaroxaban had a RivLev low enough to consider thrombolysis. In ICH patients, two-thirds had a RivLev high enough to meet the eligibility for the use of a specific reversal agent. INR thresholds perform poorly to inform treatment decisions in individual patients. Ann Neurol 2018.</p></div></div>

Head motion during MRI scanning influence estimates of cortical morphology. Previous studies have found that older adults demonstrate greater head motion than younger adults, while other studies have found task-related differences in head motion. Cortical morphology also differ with age, as measured by cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, and gyrification. Here I replicated all three of these prior findings within a larger dataset than these results have been demonstrated previously, with a sample size of more than 600 adults across the adult lifespan (Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience, CamCAN). Furthermore, I additionally test for the influence of head motion on cortical fractal dimensionality and gyrification; effects were statistically significant in some cases, but small in magnitude.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275826v1?rss=1">Task-induced deactivation in diverse brain systems correlates with interindividual differences in distinct autonomic indices</a></h4>

Neuroimaging research has shown that different cognitive tasks induce relatively specific activation patterns, as well as less task-specific deactivation patterns. Here we examined whether individual differences in Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity during task performance correlate with the magnitude of task-induced deactivation. In an fMRI study, participants performed a continuous mental arithmetic task in a task/rest block design, while undergoing combined fMRI and heart/respiration rate acquisitions using photoplethysmograph and respiration belt. As expected, task performance increased heart-rate and reduced the RMSSD, a cardiac index related to vagal tone. Across participants, higher heart rate during task was linked to increased activation in fronto-parietal regions, as well as to stronger deactivation in ventromedial prefrontal regions. Respiration frequency during task was associated with similar patterns, but in different regions than those identified for heart-rate. Finally, in a large set of regions, almost exclusively limited to the Default Mode Network, lower RMSSD was associated with greater deactivation, and furthermore, the vast majority of these regions were task-deactivated at the group level. Together, our findings show that inter-individual differences in ANS activity are strongly linked to task-induced deactivation. Importantly, our findings suggest that deactivation is a multifaceted construct potentially linked to ANS control, because distinct ANS measures correlate with deactivation in different regions. We discuss the implications for current theories of cortical control of the ANS and for accounts of deactivation, with particular reference to studies documenting a "failure to deactivate" in multiple clinical states.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275818v1?rss=1">Why not record from every channel with a CMOS scanning probe?</a></h4>

Neural recording devices normally require one output connection for each electrode. This constrains the number of electrodes that can be accommodated by the thin shafts of implantable probes. Sharing a single output connection between multiple electrodes relaxes this constraint and permits designs of ultra-high density neural probes. Here we report the design and in vivo validation of such a device, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scanning probe with 1344 electrodes and 12 reference electrodes along an 8.1 mm x 100 m x 50 m shaft; the outcome of the European research project NeuroSeeker. This technology presented new challenges for data management and visualization, and we also report new methods addressing these challenges developed within NeuroSeeker. Scanning CMOS technology allows the fabrication of much smaller, denser electrode arrays. To help design electrode configurations for future probes, several recordings from many different brain regions were made with an ultra-dense passive probe fabricated using CMOS process. All datasets are available online.

Several recent studies have demonstrated the association of cat-related injuries with major depression and with depressiveness in the general population. It was suggested that cat-scratch disease, the infection with the bacterium Bartonella henselae, can be responsible for the observed association. However, no direct evidence for the role of the Bartonella infection in this association has been published until now. In this preregistered case-controls study performed on 250 healthy subjects tested earlier for the presence of anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies, we searched for the positive association between presence of anamnestic anti-Bartonella IgG antibodies and depressiveness measured with Beck II inventory, depression subscale of neuroticism measured with N-70 questionnaire, and self-reported health problems. We found that that Bartonella-seropositivity was positively correlated with Beck depression only in Toxoplasma-seronegative men and negatively correlated with health in Toxoplasma-seronegative women. Bartonella seropositivity expressed protective effects against Toxoplasma seropositivity-associated increased neuroticism in men while Toxoplasma-seropositivity expressed protective effects against Bartonella seropositivity-associated health problems in women. A comparison of the patterns of association of mental and physical health problems with Bartonella seropositivity and with reported cat-related injury suggests that different factor, possibly infection with different pathogen transmitted by cat related-injuries than the Bartonella henselae, is responsible for the observed association of cat related-injuries with depressiveness and major depression. The existence of complex interactions between Bartonella seropositivity, Toxoplasma seropositivity, and sex also suggest that the effect of symbionts on the host's phenotype must by always studied in the context of other infections, and separately for men and women.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the herpetic virus, which infects 45-100% people worldwide. Many reports suggest that CMV could impair cognitive functions of infected subjects. Here we searched for indices of effects of CMV on infected subjects' intelligence and knowledge. The Intelligence Structure Test I S T 2000 R was used to compare IQ of 148 CMV infected and 135 CMV free university students. Infected students expressed higher intelligence. Paradoxically, their IQ decreased with decreasing concentration of anti CMV antibodies, which can be used, statistically, as a proxy of the time passed from the moment of infection in young subjects when the age of subjects is statistically controlled. The paradox of seemingly higher intelligence of CMV infected subjects could be explained by the presence of the subpopulation of about 5-10 % CMV positive individuals in the population of "CMV negative students". These false negative subjects had probably not only the oldest infections and therefore the lowest concentration of anamnestic antibodies, but also the lowest intelligence among the infected students. Prevalence of CMV infection in all countries is very high, approaching sometimes 90 %. Therefore, the total impact of CMV on human intelligence may be large.

Decisions must often be made in the face of uncertain evidence. It has been proposed that the brain utilizes its neuromodulatory brainstem systems to broadcast uncertainty signals across the brain, thereby triggering changes in global brain state and neural plasticity. Recent animal work indicates that task-evoked responses in neuromodulatory systems signal two computational variables, at different times during perceptual decisions: decision confidence (i.e., the complement of uncertainty) before feedback and prediction errors (i.e., deviations from expected reward) after feedback. Neuromodulatory systems also regulate central arousal state. We here monitored pupil diameter, a marker of central arousal state, while human subjects performed a challenging perceptual choice task with delayed monetary reward. We quantified evoked pupil responses during decision formation and after reward feedback. During both intervals, decision difficulty and accuracy had interacting effects on pupil responses. This interaction reflected decision uncertainty prior to feedback and prediction error after feedback. Critically, the pattern of pupil responses during both intervals was in line with a model that uses the decision-maker's graded belief in choice accuracy to anticipate rewards and compute prediction errors. We conclude that pupil-linked arousal systems are modulated by internal belief states, in line with recent insights into dopamine signaling.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275727v1?rss=1">Visual encoding signals around 200 milliseconds track onset of evidence accumulation during human decision making</a></h4>

Previous research has shown that potentials collected from human electroencephalographic (EEG) records track evidence accumulation during perceptual decision making (O'Connell et al., 2012; Philiastides et al., 2014; Loughnane et al., 2016). However these studies relied on comparing differences across experimental conditions. In this study, we directly tested the hypothesis that N200 latencies (EEG stimulus-locked negative peaks occurring between 150 and 275 milliseconds in female and male human subjects) reflect visual processing time that occurs before evidence accumulation, labeled visual encoding time (VET), in the context of cognitive theory. Simulations of decision-making models show that differences in processes not related to evidence accumulation are tracked by early reaction time percentiles. The hypothesis that N200 latencies are analogs of VET was thus directly tested by quantifying 1-to-1 slope relationships in 1) linear regression between trial-averaged N200 latencies and early reaction time percentiles, 2) linear regression between single-trial N200 latencies and reaction times, and 3) parameter estimation of cognitive models of decision-making. Evidence was found of near 1-to-1 correspondence in each test. Deflection times of the N200 waveform were not found to have a significant relationship with early reaction time percentiles, suggesting that a certain threshold of initial extrastriate activity is necessary before evidence accumulation. N200 waveforms were projected to the cortical surface at temporal and extrastriate locations from a spline-Laplacian transformation, and are thus hypothesized to reflect the segregation from noise of the target stimulus. This research adds credence to the mounting evidence that N200 latencies track onset of evidence accumulation.

Biogenic amine neurotransmitters play a central role in metazoan nervous systems, and both their chemical structures and cognate receptors are evolutionarily highly conserved. In the nematode C. elegans, four classical neurotransmitters - serotonin, dopamine, octopamine, and tyramine - have been detected and appear to serve signaling functions related to those in insects or vertebrates (1). Interestingly, one of the small molecule pheromones released by C. elegans incorporates the monoamine octopamine. Octopamine succinylated ascaroside #9 (osas#9) is biochemically derived by connecting the neurotransmitter octopamine to an ascaroside - a universal building block of pheromones in C. elegans (2, 3). Neuronal ablation, cell-specific genetic rescue, and calcium imaging show that tyra-2, a gene coding for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), expression in the nociceptive neuron ASH is both necessary and sufficient to induce avoidance of osas#9. In contrast, expression of tyra-2 in AWA, a neuron pair primarily involved in attraction, reverses the behavioral response to osas#9. These results show that TYRA-2 serves as a receptor for the neurotransmitter-derived osas#9, and thus may function in both internal signaling and sensation of external signals. The TYRA-2/osas#9 signaling system thus provides an example for the evolution of an inter-organismal communication channel via co-option of a small-molecule signal and its cognate receptor.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275644v1?rss=1">Channelrhodopsin variants engage distinct patterns of network activity</a></h4>

Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels that enable cell type-specific activation of neurons or neural circuits. Channelrhodopsin-2 has been widely used as a tool to probe circuit function in vitro and in vivo. Several recently developed ChR variants are characterized by faster kinetics and reduced desensitization. However, little is known about how their varying properties may regulate their interaction with local network dynamics. We compared ChR-evoked patterns of multi-unit activity and local field potentials in primary visual cortex of mice expressing three ChR variants with distinct temporal profiles: Chronos, Chrimson, and ChR2. We assessed overall activation of by measuring the amplitude and temporal progression of evoked spiking. Using gamma-range (30-80Hz) LFP power as an assay for local network engagement, we examined the recruitment of cortical network activity by each tool. All ChR variants caused light-evoked increases in firing in vivo, but each demonstrated different temporal patterning of evoked activity. In addition, the three ChRs had distinct effects on cortical gamma-band activity. Our findings suggest that variations in the kinetics of optogenetic tools can substantially affect their efficacy in neural networks in vivo, as well as the manner in which their activation engages circuit resonance.

<p>by Helen R. Fryer, Steven M. Wolinsky, Angela R. McLean</p>

Although antiretroviral drug therapy suppresses human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) to undetectable levels in the blood of treated individuals, reservoirs of replication competent HIV-1 endure. Upon cessation of antiretroviral therapy, the reservoir usually allows outgrowth of virus and approaches to targeting the reservoir have had limited success. Ongoing cycles of viral replication in regions with low drug penetration contribute to this persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to illustrate a new approach to eliminating the part of the reservoir attributable to persistent replication in drug sanctuaries. Reducing the residency time of CD4 T cells in drug sanctuaries renders ongoing replication unsustainable in those sanctuaries. We hypothesize that, in combination with antiretroviral drugs, a strategy to orchestrate CD4 T cell trafficking could contribute to a functional cure for HIV-1 infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pRlEmfNB4Ng" width="1" />

<p>by Lauric A. Ferrat, Marc Goodfellow, John R. Terry</p>

Neural mass models (NMMs) are increasingly used to uncover the large-scale mechanisms of brain rhythms in health and disease. The dynamics of these models is dependent upon the choice of parameters, and therefore it is crucial to be able to understand how dynamics change when parameters are varied. Despite being considered low dimensional in comparison to micro-scale, neuronal network models, with regards to understanding the relationship between parameters and dynamics, NMMs are still prohibitively high dimensional for classical approaches such as numerical continuation. Therefore, we need alternative methods to characterise dynamics of NMMs in high dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we introduce a statistical framework that enables the efficient exploration of the relationship between model parameters and selected features of the simulated, emergent model dynamics of NMMs. We combine the classical machine learning approaches of trees and random forests to enable studying the effect that varying multiple parameters has on the dynamics of a model. The method proceeds by using simulations to transform the mathematical model into a database. This database is then used to partition parameter space with respect to dynamic features of interest, using random forests. This allows us to rapidly explore dynamics in high dimensional parameter space, capture the approximate location of qualitative transitions in dynamics and assess the relative importance of all parameters in the model in all dimensions simultaneously. We apply this method to a commonly used NMM in the context of transitions to seizure dynamics. We find that the inhibitory sub-system is most crucial for the generation of seizure dynamics, confirm and expand previous findings regarding the ratio of excitation and inhibition, and demonstrate that previously overlooked parameters can have a significant impact on model dynamics. We advocate the use of this method in future to constrain high dimensional parameter spaces enabling more efficient, person-specific, model calibration.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RmZNyRo2Y1Y" width="1" />

<p>by Benjamin Schubert, Charlotta Schärfe, Pierre Dönnes, Thomas Hopf, Debora Marks, Oliver Kohlbacher</p>

Immunogenicity is a major problem during the development of biotherapeutics since it can lead to rapid clearance of the drug and adverse reactions. The challenge for biotherapeutic design is therefore to identify mutants of the protein sequence that minimize immunogenicity in a target population whilst retaining pharmaceutical activity and protein function. Current approaches are moderately successful in designing sequences with reduced immunogenicity, but do not account for the varying frequencies of different human leucocyte antigen alleles in a specific population and in addition, since many designs are non-functional, require costly experimental post-screening.
Here, we report a new method for de-immunization design using multi-objective combinatorial optimization. The method simultaneously optimizes the likelihood of a functional protein sequence at the same time as minimizing its immunogenicity tailored to a target population. We bypass the need for three-dimensional protein structure or molecular simulations to identify functional designs by automatically generating sequences using probabilistic models that have been used previously for mutation effect prediction and structure prediction. As proof-of-principle we designed sequences of the C2 domain of Factor VIII and tested them experimentally, resulting in a good correlation with the predicted immunogenicity of our model.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5E6eC-9uF44" width="1" />

<p>by Diego Fernandez Slezak, Mariano Sigman, Guillermo A. Cecchi</p>

We present a theory of decision-making in the presence of multiple choices that departs from traditional approaches by explicitly incorporating <i>entropic barriers</i> in a stochastic search process. We analyze response time data from an on-line repository of 15 million blitz chess games, and show that our model fits not just the mean and variance, but the entire response time distribution (over several response-time orders of magnitude) at every stage of the game. We apply the model to show that (a) higher cognitive expertise corresponds to the exploration of more complex solution spaces, and (b) reaction times of users at an on-line buying website can be similarly explained. Our model can be seen as a synergy between diffusion models used to model simple two-choice decision-making and planning agents in complex problem solving.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KOSfYo_HLEU" width="1" />

<p>The ability to synthesize realistic patterns of neural activity is crucial
for studying neural information processing. Here we used the Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to simulate the concerted activity of a
population of neurons. We adapted the Wasserstein-GAN variant to facilitate the
generation of unconstrained neural population activity patterns while still
benefiting from parameter sharing in the temporal domain. We demonstrate that
our proposed GAN, which we termed Spike-GAN, generates spike trains that match
accurately the first- and second-order statistics of datasets of tens of
neurons and also approximates well their higher-order statistics. We applied
Spike-GAN to a real dataset recorded from salamander retina and showed that it
performs as well as state-of-the-art approaches based on the maximum entropy
and the dichotomized Gaussian frameworks. Importantly, Spike-GAN does not
require to specify a priori the statistics to be matched by the model, and so
constitutes a more flexible method than these alternative approaches.Finally,
we show how to exploit a trained Spike-GAN to construct 'importance maps' to
detect the most relevant statistical structures present in a spike train.
Spike-GAN provides a powerful, easy-to-use technique for generating realistic
spiking neural activity and for describing the most relevant features of the
large-scale neural population recordings studied in modern systems
neuroscience.

<p>Phase response curves are important for analysis and modeling of oscillatory
dynamics in various applications, particularly in neuroscience. Standard
experimental technique for determining them requires isolation of the system
and application of a specifically designed input. However, isolation is not
always feasible and we are compelled to observe the system in its natural
environment under free-running conditions. To that end we propose an approach
relying only on passive observations of the system and its input. We illustrate
it with simulation results of an oscillator driven by a stochastic force.

<p>by Yohei Kondo, Kazuhiro Aoki, Shin Ishii</p>

Living tissues undergo deformation during morphogenesis. In this process, cells generate mechanical forces that drive the coordinated cell motion and shape changes. Recent advances in experimental and theoretical techniques have enabled <i>in situ</i> measurement of the mechanical forces, but the characterization of mechanical properties that determine how these forces quantitatively affect tissue deformation remains challenging, and this represents a major obstacle for the complete understanding of morphogenesis. Here, we proposed a non-invasive reverse-engineering approach for the estimation of the mechanical properties, by combining tissue mechanics modeling and statistical machine learning. Our strategy is to model the tissue as a continuum mechanical system and to use passive observations of spontaneous tissue deformation and force fields to statistically estimate the model parameters. This method was applied to the analysis of the collective migration of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, and the tissue flow and force were simultaneously observed by the phase contrast imaging and traction force microscopy. We found that our monolayer elastic model, whose elastic moduli were reverse-engineered, enabled a long-term forecast of the traction force fields when given the tissue flow fields, indicating that the elasticity contributes to the evolution of the tissue stress. Furthermore, we investigated the tissues in which myosin was inhibited by blebbistatin treatment, and observed a several-fold reduction in the elastic moduli. The obtained results validate our framework, which paves the way to the estimation of mechanical properties of living tissues during morphogenesis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CHVPZZQ-N8s" width="1" />

<p>by Charlie Beirnaert, Pieter Meysman, Trung Nghia Vu, Nina Hermans, Sandra Apers, Luc Pieters, Adrian Covaci, Kris Laukens</p>

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is, together with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the most established platform to perform metabolomics. In contrast to LC-MS however, NMR data is predominantly being processed with commercial software. Meanwhile its data processing remains tedious and dependent on user interventions. As a follow-up to speaq, a previously released workflow for NMR spectral alignment and quantitation, we present speaq 2.0. This completely revised framework to automatically analyze 1D NMR spectra uses wavelets to efficiently summarize the raw spectra with minimal information loss or user interaction. The tool offers a fast and easy workflow that starts with the common approach of peak-picking, followed by grouping, thus avoiding the binning step. This yields a matrix consisting of features, samples and peak values that can be conveniently processed either by using included multivariate statistical functions or by using many other recently developed methods for NMR data analysis. speaq 2.0 facilitates robust and high-throughput metabolomics based on 1D NMR but is also compatible with other NMR frameworks or complementary LC-MS workflows. The methods are benchmarked using a simulated dataset and two publicly available datasets. speaq 2.0 is distributed through the existing speaq R package to provide a complete solution for NMR data processing. The package and the code for the presented case studies are freely available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=speaq) and GitHub (https://github.com/beirnaert/speaq).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JylVVwDPK18" width="1" />

<p>by Gregory Handy, Sean D. Lawley, Alla Borisyuk</p>

Many diverse biological systems are described by randomly moving particles that can be captured by traps in their environment. Examples include neurotransmitters diffusing in the synaptic cleft before binding to receptors and prey roaming an environment before capture by predators. In most cases, the traps cannot capture particles continuously. Rather, each trap must wait a transitory “recharge” time after capturing a particle before additional captures. This recharge time is often overlooked. In the case of instant recharge, the average number of particles captured before they escape grows linearly in the total number of particles. In stark contrast, we prove that for any nonzero recharge time, the average number of captured particles grows at most logarithmically in the total particle number. This is a fundamental effect of recharge, as it holds under very general assumptions on particle motion and spatial domain. Furthermore, we characterize the parameter regime in which a given recharge time will dramatically affect a system, allowing researchers to easily verify if they need to account for recharge in their specific system. Finally, we consider a few examples, including a neural system in which recharge reduces neurotransmitter bindings by several orders of magnitude.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AWmsUhc2uf8" width="1" />

Metabolomics studies use quantitative analyses of metabolites from body fluids or tissues in order to investigate a sequence of cellular processes and biological systems in response to genetic and environmental influences. This promises an immense potential for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Most conventional metabolomics analysis methods exam one metabolite at a time and may overlook the synergistic effect of combining multiple metabolites. In this article, we proposed a new bioinformatics framework that infers the non-linear synergy among multiple metabolites using a symbolic model and subsequently, identify key metabolites using network analysis. Such a symbolic model is able to represent a complex non-linear relationship among a set of metabolites associated with osteoarthritis (OA) and is automatically learned using an evolutionary algorithm. Applied to the Newfoundland Osteoarthritis Study (NFOAS) dataset, our methodology was able to identify nine key metabolites including some known osteoarthritis-associated metabolites and some novel metabolic markers that have never been reported before. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology and more importantly, with further investigations, propose new hypotheses that can help better understand the OA disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t5hZej7ZfPQ" width="1" />

Genetic variants underlying complex traits, including disease susceptibility, are enriched within the transcriptional regulatory elements, promoters and enhancers. There is emerging evidence that regulatory elements associated with particular traits or diseases share similar patterns of transcriptional activity. Accordingly, shared transcriptional activity (coexpression) may help prioritise loci associated with a given trait, and help to identify underlying biological processes. Using cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) profiles of promoter- and enhancer-derived RNAs across 1824 human samples, we have analysed coexpression of RNAs originating from trait-associated regulatory regions using a novel quantitative method (network density analysis; NDA). For most traits studied, phenotype-associated variants in regulatory regions were linked to tightly-coexpressed networks that are likely to share important functional characteristics. Coexpression provides a new signal, independent of phenotype association, to enable fine mapping of causative variants. The NDA coexpression approach identifies new genetic variants associated with specific traits, including an association between the regulation of the OCT1 cation transporter and genetic variants underlying circulating cholesterol levels. NDA strongly implicates particular cell types and tissues in disease pathogenesis. For example, distinct groupings of disease-associated regulatory regions implicate two distinct biological processes in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis; a further two separate processes are implicated in Crohn’s disease. Thus, our functional analysis of genetic predisposition to disease defines new distinct disease endotypes. We predict that patients with a preponderance of susceptibility variants in each group are likely to respond differently to pharmacological therapy. Together, these findings enable a deeper biological understanding of the causal basis of complex traits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ui1gzYlU5Ic" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Research in rodents has established the role of the amygdaloid complex in defensive responses to conditioned threat. In human imaging studies, however, activation of the amygdala by conditioned threat cues is often not observed. One hypothesis states that this finding reflects adaptation of amygdaloid responses over time. We tested this hypothesis by estimating single-trial neural responses over a large number of conditioning trials. Functional MRI (fMRI) was recorded from 18 participants during classical differential fear conditioning: Participants viewed oriented grayscale grating stimuli (45° or 135°) presented centrally in random order. In the acquisition block, one grating (the CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US), on 25% of trials. The other grating, denoted CS–, was never paired with the US. Consistent with previous reports, BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula, but not the amygdala, was heightened when viewing CS+ stimuli that were not paired with US compared to CS– stimuli. Trial-by-trial analysis showed that over the course of acquisition, activity in the amygdala attenuated. Interestingly, activity in the dACC and insula also declined. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) corroborated these results, indicating that the voxel patterns evoked by CS+ and CS– in these brain regions became less distinguishable over time. Together, the present findings support the hypothesis that the lack of BOLD differences in the amygdaloid complex in many studies of classical conditioning is due to adaptation, and the adaptation effects may reflect changes in large-scale networks mediating aversive conditioning, particularly the salience network.</p>

<p>Economic decisions arise from evaluation of alternative actions in contexts of motivation and memory. In the predatory sea-slug <i>Pleurobranchaea</i> the economic decisions of foraging are found to occur by the workings of a simple, affectively controlled homeostat with learning abilities. Here, the neuronal circuit relations for approach-avoidance choice of <i>Pleurobranchaea</i> are expressed and tested in the foraging simulation Cyberslug. Choice is organized around appetitive state as a moment-to-moment integration of sensation, motivation (satiation/hunger), and memory. Appetitive state controls a switch for approach vs. avoidance turn responses to sensation. Sensory stimuli are separately integrated for incentive value into appetitive state, and for prey location (stimulus place) into mapping motor response. Learning interacts with satiation to regulate prey choice affectively. The virtual predator realistically reproduces the decisions of the real one in varying circumstances and satisfies optimal foraging criteria. The basic relations are open to experimental embellishment toward enhanced neural and behavioral complexity in simulation, as was the ancestral bilaterian nervous system in evolution.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progresses insidiously over decades. Therefore, study of preclinical AD is critical to identify early pathophysiological changes as potential targets for prevention or treatment. The brain processes at the preclinical stage remain minimally understood. Aside from age, the E4 allele of APOE flags a group at particularly high risk of late-onset AD (LOAD). Studies of these individuals could provide insights about the ontogenesis of AD offering clues for novel treatment strategies. To this end, cognitively normal, <i>APOE*E4</i> homozygotes from the Alzheimer’s Diseases Neuroimaging Research Initiative database (ADNI-LONI) provided fluorodeoxyglucose and amyloid (florbetapir) PET scans (<i>n</i> = 8 and 7, respectively; mean age 76 years). Their scans were compared to those of matched cognitively normal elders who were not E4 carriers. There was dissociation in the distribution between glucose uptake and amyloid deposition in the homozygotes. Peak hypometabolism localized bilaterally along the medial temporal cortex. In contrast, peak amyloid deposition localized principally to the putamen, a finding also seen in preclinical carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations and preclinical AD associated with Down syndrome. Additional regions of amyloid deposition in homozygotes were medial prefrontal cortices including the anterior cingulate, middle and inferior frontal cortices, and middle and inferior occipital cortices. These findings contrast with those reported for LOAD. These data begin to characterize elders with normal cognition despite high AD risk in comparison to the known phenotypes of patients with LOAD.</p>

Abstract
<p>Studies of feature-based attention have associated activity in a dorsal frontoparietal network with putative attentional priority signals. Yet, how this neural activity mediates attentional selection and whether it guides behavior are fundamental questions that require investigation. We reasoned that endogenous fluctuations in the quality of attentional priority should influence task performance. Human subjects detected a speed increment while viewing clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) motion (baseline task) or while attending to either direction amid distracters (attention task). In an fMRI experiment, direction-specific neural pattern similarity between the baseline task and the attention task revealed a higher level of similarity for correct than incorrect trials in frontoparietal regions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we disrupted posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and found a selective deficit in the attention task, but not in the baseline task, demonstrating the necessity of this cortical area during feature-based attention. These results reveal that frontoparietal areas maintain attentional priority that facilitates successful behavioral selection.</p>

<p>Damage to the CNS results in neuronal and axonal degeneration, and subsequent neurological dysfunction. Endogenous repair in the CNS is impeded by inhibitory chemical and physical barriers, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which prevent axon regeneration. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of axonal histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) can promote microtubule α-tubulin acetylation and restore the growth of CSPGs- and MAG-inhibited axons. Since the acetylation of α-tubulin is regulated by two opposing enzymes, HDAC6 (deacetylation) and α-tubulin acetyltransferase-1 (αTAT1; acetylation), we have investigated the regulation of these enzymes downstream of a growth inhibitory signal. Our findings show that exposure of primary mouse cortical neurons to soluble CSPGs and MAG substrates cause an acute and RhoA-kinase-dependent reduction in α-tubulin acetylation and αTAT1 protein levels, without changes to either HDAC6 levels or HDAC6 activity. The CSPGs- and MAG-induced reduction in αTAT1 occurs primarily in the distal and middle regions of neurites and reconstitution of αTAT1, either by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition or lentiviral-mediated αTAT1 overexpression, can restore neurite growth. Lastly, we demonstrate that CSPGs and MAG signaling decreases αTAT1 levels posttranscriptionally via a ROCK-dependent increase in αTAT1 protein turnover. Together, these findings define αTAT1 as a novel potential therapeutic target for ameliorating CNS injury characterized by growth inhibitory substrates that are prohibitive to axonal regeneration.</p>

<p>Characterizing functional brain networks in humans during magnetophosphene
perception. Dense electroencephalography (EEG, 128 channels) was performed in
N=3 volunteers during high-level (50 mT) magnetic field (MF) exposure.
Functional brain networks were reconstructed, at the cortical level from scalp
recordings, using the EEG source connectivity method. Magnetophosphene
perception appears to consistently activate the right inferior
occipito-temporal pathway. This study provides the very first neuroimaging
results characterizing magnetophosphene perception in humans. The use of
dense-EEG source connectivity is a promising approach in the field of
bioelectromagnetics.

<p>In psychological measurements, two levels should be distinguished: the
'individual level', relative to the different participants in a given cognitive
situation, and the 'collective level', relative to the overall statistics of
their outcomes, which we propose to associate with a notion of 'collective
participant'. When the distinction between these two levels is properly
formalized, it reveals why the modeling of the collective participant generally
requires beyond-quantum - non-Bornian - probabilistic models, when sequential
measurements at the individual level are considered, and this though a pure
quantum description remains valid for single measurement situations.

<p>We examine the problem of optimal sparse encoding of sensory stimuli by
latent variables in stochastic models. Analyzing restricted Boltzmann machines
with a communications theory approach, we search for the minimal model size
that correctly conveys the correlations in stimulus patterns in an
information-theoretic sense. We show that the Fisher information Matrix (FIM)
reveals the optimal model size. In larger models the FIM reveals that
irrelevant parameters are associated with individual latent variables,
displaying a surprising amount of order. For well-fit models, we observe the
emergence of statistical criticality as diverging generalized susceptibility of
the model. In this case, an encoding strategy is adopted where highly
informative, but rare stimuli selectively suppress variability in the encoding
units. The information content of the encoded stimuli acts as an unobserved
variable leading to criticality. Together, these results can explain the
stimulus-dependent variability suppression observed in sensory systems, and
suggest a simple, correlation-based measure to reduce the size of artificial
neural networks.

<p>We propose a metric - called Multi-Scale Relevance (MSR) - to score neurons
for their prominence in encoding for the animal's behaviour that is being
observed in a multi-electrode array recording experiment. The MSR assumes that
relevant neurons exhibit a wide variability in their dynamical state, in
response to the external stimulus, across different time scales. It is a
non-parametric, fully featureless indicator, in that it uses only the time
stamps of the firing activity, without resorting to any a priori covariate or
invoking any specific tuning curve for neural activity. We test the method on
data from freely moving rodents, where we found that neurons having low MSR
tend to have low mutual information and low firing sparsity across the
correlates that are believed to be encoded by the region of the brain where the
recordings were made. In addition, neurons with high MSR contain significant
information on spatial navigation and allow to decode spatial position or head
direction as efficiently as those neurons whose firing activity has high mutual
information with the covariate to be decoded.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10131">Broadly heterogeneous network topology begets order-based representation by privileged neurons. (arXiv:1802.10131v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>How spiking activity reverberates through neuronal networks, how evoked and
spontaneous activity interact and blend, and how the combined activities
represent external stimulation are pivotal questions in neuroscience. We
simulated minimal models of unstructured spiking networks in silico, asking
whether and how gentle external stimulation might be subsequently reflected in
spontaneous activity fluctuations. Consistent with earlier findings in silico
and in vitro, we observe a privileged sub-population of 'pioneer neurons' that,
by their firing order, reliably encode previous external stimulation. We show
that the distinctive role of pioneer neurons is owed to a combination of
exceptional sensitivity to, and pronounced influence on, network activity. We
further show that broadly heterogeneous connection topology - a broad "middle
class" in degree of connectedness - not only increases the number of 'pioneer
neurons' in unstructured networks, but also renders the emergence of 'pioneer
neurons' more robust to changes in the excitatory-inhibitory balance. In
conclusion, we offer a minimal model for the emergence and representational
role of 'pioneer neurons', as observed experimentally in vitro. In addition, we
show how broadly heterogeneous connectivity can enhance the representational
capacity of unstructured networks.

A brain-imaging paper by Kastner and colleagues in 1999 was the first to demonstrate that merely focusing attention at a spatial location changed the baseline activity level in various regions of human visual cortex even before any stimuli appeared. The study provided a touchstone for investigating cognitive–sensory interactions and understanding the proactive endogenous signals that shape perception.

In a series of seminal behavioral and electrophysiological experiments, Knudsen and Konishi studied the mechanisms of hearing. Their 1979 article showed how the barn owl utilizes unique anatomical features for creating a systematic internal representation of auditory space. This established the barn owl as a prime model for studying sensory systems.

A pair of 2009 papers by Cardin et al. and Sohal et al. marked a watershed moment as optogenetics exploded onto the scene of systems neuroscience. This pair of back-to-back papers in the June issue of Nature leveraged a powerful combination of the Cre/lox system, adeno-associated viral gene vectors, and optogenetics to re-examine the circuit basis of neuronal synchronization.

This landmark work not only offered a biological explanation for this cognitive function, but also opened up a wide field of research aimed at understanding the biological bases of various cognitive functions.

This plasticity rule offers an attractive mechanism for circuit refinement that improves signal-to-noise ratio and preserves previously stored information.

<p>by Stefano Motta, Claudia Minici, Dario Corrada, Laura Bonati, Alessandro Pandini</p>

Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors belonging to the basic helix−loop−helix PER-ARNT-SIM (bHLH-PAS) protein family with a role in sensing oxygen levels in the cell. Under hypoxia, the HIF-α degradation pathway is blocked and dimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) makes HIF-α transcriptionally active. Due to the common hypoxic environment of tumors, inhibition of this mechanism by destabilization of HIF-α:ARNT dimerization has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy. Following the discovery of a druggable cavity within the PAS-B domain of HIF-2α, research efforts have been directed to identify artificial ligands that can impair heterodimerization. Although the crystallographic structures of the HIF-2α:ARNT complex have elucidated the dimer architecture and the 0X3-inhibitor placement within the HIF-2α PAS-B, unveiling the inhibition mechanism requires investigation of how ligand-induced perturbations could dynamically propagate through the structure and affect dimerization. To this end, we compared evolutionary features, intrinsic dynamics and energetic properties of the dimerization interfaces of HIF-2α:ARNT in both the apo and holo forms. Residue conservation analysis highlighted inter-domain connecting elements that have a role in dimerization. Analysis of domain contributions to the dimerization energy demonstrated the importance of bHLH and PAS-A of both partners and of HIF-2α PAS-B domain in dimer stabilization. Among quaternary structure oscillations revealed by Molecular Dynamics simulations, the hinge-bending motion of the ARNT PAS-B domain around the flexible PAS-A/PAS-B linker supports a general model for ARNT dimerization in different heterodimers. Comparison of the HIF-2α:ARNT dynamics in the apo and 0X3-bound forms indicated a model of inhibition where the HIF-2α-PAS-B interfaces are destabilised as a result of water-bridged ligand-protein interactions and these local effects allosterically propagate to perturb the correlated motions of the domains and inter-domain communication. These findings will guide the design of improved inhibitors to contrast cell survival in tumor masses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SHydMixIans" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Higher-order visual thalamus plays a fundamental but poorly understood role in attention-demanding tasks. To investigate how neuronal dynamics in higher-order visual thalamus are modulated by sustained attention, we performed multichannel electrophysiological recordings in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex (LP/pulvinar) in the ferret (<i>Mustela putorius furo</i>). We recorded single unit activity and local field potential during the performance of the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) that is used in both humans and animals as an assay of sustained attention. We found that half of the units exhibited an increasing firing rate during the delay period before stimulus onset (attention-modulated units). In contrast, the non-attention-modulated units responded to the stimulus, but not during the delay period. Spike-field coherence of only the attention-modulated neurons significantly increased from the start of the delay period until screen touch, predominantly in the theta frequency band. In addition, theta power and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling were elevated throughout the delay period. Our findings suggest that the theta oscillation plays a role in orchestrating thalamic signaling during sustained attention.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Impaired sustained attention can be deadly, as illustrated by the number of motor vehicle accidents that are caused by drivers not reacting quickly enough to unexpected events on the road. Understanding how electrical signaling in higher-order visual nuclei, such as the LP/pulvinar, is modulated during tasks that require sustained attention is an important step in achieving a mechanistic understanding of sustained attention, which will eventually lead to new strategies to prevent and treat impairment in sustained attention.</p>

Abstract<p>Neuroimaging studies in animal models and human subjects have each revealed that relatively low striatal dopamine D2-like receptor binding potential is associated with poor impulse control and with vulnerability for addiction-related behaviors. These studies cannot, however, disambiguate the roles for various pools of D2 receptors found in the striatum (e.g., those expressed on medium spiny striato-pallidal neurons vs. on dopamine-releasing nerve terminals) in these behavioral outcomes. To clarify the role of the latter pool – namely, D2 autoreceptors – we studied mice carrying a conditional DRD2 gene, with or without Cre-recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter gene locus (autoDrd2-KO, n = 19 and controls, n = 21). These mice were tested for locomotor response to cocaine, and spatial reversal learning was assessed in operant conditioning chambers. As predicted, compared to control mice, autoDrd2-KO animals demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), confirming previous research using a similar genetic model. In the spatial reversal learning task, autoDrd2-KO mice were slower to reach a learning criterion and had difficulty sustaining a prolonged nose poke response, measurements conceptually related to impaired response inhibition. Rate of learning of the initial discrimination and latencies to collect rewards, to initiate trials and to produce a response were unaffected by genetic deletion of D2 autoreceptors, discarding possible motor and motivational factors. Together, these findings confirm the role of D2 autoreceptors in reversal learning and suggest a broader involvement in behavioral inhibition mechanisms.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Because impulsivity and substance use disorder often co-occur, they may share common molecular and cellular determinants. Studies in humans and animal models alike have helped identify the bioavailability dopamine receptor D2 as a correlate of both impulsivity and predisposition for addictive behaviors. Nevertheless, these studies were not able to differentiate between the respective roles of D2 auto- and heteroreceptors. The present work provides evidence that D2 autoreceptors alone influence the performance in a task measuring impulsivity in mice, suggesting that impulsivity is not only resulting from dysfunctional striato-pallidal neurons, but also might also be modulated by upstream, pre-synaptic events.</p>

<p>Survival in a fast-changing environment requires animals not only to detect unexpected sensory events, but also to react. In humans, these salient sensory events generate large electrocortical responses, which have been traditionally interpreted within the sensory domain. Here we describe a basic physiological mechanism coupling saliency-related cortical responses with motor output. In four experiments conducted on 70 healthy participants, we show that salient substartle sensory stimuli modulate isometric force exertion by human participants, and that this modulation is tightly coupled with electrocortical activity elicited by the same stimuli. We obtained four main results. First, the force modulation follows a complex triphasic pattern consisting of alternating decreases and increases of force, time-locked to stimulus onset. Second, this modulation occurs regardless of the sensory modality of the eliciting stimulus. Third, the magnitude of the force modulation is predicted by the amplitude of the electrocortical activity elicited by the same stimuli. Fourth, both neural and motor effects are not reflexive but depend on contextual factors. Together, these results indicate that sudden environmental stimuli have an immediate effect on motor processing, through a tight corticomuscular coupling. These observations suggest that saliency detection is not merely perceptive but reactive, preparing the animal for subsequent appropriate actions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Salient events occurring in the environment, regardless of their modalities, elicit large electrical brain responses, dominated by a widespread "vertex" negative-positive potential. This response is the largest synchronization of neural activity that can be recorded from a healthy human being. Current interpretations assume that this vertex potential reflects sensory processes. Contrary to this general assumption, we show that the vertex potential is strongly coupled with a modulation of muscular activity that follows the same pattern. Both the vertex potential and its motor effects are not reflexive but strongly depend on contextual factors. These results reconceptualize the significance of these evoked electrocortical responses, suggesting that saliency detection is not merely perceptive but reactive, preparing the animal for subsequent appropriate actions.</p>

<p>Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been shown to be required for certain types of cognitive function. For example, studies have shown that these neurons are critical for pattern separation, the ability to store similar experiences as distinct memories. Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been shown to cause the loss of newborn hippocampal neurons, the signaling pathway(s) that triggers their death is unknown. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activates the PERK-eIF2α pathway that acts to restore ER function and improve cell survival. However, unresolved/intense ER stress activates C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), leading to cell death. We show that TBI causes the death of hippocampal newborn neurons via CHOP. Using CHOP KO mice, we show that loss of CHOP markedly reduces newborn neuron loss after TBI. Injured CHOP mice performed significantly better in a context fear discrimination task compared with injured wild-type mice. In contrast, the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 exacerbated doublecortin cell loss and worsened contextual discrimination. Administration of guanabenz (which reduces ER stress) to injured male rats reduced the loss of newborn neurons and improved one-trial contextual fear memory. Interestingly, we also found that the surviving newborn neurons in brain-injured animals had dendritic loss, which was not observed in injured CHOP KO mice or in animals treated with guanabenz. These results indicate that ER stress plays a key role in the death of newborn neurons after TBI. Further, these findings indicate that ER stress can alter dendritic arbors, suggesting a role for ER stress in neuroplasticity and dendritic pathologies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The hippocampus, a structure in the temporal lobe, is critical for learning and memory. The hippocampus is one of only two areas in which neurons are generated in the adult brain. These newborn neurons are required for certain types of memory, and are particularly vulnerable to traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the mechanism(s) that causes the loss of these cells after TBI is poorly understood. We show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways are activated in newborn neurons after TBI, and that manipulation of the CHOP cascade improves newborn neuron survival and cognitive outcome. These results suggest that treatments that prevent/resolve ER stress may be beneficial in treating TBI-triggered memory dysfunction.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/9/2359?rss=1">Age-Dependent Decline in Fate Switch from NG2 Cells to Astrocytes After Olig2 Deletion</a></h4>

<p>NG2 cells are a resident glial progenitor cell population that is uniformly distributed throughout the developing and mature mammalian CNS. Those in the postnatal CNS generate exclusively myelinating and non-myelinating oligodendrocytes and are thus equated with oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Prenatally, NG2 cells in the ventral gray matter of the forebrain generate protoplasmic astrocytes as well as oligodendrocytes. The fate conversion from NG2 cells into protoplasmic astrocytes is dependent on downregulation of the key oligodendrocyte transcription factor Olig2. We showed previously that constitutive deletion of Olig2 in NG2 cells converts NG2 cells in the neocortex into protoplasmic astrocytes at the expense of oligodendrocytes. In this study, we show that postnatal deletion of Olig2 caused NG2 cells in the neocortex but not in other gray matter regions to become protoplasmic astrocytes. However, NG2 cells in the neocortex became more resistant to astrocyte fate switch over the first 3 postnatal weeks. Fewer NG2 cells differentiated into astrocytes and did so with longer latency after Olig2 deletion at postnatal day 18 (P18) compared with deletion at P2. The high-mobility group transcription factor Sox10 was not downregulated for at least 1 month after Olig2 deletion at P18 despite an early transient upregulation of the astrocyte transcription factor NFIA. Furthermore, inhibiting cell proliferation in slice culture reduced astrocyte differentiation from Olig2-deleted perinatal NG2 cells, suggesting that cell division might facilitate nuclear reorganization needed for astrocyte transformation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> NG2 cells are glial progenitor cells that retain a certain degree of lineage plasticity. In the normal postnatal neocortex, they generate mostly oligodendrocyte lineage cells. When the oligodendrocyte transcription factor Olig2 is deleted in NG2 cells in the neocortex, they switch their fate to protoplasmic astrocytes. However, the efficiency of the fate switch decreases with age over the first 3 postnatal weeks and is reduced when cell proliferation is inhibited. As the neocortex matures, sustained expression of the oligodendrocyte lineage-specific key transcription factor Sox10 becomes less dependent on Olig2. Together, our findings suggest a gradual stabilization of the oligodendrocyte lineage genes and loss of lineage plasticity during the first 3 weeks after birth, possibly due to nuclear reorganization.</p>

<p>Loss-of-function mutations in progranulin, a lysosomal glycoprotein, cause neurodegenerative disease. Progranulin haploinsufficiency causes frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and complete progranulin deficiency causes <i>CLN11</i> neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Progranulin replacement is a rational therapeutic strategy for these disorders, but there are critical unresolved mechanistic questions about a progranulin gene therapy approach, including its potential to reverse existing pathology. Here, we address these issues using an AAV vector (AAV-<i>Grn</i>) to deliver progranulin in <i>Grn</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice (both male and female), which model aspects of NCL and FTD pathology, developing lysosomal dysfunction, lipofuscinosis, and microgliosis. We first tested whether AAV-<i>Grn</i> could improve preexisting pathology. Even with treatment after onset of pathology, AAV-<i>Grn</i> reduced lipofuscinosis in several brain regions of <i>Grn</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice. AAV-<i>Grn</i> also reduced microgliosis in brain regions distant from the injection site. AAV-expressed progranulin was only detected in neurons, not in microglia, indicating that the microglial activation in progranulin deficiency can be improved by targeting neurons and thus may be driven at least in part by neuronal dysfunction. Even areas with sparse transduction and almost undetectable progranulin showed improvement, indicating that low-level replacement may be sufficiently effective. The beneficial effects of AAV-<i>Grn</i> did not require progranulin binding to sortilin. Finally, we tested whether AAV-<i>Grn</i> improved lysosomal function. AAV-derived progranulin was delivered to the lysosome, ameliorated the accumulation of LAMP-1 in <i>Grn</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice, and corrected abnormal cathepsin D activity. These data shed light on progranulin biology and support progranulin-boosting therapies for NCL and FTD due to <i>GRN</i> mutations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Heterozygous loss-of-function progranulin (<i>GRN</i>) mutations cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and homozygous mutations cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Here, we address several mechanistic questions about the potential of progranulin gene therapy for these disorders. <i>GRN</i> mutation carriers with NCL or FTD exhibit lipofuscinosis and <i>Grn</i><sup>–/–</sup> mouse models develop a similar pathology. AAV-mediated progranulin delivery reduced lipofuscinosis in <i>Grn</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice even after the onset of pathology. AAV delivered progranulin only to neurons, not microglia, but improved microgliosis in several brain regions, indicating cross talk between neuronal and microglial pathology. Its beneficial effects were sortilin independent. AAV-derived progranulin was delivered to lysosomes and corrected lysosomal abnormalities. These data provide <i>in vivo</i> support for the efficacy of progranulin-boosting therapies for FTD and NCL.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/9/2328?rss=1">Corticosterone Production during Repeated Social Defeat Causes Monocyte Mobilization from the Bone Marrow, Glucocorticoid Resistance, and Neurovascular Adhesion Molecule Expression</a></h4>

<p>Repeated social defeat (RSD) stress promotes the release of bone marrow-derived monocytes into circulation that are recruited to the brain, where they augment neuroinflammation and cause prolonged anxiety-like behavior. Physiological stress activates the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis, and both of these systems play a role in the physiological, immunological, and behavioral responses to stress. The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of HPA activation and corticosterone production in the immunological responses to stress in male C57BL/6 mice. Here, surgical (adrenalectomy) and pharmacological (metyrapone) interventions were used to abrogate corticosterone signaling during stress. We report that both adrenalectomy and metyrapone attenuated the stress-induced release of monocytes into circulation. Neither intervention altered the production of monocytes during stress, but both interventions enhanced retention of these cells in the bone marrow. Consistent with this observation, adrenalectomy and metyrapone also prevented the stress-induced reduction of a key retention factor, CXCL12, in the bone marrow. Corticosterone depletion with metyrapone also abrogated the stress-induced glucocorticoid resistance of myeloid cells. In the brain, these corticosterone-associated interventions attenuated stress-induced microglial remodeling, neurovascular expression of the adhesion molecule intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, prevented monocyte accumulation and neuroinflammatory signaling. Overall, these results indicate that HPA activation and corticosterone production during repeated social defeat stress are critical for monocyte release into circulation, glucocorticoid resistance of myeloid cells, and enhanced neurovascular cell adhesion molecule expression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent studies of stress have identified the presence of monocytes that show an exaggerated inflammatory response to immune challenge and are resistant to the suppressive effects of glucocorticoids. Increased presence of these proinflammatory monocytes has been implicated in neuropsychiatric symptoms and the development of chronic cardiovascular, autoimmune, and metabolic disorders. In the current study, we show novel evidence that corticosterone produced during stress enhances the release of proinflammatory monocytes from the bone marrow into circulation, augments their recruitment to the brain and the induction of a neuroinflammatory profile. Overproduction of corticosterone during stress is also the direct cause of glucocorticoid resistance, a key phenotype in individuals exposed to chronic stress. Inhibiting excess corticosterone production attenuates these inflammatory responses to stress.</p>

<p>It is well known that top–down expectations affect perceptual processes. Yet, remarkably little is known about the relationship between expectations and conscious awareness. We address three crucial outstanding questions: (1) how do expectations affect the likelihood of conscious stimulus perception?; (2) does the brain register violations of expectations nonconsciously?; and (3) do expectations need to be conscious to influence perceptual decisions? Using human participants, we performed three experiments in which we manipulated stimulus predictability within the attentional blink paradigm, while combining visual psychophysics with electrophysiological recordings. We found that valid stimulus expectations increase the likelihood of conscious access of stimuli. Furthermore, our findings suggest a clear dissociation in the interaction between expectations and consciousness: conscious awareness seems crucial for the implementation of top–down expectations, but not for the generation of bottom-up stimulus-evoked prediction errors. These results constrain and update influential theories about the role of consciousness in the predictive brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While the relationship between expectations and conscious awareness plays a major role in many prediction-based theories of brain functioning, thus far few empirical studies have examined this relationship. Here, we address this gap in knowledge in a set of three experiments. Our results suggest that the effect of expectations on conscious awareness varies between different steps of the hierarchy of predictive processing. While the active use of top–down expectations for perceptual decisions requires conscious awareness, prediction errors can be triggered outside of conscious awareness. These results constrain and update influential theories about the role of consciousness in the predictive brain.</p>

<p>Environmental events are processed on multiple timescales via hierarchical organization of temporal receptive windows (TRWs) in the brain. The dependence of neural timescales and TRWs on altered states of consciousness is unclear. States of reduced consciousness are marked by a shift toward slowing of neural dynamics (&lt;1 Hz) in EEG/ECoG signals. We hypothesize that such prolongation of intrinsic timescales are also seen in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. To test this hypothesis, we measured the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals using mean frequency (MF) and temporal autocorrelation (AC) in healthy volunteers (<i>n</i> = 23; male/female 14/9) during graded sedation with propofol. We further examined the relationship between the intrinsic timescales (local/voxel level) and its regional connectivity (across neighboring voxels; regional homogeneity, ReHo), global (whole-brain level) functional connectivity (GFC), and topographical similarity (Topo). Additional results were obtained from patients undergoing deep general anesthesia (<i>n</i> = 12; male/female: 5/7) and in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) (<i>n</i> = 21; male/female: 14/7). We found that MF, AC, and ReHo increased, whereas GFC and Topo decreased, during propofol sedation. The local alterations occur before changes of distant connectivity. Conversely, all of these parameters decreased in deep anesthesia and in patients with DOC. We conclude that propofol synchronizes local neuronal interactions and prolongs the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals. These effects may impede communication among distant brain regions. Furthermore, the intrinsic timescales exhibit distinct dynamic signatures in sedation, deep anesthesia, and DOC. These results improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness in pharmacologic and neuropathologic states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Information processing in the brain occurs through a hierarchy of temporal receptive windows (TRWs) in multiple timescales. Anesthetic drugs induce a reversible suppression of consciousness and thus offer a unique opportunity to investigate the state dependence of neural timescales. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that sedation with propofol is accompanied by the prolongation of the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals presumably reflecting enlarged TRWs. We show that this is accomplished by an increase of local and regional signal synchronization, effects that may disrupt information exchange among distant brain regions. Furthermore, we show that the timescales of intrinsic BOLD signals exhibit distinct dynamic signatures in sedation, deep anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness.</p>

<p>A fundamental feature of cortical visual processing is the separation of visual processing for the upper and lower visual fields. In early visual cortex (EVC), the upper visual field is processed ventrally, with the lower visual field processed dorsally. This distinction persists into several category-selective regions of occipitotemporal cortex, with ventral and lateral scene-, face-, and object-selective regions biased for the upper and lower visual fields, respectively. Here, using an elliptical population receptive field (pRF) model, we systematically tested the sampling of visual space within ventral and dorsal divisions of human EVC in both male and female participants. We found that (1) pRFs tend to be elliptical and oriented toward the fovea with distinct angular distributions for ventral and dorsal divisions of EVC, potentially reflecting a radial bias; and (2) pRFs in ventral areas were larger (~1.5<font face="arial,helvetica">x</font>) and more elliptical (~1.2<font face="arial,helvetica">x</font>) than those in dorsal areas. These differences potentially reflect a tendency for receptive fields in ventral temporal cortex to overlap the fovea with less emphasis on precise localization and isotropic representation of space compared with dorsal areas. Collectively, these findings suggest that ventral and dorsal divisions of EVC sample visual space differently, likely contributing to and/or stemming from the functional differentiation of visual processing observed in higher-level regions of the ventral and dorsal cortical visual pathways.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The processing of visual information from the upper and lower visual fields is separated in visual cortex. Although ventral and dorsal divisions of early visual cortex (EVC) are commonly assumed to sample visual space equivalently, we demonstrate systematic differences using an elliptical population receptive field (pRF) model. Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) ventral and dorsal divisions of EVC exhibit diverging distributions of pRF angle, which are biased toward the fovea; and (2) ventral pRFs exhibit higher aspect ratios and cover larger areas than dorsal pRFs. These results suggest that ventral and dorsal divisions of EVC sample visual space differently and that such differential sampling likely contributes to different functional roles attributed to the ventral and dorsal pathways, such as object recognition and visually guided attention, respectively.</p>

<p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons regulate reproduction through pulsatile GnRH release. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have persistently elevated luteinizing hormone release frequency, reflecting GnRH release; this exacerbates hyperandrogenemia and disrupted reproductive cycles that are characteristic of this disorder. Clinical evidence suggests that neuroendocrine features of PCOS may manifest peripubertally. Adult mice prenatally exposed to androgens (PNA) mimic several reproductive features of PCOS. GnRH neurons from these mice have increased firing activity and receive increased GABAergic transmission, which is excitatory. When changes emerge during development is unknown. To study the typical postnatal development of GABAergic transmission and the effects of PNA treatment and sex, whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made of GABAergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs) in GnRH neurons in brain slices from prepubertal through adult control and PNA female and male mice. GABAergic transmission was present by 1 week of age in females and males and increased in frequency, reaching adult levels at 3 and 4 weeks, respectively. GABAergic PSC frequency was elevated in 3-week-old PNA versus control females. PSC frequency in both controls and PNA mice was activity independent, suggesting that PNA induces changes in synapse organization. PNA also alters the functional response of GnRH neurons to GABA. GABA induced firing in fewer neurons from 3-week-old PNA than control females; membrane potential depolarization induced by GABA was also reduced in cells from PNA mice at this age. PNA thus induces changes during development in the presynaptic organization of the GABAergic network afferent to GnRH neurons as well as the postsynaptic GnRH neuron response, both of which may contribute to adult reproductive dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The central neuronal network that regulates reproduction is overactive in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a leading cause of infertility. Recent evidence of neuroendocrine dysfunction in midpubertal girls suggests that the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PCOS may arise before pubertal maturation. Prenatal exposure to androgens (PNA) in mice mimics several neuroendocrine features of PCOS. GABAergic transmission to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons is important for reproduction and is increased in adult PNA mice. The typical development of this network and when changes with PNA and sex arise relative to puberty are unknown. These studies provide evidence that PNA alters prepubertal development of the GABAergic network afferent to GnRH neurons, including both the presynaptic organization and postsynaptic response. These changes may contribute to reproductive dysfunction in adults.</p>

<p>Relapse to methamphetamine (Meth) seeking progressively increases after withdrawal from drug self-administration (incubation of Meth craving). We previously demonstrated a role of dorsomedial striatum (DMS) dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) in this incubation. Here, we studied the role of afferent glutamatergic projections into the DMS and local D1R–glutamate interaction in this incubation in male rats. We first measured projection-specific activation on day 30 relapse test by using cholera toxin b (retrograde tracer) + Fos (activity marker) double-labeling in projection areas. Next, we determined the effect of pharmacological reversible inactivation of lateral or medial anterior intralaminar nuclei of thalamus (AIT-L or AIT-M) on incubated Meth seeking on withdrawal day 30. We then used an anatomical asymmetrical disconnection procedure to determine whether an interaction between AIT-L-&gt;DMS glutamatergic projections and postsynaptic DMS D1Rs contributes to incubated Meth seeking. We also determined the effect of unilateral inactivation of AIT-L and D1R blockade of DMS on incubated Meth seeking, and the effect of contralateral disconnection of AIT-L-&gt;DMS projections on nonincubated Meth seeking on withdrawal day 1. Incubated Meth seeking was associated with selective activation of AIT-&gt;DMS projections; other glutamatergic projections to DMS were not activated. AIT-L (but not AIT-M) inactivation or anatomical disconnection of AIT-L-&gt;DMS projections decreased incubated Meth seeking. Unilateral inactivation of AIT-L or D1R blockade of the DMS had no effect on incubated Meth craving, and contralateral disconnection of AIT-L-&gt;DMS projections had no effect on nonincubated Meth seeking. Our results identify a novel role of AIT-L and AIT-L-&gt;DMS glutamatergic projections in incubation of drug craving and drug seeking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Methamphetamine seeking progressively increases after withdrawal from drug self-administration, a phenomenon termed incubation of methamphetamine craving. We previously found that D1R-mediated dopamine transmission in the dorsomedial striatum plays a critical role in this incubation phenomenon. Here, we used neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological methods in rats to demonstrate that an interaction between the glutamatergic projection from the lateral anterior intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus to the dorsomedial striatum and local dopamine D1 receptors plays a critical role in relapse to methamphetamine seeking after prolonged withdrawal. Our study identified a novel motivation-related thalamostriatal projection critical to relapse to drug seeking.</p>

<p>Informational social influence theory posits that under conditions of uncertainty, we are inclined to look to others for advice. This leaves us remarkably vulnerable to being influenced by others' opinions or advice. Rational agents, however, do not blindly seek and act on arbitrary information, but often consider the quality of its source before committing to a course of action. Here, we ask the question of whether a collaborator's reputation can increase their social influence and, in turn, bias perception and anxiety under changing levels of uncertainty. Human male and female participants were asked to provide estimations of dot direction using the random dot motion (RDM) perceptual discrimination task and were paired with transient collaborators of high or low reputation whom provided their own estimations. The RDM varied in degrees of uncertainty and joint performance accuracy was linked to risk of an electric shock. Despite providing identical information, we show that collaborating with a high reputation compared with a low reputation partner, led to significantly more conformity during the RDM task for uncertain perceptual decisions. Consequently, high reputation partners decreased the subjects' anxiety during the anticipatory shock periods. fMRI data showed that parametric changes in conformity resulted in increased activity in the ventromedial PFC, whereas dissent was associated with increased in activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Furthermore, the dACC and insula, regions involved in anticipatory pain, were significantly more active when collaborating with a low reputation partner. These results suggest that information about reputation can influence both cognitive and affective processes and in turn alter the neural circuits that underlie decision-making and emotion.</p>

<p>Müller glial (MG) cells in the zebrafish retina respond to injury by acquiring retinal stem-cell characteristics. Thousands of gene expression changes are associated with this event. Key among these changes is the induction of Ascl1a and Lin28a, two reprogramming factors whose expression is necessary for retina regeneration. Whether these factors are sufficient to drive MG proliferation and subsequent neuronal-fate specification remains unknown. To test this, we conditionally expressed Ascl1a and Lin28a in the uninjured retina of male and female fish. We found that together, their forced expression only stimulates sparse MG proliferation. However, in combination with Notch signaling inhibition, widespread MG proliferation and neuron regeneration ensued. Remarkably, Ascl1 and Lin28a expression in the retina of male and female mice also stimulated sparse MG proliferation, although this was not enhanced when combined with inhibitors of Notch signaling. Lineage tracing in both fish and mice suggested that the proliferating MG generated multipotent progenitors; however, this process was much more efficient in fish than mice. Overall, our studies suggest that the overexpression of Ascl1a and Lin28a in zebrafish, in combination with inhibition of Notch signaling, can phenocopy the effects of retinal injury in Müller glia. Interestingly, Ascl1 and Lin28a seem to have similar effects in fish and mice, whereas Notch signaling may differ. Understanding the different consequences of Notch signaling inhibition in fish and mice, may suggest additional strategies for enhancing retina regeneration in mammals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mechanisms underlying retina regeneration in fish may suggest strategies for stimulating this process in mammals. Here we report that forced expression of Ascl1 and Lin28a can stimulate sparse MG proliferation in fish and mice; however, only in fish does Notch signaling inhibition collaborate with Ascl1a and Lin28a to stimulate widespread MG proliferation in the uninjured retina. Discerning differences in Notch signaling between fish and mice MG may reveal strategies for stimulating retina regeneration in mammals.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/9/2226?rss=1">Fentanyl Induces Rapid Onset Hyperalgesic Priming: Type I at Peripheral and Type II at Central Nociceptor Terminals</a></h4>

<p>Systemic fentanyl induces hyperalgesic priming, long-lasting neuroplasticity in nociceptor function characterized by prolongation of inflammatory mediator hyperalgesia. To evaluate priming at both nociceptor terminals, we studied, in male Sprague Dawley rats, the effect of local administration of agents that reverse type I (protein translation) or type II [combination of Src and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)] priming. At the central terminal, priming induced by systemic, intradermal, or intrathecal fentanyl was reversed by the combination of Src and MAPK inhibitors, but at the peripheral terminal, it was reversed by the protein translation inhibitor. Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antisense prevented fentanyl hyperalgesia and priming. To determine whether type I and II priming occur in the same population of neurons, we used isolectin B4–saporin or [Sar<sup>9</sup>, Met(O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>11</sup>]-substance P–saporin to deplete nonpeptidergic or peptidergic nociceptors, respectively. Following intrathecal fentanyl, central terminal priming was prevented by both saporins, whereas that in peripheral terminal was not attenuated even by their combination. However, after intradermal fentanyl, priming in the peripheral terminal requires both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic nociceptors, whereas that in the central terminal is dependent only on peptidergic nociceptors. Pretreatment with dantrolene at either terminal prevented fentanyl-induced priming in both terminals, suggesting communication between central and peripheral terminals mediated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. <i>In vitro</i> application of fentanyl increased cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in dorsal root ganglion neurons, which was prevented by pretreatment with dantrolene and naloxone. Therefore, acting at MOR in the nociceptor, fentanyl induces hyperalgesia and priming rapidly at both the central (type II) and peripheral (type I) terminal and this is mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fentanyl, acting at the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), induces hyperalgesia and hyperalgesic priming at both the central and peripheral terminal of nociceptors and this is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Priming in the central terminal is type II, whereas that in the peripheral terminal is type I. Our findings may provide useful information for the design of drugs with improved therapeutic profiles, selectively disrupting individual MOR signaling pathways, to maintain an adequate long-lasting control of pain.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/9/2207?rss=1">A Unique Homeostatic Signaling Pathway Links Synaptic Inactivity to Postsynaptic mTORC1</a></h4>

<p>mTORC1-dependent translational control plays a key role in several enduring forms of synaptic plasticity such as long term potentiation (LTP) and mGluR-dependent long term depression. Recent evidence demonstrates an additional role in regulating synaptic homeostasis in response to inactivity, where dendritic mTORC1 serves to modulate presynaptic function via retrograde signaling. Presently, it is unclear whether LTP and homeostatic plasticity use a common route to mTORC1-dependent signaling or whether each engage mTORC1 through distinct pathways. Here, we report a unique signaling pathway that specifically couples homeostatic signaling to postsynaptic mTORC1 after loss of excitatory synaptic input. We find that AMPAR blockade, but not LTP-inducing stimulation, induces phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent synthesis of the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) in rat cultured hippocampal neurons of either sex. Pharmacological blockade of PLD1/2 or pharmacogenetic disruption of PA interactions with mTOR eliminates mTORC1 signaling and presynaptic compensation driven by AMPAR blockade, but does not alter mTORC1 activation or functional changes during chemical LTP (cLTP). Overexpression of PLD1, but not PLD2, recapitulates both functional synaptic changes as well as signature cellular adaptations associated with homeostatic plasticity. Finally, transient application of exogenous PA is sufficient to drive rapid presynaptic compensation requiring mTORC1-dependent translation of BDNF in the postsynaptic compartment. These results thus define a unique homeostatic signaling pathway coupling mTORC1 activation to changes in excitatory synaptic drive. Our results further imply that more than one canonical mTORC1 activation pathway may be relevant for the design of novel therapeutic approaches against neurodevelopmental disorders associated with mTORC1 dysregulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Homeostatic and Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity are thought to play complementary roles in regulating neural circuit function, but we know little about how these forms of plasticity are distinguished at the single neuron level. Here, we define a signaling pathway that uniquely links mTORC1 with homeostatic signaling in neurons.</p>

<p>In mammals, olfactory sensation depends on inhalation, which controls activation of sensory neurons and temporal patterning of central activity. Odor representations by mitral and tufted (MT) cells, the main output from the olfactory bulb (OB), reflect sensory input as well as excitation and inhibition from OB circuits, which may change as sniff frequency increases. To test the impact of sampling frequency on MT cell odor responses, we obtained whole-cell recordings from MT cells in anesthetized male and female mice while varying inhalation frequency via tracheotomy, allowing comparison of inhalation-linked responses across cells. We characterized frequency effects on MT cell responses during inhalation of air and odorants using inhalation pulses and also "playback" of sniffing recorded from awake mice. Inhalation-linked changes in membrane potential were well predicted across frequency from linear convolution of 1 Hz responses; and, as frequency increased, near-identical temporal responses could emerge from depolarizing, hyperpolarizing, or multiphasic MT responses. However, net excitation was not well predicted from 1 Hz responses and varied substantially across MT cells, with some cells increasing and others decreasing in spike rate. As a result, sustained odorant sampling at higher frequencies led to increasing decorrelation of the MT cell population response pattern over time. Bulk activation of sensory inputs by optogenetic stimulation affected MT cells more uniformly across frequency, suggesting that frequency-dependent decorrelation emerges from odor-specific patterns of activity in the OB network. These results suggest that sampling behavior alone can reformat early sensory representations, possibly to optimize sensory perception during repeated sampling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Olfactory sensation in mammals depends on inhalation, which increases in frequency during active sampling of olfactory stimuli. We asked how inhalation frequency can shape the neural coding of odor information by recording from projection neurons of the olfactory bulb while artificially varying odor sampling frequency in the anesthetized mouse. We found that sampling an odor at higher frequencies led to diverse changes in net responsiveness, as measured by action potential output, that were not predicted from low-frequency responses. These changes led to a reorganization of the pattern of neural activity evoked by a given odorant that occurred preferentially during sustained, high-frequency inhalation. These results point to a novel mechanism for modulating early sensory representations solely as a function of sampling behavior.</p>

<p>The recent development of transgenic rodent lines expressing cre recombinase in a cell-specific manner, along with advances in engineered viral vectors, has permitted in-depth investigations into circuit function. However, emerging evidence has begun to suggest that genetic modifications may introduce unexpected caveats. In the current studies, we sought to extensively characterize male and female mice from both the ChAT<sub>(BAC)</sub>-Cre mouse line, created with the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) method, and ChAT<sub>(IRES)</sub>-Cre mouse line, generated with the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) method. ChAT<sub>(BAC)</sub>-Cre transgenic and wild-type mice did not differ in general locomotor behavior, anxiety measures, drug-induced cataplexy, nicotine-mediated hypolocomotion, or operant food training. However, ChAT<sub>(BAC)</sub>-Cre transgenic mice did exhibit significant deficits in intravenous nicotine self-administration, which paralleled an increase in vesicular acetylcholine transporter and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) hippocampal expression. For the ChAT<sub>(IRES)</sub>-Cre line, transgenic mice exhibited deficits in baseline locomotor, nicotine-mediated hypolocomotion, and operant food training compared with wild-type and hemizygous littermates. No differences among ChAT<sub>(IRES)</sub>-Cre wild-type, hemizygous, and transgenic littermates were found in anxiety measures, drug-induced cataplexy, and nicotine self-administration. Given that increased cre expression was present in the ChAT<sub>(IRES)</sub>-Cre transgenic mice, as well as a decrease in ChAT expression in the hippocampus, altered neuronal function may underlie behavioral phenotypes. In contrast, ChAT<sub>(IRES)</sub>-Cre hemizygous mice were more similar to wild-type mice in both protein expression and the majority of behavioral assessments. As such, interpretation of data derived from ChAT-Cre rodents must consider potential limitations dependent on the line and/or genotype used in research investigations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Altered baseline and/or nicotine-mediated behavioral profiles were discovered in transgenic mice from the ChAT<sub>(BAC)</sub>-Cre and ChAT<sub>(IRES)</sub>-Cre lines. Given that these cre-expressing mice have become increasingly used by the scientific community, either independently with chemicogenetic and optogenetic viral vectors or crossed with other transgenic lines, the current studies highlight important considerations for the interpretation of data from previous and future experimental investigations. Moreover, the current findings detail the behavioral effects of either increased or decreased baseline cholinergic signaling mechanisms on locomotor, anxiety, learning/memory, and intravenous nicotine self-administration behaviors.</p>

<p>Despite their small size, microsaccades can impede stimulus detections if executed at inopportune times. Although it has been shown that microsaccades evoke both inhibitory and excitatory responses across different visual regions, their impact on the higher-level neural decision processes that bridge sensory responses to action selection has yet to be examined. Here, we show that when human observers monitor stimuli for subtle feature changes, the occurrence of microsaccades long after (up to 800 ms) change onset predicts slower reaction times and this is accounted for by momentary suppression of neural signals at each key stage of decision formation: visual evidence encoding, evidence accumulation, and motor preparation. Our data further reveal that, independent of the timing of the change events, the onset of neural decision formation coincides with a systematic inhibition of microsaccade production, persisting until the perceptual report is executed. Our combined behavioral and neural measures highlight antagonistic interactions between microsaccade occurrence and evidence accumulation during visual decision-making tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When fixating on a location in space, we frequently make tiny eye movements called microsaccades. In the present study, we show that these microsaccades impede our ability to make perceptual decisions about visual stimuli and this impediment specifically occurs via the disruption of several processing levels of the sensorimotor network: the encoding of visual evidence itself, the accumulation of visual evidence toward a response, and effector-selective motor preparation. Furthermore, we show that the production of microsaccades is inhibited during the perceptual decision, possibly as a counteractive measure to mitigate their negative effect on behavior in this context. The combined behavioral and neural measures used in this study provide strong and novel evidence for the interaction of fixational eye movements and the perceptual decision-making process.</p>

<p>The functionally selective 5-HT2C receptor ligand SB242084 can increase motivation and have rapid onset anti–depressant-like effects. We sought to identify the specific behavioral effects of SB242084 treatment and elucidate the mechanism in female and male mice. Using a quantitative behavioral approach, we determined that SB242084 increases the vigor and persistence of goal-directed activity across different types of physical work, particularly when work requirements are demanding. We found this influence of SB242084 on effort, rather than reward to be reflected in striatal DA measured during behavior. Using <i>in vivo</i> fast scan cyclic voltammetry, we found that SB242084 has no effect on reward-related phasic DA release in the NAc. Using <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis to measure tonic changes in extracellular DA, we also found no changes in the NAc. In contrast, SB242084 treatment increases extracellular DA in the dorsomedial striatum, an area that plays a key role in response vigor. These findings have several implications. At the behavioral level, this work shows that the capacity to work in demanding situations can be increased, without a generalized increase in motor activity or reward value. At the circuit level, we identified a pathway restricted potentiation of DA release and showed that this was the reason for the increased response vigor. At the cellular level, we show that a specific serotonin receptor cross talks to the DA system. Together, this information provides promise for the development of treatments for apathy, a serious clinical condition that can afflict patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motivated behaviors are modulated by reward value, effort demands, and cost-benefit computations. This information drives the decision to act, which action to select, and the intensity with which the selected action is performed. Because these behavioral processes are all regulated by DA signaling, it is very difficult to influence selected aspects of motivated behavior without affecting others. Here we identify a pharmacological treatment that increases the vigor and persistence of responding in mice, without increasing generalized activity or changing reactions to rewards. We show that the 5-HT2C-selective ligand boosts motivation by potentiating activity-dependent DA release in the dorsomedial striatum. These results reveal a novel strategy for treating patients with motivational deficits, avolition, or apathy.</p>

<p>We discuss the two moments of human cognition, namely, apprehension (A),
whereby a coherent perception emerges from the recruitment of neuronal groups,
and judgment(B),that entails the comparison of two apprehensions acquired at
different times, coded in a suitable language and retrieved by memory. (B)
entails self-consciousness, in so far as the agent who expresses the judgment
must be aware that the two apprehensions are submitted to his/her own scrutiny
and that it is his/her task to extract a mutual relation. Since (B) lasts
around 3 seconds, the semantic value of the pieces under comparison must be
decided within that time. This implies a fast search of the memory contents. As
a fact, exploring human subjects with sequences of simple words, we find
evidence of a limited time window , corresponding to the memory retrieval of a
linguistic item in order to match it with the next one in a text flow (be it
literary, or musical,or figurative). While apprehension is globally explained
as a Bayes inference, judgment tresults from an inverse Bayes inference. As a
consequence, two hermeneutics emerge (called respectively circle and coil). The
first one acts in a pre-assigned space of features. The second one provides the
discovery of novel features, thus unveiling previously unknown aspects and
hence representing the road to reality.

<p>A measurement based formula for consciousness, C, as a function of time t, is
constructed. The formula depends on identifying a natural relevant
self-generated, time-dependent dynamical process inherent in any entity. For
human beings the relevant dynamical process identified is the ensemble of brain
waves, observed in EEG measurements, that are represented in the model by their
measured time dependent correlation functions. These correlation functions
define the accessible dynamical state of the brain at any moment of time. From
them a time dependent probability function, P(t), is extracted by using a
mathematical identity. According to information theory, -P(t) log P(t), is a
measure of the information contained in the brain waves. Consciousness, C, is
defined by this information theory formula: it is not localized, does not
depend on specific hardwire details of the brain, but reflects the information
content present in brain waves. Justifications, based on observational
evidence, are given for the formula and it is shown that C reflects the degree
of "awareness" that a person has at a given moment of time. The model explains
the observed time delay between when a brain wave is seen to initiate an action
and when there is awareness that the action has been initiated, in terms of the
way brain waves processes information. Some testable consequences of the model,
including the role dreaming sleep plays in long term memory storage, are
discussed. It is also shown that non living entities have C=0.

cAMP and cGMP are well established second messengers required for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation/consolidation. By contrast, amyloid β (Aβ), mostly known as one of the main culprits for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has received relatively little attention in the context of plasticity and memory. Of note, however, low physiological concentrations of Aβ seem necessary for LTP induction and for memory formation. This should come as no surprise, since hormesis emerged as a central dogma in biology.

<p>by Meenu R. Mridula, Ashalatha S. Nair, K. Satheesh Kumar</p>

In this paper, we compared the efficacy of observation based modeling approach using a genetic algorithm with the regular statistical analysis as an alternative methodology in plant research. Preliminary experimental data on <i>in vitro</i> rooting was taken for this study with an aim to understand the effect of charcoal and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) on successful rooting and also to optimize the two variables for maximum result. Observation-based modelling, as well as traditional approach, could identify NAA as a critical factor in rooting of the plantlets under the experimental conditions employed. Symbolic regression analysis using the software deployed here optimised the treatments studied and was successful in identifying the complex non-linear interaction among the variables, with minimalistic preliminary data. The presence of charcoal in the culture medium has a significant impact on root generation by reducing basal callus mass formation. Such an approach is advantageous for establishing <i>in vitro</i> culture protocols as these models will have significant potential for saving time and expenditure in plant tissue culture laboratories, and it further reduces the need for specialised background.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OcWMQ8wOno0" width="1" />

Marine Synechococcus cyanobacteria are major contributors to global oceanic primary production and exhibit a unique diversity of photosynthetic pigments, allowing them to exploit a wide range of light niches. However, the relationship between pigment content and niche partitioning has remained largely undetermined due to the lack of a single-genetic marker...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/Fj285lHf7Y4" width="1" />

RIPK1 is a critical mediator of cell death and inflammation downstream of TNFR1 upon stimulation by TNFα, a potent proinflammatory cytokine involved in a multitude of human inflammatory and degenerative diseases. RIPK1 contains an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain, and a C-terminal death domain (DD).

Electron microscope studies have shown that the switched-off state of myosin II in muscle involves intramolecular interaction between the two heads of myosin and between one head and the tail. The interaction, seen in both myosin filaments and isolated molecules, inhibits activity by blocking actin-binding and ATPase sites on myosin....<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/O3A2k31xEBA" width="1" />

<p>The relationship between brain structure and function has been probed using a
variety of approaches, but how the underlying structural connectivity of the
human brain drives behavior is far from understood. To investigate the effect
of anatomical brain organization on human task performance, we use a
data-driven computational modeling approach and explore the functional effects
of naturally occurring structural differences in brain networks. We construct
personalized brain network models by combining anatomical connectivity
estimated from diffusion spectrum imaging of individual subjects with a
nonlinear model of brain dynamics. By performing computational experiments in
which we measure the excitability of the global brain network and spread of
synchronization following a targeted computational stimulation, we quantify how
individual variation in the underlying connectivity impacts both local and
global brain dynamics. We further relate the computational results to
individual variability in the subjects' performance of three language-demanding
tasks both before and after transcranial magnetic stimulation to the
left-inferior frontal gyrus. Our results show that task performance correlates
with either local or global measures of functional activity, depending on the
complexity of the task. By emphasizing differences in the underlying structural
connectivity, our model serves as a powerful tool to predict individual
differences in task performances, to dissociate the effect of targeted
stimulation in tasks that differ in cognitive complexity, and to pave the way
for the development of personalized therapeutics.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons form dendritic gap junctions with one another, but the connectivity among gap junction-coupled dendrites remains uninvestigated in most neocortical areas. We visualized gap junctions in layer 4 of the mouse barrel cortex and examined their structural details. PV neurons were divided into 4 types based on the location of soma and dendrites within or outside barrels. Type 1 neurons that had soma and all dendrites inside a barrel, considered most specific to single vibrissa-derived signals, unexpectedly formed gap junctions only with other types but never with each other. Type 2 neurons inside a barrel elongated dendrites outward, forming gap junctions within a column that contained the home barrel. Type 3 neurons located outside barrels established connections with all types including Type 4 neurons that were confined inside the inter-barrel septa. The majority (33/38, 86.8%) of dendritic gap junctions were within 75 μm from at least 1 of 2 paired somata. All types received vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive axon terminals preferentially on somata and proximal dendrites, indicating the involvement of all types in thalamocortical feedforward regulation in which proximal gap junctions may also participate. These structural organizations provide a new morphological basis for regulatory mechanisms in barrel cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The mammalian dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium develops—from medial to lateral—into the choroid plaque, cortical hem, hippocampal primordium and isocortex under the influence of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling. Correct telencephalic development requires a tight coordination of the extent/duration of these signals, but the identification of possible molecular coordinators is still limited. Here, we postulated that Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (Sfrp1), a multifunctional regulator of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling strongly expressed during early telencephalic development, may represent 1 of such molecules. We report that in E10.5–E12.5 <span style="font-style: italic;">Sfrp1</span><sup>−<span style="font-style: italic;">/</span></sup><sup>−</sup> embryos, the hem and hippocampal domains are reduced in size whereas the prospective neocortex is medially extended. These changes are associated with a significant reduction of the medio-lateral telencephalic expression of <span style="font-style: italic;">Axin2</span>, a read-out of Wnt/βcatenin signaling activation. Furthermore, in the absence of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sfrp1</span>, Notch signaling is increased, cortical progenitor cell cycle is shorter, with expanded progenitor pools and enhanced generation of early-born neurons. Hence, in postnatal <span style="font-style: italic;">Sfrp1</span><sup>−<span style="font-style: italic;">/</span></sup><sup>−</sup> animals the anterior hippocampus is reduced and the neocortex is shorter in the antero-posterior and medio-lateral axis but is thicker. We propose that, by controlling Wnt and Notch signaling in opposite directions, Sfrp1 promotes hippocampal patterning and balances medio-lateral and antero-posterior cortex expansion.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cognitive training has been suggested as a possible remediation of decline in brain structure with older age. However, it is unknown whether training effects are transient or enduring, as no studies have examined training-induced plasticity relative to decline in older adults across extended periods with multiple intervention phases. We investigated the temporal dynamics of brain plasticity across periods on and off memory training, hypothesizing that (1) a decline in white matter (WM) microstructure would be observed across the duration of the study and (2) that periods of memory training would moderate the WM microstructural decline. In total, 107 older adults followed a 40-week program, including 2 training periods separated by periods with no intervention. The general decline in WM microstructure observed across the duration of the study was moderated following the training periods, demonstrating that cognitive training may mitigate age-related brain deterioration. The training-related improvements were estimated to subside over time, indicating that continuous training may be a premise for the enduring attenuation of neural decline. Memory improvements were largely maintained after the initial training period, and may thus not rely on continuous training to the same degree as WM microstructure.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The axonal composition of cortical projections originating in premotor, supplementary motor (SMA), primary motor (a4), somatosensory and parietal areas and descending towards the brain stem and spinal cord was characterized in the monkey with histological tract tracing, electron microscopy (EM) and diffusion MRI (dMRI). These 3 approaches provided complementary information. Histology provided accurate assessment of axonal diameters and size of synaptic boutons. dMRI revealed the topography of the projections (tractography), notably in the internal capsule. From measurements of axon diameters axonal conduction velocities were computed. Each area communicates with different diameter axons and this generates a hierarchy of conduction delays in this order: a4 (the shortest), SMA, premotor (F7), parietal, somatosensory, premotor F4 (the longest). We provide new interpretations for i) the well-known different anatomical and electrophysiological estimates of conduction velocity; ii) why conduction delays are probably an essential component of the cortical motor command; and iii) how histological and dMRI tractography can be integrated.</span>

Here we formulate a mechanistic mathematical model to describe the growth dynamics of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in the presence of the <i>β</i>-lactam antibiotic meropenem. The model is mechanistic in the sense that carrying capacity is taken into account through the dynamics of nutrient availability rather than via logistic growth. In accordance with our experimental results we incorporate a sub-population of cells, differing in morphology from the normal bacillary shape of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> bacteria, which we assume have immunity from direct antibiotic action. By fitting this model to experimental data we obtain parameter values that give insight into the growth of a bacterial population that includes different cell morphologies. The analysis of two parameters sets, that produce different long term behaviour, allows us to manipulate the system theoretically in order to explore the advantages of a shape transition that may potentially be a mechanism that allows <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to withstand antibiotic effects. Our results suggest that inhibition of this shape transition may be detrimental to bacterial growth and thus suggest that the transition may be a defensive mechanism implemented by bacterial machinery. In addition to this we provide strong theoretical evidence for the potential therapeutic strategy of using antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in combination with meropenem. This proposed combination therapy exploits the shape transition as AMPs induce cell lysis by forming pores in the cytoplasmic membrane, which becomes exposed in the spherical cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BjL-m6ALghY" width="1" />

<p>by Huijing Du, Yangyang Wang, Daniel Haensel, Briana Lee, Xing Dai, Qing Nie</p>

The mammalian skin epidermis is a stratified epithelium composed of multiple layers of epithelial cells that exist in appropriate sizes and proportions, and with distinct boundaries separating each other. How the epidermis develops from a single layer of committed precursor cells to form a complex multilayered structure of multiple cell types remains elusive. Here, we construct stochastic, three-dimensional, and multiscale models consisting of a lineage of multiple cell types to study the control of epidermal development. Symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions, stochastic cell fate transitions within the lineage, extracellular morphogens, cell-to-cell adhesion forces, and cell signaling are included in model. A GPU algorithm was developed and implemented to accelerate the simulations. These simulations show that a balance between cell proliferation and differentiation during lineage progression is crucial for the development and maintenance of the epidermal tissue. We also find that selective intercellular adhesion is critical to sharpening the boundary between layers and to the formation of a highly ordered structure. The long-range action of a morphogen provides additional feedback regulations, enhancing the robustness of overall layer formation. Our model is built upon previous experimental findings revealing the role of Ovol transcription factors in regulating epidermal development. Direct comparisons of experimental and simulation perturbations show remarkable consistency. Taken together, our results highlight the major determinants of a well-stratified epidermis: balanced proliferation and differentiation, and a combination of both short- (symmetric/asymmetric division and selective cell adhesion) and long-range (morphogen) regulations. These underlying principles have broad implications for other developmental or regenerative processes leading to the formation of multilayered tissue structures, as well as for pathological processes such as epidermal wound healing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pNAuW3tTk3A" width="1" />

From gastrulation to late organogenesis animal development involves many genetic and bio-mechanical interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. Ectodermal organs, such as hairs, feathers and teeth are well studied examples of organs whose development is based on epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. These develop from a similar primordium through an epithelial folding and its interaction with the mesenchyme. Despite extensive knowledge on the molecular pathways involved, little is known about the role of bio-mechanical processes in the morphogenesis of these organs. We propose a simple computational model for the biomechanics of one such organ, the tooth, and contrast its predictions against cell-tracking experiments, mechanical relaxation experiments and the observed tooth shape changes over developmental time. We found that two biomechanical processes, differential tissue growth and differential cell adhesion, were enough, in the model, for the development of the 3D morphology of the early tooth germ. This was largely determined by the length and direction of growth of the cervical loops, lateral folds of the enamel epithelium. The formation of these cervical loops was found to require accelerated epithelial growth relative to other tissues and their direction of growth depended on specific differential adhesion between the three tooth tissues. These two processes and geometrical constraints in early tooth bud also explained the shape asymmetry between the lateral cervical loops and those forming in the anterior and posterior of the tooth. By performing mechanical perturbations <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in silico</i> we inferred the distribution and direction of tensile stresses in the mesenchyme that restricted cervical loop lateral growth and forced them to grow downwards. Overall our study suggests detailed quantitative explanations for how bio-mechanical processes lead to specific morphological 3D changes over developmental time.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zf3yG1dZ4nA" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder usually caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). RTT is typified by apparently normal development until 6–18 mo of age, when motor and communicative skills regress and hand stereotypies, autonomic symptoms, and seizures present. Restoration of MeCP2 function selectively to astrocytes reversed several deficits in a murine model of RTT, but the mechanism of this rescue is unknown. Astrocytes carry out many essential functions required for normal brain functioning, including extracellular K<sup>+</sup> buffering. Kir4.1, an inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel, is largely responsible for the channel-mediated K<sup>+</sup> regulation by astrocytes. Loss-of-function mutations in Kir4.1 in human patients result in a severe neurodevelopmental disorder termed EAST or SESAME syndrome. Here, we evaluated astrocytic Kir4.1 expression in a murine model of Rett syndrome. We demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that Kir4.1 is a direct molecular target of MeCP2. Astrocytes from <i>Mecp2</i>-deficient mice express significantly less Kir4.1 mRNA and protein, which translates into a &gt;50% deficiency in Ba<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive Kir4.1-mediated currents, and impaired extracellular potassium dynamics. By examining astrocytes in isolation, we demonstrate that loss of Kir4.1 is cell autonomous. Assessment through postnatal development revealed that Kir4.1 expression in <i>Mecp2</i>-deficient animals never reaches adult, wild-type levels, consistent with a neurodevelopmental disorder. These are the first data implicating a direct MeCP2 molecular target in astrocytes and provide novel mechanistic insight explaining a potential mechanism by which astrocytic dysfunction may contribute to RTT.</p>

Abstract
<p>Uncovering the neural dynamics of facial identity processing along with its representational basis outlines a major endeavor in the study of visual processing. To this end, here, we record human electroencephalography (EEG) data associated with viewing face stimuli; then, we exploit spatiotemporal EEG information to determine the neural correlates of facial identity representations and to reconstruct the appearance of the corresponding stimuli. Our findings indicate that multiple temporal intervals support: facial identity classification, face space estimation, visual feature extraction and image reconstruction. In particular, we note that both classification and reconstruction accuracy peak in the proximity of the N170 component. Further, aggregate data from a larger interval (50–650 ms after stimulus onset) support robust reconstruction results, consistent with the availability of distinct visual information over time. Thus, theoretically, our findings shed light on the time course of face processing while, methodologically, they demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based image reconstruction.</p>

Abstract
<p>The central medial nucleus (CeM) is a part of the intralaminar thalamus, which is involved in the control of arousal and sensory processing. However, ionic conductances and mechanisms that regulate the activity of the CeM are not well studied. Here, we used <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adolescent rats to demonstrate that T-type calcium currents (T-currents) are prominent in the majority of the studied CeM neurons and are critical determinants of low-threshold calcium spikes (LTSs), which in turn regulate excitability of these neurons. Using an ATP-free internal solution decreased T-current density and induced a profound hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation curves while voltage-dependent activation kinetics were spared. Furthermore, selective pharmacological blockade of T-channels or use of an ATP-free solution reduced both tonic action potential (AP) frequency and rebound burst firing in CeM neurons. Our results indicate that T-channels are critical regulators of a thalamocortical circuit output and suggest that cytosolic ATP could be an endogenous regulatory mechanism in which T-channels may functionally gate sensory transmission and arousal <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

Abstract<p>Economic decisions arise from evaluation of alternative actions in contexts of motivation and memory. In the predatory sea-slug <i>Pleurobranchaea</i> the economic decisions of foraging are found to occur by the workings of a simple, affectively controlled homeostat with learning abilities. Here, the neuronal circuit relations for approach-avoidance choice of <i>Pleurobranchaea</i> are expressed and tested in the foraging simulation Cyberslug™. Choice is organized around appetitive state as a moment-to-moment integration of sensation, motivation (satiation/hunger), and memory. Appetitive state controls a switch for approach vs. avoidance turn responses to sensation. Sensory stimuli are separately integrated for incentive value into appetitive state, and for prey location (stimulus place) into mapping motor response. Learning interacts with satiation to regulate prey choice affectively. The virtual predator realistically reproduces the decisions of the real one in varying circumstances and satisfies optimal foraging criteria. The basic relations are open to experimental embellishment toward enhanced neural and behavioral complexity in simulation, as was the ancestral bilaterian nervous system in evolution.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Contemporary artificial intelligence lacks the attributes of natural intelligence, in particular the abilities to relate information affectively. Accordingly, it is notable that the most complex animal behaviors serve primitive homeostatic goals, and emerge from the primitive mechanisms generating motivation and reward learning. Here is shown in simulation the function of a basic neuronal circuit for cost-benefit decision, derived from studies of a predatory generalist, the sea-slug <i>Pleurobranchaea</i>, and based on affective integration of information. Its simplicity may reflect distant ancestral qualities on which complexities in economic, cognitive, and social behaviors were built. The simulation validates experimental data and provides a basic module on which complexity in economic, cognitive, and social behaviors could be built.</p>

Abstract<p>Stress is a potent etiological factor in the onset of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, significant efforts have been made to identify factors that produce resilience to the outcomes of a later stressor, in hopes of preventing untoward clinical outcomes. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has recently emerged as a prophylactic capable of preventing neurochemical and behavioral outcomes of a future stressor. Despite promising results of preclinical studies performed in male rats, the effects of proactive ketamine in female rats remains unknown. This is alarming given that stress-related disorders affect females at nearly twice the rate of males. Here we explore the prophylactic effects of ketamine on stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and the neural circuit-level processes that mediate these effects in female rats. Ketamine given 1 week prior to an uncontrollable stressor (inescapable tailshock, IS) reduced typical stress-induced activation of the serotonergic (5-HT) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and eliminated DRN-dependent juvenile social exploration (JSE) deficits 24 hours after the stressor. Proactive ketamine altered prelimbic cortex (PL) neural ensembles so that a later experience with IS now activated these cells, which it ordinarily would not. Ketamine acutely activated a prelimbic cortex (PL) to DRN (PL-DRN) circuit and inhibition of this circuit with Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) at the time of IS 1 week later prevented stress prophylaxis, suggesting that persistent changes in PL-DRN circuit activity are responsible, at least in part, for mediating long term effects associated with ketamine.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Stress-related disorders affect females at twice the rate of males, and so identifying factors capable of producing resilience in females is critically important. Recent efforts to identify neural mechanisms underlying the prophylactic effects of ketamine on the behavioral and neural impact of a later stressor have focused solely on male rodents. Here we show that ketamine administered to female rats 1 week before an uncontrollable stressor prevents stress-induced anxiety-like behavioral effects. The mechanisms by which ketamine exerts prophylactic effects were explored, and ketamine was found to activate an inhibitory prelimbic cortex-dorsal raphe nucleus circuit and that this circuit activation is required for the stress-buffering effects of ketamine. These data provide a basis for prophylactic use of ketamine in females.</p>

Abstract<p>Greater emphasis on the study of intact cellular networks in their physiological environment has led to rapid advances in intravital imaging in the central nervous system, while the peripheral system remains largely unexplored. To assess large networks of sensory neurons we selectively label primary afferents with GCaMP6s in male and female C57bl/6 mice and visualise their functional responses to peripheral stimulation <i>in vivo</i>. We show that we are able to monitor the activity of hundreds of sensory neurons simultaneously, with sufficient sensitivity to detect, in most cases, single action potentials with a typical rise time of around 200 milliseconds, and an exponential decay with a time constant of approximately 700 milliseconds. With this technique we are able to characterise the responses of large populations of sensory neurones to innocuous and noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli under normal and inflammatory conditions. We demonstrate that the majority of primary afferents are polymodal with between 50-80% of thermally sensitive DRG neurons responding also to noxious mechanical stimulation. We also specifically assess the small population of peripheral cold neurons and demonstrate significant sensitisation to cooling after a model of sterile and persistent inflammation, with significantly increased sensitivity already at decreases of 5°C when compared to uninflamed responses. This not only reveals interesting new insights into the (patho)physiology of the peripheral nervous system but also demonstrates the sensitivity of this imaging technique to physiological changes in primary afferents.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Most of our functional understanding of the peripheral nervous system has come from single unit recordings. However, the acquisition of such data are labor-intensive and usually ‘low yield’. Moreover, some questions are best addressed by studying populations of neurons. To this end we report on a system that monitors activity in hundreds of single sensory neurons simultaneously, with sufficient sensitivity to detect in most cases single action potentials. We use this technique to characterize response properties to natural and electrical stimuli and to demonstrate polymodality in the majority of neurons as well as their sensitization under inflammatory conditions. We therefore believe this approach will be very useful for the study of the somatosensory system in general, and pain in particular.</p>

Abstract<p>To understand the hippocampus it is necessary to understand the subiculum. Unlike other hippocampal subfields, the subiculum projects to almost all distal hippocampal targets, highlighting its critical importance for external networks. The present studies, in male rats and mice, reveal a new category of dorsal subiculum neurons that innervate both the mammillary bodies and the retrosplenial cortex. These bifurcating neurons comprise almost half of the hippocampal cells that project to retrosplenial cortex. The termination of these numerous collateral projections was visualized within the medial mammillary nucleus and the granular retrosplenial cortex (area 29). These collateral projections included subiculum efferents that cross to the contralateral mammillary bodies. Within the granular retrosplenial cortex, the collateral projections form a particularly dense plexus in deep layer II and layer III. This retrosplenial termination site co-localized with markers for VGluT2 and neurotensin. While efferents from the hippocampal CA fields standardly collateralize, subiculum projections often have only one target site. Consequently, the many collateral projections involving the retrosplenial cortex and the mammillary bodies present a relatively unusual pattern for the subiculum, which presumably relates to how both targets have complementary roles in spatial processing. Furthermore, along with the anterior thalamic nuclei, the mammillary bodies and retrosplenial cortex are key members of a memory circuit, which is usually described as both starting and finishing in the hippocampus. The present findings reveal how the hippocampus simultaneously engages different parts of this circuit, so forcing an important revision of this network.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The hippocampus has both cortical and subcortical connections that are critical for spatial learning in rodents and episodic memory in humans. Chief among these connections are the dense hippocampal inputs to the retrosplenial cortex and mammillary bodies, both of which originate in the subiculum. The present experiments reveal that in rodents approximately half of these retrosplenial projections have collaterals that also innervate the mammillary bodies. Consequently, these two areas share common hippocampal information, despite playing different roles in cognition. These same collateral projections contradict longstanding ideas about extended, serial hippocampal networks for memory. As these networks are affected from the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease, when memory disorders first appear, there is added significance in understanding their precise connectivity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0336-17.2018v1?rss=1">Losing Control in Social Situations: how the Presence of Others Affects Neural Processes Related to Sense of Agency</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Social contexts substantially influence individual behaviour, but little is known about how they affect cognitive processes related to voluntary action. Previously it has been shown that social context reduces participants’ sense of agency over the outcomes of their actions and outcome monitoring. In this fMRI study on human volunteers, we investigated the neural mechanisms by which social context alters sense of agency. Participants made costly actions to stop inflating a balloon before it burst. On ‘social’ trials, another player could act in their stead, but we analysed only trials where the other player remained passive. We hypothesized that mentalizing processes during social trials would affect decision-making fluency and lead to a decrease sense of agency. In line with this hypothesis, we found increased activity in bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus and middle frontal gyrus during social trials, compared to non-social trials. Activity in the precuneus was, in turn, negatively related to sense of agency at single-trial level. We further found a double dissociation between TPJ and angular gyrus (AG): activity in the left AG was not sensitive to social context, but was negatively related to sense of agency. In contrast, activity in the TPJ was modulated by social context, but was not sensitive to sense of agency.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The presence of other people can have substantial influence on how individuals act. Understanding the cognitive and neural processes underlying such behavioural changes would allow for better prediction of social context effects on individual actions, and ultimately support the development of optimized learning environments and interventions aimed at improving social behavior. The work presented here on the neural processes underlying social context effects on sense of agency is an important contribution to research on human cognition, voluntary action and social psychology.</p>

<p>The same concept can mean different things or be instantiated in different
forms depending on context, suggesting a degree of flexibility within the
conceptual system. We propose that a compositional network model can be used to
capture and predict this flexibility. We modeled individual concepts (e.g.,
BANANA, BOTTLE) as graph-theoretical networks, in which properties (e.g.,
YELLOW, SWEET) were represented as nodes and their associations as edges. In
this framework, networks capture the within-concept statistics that reflect how
properties correlate with each other across instances of a concept. We ran a
classification analysis using the Graph Fourier Transform technique to validate
these models, and find that these models can successfully discriminate between
object concepts. We then computed formal measures from these concept networks
and explored their relationship to conceptual structure. We find that diversity
coefficients and core-periphery structure can be interpreted as network-based
measures of conceptual flexibility and stability, respectively. These results
support the feasibility of a concept network framework and highlight its
ability to formally capture important characteristics of the conceptual system.

<p>The standard state space model is widely believed to account for the
cerebellar computation in motor adaptation tasks [1]. Here we show that several
recent experiments [2-4] where the visual feedback is irrelevant to the motor
response challenge the standard model. Furthermore, we propose a new model that
accounts for the the results presented in [2-4]. According to this new model,
learning and forgetting are coupled and are error size dependent. We also show
that under reasonable assumptions, our proposed model is the only model that
accounts for both the classical adaptation paradigm as well as the recent
experiments [2-4].

<p>Machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples: small changes
to images can cause computer vision models to make mistakes such as identifying
a school bus as an ostrich. However, it is still an open question whether
humans are prone to similar mistakes. Here, we create the first adversarial
examples designed to fool humans, by leveraging recent techniques that transfer
adversarial examples from computer vision models with known parameters and
architecture to other models with unknown parameters and architecture, and by
modifying models to more closely match the initial processing of the human
visual system. We find that adversarial examples that strongly transfer across
computer vision models influence the classifications made by time-limited human
observers.

<p>Neural networks modularity is a major challenge for the development of
control circuits of neural activity. Under physiological limitations, the
accessible regions for external stimulation are possibly different from the
functionally relevant ones, requiring complex indirect control designs.
Moreover, control over one region might affect activity of other downstream
networks, once sparse connections exist. We address these questions by
developing a hybrid device of a cortical culture functionally integrated with a
biomimetic hardware neural network. This design enables the study of modular
networks controllability, while connectivity is well-defined and key features
of cortical networks are accessible. Using a closed-loop control to monitor the
activity of the coupled hybrid, we show that both modules are congruently
modified, in the macroscopic as well as the microscopic activity levels.
Control impacts efficiently the activity on both sides whether the control
circuit is an indirect series one, or implemented independently only on one of
the modules. Hence, these results present global functional impacts of a local
control intervention. Overall, this strategy provides an experimental access to
the controllability of neural activity irregularities, when embedded in a
modular organization.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sensory information is processed in specific brain regions, and shared between the cerebral hemispheres by axons that cross the midline through the corpus callosum. However, sensory deprivation usually causes sensory losses and/or functional changes. This is the case of people who suffered limb amputation and show changes of body map organization within the somatosensory cortex (S1) of the deafferented cerebral hemisphere (contralateral to the amputated limb), as well as in the afferented hemisphere (ipsilateral to the amputated limb). Although several studies have approached these functional changes, the possible finer morphological alterations, such as those occurring in callosal axons, still remain unknown. The present work combined histochemistry, single-axon tracing and 3D microscopy to analyze the fine morphological changes that occur in callosal axons of the forepaw representation in early amputated rats. We showed that the forepaw representation in S1 was reduced in the deafferented hemisphere and expanded in the afferented side. Accordingly, after amputation, callosal axons originating from the deafferented cortex undergo an expansion of their terminal arbors with increased number of terminal boutons within the homotopic representation at the afferented cerebral hemisphere. Similar microscale structural changes may underpin the macroscale morphological and functional phenomena that characterize limb amputation in humans.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a form of activity-dependent remodeling of synaptic strength that underlies memory formation. Despite its key role in dictating learning rules in the brain circuits, the molecular mechanisms mediating STDP are still poorly understood. Here, we show that spike timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) and A-type K<sup>+</sup> currents are modulated by pharmacological agents affecting the levels of active glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and by GSK3β knockdown in layer 2/3 of the mouse somatosensory cortex. Moreover, the blockade of A-type K<sup>+</sup> currents mimics the effects of GSK3 up-regulation on tLTD and occludes further changes in synaptic strength. Pharmacological, immunohistochemical and biochemical experiments revealed that GSK3β influence over tLTD induction is mediated by direct phosphorylation at Ser-616 of the Kv4.2 subunit, a molecular determinant of A-type K<sup>+</sup> currents. Collectively, these results identify the functional interaction between GSK3β and Kv4.2 channel as a novel mechanism for tLTD modulation providing exciting insight into the understanding of GSK3β role in synaptic plasticity.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The purpose of this study was to investigate the restorative role of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and memory impairments in a simulation of Alzheimer’s disease. Mice subjected to LPS administration (250 μg/kg, i.p.) were treated with LIPUS daily for 7 days. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammatory markers were estimated in brain tissue using western blot. After LIPUS treatment, the neuroprotective effects of LIPUS in mice were assessed by behavioral tests. LPS plus LIPUS-treated mice exhibited a significant increase in the average time spent in the target quadrant compared to the LPS-treated group. Compared with the LPS-treated group, LPS plus LIPUS-treated mice revealed a preference for the novel object. LIPUS treatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases in the expression of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the hippocampus region of LPS-treated mice. Furthermore, LIPUS significantly reduced the protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the mice brain induced by LPS. LIPUS treatment induces neuroprotection by inhibiting the LPS-induced activation of TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory signaling and by enhancing the associated CREB/BDNF expression in LPS-treated mice. Our data showed that LIPUS attenuated LPS-induced memory impairment as well as amyloidogenesis via the suppression of neuroinflammatory activity and BDNF decline.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Preterm birth is the greatest risk factor for lifelong neurocognitive deficits, globally. The effect of prematurity on early cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological performance in human infant.</span>

Abstract<p>Inhibitory control (IC) is a core executive function that enables humans to resist habits, temptations or distractions. IC efficiency in childhood is a strong predictor of academic and professional success later in life. Based on analysis of the sulcal pattern, a qualitative feature of cortex anatomy determined during fetal life and stable during development, we searched for evidence that inter-individual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI), we analyzed the sulcal pattern of two key regions of the IC neural network, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), which limits the inferior frontal gyrus. We found that the sulcal pattern asymmetry of both the ACC and IFC contributes to IC (Stroop score) in children and adults: participants with asymmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns had better IC efficiency than participants with symmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns. Such additive effects of IFC and ACC sulcal patterns on IC efficiency suggest that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency. This view shares some analogies with the ‘common variant – small effect’ model in genetics, which states that frequent genetic polymorphisms have small effects but collectively account for a large portion of the variance. Similarly, each sulcal polymorphism has a small but additive effect: IFC and ACC sulcal patterns respectively explained 3% and 14% of the variance of the Stroop interference scores.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Inhibitory control (IC) is a cognitive function that plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric conditions and in academic and professional success. Using anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI) of healthy children and adults, we found that IC efficiency is constrained by the morphology (sulcal pattern) of two key regions of the neural network underlying IC. Because the sulcal pattern is a morphologic feature of cortical anatomy that is determined during fetal life and stable during development, our findings provide evidence that interindividual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes and that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Schwannomatosis and neurofibromatosis type 2 are hereditary tumor syndromes and peripheral neuropathy has been reported in both. We prospectively applied <em>in-vivo</em> morphometric measurement of dorsal root ganglia volume in 16 schwannomatosis, 14 neurofibromatosis type 2 patients, and 26 healthy controls by MR-Neurography. Compared to healthy controls, dorsal root ganglia hypertrophy was a consistent finding in neurofibromatosis type 2 (L3: +267%, L4: +235%, L5: +241%, S1: +300% and S2: +242%, Bonferroni-adjusted p&lt;0.001) but not in schwannomatosis. Dorsal root ganglia may be a vulnerable site in origination of areflexia and sensory loss and a useful diagnostic marker in neurofibromatosis type 2. This article is protected by copyright.

<p>Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire and fine-tune
knowledge throughout their lifespan. This ability is mediated by a rich set of
neurocognitive functions that together contribute to the early development and
experience-driven specialization of our sensorimotor skills. Consequently, the
ability to learn from continuous streams of information is crucial for
computational learning systems and autonomous agents (inter)acting in the real
world. However, continual lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge
for machine learning and neural network models since the incremental
acquisition of new skills from non-stationary data distributions generally
leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a
major drawback also for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that
typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus
without accounting for situations in which the number of tasks is not known a
priori and the information becomes incrementally available over time. In this
review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to continual
lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural
network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic
interference. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific
continual lifelong learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts
are required for the development of general-purpose artificial intelligence and
autonomous agents. We discuss well-established research and recent
methodological trends motivated by experimentally observed lifelong learning
factors in biological systems. Such factors include principles of neurosynaptic
stability-plasticity, critical developmental stages, intrinsically motivated
exploration, transfer learning, and crossmodal integration.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The thalamus receives input from 3 distinct cortical layers, but input from only 2 of these has been well characterized. We therefore investigated whether the third input, derived from layer 6b, is more similar to the projections from layer 6a or layer 5. We studied the projections of a restricted population of deep layer 6 cells (“layer 6b cells”) taking advantage of the transgenic mouse Tg(Drd1a-cre)FK164Gsat/Mmucd (Drd1a-Cre), that selectively expresses Cre-recombinase in a subpopulation of layer 6b neurons across the entire cortical mantle. At P8, 18% of layer 6b neurons are labeled with Drd1a-Cre::tdTomato in somatosensory cortex (SS), and some co-express known layer 6b markers. Using Cre-dependent viral tracing, we identified topographical projections to higher order thalamic nuclei. VGluT1+ synapses formed by labeled layer 6b projections were found in posterior thalamic nucleus (Po) but not in the (pre)thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The lack of TRN collaterals was confirmed with single-cell tracing from SS. Transmission electron microscopy comparison of terminal varicosities from layer 5 and layer 6b axons in Po showed that L6b varicosities are markedly smaller and simpler than the majority from L5. Our results suggest that L6b projections to the thalamus are distinct from both L5 and L6a projections.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Goal-directed behavior requires cognitive control of action, putatively by means of frontal-lobe impact on posterior brain areas. We investigated frontoparietal directed interaction (DI) in monkeys during memory-guided rule-based reaches, to test if DI supports motor-goal selection or working memory (WM) processes. We computed DI between the parietal reach region (PRR) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) with a Granger-causality measure of intracortical local field potentials (LFP). LFP mostly in the beta (12–32 Hz) and low-frequency (f≤10Hz) ranges contributed to DI. During movement withholding, beta-band activity in PRR had a Granger-causal effect on PMd independent of WM content. Complementary, low-frequency PMd activity had a transient Granger-causing effect on PRR specifically during WM retrieval of spatial motor goals, while no DI was associated with preliminary motor-goal selection. Our results support the idea that premotor and posterior parietal cortices interact functionally to achieve cognitive control during goal-directed behavior, in particular, that frontal-to-parietal interaction occurs during retrieval of motor-goal information from spatial WM.</span>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Loss of function of the astrocyte-specific protein MLC1 leads to the childhood onset leukodystrophy “megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts” (MLC). Studies on isolated cells show a role for MLC1 in astrocyte volume regulation and suggest that disturbed brain ion and water homeostasis is central to the disease. Excitability of neuronal networks is particularly sensitive to ion and water homeostasis. In line with this, reports of seizures and epilepsy in MLC patients exist. However, systematic assessment and mechanistic understanding of seizures in MLC are lacking.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We analyzed an MLC patient inventory to study occurrence of seizures in MLC. We used two distinct genetic mouse models of MLC to further study epileptiform activity and seizure threshold through wireless extracellular field potential recordings. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings and K<sup>+</sup>-sensitive electrode recordings in mouse brain slices were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy in MLC.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: An early onset of seizures is common in MLC. Similarly, in MLC mice we uncovered spontaneous epileptiform brain activity and a lowered threshold for induced seizures. At the cellular level, we found that although passive and active properties of individual pyramidal neurons are unchanged, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> dynamics and neuronal network activity are abnormal in MLC mice.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Disturbed astrocyte regulation of ion and water homeostasis in MLC causes hyperexcitability of neuronal networks and seizures. These findings suggest a role for defective astrocyte volume regulation in epilepsy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) channels underlie action potential generation and propagation and hence are central to the regulation of excitability in the nervous system. Mutations in the genes <em>SCN1A</em>, <em>SCN2A</em>, and <em>SCN8A</em>, encoding the Na<sup>+</sup> channel pore-forming (α) subunits Nav1.1, 1.2, and 1.6, respectively, and <em>SCN1B</em>, encoding the accessory subunit β<sub>1</sub>, are established causes of genetic epilepsies. <em>SCN3A</em>, encoding Nav1.3, is known to be highly expressed in brain, but has not previously been linked to early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. Here, we describe a cohort of four patients with epileptic encephalopathy and heterozygous <em>de novo</em> missense variants in <em>SCN3A</em> (p.Ile875Thr in two cases, p.Pro1333Leu, and p.Val1769Ala).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: All patients presented with treatment-resistant epilepsy in the first year of life, severe to profound intellectual disability, and, in two cases (both with the variant p.Ile875Thr), diffuse polymicrogyria.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Electrophysiological recordings of mutant channels revealed prominent gain of channel function, with a markedly increased amplitude of the slowly inactivating current component, and, for two of three mutants (p.Ile875Thr and p.Pro1333Leu), a left-shift in the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarized potentials. Gain of function was not observed for Nav1.3 variants known or presumed to be inherited (p.Arg1642Cys and p.Lys1799Gln). The anti-seizure medications phenytoin and lacosamide selectively blocked slowly inactivating over transient current in wild-type and mutant Nav1.3 channels.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: These findings establish <em>SCN3A</em> as a new gene for infantile epileptic encephalopathy and suggest a potential pharmacologic intervention. These findings also reinforce the role of Nav1.3 as an important regulator of neuronal excitability in the developing brain while providing additional insight into mechanisms of slow inactivation of Nav1.3.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: To determine relationships of memory complaints to cognitive function and decline, incident dementia, and neurodegenerative and other neuropathologies, as well as the population-attributable risk for dementia in older black and white persons.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: 4015 community-based persons (28% black; 74% women; mean baseline age 78 years), were enrolled in one of four longitudinal cohort studies, and another 2937 in a population-based cohort. Memory scores, assessed using two questions (5-point Likert scales) were categorized as complaints present or absent. Global cognition and five cognitive domains were derived from annual neuropsychological tests. Dementia was assessed from these tests and additional data. Neuropathologic data were available for 1350 deceased with brain autopsies. Regression and mixed effects models were used to examine relationships of memory complaints to cognition and neuropathology.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Baseline memory complaints (n=1310; 33% of 4015) were associated with lower cognition and faster decline in all domains (global score estimate = -0.032 [SE=0.004], <em>p</em>&lt;0.0001), during a mean follow-up of 6 (SD=2) years. Persons with memory complaints had higher dementia risk (HR=1.64; 95%CI: 1.42-1.89) and odds of pathologic Alzheimer's disease (OR=1.96; 95%CI: 1.51-2.54), neocortical Lewy bodies (OR=2.47, 95%CI: 1.54-3.96), and other neurodegenerative pathologies. Results for dementia risk were similar among blacks and whites. Among 2937 older persons in a population-based cohort with similar data, the population-attributable risk for incident dementia due to memory complaints was 14.0% (95%CI: 2.6-23.0), and did not vary between the black and white groups.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Memory complaints are common in older black and white persons, and relate to cognitive decline, dementia risk, and neurodegenerative pathologies. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

Abstract
<p>Neuropathic pain is caused by peripheral nerve injury (PNI). One hallmark symptom is allodynia (pain caused by normally innocuous stimuli), but its mechanistic underpinning remains elusive. Notably, whether selective stimulation of non-nociceptive primary afferent Aβ fibers indeed evokes neuropathic pain-like sensory and emotional behaviors after PNI is unknown, because of the lack of tools to manipulate Aβ fiber function in awake, freely moving animals. In this study, we used a transgenic rat line that enables stimulation of non-nociceptive Aβ fibers by a light-activated channel (channelrhodopsin-2; ChR2). We found that illuminating light to the plantar skin of these rats with PNI elicited pain-like withdrawal behaviors that were resistant to morphine. Light illumination to the skin of PNI rats increased the number of spinal dorsal horn (SDH) Lamina I neurons positive to activity markers (c-Fos and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; pERK). Whole-cell recording revealed that optogenetic Aβ fiber stimulation after PNI caused excitation of Lamina I neurons, which were normally silent by this stimulation. Moreover, illuminating the hindpaw of PNI rats resulted in activation of central amygdaloid neurons and produced an aversion to illumination. Thus, these findings provide the first evidence that optogenetic activation of primary afferent Aβ fibers in PNI rats produces excitation of Lamina I neurons and neuropathic pain-like behaviors that were resistant to morphine treatment. This approach may provide a new path for investigating circuits and behaviors of Aβ fiber-mediated neuropathic allodynia with sensory and emotional aspects after PNI and for discovering novel drugs to treat neuropathic pain.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0415-17.2018?rss=1">Short-Term Depression of Axonal Spikes at the Mouse Hippocampal Mossy Fibers and Sodium Channel-Dependent Modulation</a></h4>

<p>Axonal spike is an important upstream process of transmitter release, which directly impacts on release probability from the presynaptic terminals. Despite the functional significance, possible activity-dependent modulation of axonal spikes has not been studied extensively, partly due to inaccessibility of the small structures of axons for electrophysiological recordings. In this study, we tested the possibility of use-dependent changes in axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, where direct recordings from the axon terminals are readily feasible. Hippocampal slices were made from mice of either sex, and loose-patch clamp recordings were obtained from the visually identified giant mossy fiber boutons located in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. Stimulation of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus elicited axonal spikes at the single bouton which occurred in all or none fashion. Unexpected from the digital nature of spike signaling, the peak amplitude of the second spikes in response to paired stimuli at a 50-ms interval was slightly but reproducibly smaller than the first spikes. Repetitive stimuli at 20 or 100 Hz also caused progressive use-dependent depression during the train. Notably, veratridine, an inhibitor of inactivation of sodium channels, significantly accelerated the depression with minimal effect on the initial spikes. These results suggest that sodium channels contribute to use-dependent depression of axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, possibly by shaping the afterdepolarization (ADP) following axonal spikes. Prolonged depolarization during ADP may inactivate a fraction of sodium channels and thereby suppresses the subsequent spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers.</p>

However, the physiological effects produced by GPi DBS are not fully understood. In particular, how a single-pulse GPi DBS changes cortical circuits has never been investigated. We studied the modulation of motor cortical excitability and plasticity with single-pulse GPi DBS in dystonia patients with bilateral implantation of GPi DBS.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25156-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>The cortical evoked potentials from DBS were recorded with electroencephalography. Transcranial magnetic stimulation with a conditioning test paired-pulse paradigm was used to investigate the effect of GPi DBS on the primary motor cortex. How GPi DBS might modulate the motor cortical plasticity was tested using a paired associative stimulation paradigm with repetitive pairs of GPi DBS and motor cortical stimulation at specific time intervals.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25156-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>GPi stimulation produced 2 peaks of cortical evoked potentials with latencies of ∼10 and ∼25 milliseconds in the motor cortical area. Cortical facilitation was observed at ∼10 milliseconds after single-pulse GPi DBS, and cortical inhibition was observed after a ∼25-millisecond interval. Repetitive pairs of GPi stimulation with cortical stimulation at these 2 time intervals produced long-term potentiation-like effects in the motor cortex.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25156-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Single-pulse DBS modulates cortical excitability and plasticity at specific time intervals.

<div class="section" id="ana25159-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Recent studies have underlined the effect of systemic inflammation on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity and contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation if not tightly regulated. The aim of our study was to fully characterize human circulating neutrophils at different disease stages in AD.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25159-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We analyzed neutrophil phenotypes and functions in 42 patients with AD (16 with mild cognitive impairment and 26 with dementia), and compared them to 22 age-matched healthy subjects. This study was performed directly in whole blood to avoid issues with data interpretation related to cell isolation procedures.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25159-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Blood samples from AD patients with dementia revealed neutrophil hyperactivation associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and increased levels of intravascular neutrophil extravascular traps. The homeostasis of circulating neutrophils in these patients also changed: The ratio between the harmful hyperreactive CXCR4<sup>high</sup>/CD62L<sup>low</sup> senescent and the CD16<sup>bright</sup>/CD62L<sup>dim</sup> immunosuppressive neutrophil subsets rose in the later stage of the disease. These abnormalities were greater in fast-decliner than in slow-decliner patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25159-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Our results indicate that the inflammatory properties of circulating neutrophils shift as the percentage of aged neutrophils expands in patients with AD—changes that may play an instrumental role in establishing systemic chronic inflammation. Most important, our data strongly suggest that the neutrophil phenotype may be associated with the rate of cognitive decline and may thus constitute an innovative and prognostic blood biomarker in patients with AD.

How the brain generates accurate movement is a long-standing problem in neuroscience. In this issue of Neuron, Russo et al. (2018) argue that population activity in motor cortex does not represent muscle patterns but rather untangled neural trajectories that are robust to noise.

In this issue of Neuron, Dawes et al. (2018) show that CASPR2 antibodies (Abs) isolated from patients bind specifically to primary afferent cell bodies and induce neuropathic pain in mice. Consequent decreased expression of Kv1 channels and their aberrant localization along myelinated axons explain the observed hyperexcitability and pain.

In this issue Neuron, Turchi et al. (2018) reversibly inactivate the basal forebrain to show that this region magnifies global neocortical signal fluctuations without altering the topography of canonical resting-state networks. Thus, spatially diffuse signals in functional neuroimaging data may track large-scale neuromodulatory state changes in the primate brain.

<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) are an important cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. In this work we aimed to investigate whether abnormal gene regulation, mediated by microRNA, could be involved in FCD type II.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We used total RNA from the brain tissue of 16 patients with FCD type II and 28 controls. MicroRNA expression was initially assessed by microarray. Quantitative PCR (qPCR), <em>in situ</em> hybridization, luciferase reporter assays and deep sequencing for genes in the mTOR pathway were performed to validate and further explore our initial study.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: hsa-let-7f (p=0.039), hsa-miR-31 (p=0.0078) and hsa-miR34a (p=0.021) were downregulated in FCD type II, whereas a transcription factor involved in neuronal and glial fate specification, <em>NEUROG2</em> (p&lt;0.05), was upregulated. We also found that the <em>RND2</em> gene, a <em>NEUROG2-</em>target, is upregulated (p&lt;0.001). <em>In vitro</em> experiments showed that hsa-miR-34a downregulates <em>NEUROG2</em> by binding to its 5'-untranslated region. Moreover, we observed strong nuclear expression of <em>NEUROG2</em> in balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons and found that 28.5% of our patients presented brain somatic mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Our findings suggest a new molecular mechanism, in which <em>NEUROG2</em> has a pivotal and central role in the pathogenesis of FCD type II. In this way, we found that the downregulation of hsa-miR-34a leads to upregulation of <em>NEUROG2,</em> and consequently to overexpression of the <em>RND2</em> gene. These findings indicate that a faulty coupling in neuronal differentiation and migration mechanisms may explain the presence of aberrant cells and complete dyslamination in FCD type II.

It has been known for decades that degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC), the major noradrenergic nucleus in the brain, occurs in both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but it was given scant attention. It is now recognized that hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC is the first detectable AD-like neuropathology in the human brain, α-synuclein inclusions in the LC represent an early step in PD, and experimental LC lesions exacerbate neuropathology and cognitive/behavioral deficits in animal models.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective: Many stroke patients show remarkable recovery of language after initial severe impairment, but it is difficult to predict which patients will show good recovery. We aimed to identify patient and lesion characteristics that together predict the best naming outcome in four studies.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods: We report two longitudinal studies that identified two variables at onset that were strongly associated with good recovery of naming (the most common residual deficit in aphasia) in the first six months after stroke: damage to left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and/or superior longitudinal fasciculus/arcuate fasciculus (SLF/AF) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use. We then tested these variables in two independent cohorts of chronic left hemisphere stroke patients, using chi squared tests and multivariable logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes and t-tests for continuous outcomes.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results: Lesion load in left pSTG and SLF/AF was associated with poorer naming outcome. Preservation of these areas and use of SSRIs were associated with naming recovery, independent of lesion volume, time since stroke, and depression. Patients with damage to these critical areas showed better naming outcome if they took SSRIs for three months after stroke. Those with preservation of these critical areas achieved good recovery of naming regardless of SSRI use.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation: Lesion load in left pSTG and SLF/AF at onset predicts later naming performance. Although based on a small number of patients, our preliminary results suggest outcome might be modulated by SSRIs, but these associations need to be confirmed in a larger randomized controlled trial.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objectives</b>: To assess [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake patterns across the primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants (logopenic, semantic and agrammatic), examine regional uptake patterns of [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 independent of clinical diagnosis, and compare the diagnostic utility of [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451, [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluorodeoxygluclose (FDG)-PET and MRI to differentiate the PPA variants.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We performed statistical parametric mapping of [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 across 40 PPA patients (logopenic-PPA=14, semantic-PPA=13 and agrammatic-PPA=13) compared to 80 cognitively normal, PiB-negative controls, age and gender matched 2:1. Principal component analysis of regional [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 tau-PET SUVR was performed to understand underlying patterns of [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 uptake independent of clinical diagnosis. Penalized multinomial regression analyses were utilized to assess diagnostic utility.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Logopenic-PPA showed striking uptake throughout neocortex, particularly temporoparietal, compared to controls, semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA. Semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA showed milder patterns of focal [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 uptake. Semantic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left&gt;right) in anteromedial temporal lobes, compared to controls and agrammatic-PPA. Agrammatic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left&gt;right) throughout prefrontal white matter and in subcortical grey matter structures, compared to controls and semantic-PPA. The principal component analysis of regional [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 indicated two primary dimensions, a severity dimension that distinguished logopenic-PPA from agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA, and a frontal-versus-temporal contrast that distinguishes agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA cases. Diagnostic utility of [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451was superior to MRI and at least equal to FDG-PET.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451binding characteristics differ across the PPA variants, and were excellent at distinguishing between the variants. [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451binding characteristics were as good or better than other brain imaging modalities utilized in clinical practice, suggesting that [<sup>18</sup>F]AV-1451 may have clinical diagnostic utility in PPA.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Reduction in parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons is observed in adult mice exposed to ethanol at postnatal day 7 (P7), a late gestation fetal alcohol spectrum disorder model. To evaluate whether PV<sup>+</sup> cells are lost, or PV expression is reduced, we quantified PV<sup>+</sup> and associated perineuronal net (PNN)<sup>+</sup> cell densities in barrel cortex. While PNN<sup>+</sup> cell density was not reduced by P7 ethanol, PV cell density decreased by 25% at P90 with no decrease at P14. PNN<sup>+</sup> cells in controls were virtually all PV<sup>+</sup>, whereas more than 20% lacked PV in ethanol-treated adult animals. P7 ethanol caused immediate apoptosis in 10% of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in G42 mice, which express GFP in a subset of PV<sup>+</sup> cells, and GFP<sup>+</sup> cell density decreased by 60% at P90 without reduction at P14. The ethanol effect on PV<sup>+</sup> cell density was attenuated by lithium treatment at P7 or at P14–28. Thus, reduced PV<sup>+</sup> cell density may be caused by disrupted cell maturation, in addition to acute apoptosis. This effect may be regionally specific: in the dentate gyrus, P7 ethanol reduced PV<sup>+</sup> cell density by 70% at P14 and both PV<sup>+</sup> and PNN<sup>+</sup> cell densities by 50% at P90, and delayed lithium did not alleviate ethanol’s effect.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural progenitor proliferation and cell fate decision from self-renewal to differentiation are crucial factors in determining brain size and morphology. The cytoskeletal dependent regulation of these processes is not entirely known. The actin-binding filamin A (FlnA) was shown to regulate proliferation of progenitors by directing changes in cell cycles proteins such as Cdk1 during G2/M phase. Here we report that functional loss of FlnA not only affects the rate of proliferation by altering cell cycle length but also causes a defect in early differentiation through changes in cell fate specification. FlnA interacts with Rho GTPase RhoA, and FlnA loss impairs RhoA activation. Disruption of either of these cytoskeletal associated proteins delays neurogenesis and promotes neural progenitors to remain in proliferative states. Aurora kinase B (Aurkb) has been implicated in cytokinesis, and peaks in expression during the G2/M phase. Inhibition of FlnA or RhoA impairs Aurkb degradation and alters its localization during mitosis. Overexpression of Aurkb replicates the same delay in neurogenesis seen with loss of FlnA or RhoA. Our findings suggest that shared cytoskeletal processes can direct neural progenitor proliferation by regulating the expression and localization of proteins that are implicated in the cell cycle progression and cell fate specification.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We have proposed that cortical nNOS/NK1R interneurons have a role in sleep homeostasis. The hypocretins (orexins) are wake-promoting neuropeptides and hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) neurons project to the cortex. Hcrt peptides affect deep layer cortical neurons, and Hcrt receptor 1 (<span style="font-style: italic;">Hcrtr1; Ox1r</span>) mRNA is expressed in cortical nNOS/NK1R cells. Therefore, we investigated whether Hcrt neuron stimulation affects cingulate cortex nNOS/NK1R neurons. Bath application of HCRT1/orexin-A evoked an inward current and membrane depolarization in most nNOS/NK1R cells which persisted in tetrodotoxin; optogenetic stimulation of Hcrt terminals expressing channelrhodopsin-2 confirmed these results, and pharmacological studies determined that HCRTR1 mediated these responses. Single-cell RT-PCR found <span style="font-style: italic;">Hcrtr1</span> mRNA in 31% of nNOS/NK1R cells without any <span style="font-style: italic;">Hcrtr2</span> mRNA expression; immunohistochemical studies of <span style="font-style: italic;">Hcrtr1-EGFP</span> mice confirmed that a minority of nNOS/NK1R cells express HCRTR1. When Hcrt neurons degenerated in <span style="font-style: italic;">orexin-tTA;TetO DTA</span> mice, the increased EEG delta power during NREM sleep produced in response to 4 h sleep deprivation and c-FOS expression in cortical nNOS/NK1R cells during recovery sleep were indistinguishable from that of controls. We conclude that Hcrt excitatory input to these deep layer cells is mediated through HCRTR1 but is unlikely to be involved in the putative role of cortical nNOS/NK1R neurons in sleep homeostasis.</span>

The ability of the retina to adapt to changes in mean light intensity and contrast is well known. Classically, however, adaptation is thought to affect gain but not to change the visual modality encoded by a given type of retinal neuron. Recent findings reveal unexpected dynamic properties in mouse retinal neurons that challenge this view. Specifically, certain cell types change the visual modality they encode with variations in ambient illumination or following repetitive visual stimulation. These discoveries demonstrate that computations performed by retinal circuits with defined architecture can change with visual input.

Vyas et al. ask whether learning “covertly,” without physical movements, can transfer to overt behavior. By using visuomotor perturbations, they show that covert and overt movements derive from a common neural substrate consisting of motor cortical preparatory activity that facilitates transfer of learning.
