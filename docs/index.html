              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NICEdrug.ch, a workflow for rational drug design and systems-level analysis of drug metabolism</a></h4>

              
                The discovery of a drug requires over a decade of intensive research and financial investments – and still has a high risk of failure. To reduce this burden, we developed the NICEdrug.ch resource, which incorporates 250,000 bioactive molecules, and studied their enzymatic metabolic targets, fate, and toxicity. NICEdrug.ch includes a unique fingerprint that identifies reactive similarities between drug–drug and drug–metabolite pairs. We validated the application, scope, and performance of NICEdrug.ch over similar methods in the field on golden standard datasets describing drugs and metabolites sharing reactivity, drug toxicities, and drug targets. We use NICEdrug.ch to evaluate inhibition and toxicity by the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil, and suggest avenues to alleviate its side effects. We propose shikimate 3-phosphate for targeting liver-stage malaria with minimal impact on the human host cell. Finally, NICEdrug.ch suggests over 1300 candidate drugs and food molecules to target COVID-19 and explains their inhibitory mechanism for further experimental screening. The NICEdrug.ch database is accessible online to systematically identify the reactivity of small molecules and druggable enzymes with practical applications in lead discovery and drug repurposing.

                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a major and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, yet the biological mechanisms involved in its aetiology are poorly understood. Evidence links this disorder with mitochondrial dysfunction and/or impaired lysosomal degradation – key features of the autophagy of mitochondria, known as mitophagy. Here, we investigated the role of LRRK2, a protein kinase frequently mutated in PD, in this process in vivo. Using mitophagy and autophagy reporter mice, bearing either knockout of LRRK2 or expressing the pathogenic kinase-activating G2019S LRRK2 mutation, we found that basal mitophagy was specifically altered in clinically relevant cells and tissues. Our data show that basal mitophagy inversely correlates with LRRK2 kinase activity in vivo. In support of this, use of distinct LRRK2 kinase inhibitors in cells increased basal mitophagy, and a CNS penetrant LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, GSK3357679A, rescued the mitophagy defects observed in LRRK2 G2019S mice. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that pathogenic LRRK2 directly impairs basal mitophagy, a process with strong links to idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, and demonstrates that pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 is a rational mitophagy-rescue approach and potential PD therapy.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Enhanced cerebellar oscillations have recently been identified in essential tremor (ET) patients as a key pathophysiological change. Since ET is considered a heterogeneous group of diseases, we investigated whether cerebellar oscillations differ in ET subtypes (familial vs. sporadic). This study aims to determine cerebellar physiology in familial and sporadic ET. Using surface electroencephalogram, we studied cerebellar physiology in 40 ET cases (<em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 22 familial and <em class="a-plus-plus">n</em> = 18 sporadic) and 20 age-matched controls. Both familial and sporadic ET cases had an increase in the intensity of cerebellar oscillations when compared to controls. Interestingly, cerebellar oscillations correlated with tremor severity in familial ET but not in sporadic ET. Our study demonstrated that ET cases have enhanced cerebellar oscillations, and the different relationships between cerebellar oscillations and tremor severity in familial and sporadic ET suggest diverse cerebellar pathophysiology.</p>

                Background: Delayed cerebral ischemia and cerebral vasospasm remain the leading causes of poor outcome in survivors of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Refractory cerebral vasospasms can be treated with endovascular vasodilator therapy, which can either be performed in conscious sedation or general anesthesia. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of the anesthesia modality on long-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular vasodilator therapy due to cerebral vasospasm and hypoperfusion. Methods: Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were retrospectively analyzed at time of discharge from the hospital and six months after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additionally, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was assessed 24 hours before, immediately before, immediately after, and 24 hours after endovascular vasodilator therapy, and at discharge and six months. Interventional parameters such as duration of intervention, choice and dosage of vasodilator and number of arteries treated were also recorded. Results: A total of 98 patients were included in this analysis and separated into patients who had interventions in conscious sedation, general anesthesia and a mix of both. Neither mRS at discharge nor at six months showed a significant difference for functionally independent outcomes (mRS 0-2) between groups. NIHSS before endovascular vasodilator therapy was significantly higher in patients receiving interventions in general anesthesia but did not differ anymore between groups six months after the initial bleed. Conclusion: This study did not observe a difference in outcome whether patients underwent endovascular vasodilator therapy in general anesthesia or conscious sedation for refractory cerebral vasospasms. Hence, the choice should be made for each patient individually.

                Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung is an uncommon subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Even in the early stages, pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) has a dismal prognosis when compared to other kinds of NSCLC with a mean survival of 9–12 months and a five-year survival rate of around 20%. We present the case of a 68-year-old woman with a two-month history of shortness of breath and cough. Initial computed tomography (CT) scan showed features of interstitial lung disease with chronic obstructive airway changes. After 34 months, the patient’s condition worsened with newer complaints of sore throat and hemoptysis. A repeat CT scan showed a ∼49x38x59mm size lesion in the superior segment of the left lower lobe. A core needle biopsy was performed, which revealed tumor cells consisting of irregular tubules and sarcomatoid components. The patient was started on chemotherapy. Unfortunately, she succumbed to her disease. Our case highlights the aggressiveness of PSC.

Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are suggested as tools to improve the documentation of research data and make them universally accessible. In a self-guided approach, we introduced the open-source ELN eLabFTW into our life-science lab group and, after using it for a while, think it is a useful tool to overcome hurdles in ELN introduction by providing a combination of properties making it suitable for small life-science labs, like ours. We set up our instance of eLabFTW, without any further programming needed. Our efforts to embrace open data approach by introducing an ELN fits well with other institutional organized ELN initiatives in academic research and our goals towards data quality management.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model checking via testing for direct effects in Mendelian Randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yangqing Deng, Wei Pan</p>

It is of great interest and potential to discover causal relationships between pairs of exposures and outcomes using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to deal with hidden confounding in observational studies. Two most popular approaches are Mendelian randomization (MR), which usually use independent genetic variants/SNPs across the genome, and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) (or their generalizations) using cis-SNPs local to a gene (or some genome-wide and likely dependent SNPs), as IVs. In spite of their many promising applications, both approaches face a major challenge: the validity of their causal conclusions depends on three critical assumptions on valid IVs, and more generally on other modeling assumptions, which however may not hold in practice. The most likely as well as challenging situation is due to the wide-spread horizontal pleiotropy, leading to two of the three IV assumptions being violated and thus to biased statistical inference. More generally, we’d like to conduct a goodness-of-fit (GOF) test to check the model being used. Although some methods have been proposed as being robust to various degrees to the violation of some modeling assumptions, they often give different and even conflicting results due to their own modeling assumptions and possibly lower statistical efficiency, imposing difficulties to the practitioner in choosing and interpreting varying results across different methods. Hence, it would help to directly test whether any assumption is violated or not. In particular, there is a lack of such tests for TWAS. We propose a new and general GOF test, called TEDE (TEsting Direct Effects), applicable to both correlated and independent SNPs/IVs (as commonly used in TWAS and MR respectively). Through simulation studies and real data examples, we demonstrate high statistical power and advantages of our new method, while confirming the frequent violation of modeling (including valid IV) assumptions in practice and thus the importance of model checking by applying such a test in MR/TWAS analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical framework for place coding in the auditory system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alex D. Reyes</p>

In the auditory system, tonotopy is postulated to be the substrate for a place code, where sound frequency is encoded by the location of the neurons that fire during the stimulus. Though conceptually simple, the computations that allow for the representation of intensity and complex sounds are poorly understood. Here, a mathematical framework is developed in order to define clearly the conditions that support a place code. To accommodate both frequency and intensity information, the neural network is described as a space with elements that represent individual neurons and clusters of neurons. A mapping is then constructed from acoustic space to neural space so that frequency and intensity are encoded, respectively, by the location and size of the clusters. Algebraic operations -addition and multiplication- are derived to elucidate the rules for representing, assembling, and modulating multi-frequency sound in networks. The resulting outcomes of these operations are consistent with network simulations as well as with electrophysiological and psychophysical data. The analyses show how both frequency and intensity can be encoded with a purely place code, without the need for rate or temporal coding schemes. The algebraic operations are used to describe loudness summation and suggest a mechanism for the critical band. The mathematical approach complements experimental and computational approaches and provides a foundation for interpreting data and constructing models.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Topology-preserving smoothing of retinotopic maps</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yanshuai Tu, Duyan Ta, Zhong-Lin Lu, Yalin Wang</p>

Retinotopic mapping, i.e., the mapping between visual inputs on the retina and neuronal activations in cortical visual areas, is one of the central topics in visual neuroscience. For human observers, the mapping is obtained by analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals of cortical responses to slowly moving visual stimuli on the retina. Although it is well known from neurophysiology that the mapping is topological (i.e., the topology of neighborhood connectivity is preserved) within each visual area, retinotopic maps derived from the state-of-the-art methods are often not topological because of the low signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution of fMRI. The violation of topological condition is most severe in cortical regions corresponding to the neighborhood of the fovea (e.g., < 1 degree eccentricity in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset), significantly impeding accurate analysis of retinotopic maps. This study aims to directly model the topological condition and generate topology-preserving and smooth retinotopic maps. Specifically, we adopted the Beltrami coefficient, a metric of quasiconformal mapping, to define the topological condition, developed a mathematical model to quantify topological smoothing as a constrained optimization problem, and elaborated an efficient numerical method to solve the problem. The method was then applied to V1, V2, and V3 simultaneously in the HCP dataset. Experiments with both simulated and real retinotopy data demonstrated that the proposed method could generate topological and smooth retinotopic maps.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High-throughput Interpretation of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor Short-read Sequencing Data with PING</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wesley M. Marin, Ravi Dandekar, Danillo G. Augusto, Tasneem Yusufali, Bianca Heyn, Jan Hofmann, Vinzenz Lange, Jürgen Sauter, Paul J. Norman, Jill A. Hollenbach</p>

The <i>killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor</i> (<i>KIR)</i> complex on chromosome 19 encodes receptors that modulate the activity of natural killer cells, and variation in these genes has been linked to infectious and autoimmune disease, as well as having bearing on pregnancy and transplant outcomes. The medical relevance and high variability of <i>KIR</i> genes makes short-read sequencing an attractive technology for interrogating the region, providing a high-throughput, high-fidelity sequencing method that is cost-effective. However, because this gene complex is characterized by extensive nucleotide polymorphism, structural variation including gene fusions and deletions, and a high level of homology between genes, its interrogation at high resolution has been thwarted by bioinformatic challenges, with most studies limited to examining presence or absence of specific genes. Here, we present the PING (Pushing Immunogenetics to the Next Generation) pipeline, which incorporates empirical data, novel alignment strategies and a custom alignment processing workflow to enable high-throughput <i>KIR</i> sequence analysis from short-read data. PING provides <i>KIR</i> gene copy number classification functionality for all <i>KIR</i> genes through use of a comprehensive alignment reference. The gene copy number determined per individual enables an innovative genotype determination workflow using genotype-matched references. Together, these methods address the challenges imposed by the structural complexity and overall homology of the <i>KIR</i> complex. To determine copy number and genotype determination accuracy, we applied PING to European and African validation cohorts and a synthetic dataset. PING demonstrated exceptional copy number determination performance across all datasets and robust genotype determination performance. Finally, an investigation into discordant genotypes for the synthetic dataset provides insight into misaligned reads, advancing our understanding in interpretation of short-read sequencing data in complex genomic regions. PING promises to support a new era of studies of KIR polymorphism, delivering high-resolution <i>KIR</i> genotypes that are highly accurate, enabling high-quality, high-throughput <i>KIR</i> genotyping for disease and population studies.

Data from filamentous fungi suggest that, even when bathed in a common cytoplasm, nuclei are capable of autonomous behaviors, including division. How does this potential for autonomy affect the organization of cellular processes between nuclei? Here we analyze a simplified model of circadian rhythm, a form of cellular oscillator, in a mathematical model of the filamentous fungus <i>Neurospora crassa</i>. Our results highlight a potential role played by mRNA-protein phase separation to keep mRNAs close to the nuclei from which they originate, while allowing proteins to diffuse freely between nuclei. Our modeling shows that syncytism allows for extreme mRNA efficiency—we demonstrate assembly of a robust oscillator with a transcription rate a thousand-fold less than in comparable uninucleate cells. We also show self-organized division of the labor of mRNA production, with one nucleus in a two-nucleus syncytium producing at least twice as many mRNAs as the other in 30% of cycles. This division can occur spontaneously, but division of labor can also be controlled by regulating the amount of cytoplasmic volume available to each nucleus. Taken together, our results show the intriguing richness and potential for emergent organization among nuclei in multinucleate cells. They also highlight the role of previously studied mechanisms of cellular organization, including nuclear space control and localization of mRNAs through RNA-protein phase separation, in regulating nuclear coordination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Presentation of cytokine profile in relation to oxidative stress parameters in patients with severe COVID-19: an observational pilot study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: COVID-19 can be worsened by hyper-production of cytokines accompanied by increased level of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between a set of cytokines and the markers of the oxidative stress. Methods: The levels of cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL8, IL-10, VEGF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1α, MCP-1 and EGF were determined by using High Sensitivity Evidence Investigator™ Biochip Array technology. The oxidative stress parameters (d-ROM, PAT, OS index) were measured in serum on FRAS5 analytical photometric system. Results: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF, MCP-1 and EGF were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the patients with severe COVID-19 with increased levels of IL-2, IFN-g, TNF-a and IL-1α. The d-ROM, OS index, and PAT were significantly higher (p<0.05) in severe COVID-19 patients. IL-6 demonstrated the strongest correlation with all of the markers of the oxidative stress, d-ROM (r=0.9725, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.5000, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.9593, p=0.012). Similar behavior was evidenced between IFN-g and d-ROM (r=0.4006, p=0.0001), PAT (r=0.6030, p=0.0001) and OS index (r=0.4298, p=0.012). Conclusion: The oxidative stress markers show good correlation with the tested cytokines which can be measured at the beginning of the disease in a primary care setting to predict the course of COVID-19.

                Background: Sea grapes or  Caulerpa racemosa have a lot of phytochemical content, especially unsaturated fatty acids that are beneficial for health. This study aims to evaluate the effects of sea grapes extract on blood glucose levels, total cholesterol-, and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1α in male Wistar rats, which were given per-oral (p.o.) cholesterol- and carbohydrates fat-enriched diets (CFED). Methods: Forty male Wistar albino rats weighing between 200 – 250 g were used for this study. Animals were randomly distributed into four groups of ten animals each. Group A served as control (received standard dry pellet diet). Rats in group B were fed on CFED for 4 weeks.  Groups C and D were fed on CFED and were administered 150 and 450 mg/kg of  sea grapes extract (p.o.), respectively. Results: Group C rats indicated a blood glucose reduction and an increase in PGC-1α serum, in comparison to group D (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between group C and D in blood cholesterol reduction (high dose of the extract did not have significant effects) (p=0.222), and both groups had the same effect in lowering total cholesterol in rats. Conclusion: Sea grapes extract is proven to improve blood glucose, total cholesterol, and PGC-1α levels in rats fed with CFED.

     alt="The complex synaptic pathways onto a looming-detector neuron revealed using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM)"/>
<p>We traced two trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons, in separate larval locusts from their synpases with the LGMD1 in the lobula complex (LOX) through the 2<sup>nd</sup> optic chiasm (OCH2) back into the medulla. In the medulla we found not only downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron but also a feedback loop with TmA neurons making outputs and receiving inputs.


</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of locusts to detect looming stimuli and avoid collisions or predators depends on a neuronal circuit in the locust's optic lobe. Although comprehensively studied for over three decades there are still major questions about the computational steps of this circuit. We used 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae of Locusta migratoria to describe the connection between the lobula giant movement detector 1 (LGMD1) neuron in the lobula complex and the upstream neuropil, the medulla. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the connecting neurons termed trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons and their synaptic connectivity. This enabled us to trace neurons over several hundred micrometers between the medulla and the lobula complex while identifying their synapses. We traced two different TmA neurons, each from a different individual, from their synapses with the LGMD in the lobula complex up into the medulla and describe their synaptic relationships. There is not a simple downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron onto these TmA neurons; there is also a feedback loop in place with TmA neurons making outputs as well as receiving inputs. More than one type of neuron shapes the signal of the TmA neurons in the medulla. We found both columnar and trans-columnar neurons connected with the traced TmA neurons in the medulla. These findings indicate that there are computational steps in the medulla that have not been included in models of the neuronal pathway for looming detection.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic distribution and inferior colliculus projection pattern of inhibitory and excitatory cell types in the lateral superior olive of Mongolian gerbils"/>
<p>In situ hybridization was used to identify inhibitory and excitatory principal neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) of Mongolian gerbil. Inhibitory LSO neurons were less numerous and projected contralaterally. One third of excitatory neurons projected ipsilaterally and were biased to the low-frequency limb of the LSO. This projection appears species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sound localization critically relies on brainstem neurons that compare information from the two ears. The conventional role of the lateral superior olive (LSO) is extraction of intensity differences; however, it is increasingly clear that relative timing, especially of transients, is also an important function. Cellular diversity within the LSO that is not well understood may underlie its multiple roles. There are glycinergic inhibitory and glutamatergic excitatory principal neurons in the LSO, however, there is some disagreement regarding their relative distribution and projection pattern. Here we employ <i>in situ</i> hybridization to definitively identify transmitter types combined with retrograde labeling of projections to the inferior colliculus (IC) to address these questions. Excitatory LSO neurons were more numerous (76%) than inhibitory ones. A smaller proportion of inhibitory neurons were IC-projecting (45% vs. 64% for excitatory) suggesting that inhibitory LSO neurons may have more projections to other regions such the lateral lemniscus or more distributed IC projections. Inhibitory LSO neurons almost exclusively projected ipsilaterally making up a sizeable proportion (41%) of the transmitter type-labeled ipsilateral IC projection from LSO and exhibited a moderate low frequency bias (10% difference H-L). Two thirds of excitatory neurons projected contralaterally and had a slight high frequency bias (4%). One third of excitatory LSO neurons projected ipsilaterally to the IC and these cells were strongly biased toward the low frequency limb of the LSO (37%). This projection appears to be species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing suggesting that this may be a specialization for such ability.</p>

     alt="A schizophrenia risk factor induces marked anatomical deficits at GABAergic-dopaminergic synapses in the rat ventral tegmental area: essential evidence for new targeted therapies"/>
<p><b>Hypothesis:</b> Synaptic changes occur within a midbrain GABA-dopamine circuit of male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor.</p>
<p><b>Outcomes:</b> In the offspring of MIA dams, markedly smaller inhibitory synapses were observed for non-triadic (classic) and newly discovered triadic synapses. These changes could contribute to well documented striatal hyperdopaminergia. The findings provide a new therapeutic target.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To develop new therapies for schizophrenia, evidence accumulated over decades highlights the essential need to investigate the GABAergic synapses that presynaptically influence midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Since current technology restricts these studies to animals, and evidence accumulated in recent decades indicates a developmental origin of schizophrenia, we investigated synaptic changes in male rat offspring exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA), a schizophrenia risk factor. Using a novel combination of lentiviruses, peroxidase-immunogold double-labeling, three-dimensional serial section transmission electron microscopy and stereology, we observed clear anatomical alterations in synaptic inputs on dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA). These changes relate directly to a characteristic feature of schizophrenia: increased dopamine release. In 3-month-old and 14-month-old MIA rats, we found a marked decrease in the volume of presynaptic GABAergic terminals from the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), and in the length of the synapses they made, when innervating pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In MIA rats in the long-term, we also discovered a decrease in the volume of the post-synaptic density (PSD) and in the maximum thickness of the PSD at the same synapses. These marked deficits were evident in conventional GABA-dopamine synapses and in synaptic triads that we discovered involving asymmetric synapses that innervated RMTg GABAergic presynaptic terminals, which in turn innervated pVTA dopaminergic neurons. In triads, the PSD thickness of asymmetric synapses was significantly decreased in MIA rats in the long-term cohort. The extensive anatomical deficits provide a potential basis for new therapies targeted at synaptic inputs on midbrain pVTA dopaminergic neurons, in contrast to current striatum-targeted anti-psychotic drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Deep learning detects cardiotoxicity in a high-content screen with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes</a></h4>

              
                Drug-induced cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are major causes of drug attrition. To decrease late-stage drug attrition, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries need to establish biologically relevant models that use phenotypic screening to detect drug-induced toxicity <i>in vitro</i>. In this study, we sought to rapidly detect patterns of cardiotoxicity using high-content image analysis with deep learning and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). We screened a library of 1280 bioactive compounds and identified those with potential cardiotoxic liabilities in iPSC-CMs using a single-parameter score based on deep learning. Compounds demonstrating cardiotoxicity in iPSC-CMs included DNA intercalators, ion channel blockers, epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin-dependent kinase, and multi-kinase inhibitors. We also screened a diverse library of molecules with unknown targets and identified chemical frameworks that show cardiotoxic signal in iPSC-CMs. By using this screening approach during target discovery and lead optimization, we can de-risk early-stage drug discovery. We show that the broad applicability of combining deep learning with iPSC technology is an effective way to interrogate cellular phenotypes and identify drugs that may protect against diseased phenotypes and deleterious mutations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Contrasting effects of Western vs. Mediterranean diets on monocyte inflammatory gene expression and social behavior in a primate model</a></h4>

              
                Dietary changes associated with industrialization substantially increase the prevalence of chronic diseases, such as obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, major contributors to the public health burden. The high prevalence of these chronic diseases is often attributed to an 'evolutionary mismatch' between human physiology and modern nutritional environments. Western diets enriched with foods that were scarce throughout human evolutionary history (e.g., simple sugars and saturated fats) promote inflammation and disease relative to diets more akin to ancestral human hunter-gatherer diets, such as a Mediterranean diet. Peripheral blood monocytes, precursors to macrophages and important mediators of innate immunity and inflammation, are sensitive to the environment and may represent a critical intermediate in the pathway linking diet to disease. We evaluated the effects of 15 months of whole diet manipulations mimicking human Western or Mediterranean diet patterns on monocyte polarization using a well-established model of human health, the cynomolgus macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>). Monocyte transcriptional profiles differed markedly between the two diets, with 40% of transcripts showing differential expression (FDR &lt; 0.05). Monocytes from Western diet consumers were polarized toward a more proinflammatory phenotype. Compared to the Mediterranean diet, the Western diet shifted the co-expression of 445 gene pairs, including small RNAs and transcription factors associated with metabolism and adiposity in humans, and dramatically altered behavior. For example, Western-fed individuals were more anxious and less socially integrated compared to the Mediterranean-fed subjects. These behavioral changes were also associated with some of the effects of diet on gene expression, suggesting an interaction between diet, central nervous system activity, and monocyte gene expression. The results of this study provide new insights into evolutionary mismatch at the molecular level and uncover new pathways through which Western diets alter monocyte polarization toward a proinflammatory phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An oscillating computational model can track pseudo-rhythmic speech by using linguistic predictions</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal oscillations putatively track speech in order to optimize sensory processing. However, it is unclear how isochronous brain oscillations can track pseudo-rhythmic speech input. Here we propose that oscillations can track pseudo-rhythmic speech when considering that speech time is dependent on content-based predictions flowing from internal language models. We show that temporal dynamics of speech are dependent on the predictability of words in a sentence. A computational model including oscillations, feedback, and inhibition is able to track pseudo-rhythmic speech input. As the model processes, it generates temporal phase codes, which are a candidate mechanism for carrying information forward in time. The model is optimally sensitive to the natural temporal speech dynamics and can explain empirical data on temporal speech illusions. Our results suggest that speech tracking does not have to rely only on the acoustics but could also exploit ongoing interactions between oscillations and constraints flowing from internal language models.

                Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires potent and low-cost therapeutics. We identified a series of single-domain antibodies (i.e., nanobody), <i>Nanosota-1</i>, from a camelid nanobody phage display library. Structural data showed that <i>Nanosota-1</i> bound to the oft-hidden receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking viral receptor ACE2. The lead drug candidate possessing an Fc tag (<i>Nanosota-1C-Fc</i>) bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD ~3000 times more tightly than ACE2 did and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus ~160 times more efficiently than ACE2 did. Administered at a single dose, <i>Nanosota-1C-Fc</i> demonstrated preventive and therapeutic efficacy against live SARS-CoV-2 infection in both hamster and mouse models. Unlike conventional antibodies, <i>Nanosota-1C-Fc</i> was produced at high yields in bacteria and had exceptional thermostability. Pharmacokinetic analysis of <i>Nanosota-1C-F</i>c documented an excellent <i>in vivo</i> stability and a high tissue bioavailability. As effective and inexpensive drug candidates, <i>Nanosota-1</i> may contribute to the battle against COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of splicing factor SRSF1 is required for development and cilia function</a></h4>

              
                Shuttling RNA-binding proteins coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic steps of gene expression. The SR family proteins regulate RNA splicing in the nucleus and a subset of them, including SRSF1, shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm affecting post-splicing processes. However, the physiological significance of this remains unclear. Here, we used genome editing to knock-in a nuclear retention signal (NRS) in <i>Srsf1 </i>to create a mouse model harboring an SRSF1 protein that is retained exclusively in the nucleus. <i>Srsf1<sup>NRS/NRS </sup></i>mutants displayed small body size, hydrocephalus and immotile sperm, all traits associated with ciliary defects. We observed reduced translation of a subset of mRNAs and decreased abundance of proteins involved in multiciliogenesis, with disruption of ciliary ultrastructure and motility in cells and tissues derived from this mouse model. These results demonstrate that SRSF1 shuttling is used to reprogram gene expression networks in the context of high cellular demands, as observed here, during motile ciliogenesis.

                    implications for evolutionary trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Copy number variation (CNV) through gene or chromosome amplification provides a route for rapid phenotypic variation and supports long-term evolution of gene functions. Although the evolutionary importance of CNV is known, little is understood about how genetic background influences CNV tolerance. Here, we measured fitness costs of over 4,000 over-expressed genes in 15 <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strains representing different lineages, to explore natural variation in tolerating gene overexpression (OE). Strain-specific effects dominated the fitness costs of gene OE. We report global differences in the consequences of gene OE, independent of the amplified gene, as well as gene-specific effects that were dependent on the genetic background. Natural variation in the response to gene OE could be explained by several models, including strain-specific physiological differences, resource limitations, and regulatory sensitivities. This work provides new insight on how genetic background influences tolerance to gene amplification and the evolutionary trajectories accessible to different backgrounds.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Uniparental nuclear inheritance following bisexual mating in fungi</a></h4>

              
                Some remarkable animal species require an opposite-sex partner for their sexual development but discard the partner’s genome before gamete formation, generating hemi-clonal progeny in a process called hybridogenesis. Here, we discovered a similar phenomenon, termed pseudosexual reproduction, in a basidiomycete human fungal pathogen, <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, where exclusive uniparental inheritance of nuclear genetic material was observed during bisexual reproduction. Analysis of strains expressing fluorescent reporter proteins revealed instances where only one of the parental nuclei was present in the terminal sporulating basidium. Whole-genome sequencing revealed the nuclear genome of the progeny was identical with one or the other parental genome. Pseudosexual reproduction was also detected in natural isolate crosses where it resulted in mainly <i>MAT</i>a progeny, a bias observed in <i>Cryptococcus</i> ecological distribution as well. The mitochondria in these progeny were inherited from the <i>MAT</i>&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; parent, resulting in nuclear-mitochondrial genome exchange. The meiotic recombinase Dmc1 was found to be critical for pseudosexual reproduction. These findings reveal a novel, and potentially ecologically significant, mode of eukaryotic microbial reproduction that shares features with hybridogenesis in animals.

Even so, interpretation of this data requires considerable knowledge about the nature of the representation and often depends on manual operations. Decoding provides a means to infer the information content of such recordings but typically requires highly processed data and prior knowledge of the encoding scheme. Here, we developed a deep-learning framework able to decode sensory and behavioral variables directly from wide-band neural data. The network requires little user input and generalizes across stimuli, behaviors, brain regions, and recording techniques. Once trained, it can be analyzed to determine elements of the neural code that are informative about a given variable. We validated this approach using electrophysiological and calcium-imaging data from rodent auditory cortex and hippocampus as well as human electrocorticography (ECoG) data. We show successful decoding of finger movement, auditory stimuli, and spatial behaviors – including a novel representation of head direction - from raw neural activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Postnatal SETD1B is essential for learning and the regulation of neuronal plasticity genes</a></h4>

              
                Histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) is mediated by six different lysine methyltransferases. Amongst these enzymes SET domain containing 1b (SETD1B) has been linked to syndromic intellectual disability but its role in the postnatal brain has not been studied yet. Here we employ mice that lack Setd1b from excitatory neurons of the postnatal forebrain and combine neuron-specific ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approaches to elucidate its role in neuronal gene expression. We observe that SETD1B controls the expression of genes with a broad H3K4me3 peak at their promoters that represent neuronal enriched genes linked to learning and memory function. Comparative analysis to corresponding data from conditional Kmt2a and Kmt2b knockout mice suggests that this function is specific to SETD1B. Moreover, postnatal loss of Setd1b leads to severe learning impairment, suggesting that SETD1B-mediated regulation of H3K4me levels in postnatal neurons is critical for cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gene regulatory networks controlling temporal patterning, neurogenesis and cell fate specification in the mammalian retina.</a></h4>

              
                Gene regulatory networks (GRNs), consisting of transcription factors and their target cis-regulatory sequences, control neurogenesis and cell fate specification in the developing central nervous system, but their organization is poorly characterized. In this study, we performed integrated scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analysis from both mouse and human retina to profile dynamic changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and transcription factor footprinting during retinal neurogenesis. We identified multiple interconnected, evolutionarily-conserved GRNs consisting of cell type-specific transcription factors that both activate expression of genes within their own network and often inhibit expression of genes in other networks. These GRNs control state transitions within primary retinal progenitors that underlie temporal patterning, regulate the transition from primary to neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type. We confirmed the prediction of this analysis that the NFI transcription factors Nfia, Nfib, and Nfix selectively activate expression of genes that promote late-stage temporal identity in primary retinal progenitors. We also used GRNs to identify additional transcription factors that selectively promote (Insm1/2) and inhibit (Tbx3, Tcf7l1/2) rod photoreceptor specification in postnatal retina. This study provides an inventory of cis- and trans-acting factors that control retinal development, identifies transcription factors that control the temporal identity of retinal progenitors and cell fate specification, and will potentially help guide cell-based therapies aimed at replacing retinal neurons lost due to disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Zona Incerta activity dynamics underlying associative fear learning and fear generalization</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that the Zona Incerta (ZI) plays a role in fear learning and recall. However, there is a clear gap in knowledge as to whether the ZI can encode fear evoking threats and cues that predict them. Here, we subject mice to a classical fear conditioning paradigm while recording the in-vivo calcium dynamics of ZI neurons. We observed that ZI neurons can encode not only a fear evoking stimulus, but can also learn to encode predictive cues, associate them with the unconditioned fear evoking stimulus, and discriminate them from neutral non-predictive cues. While the ZI across all mice learned to become mainly excited by fear predictive cues, only mice that did not generalize fear became largely inhibited by non-predictive cues and better discriminated the two. Together, we provide extensive evidence that the ZI differentially encode fear predictive and non-predictive cues in a generalization dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ageing-associated myelin dysfunction drives amyloid deposition in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, shows a strict age-dependency, but why ageing constitutes the main risk factor for this disease is still poorly understood. Brain ageing affects oligodendrocytes and the structural integrity of myelin sheaths, the latter associated with secondary neuroinflammation. Since oligodendrocytes support axonal and neuronal health, we hypothesised that ageing-associated loss of myelin integrity could be an upstream risk factor for neuronal amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition, the primary neuropathological hallmark of AD. Here, we show that in AD mouse models different genetically induced defects of myelin integrity or demyelinating injuries are indeed potent drivers of amyloid deposition in vivo, quantified by whole brain light sheet microscopy. Conversely, the lack of myelin in the forebrain provides protection against plaque deposition. Mechanistically, we find that myelin dysfunction causes the accumulation of the A{beta} producing machinery within axonal swellings and increases cortical amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage. Surprisingly, AD mice with dysfunctional myelin lack plaque-corralling microglia but show a disease-associated microglia (DAM)-like signature as revealed by bulk and single cell transcriptomics. These activated microglia, however, are primarily engaged with myelin, preventing the protective reactions of microglia to A{beta} plaques. Our data suggest a working model, in which age-dependent structural defects of myelin promote plaque formation, directly and indirectly, and are thus an upstream AD risk factor. Improving oligodendrocyte health and myelin integrity could be a promising target to delay AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disparate energy consumption despite similar network activity</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits can produce similar activity patterns from vastly different combinations of channel and synaptic conductances. These conductances are tuned for specific activity patterns but might also reflect additional constraints, such as metabolic cost or robustness to perturbations. How do such constraints influence the range of permissible conductances? Here, we investigate how metabolic cost affects the parameters of neural circuits with similar activity in a model of the pyloric network of the crab Cancer borealis. We use a novel machine learning method to identify a range of network models that can generate activity patterns matching experimental data. We find that neural circuits can consume largely different amounts of energy despite similar circuit activity. We then study how circuit parameters get constrained by minimizing energy consumption and identify circuit parameters that might be subject to metabolic tuning. Finally, we investigate the interaction between metabolic cost and temperature robustness. We show that metabolic cost can vary across temperatures, but that robustness to temperature changes does not necessarily incur an increased metabolic cost. Our analyses show that, despite metabolic efficiency and temperature robustness constraining circuit parameters, neural systems can generate functional, efficient, and robust network activity with widely disparate sets of conductances.

                The value we place on our time impacts what we decide to do with it. Value it too little, and we obsess over all details. Value it too much, and we rush carelessly to move on. How to strike this often context-specific balance is a challenging decision-making problem. Average-reward, putatively encoded by tonic dopamine, serves in existing reinforcement learning theory as the stationary opportunity cost of time. However, environmental context and the cost of deliberation therein often varies in time and is hard to infer and predict. Here, we define a non-stationary opportunity cost of deliberation arising from performance variation on multiple timescales. Estimated from reward history, this cost readily adapts to reward-relevant changes in context and suggests a generalization of average-reward reinforcement learning (AR-RL) to account for non-stationary contextual factors. We use this deliberation cost in a simple decision-making heuristic called Performance-Gated Deliberation, which approximates AR-RL and is consistent with empirical results in both cognitive and systems decision-making neuroscience. We propose that deliberation cost is implemented directly as urgency, a previously characterized neural signal effectively controlling the speed of the decision-making process. We use behaviour and neural recordings from non-human primates in a non-stationary random walk prediction task to support our results. We make readily testable predictions for both neural activity and behaviour and discuss how this proposal can facilitate future work in cognitive and systems neuroscience of reward-driven behaviour.

                Challenges in clinical data sharing and the need to protect data privacy have led to the development and popularization of methods that do not require directly transferring patient data. In neuroimaging, integration of data across multiple institutions also introduces unwanted biases driven by scanner differences. These scanner effects have been shown by several research groups to severely affect downstream analyses. To facilitate the need of removing scanner effects in a distributed data setting, we introduce distributed ComBat, an adaptation of a popular harmonization method for multivariate data that borrows information across features. We present our fast and simple distributed algorithm and show that it yields equivalent results using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Our method enables harmonization while ensuring maximal privacy protection, thus facilitating a broad range of downstream analyses in functional and structural imaging studies.

                Humans adapt their learning strategies to changing environments by estimating the volatility of the reinforcement conditions. Here, we examine how volatility affects learning and the underlying functional brain organizations using a probabilistic reward reversal learning task. We found that the order of conditions was critically important; participants adjusted learning rate going from volatile to stable, but not from stable to volatile, environments. Subjective volatility of the environment was encoded in the striatal reward system and its dynamic connections with the prefrontal control system. Flexibility, which captures the dynamic changes of network modularity in the brain, was higher in the environmental transition from volatile to stable than from stable to volatile. These findings suggest that behavioral adaptations and dynamic brain organizations in transitions between stable and volatile environments are asymmetric, providing critical insights into the way that people learn under uncertainty.

                Treatments for amblyopia focus on vision therapy and patching of one eye. Predicting the success of these methods remains difficult, however. Recent research has used binocular rivalry to monitor visual cortical plasticity during occlusion therapy, leading to a successful prediction of the recovery rate of the amblyopic eye. The underlying mechanisms and their relation to neural homeostatic plasticity are not known. Here we propose a spiking neural network to explain the effect of shortterm monocular deprivation on binocular rivalry. The model reproduces perceptual switches as observed experimentally. When one eye is occluded, inhibitory plasticity changes the balance between the eyes and leads to longer dominance periods for the eye that has been deprived. The model suggests that homeostatic inhibitory plasticity is a critical component of the observed effects and might play an important role in the recovery from amblyopia.

                Intelligence describes the general cognitive ability level of a person. It is one of the most fundamental concepts in psychological science and is crucial for effective adaption of behavior to varying environmental demands. Changing external task demands have been shown to induce reconfiguration of functional brain networks. However, whether neural reconfiguration between different tasks is associated with intelligence has not yet been investigated. We used fMRI data from 812 subjects to show that higher scores of general intelligence are related to less brain network reconfiguration between resting state and seven different tasks as well as to network reconfiguration between tasks. This association holds for all functional brain networks except the motor system, and replicates in two independent samples (N = 138, N = 184). Our findings suggest that the intrinsic network architecture of individuals with higher general intelligence scores is closer to the network architecture as required by various cognitive demands. Multi-task brain network reconfiguration may, therefore, reflect the neural equivalent of the behavioral positive manifold, i.e., the essence of the concept of general intelligence. Finally, our results support neural efficiency theories of cognitive ability and reveal insights into human intelligence as an emergent property from a distributed multi-task brain network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Claudin-5 binder enhances focused ultrasound-mediated opening in an in vitro blood-brain barrier model</a></h4>

              
                Rationale: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) while functioning as a gatekeeper of the brain, impedes cerebral drug delivery. An emerging technology to overcome this limitation is focused ultrasound (FUS). When FUS interacts with intravenously injected microbubbles (FUS+MB), the BBB opens, transiently allowing the access of therapeutic agents into the brain. However, the ultrasound parameters need to be tightly tuned: when the acoustic pressure is too low there is no opening, and when it is too high, bleeds can occur. We therefore asked whether BBB permeability can be increased by combining FUS+MB with a second modality such that in a clinical setting lower acoustic pressures could be potentially used. Methods: Given that FUS achieves BBB opening by the disruption of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as claudin-5 of brain endothelial cells, we generated a stable MDCK II cell line (eGFP-hCldn5-MDCK II) that expresses fluorescently tagged human claudin-5. Two claudin-5 binders, mC5C2 (a peptide) and cCPEm (a truncated form of an enterotoxin), that have been reported previously to weaken the barrier, were synthesized and assessed for their abilities to enhance the permeability of cellular monolayers. We then performed a comparative analysis of single and combination treatments. Results: We successfully generated a novel cell line that formed functional monolayers as validated by an increased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) reading and a low (< 0.2%) permeability to sodium fluorescein (376 Da). We found that the binders exerted a time- and concentration-dependent effect on BBB opening when incubated over an extended period, whereas FUS+MB caused a rapid barrier opening followed by recovery after 12 hours within the tested pressure range. Importantly, preincubation with cCPEm prior to FUS+MB treatment resulted in greater barrier opening compared to either FUS+MB or cCPEm alone as measured by reduced TEER values and an increased permeability to fluorescently labelled 40 kDa dextran (FD40). Conclusion: The data suggest that pre-incubation with clinically suitable binders to TJ proteins may be a general strategy to facilitate safer and more effective ultrasound-mediated BBB opening in cellular and animal systems and potentially also for the treatment of human diseases of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the discovery of ADRAM, an experience-dependent long noncoding RNA that drives fear extinction through a direct interaction with the chaperone protein 14-3-3</a></h4>

              
                Long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) comprise a new class of genes that have been assigned key roles in development and disease. Many lncRNAs are specifically transcribed in the brain where they regulate the expression of protein-coding genes that underpin neuronal function; however, their role in learning and memory remains largely unexplored. We used RNA Capture-Seq to identify a large population of lncRNAs that are expressed in the infralimbic cortex of adult male mice in response to fear-related learning, with 14.5% of these annotated in the GENCODE database as lncRNAs with no known function. We combined these data with cell-type-specific ATAC-seq on neurons that had been selectively activated by fear-extinction learning, and revealed 434 lncRNAs derived from enhancer regions in the vicinity of protein-coding genes. In particular, we discovered an experience-induced lncRNA called ADRAM that acts as both a scaffold and a combinatorial guide to recruit the brain-enriched chaperone protein 14-3-3 to the promoter of the memory-associated immediate early gene Nr4a2. This leads to the expulsion of histone deactylases 3 and 4, and the recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase creb binding protein, which drives learning-induced Nr4a2 expression. Knockdown of ADRAM disrupts this interaction, blocks the expression of Nr4a2, and ultimately impairs the formation of fear-extinction memory. This study expands the lexicon of experience-dependent lncRNA activity in the brain, highlights enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) as key players in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression associated with fear extinction, and suggests eRNAs, such as ADRAM, may constitute viable targets in developing novel treatments for fear-related anxiety disorders.

                Breathing depends on interneurons in the preBotzinger complex (preBotC) derived from Dbx1-expressing precursors. Here we investigate whether rhythm- and pattern-generating functions reside in discrete classes of Dbx1 preBotC neurons. In a slice model of breathing with ~5 s cycle period, putatively rhythmogenic Type-1 Dbx1 preBotC neurons activate 100-300 ms prior to Type-2 neurons, putatively specialized for output pattern, and 300-500 ms prior to the inspiratory motor output. We sequenced Type-1 and Type-2 transcriptomes and identified differential expression of 123 genes including ionotropic receptors (Gria3 and Gabra1) that may explain their preinspiratory activation profiles and Ca2+ signaling (Cracr2a, Sgk1) involved in inspiratory and sigh bursts. Surprisingly, neuropeptide receptors that influence breathing (e.g., -opioid and bombesin-like peptide receptors) were only sparsely expressed, which suggests that cognate peptides and opioid drugs exert their profound effects on a small fraction of the preBotC core. These data in the public domain help explain the neural origins of breathing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adult neuromarkers of sustained attention and working memory predict inter- and intra-individual differences in these processes in youth</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention and working memory are central cognitive processes that vary between individuals, fluctuate over time, and have consequences for life and health outcomes. Here we characterize the functional brain architecture of these abilities in 9-11-year-old children using models based on functional magnetic resonance imaging functional connectivity. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we asked whether connectome-based models built to predict sustained attention and working memory in adults generalize to capture inter- and intra-individual differences in sustained attention and working memory performance in youth. Results revealed that a predefined connectome-based model of sustained attention predicted children's performance on the 0-back task, an attentionally taxing low-working-memory-load task. A predefined connectome-based model of working memory, on the other hand, also predicted performance on the 2-back task, an attentionally taxing high-working-memory-load task. The sustained attention model's predictive power was comparable to that achieved when predicting adults' 0-back performance and by a connectome-based model of cognition defined in the ABCD sample itself. Finally, the working memory model predicted children's recognition memory for n-back task stimuli. Together these results demonstrate that connectome-based models of sustained attention and working memory generalize to youth, reflecting the functional architecture of these processes in the developing brain.

                The highly complex central nervous systems of mammals are often studied using three-dimensional (3D) in vitro primary neuronal cultures. A coupled confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence labeling are widely utilized for visualizing the 3D structures of neurons. However, this requires fixation of the neurons and is not suitable for monitoring an identical sample at multiple time points. Thus, we propose a label-free monitoring method for 3D neuronal growth based on refractive index tomograms obtained by optical diffraction tomography. The 3D morphology of the neurons was clearly visualized, and the developmental processes of neurite outgrowth in 3D spaces were analyzed for individual neurons.

                The basal ganglia (BG) play a critical role in a variety of functions that are essential for animal survival. Information from different cortical areas propagates through the BG in anatomically segregated circuits along the parallel direct and indirect pathways. We examined how the globus pallidus (GP), a central nucleus within the indirect pathway, encodes input from the motor and cognitive domains. We chronically recorded and analyzed neuronal activity in the GP of rats engaged in a novel environment exposure task. GP neurons displayed multidimensional responses to movement and contextual information. A model predicting single unit activity required many task-related variables, thus confirming the multidimensionality of GP neurons. In addition, populations of GP neurons, but not single units, reliably encoded the animals' locomotion speed and the environmental novelty. We posit that the GP independently processes information from different domains, effectively compresses it and collectively conveys it to successive nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Environmental enrichment mitigatesthe long-lasting sequelae of perinatal fentanyl exposure</a></h4>

              
                The opioid epidemic is a rapidly evolving societal issue that stems from the abuse of prescription and illicit opioids, including increasing use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Fentanyl use among women has increased substantially in the last decade, leading to a 40-fold increase in the number of perinatally-exposed infants. This exposure can result in neuropsychiatric abnormalities that persist into adolescence and, in some cases, adulthood. We previously developed a preclinical model to establish the consequences of perinatal fentanyl exposure and identified a pattern of synaptic pathophysiology that involves lasting impairments in primary somatosensory (S1) circuit function and behavior. Here, we ask if these long-lasting effects can be restored by a non-invasive intervention. We demonstrate that developmental exposure to environmental enrichment ameliorates many of fentanyl's deleterious behavioral effects, including hyperactivity, enhanced sensitivity to anxiogenic environments, and sensory maladaptation. As an extension of our past work, we found that perinatal fentanyl alters the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and impairs long-term potentiation in S1 layer 2/3 neurons. These deficits in synaptic function were restored by environmental enrichment. Environmental enrichment also affected neurons in control mice, reducing long-term potentiation and depression, and increasing frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results demonstrate that the lasting somatosensory-related effects of fentanyl can be ameliorated with a non-invasive intervention introduced during early development. These findings can inform ongoing efforts to develop actionable steps toward mitigating the consequences of opioid abuse among pregnant women.

                Diffusion MRI (dMRI) of whole, intact, fixed postmortem human brain at high spatial resolution serves as key bridging technology for 3D mapping of structural connectivity and tissue microstructure at the mesoscopic scale. Ex vivo dMRI offers superior spatial resolution compared to in vivo dMRI but comes with its own technical challenges due to the significantly reduced T2 relaxation times and decreased diffusivity incurred by tissue fixation. The altered physical properties of fixed tissue necessitate the use of alternative acquisition strategies to preserve SNR and achieve sufficient diffusion weighting. Multi-shotor segmented 3D echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences have been used to shorten echo times (TEs) with reduced distortions from field inhomogeneity and eddy currents on small-bore MR scanners and have been adopted for high b-value dMRI of ex vivo whole human brain specimens. The advent of stronger gradients on human MRI scanners has led to improved image quality and a wider range of diffusion-encoding parameters for dMRI but at the cost of more severe eddy currents that result in spatial and temporal variations in the background magnetic field, which cannot be corrected for using standard vendor-provided ghost correction solutions. In this work, we show that conventional ghost correction techniques based on navigators and linear phase correction may be insufficient for EPI sequences using strong diffusion-sensitizing gradients in ex vivo dMRI experiments, resulting in orientationally biased dMRI estimates. This previously unreported problem is a critical roadblock in any effort to leverage scanners with ultra-high gradients for high-precision mapping of human neuroanatomy at the mesoscopic scale. We propose an advanced reconstruction method based on structured low-rank matrix modeling that reduces the ghosting substantially. We show that this method leads to more accurate and reliable dMRI metrics, as exemplified by diffusion tensor imaging and high angular diffusion imaging analyses in distributed neuroanatomical areas of fixed whole human brain specimens. Our findings advocate for the use of advanced reconstruction techniques for recovering unbiased metrics from ex vivo dMRI acquisitions and represent a crucial step toward making full use of strong diffusion-encoding gradients for neuroscientific studies seeking to study brain structure at multiple spatial scales.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">When learning a movement based on binary success information, one is more variable following failure than following success. Theoretically, the additional variability post-failure might reflect exploration of possibilities to obtain success. When average behavior is changing (as in learning), variability can be estimated from differences between subsequent movements. Can one estimate exploration reliably from such trial-to-trial changes when studying reward-based motor learning? To answer this question, we tried to reconstruct the exploration underlying learning as described by four existing reward-based motor learning models. We simulated learning for various learner and task characteristics. If we simply determined the additional change post-failure, estimates of exploration were sensitive to learner and task characteristics. We identified two pitfalls in quantifying exploration based on trial-to-trial changes. Firstly, performance-dependent feedback can cause correlated samples of motor noise and exploration on successful trials, which biases exploration estimates. Secondly, the trial relative to which trial-to-trial change is calculated may also contain exploration, which causes underestimation. As a solution, we developed the additional trial-to-trial change (ATTC) method. By moving the reference trial one trial back and subtracting trial-to-trial changes following specific sequences of trial outcomes, exploration can be estimated reliably for the three models that explore based on the outcome of only the previous trial. Since ATTC estimates are based on a selection of trial sequences, this method requires many trials. In conclusion, if exploration is a binary function of previous trial outcome, the ATTC method allows for a model-free quantification of exploration.</p>

	<p>Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor in all living organisms. It is involved in a large number of biochemical processes functioning either as an activator of molecules with carbonyl groups or as a carrier of acyl moieties. Together with its thioester derivatives, it plays a central role in cell metabolism, post-translational modification, and gene expression. Furthermore, recent studies revealed a role for CoA in the redox regulation by the S-thiolation of cysteine residues in cellular proteins. The intracellular concentration and distribution in different cellular compartments of CoA and its derivatives are controlled by several extracellular stimuli such as nutrients, hormones, metabolites, and cellular stresses. Perturbations of the biosynthesis and homeostasis of CoA and/or acyl-CoA are connected with several pathological conditions, including cancer, myopathies, and cardiomyopathies. In the most recent years, defects in genes involved in CoA production and distribution have been found in patients affected by rare forms of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review, we will summarize the most relevant aspects of CoA cellular metabolism, their role in the pathogenesis of selected neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and recent advancements in the search for therapeutic approaches for such diseases.</p>

	<p>Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES) is a catastrophic, extremely rare epileptic encephalopathy. It strikes previously healthy school-aged children and is usually cryptogenic. Its dramatic onset with refractory status epilepticus is always preceded by a nonspecific febrile illness. The seizure activity in FIRES may last for several weeks with little to no response to antiepileptic treatment, usually resulting in the usage of anaesthetics. This acute phase is followed by a chronic, refractory epilepsy and cognitive deficit, that persist for the rest of the patient’s life. Still to this day no definite cause has been described. In this study we review the current finding in FIRES and describe a case of a 4-year-old patient with a dramatic course of the acute phase in FIRES and unusual presentation of the chronic phase, which is dominated by extrapyramidal symptoms such as dystonia. This case highlights that the clinical presentation of FIRES may differ from those frequently described in literature.</p>

<p>The authors reconstructed 26 single lumbar spinocerebellar axons in mice and mapped axon terminals with zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex. The lumbar spinocerebellar axons showed high variations the pathway patterns (contralateral vs. ipsilateral, dorsal vs. ventral in the spinal cord, medullary vs. pontine in the cerebellar entry), branching, and termination (mainly in cerebellar lobules II, III-V, VIII-IXa-b, cerebellar nuclei, CN, nucleus X, NX, lateral reticular nucleus, LRN). The axons were classified into three major groups (magenta, orange, green), confirming the conventional main types of the lumbar spinocerebellar projections to an extent. However, the results also indicated highly heterogeneous axonal populations beyond these groups.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Among the spinocerebellar projections vital for sensorimotor coordination of limbs and the trunk, the morphology of spinocerebellar axons originating from the lumbar cord has not been well characterized compared to those from thoracic and sacral cords. We reconstructed 26 single spinocerebellar axons labeled by biotinylated dextran injections into the gray matter of the lumbar spinal cord in mice. Axon terminals were mapped in relation to the zebrin pattern of the cerebellar cortex.</p>
<p>Reconstructed axons were primarily classified into ipsilaterally and contralaterally ascending axons, arising mainly from the dorsal and ventral horns, respectively. The majority of ipsilateral and contralateral axons took the dorsal-medullary and ventral-pontine pathways, respectively. The axons of both groups terminated mainly in the vermal and medial paravermal areas of lobules II-V and VIII-IXa, often bilaterally but predominantly ipsilateral to the axonal origin, with a weak preference to particular portions of zebrin stripes. The ipsilateral axons originating from the medial dorsal horn in the upper lumbar cord (n = 3) had abundant (43–147) mossy fiber terminals and no medullary collaterals. The ipsilateral axons originating from the lateral dorsal horn in the lower lumbar cord (n = 9) and the contralateral axons (n = 14) showed remarkable morphology variations. The number of their mossy fiber terminals varied from 2 to 172. Their collaterals, observed in 17 axons out of 23, terminated mainly in the medial cerebellar nucleus, nucleus X, and lateral reticular nucleus in various degrees. The results indicated that the lumbar spinocerebellar projection contains highly heterogeneous axonal populations regarding their pathway, branching, and termination patterns.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> is a relatively large-headed and stocky iguanodontian dinosaur from the latest Early Cretaceous of Spain. Its braincase is known from three specimens. Similar to that of other dinosaurs, it shows a mosaic ossification pattern in which most of the bones seem to have fused together indistinguishably while a few (frontoparietal, basioccipital) might have remained loosely attached. The endocasts of the three specimens are described based on CT data and digital reconstructions. They show unmistakable morphological similarities with the endocast of closely related taxa, such as <i>Sirindhorna khoratensis</i> (which is close in age but from Thailand). This supports a high conservatism of the endocranial cavity. The issue of volumetric correspondence between endocranial cavity and brain in dinosaurs is analysed. Although a brain-to-endocranial cavity (BEC) index of 0.50 has been traditionally used, we employ instead 0.73. This is indeed the mid-value between the situation in adults of <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i> and <i>Gallus gallus</i>, which are members of the extant bracketing taxa of dinosaurs (Crocodilia and Aves). We thence gauge the level of encephalisation of <i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> through the calculation of the Encephalisation Quotient (EQ), which remains valuable as a metric for assessing the degree of cognitive function in extinct taxa, especially those with fully ossified braincases like dinosaurs and other archosaurs. The EQ obtained for <i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> (3.611) suggests that this species was significantly more encephalised than most if not all extant non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes. Our work adds to the growing body of data concerning theoretical cognitive capabilities in dinosaurs and supports the idea that an increasing encephalisation was fostered not only once in theropods but also in parallel in the shorter-lived lineage of ornithopods. <i>Proa valdearinnoensis</i> was ill-equipped to respond to theropod dinosaurs and possibly lived in groups as a strategy to mitigate the risk of being predated upon. We hypothesize that group-living and protracted caring of juveniles in this and possibly many other iguanodontian ornithopods favoured a degree of encephalisation that was outstanding by reptile standards.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Subcellular and regional localization of mRNA translation in midbrain dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Local translation within excitatory and inhibitory neurons is involved in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Despite the extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations of central monoaminergic neurons, the subcellular localization of protein synthesis is not well-characterized in these populations. Here, we investigated mRNA localization and translation in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, cells with enormous axonal and dendritic projections, both of which exhibit stimulation-evoked dopamine (DA) release. Using highly-sensitive ribosome-bound RNA-sequencing and imaging approaches in mDA axons, we found no evidence for axonal mRNA localization or translation. In contrast, mDA neuronal dendritic projections into the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the major components of DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we also observed dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicle-related proteins, including those involved in vesicular exocytic fusion. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA release from dendrites, but not from axons. Our translatome data further defined a molecular signature of the sparse mDA neurons resident in the SNr, including enrichment of Atp2a3/SERCA3, an ER calcium pump previously undescribed in mDA neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Selective ablation of adult GFAP-expressing tanycytes leads to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males</a></h4>

              
                In adult mammals, neural stem cells emerge in three neurogenic regions, the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle (SVZ), the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (SGZ) and the hypothalamus. In the SVZ and the SGZ, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) express the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and selective ablation of these NSPCs drastically decreases cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In the hypothalamus, GFAP is expressed by -tanycytes, which are specialized radial glia-like cells in the wall of the third ventricle. To explore the role of these hypothalamic GFAP-positive tanycytes, we used transgenic mice expressing herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-Tk) under the control of the mouse Gfap promoter and 4-week intracerebroventricular infusion of the antiviral agent ganciclovir (GCV) that kills dividing cells expressing Tk. While GCV drastically reduced the number and growth of hypothalamus-derived neurospheres from adult transgenic mice in vitro, it caused hypogonadism in vivo. The selective death of dividing tanycytes expressing GFAP indeed caused a marked decrease in testosterone levels and testicular weight, as well as vacuolization of the seminiferous tubules and loss of spermatogenesis. In addition, GCV-treated GFAP-Tk mice showed impaired sexual behavior, but no alteration in food intake or body weight. Our results also show that the selective ablation of GFAP-expressing tanycytes leads to a sharp decrease in the number of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-immunoreactive neurons and blunted LH secretion. Altogether, our data show that GFAP-expressing tanycytes play a central role in the regulation of male reproductive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural temporal context reinstatement of event structure during memory recall</a></h4>

              
                Although life unfolds continuously, experiences are generally perceived and remembered as discrete events. Accumulating evidence suggests that event boundaries disrupt temporal representations and weaken memory associations. However, less is known about the consequences of event boundaries on temporal representations during retrieval, especially when temporal information is not tested explicitly. Using a neural measure of temporal context extracted from scalp electroencephalography, we found reduced temporal context similarity between studied items separated by an event boundary when compared to items from the same event. Further, while participants free recalled list items, neural activity reflected reinstatement of temporal context representations from study, including temporal disruption. A computational model of episodic memory, the Context Maintenance and Retrieval model (CMR; Polyn, Norman & Kahana, 2009), predicted these results, and made novel predictions regarding the influence of temporal disruption on recall order. These findings implicate the impact of event structure on memory organization via temporal representations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal correlates of attentional selectivity and intensity in visual area V4 are invariant of motivational context</a></h4>

              
                Flexibly switching attentional strategies is crucial for adaptive behavior in changing environments. Depending on the context, task demand employs different degrees of the two fundamental components of attention- attentional selectivity (preferentially attending to one location in visual space) and effort (the total non-selective intensity of attention). Neuronal responses in the visual cortex that show modulation with changes in either selective attention or effort are reported to partially represent motivational aspect of the task context. The relative contributions and interactions of these two components of attention to modulate neuronal signals and their sensitivity to distinct motivational drives are poorly understood. To address this question, we independently controlled monkeys' spatially selective attention and non-selective attentional intensity in the same experimental session during a novel visual orientation change detection task. Attention was controlled either by adjusting the relative difficulty of the orientation changes at the two locations or by the reward associated with stimuli at two locations while simultaneously recording spikes from populations of neurons in area V4. We found that V4 neurons are robustly modulated by either selective attention or attentional intensity. Notably, as attentional selectivity for a neuron's receptive field location decreased, its responses became weaker, despite an increase in the animal's overall attentional intensity. This strong interaction between attentional selectivity and intensity could be identified in single trial spike trains. A simple divisive normalization of spatially distributed attention performances can explain the interaction between attention components well at the single neuron level. The effects of attentional selectivity and attentional intensity on neuronal responses were the same regardless of whether the changes were motivated by reward or task difficulty. These results provide a detailed cellular-level mechanism of how fundamental components of attention integrate and affect sensory processing in varying motivational and stimulus contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A phenomenological model of neuroimmune interactions in epileptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy can have many different causes and its development (epileptogenesis) involves a bewildering complexity of interacting processes. Here, we present a first-of-its-kind computational model to better understand the role of neuroimmune interactions in the development of acquired epilepsy. Our model describes the interactions between neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neuronal loss, circuit remodeling, and seizures. Formulated as a system of nonlinear differential equations, the model is validated using data from animal models that mimic human epileptogenesis caused by infection, status epilepticus, and blood-brain barrier disruption. The mathematical model successfully explains characteristic features of epileptogenesis such as its paradoxically long timescales (up to decades) despite short and transient injuries, or its dependence on the intensity of an injury. Furthermore, stochasticity in the model captures the variability of epileptogenesis outcomes in individuals exposed to identical injury. Notably, in line with the concept of degeneracy, our simulations reveal multiple routes towards epileptogenesis with neuronal loss as a sufficient but non-necessary component. We show that our framework allows for in silico predictions of therapeutic strategies, providing information on injury-specific therapeutic targets and optimal time windows for intervention.

                Neuroscience techniques, including in vivo recording, have allowed for a great expansion in knowledge; however, this technology may also affect the very phenomena researchers set out to investigate. Including both female and male mice in our associative learning experiments shed light on sex differences on the impact of chronic implantation of tetrodes on learning. While previous research showed intact female mice acquired trace eyeblink conditioning faster than male and ovariectomized females, implantation of chronic microdrive arrays showed sexually dimorphic effects on learning. Microdrive implanted male mice acquired the associative learning paradigm faster than both intact and ovariectomized females. These effects were not due to the weight of the drive alone, as there were no significant sex-differences in learning of animals that received dummy drive implants without tetrodes lowered into the brain. Tandem mass tag mass spectrometry and western blot analysis suggest that significant alterations in the MAPK pathway, acute inflammation, and brain derived neurotrophic factor may underlie these observed sex- and surgery-dependent effects on learning.

                Modelling brain networks with complex configuration and cellular properties requires a set of neuroinformatic tools and an organized staged workflow. We have therefore developed the Brain Scaffold Builder (BSB), a new modeling framework embedding multiple strategies for cell placement and connectivity and a flexible management of cellular and network mechanisms. With BSB, for the first time, the mouse cerebellar cortex was reconstructed and simulated at cellular resolution, using morphologically realistic multi-compartmental single-neuron models. Embedded connection rules allowed BSB to generate the cerebellar connectome, unifying a collection of scattered experimental data into a coherent construct. Naturalistic background and sensory-burst stimulation were used for functional validation against recordings in vivo, monitoring the impact of subcellular mechanisms on signal propagation and spatio-temporal processing and providing a new ground-truth about circuit organization for the prediction of neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain structure and function predict adherence to an exercise intervention in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Individualized and precision medicine approaches to exercise for cognitive and brain health in aging have the potential to improve intervention efficacy. Predicting adherence to an exercise intervention in older adults prior to its commencement will allow for adaptive and optimized approaches that could save time (no need to demonstrate failure before changing course) and money (cost of de-implementing approaches that do not work for certain individuals) which ultimately could improve health outcomes (e.g., preventative medicine approaches prior to the onset of symptoms). Individual differences in brain structure and function in older adults are potential proxies of brain and brain reserve or maintenance and may provide strong predictions of adherence. We hypothesized that brain-based measures would predict adherence to a six-month randomized controlled trial of exercise in older adults, alone and in combination with psychosocial, cognitive and health measures. In 131 older adults (aged 65.79 (4.65) years, 63 percent female) we found, using regularized elastic net regression within a nested cross-validation framework, that brain structure (cortical thickness and cortical surface area) in somatosensory, inferior temporal, and inferior frontal regions and functional connectivity (degree count) in primary information processing (somatosensory, visual), executive control, default, and attentional networks, predicted exercise adherence (R2 = 0.15, p < 0.001). Traditional survey and clinical measures such as gait and walking self-efficacy, biological sex and perceived stress also predicted adherence (R2 = 0.06, p = 0.001) but a combined multimodal model achieved the highest predictive strength (R2 = 0.22, p <0.001). Neuroimaging features alone can predict adherence to a structured group-based exercise intervention in older adults which suggests there is substantial utility of these measures for future research into precision medicine approaches. The best performing model contained multimodal features suggesting that each modality provided independent relevant information in the prediction of exercise adherence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spike protein multiorgan tropism suppressed by antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                While there is clinical evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 multiorgan tropism in severely infected coronavirus 19 patients, it is unclear if there is differential multiorgan biodistribution and organ uptake in healthy young individuals, a group that usually has asymptomatic to moderate coronavirus 19 symptoms. In addition, for antibody therapies and vaccines that target the spike protein, it is unclear if these reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or spike protein multiorgan tropism equally. We used fluorescently labeled spike protein near infrared fluorescence to study viral behavior, using an in vivo dynamic imaging system, in young mice. We found a spike protein body-wide biodistribution followed by a slow regional elimination, except for the liver, which showed an accumulation. Spike protein uptake was highest for the lungs, and this was followed by kidney, heart and liver, but, unlike the choroid plexus, it was not detected in the brain parenchyma or cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the brain vascular barriers were effective in restricting the entry of spike protein into brain parenchyma in young healthy mice. While both anti-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and anti-spike protein antibodies suppressed spike protein biodistribution and organ uptake, anti-spike protein antibody was more effective. By extension, our data support the efficacy of these antibodies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 biodistribution kinetics and multiorgan tropism that could determine coronavirus 19 organ-specific outcomes.

                Gaze stabilization compensates for movements of the head or external environment to minimize image blurring, which is critical for visually-guided behaviors. Multisensory information is used to stabilize the visual scene on the retina via the vestibulo-ocular (VOR) and optokinetic (OKR) reflexes. While the organization of neuronal circuits underlying VOR is well described across vertebrates, less is known about the contribution and evolutionary origin of the OKR circuits. Moreover, the integration of these two sensory modalities is still poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel experimental model, the isolated lamprey eye-brain-labyrinth preparation, to analyze the neuronal pathways underlying visuo-vestibular integration which allowed electrophysiological recordings while applying vestibular stimulation using a moving platform, coordinated with visual stimulation via two screens. We show that lampreys exhibit robust visuo-vestibular integration, with optokinetic information processed in the pretectum and integrated with vestibular inputs at several subcortical levels. The enhanced eye movement response to multimodal stimulation favored the vestibular response at increased velocities. The optokinetic signals can be downregulated from tectum. Additionally, saccades are present in the form of nystagmus. The lamprey represents the oldest living group of vertebrates, thus all basic components of the visuo-vestibular control of gaze were present already at the dawn of vertebrate evolution.

                Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the process associating local cerebral blood flow (CBF) to neuronal activity (NA). Although NVC provides the basis for the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) effect used in functional MRI (fMRI), the relationship between NVC and NA is still unclear. Since recent studies reported cerebellar non-linearities in BOLD signals during motor tasks execution, we investigated the NVC/NA relationship using a range of input frequencies in acute mouse cerebellar slices of vermis and hemisphere. The capillary diameter increased in response to mossy fiber activation in the 6-300Hz range, with a marked inflection around 50Hz (vermis) and 100Hz (hemisphere). The corresponding NA was recorded using high-density multi-electrode arrays and correlated to capillary dynamics through a computational model dissecting the main components of granular layer activity. Here, NVC is known to involve a balance between the NMDAR-NO pathway driving vasodilation and the mGluRs-20HETE pathway driving vasoconstriction. Simulations showed that the NMDAR-mediated component of NA was sufficient to explain the time-course of the capillary dilation but not its non-linear frequency-dependence, suggesting that the mGluRs-20HETE pathway plays a role at intermediate frequencies. These parallel control pathways imply a vasodilation-vasoconstriction competition hypothesis that could adapt local hemodynamics at the microscale bearing implications for fMRI signals interpretation.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">A woman, age 44, with a positive anti-YO paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and normal imaging developed an ocular motor disorder including periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN), gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) and rebound nystagmus (RN). During fixation there was typical PAN but changes in gaze position evoked complex, time-varying oscillations of GEN and RN. To unravel the pathophysiology of this unusual pattern of nystagmus, we developed a mathematical model of normal function of the circuits mediating the vestibular-ocular reflex and gaze-holding including their adaptive mechanisms. Simulations showed that all the findings of our patient could be explained by two, small, isolated changes in cerebellar circuits: reducing the time constant of the gaze-holding integrator, producing GEN and RN, and increasing the gain of the vestibular velocity-storage positive feedback loop, producing PAN. We conclude that the gaze- and time-varying pattern of nystagmus in our patient can be accounted for by superposition of one model that produces typical PAN and another model that produces typical GEN and RN, without requiring a new oscillator in the gaze-holding system or a more complex, nonlinear interaction between the two models. This analysis suggest a strategy for uncovering gaze-evoked and rebound nystagmus in the setting of a time-varying nystagmus such as PAN. Our results are also consistent with current ideas of compartmentalization of cerebellar functions for the control of the vestibular velocity-storage mechanism (nodulus and ventral uvula) and for holding horizontal gaze steady (the flocculus and tonsil).</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Voluntary rapid eye movements (saccades) redirect the fovea toward objects of visual interest. The saccadic system can be considered as a dual-mode system: in one mode the eye is fixating, in the other it is making a saccade. In this review, we consider two examples of dysfunctional saccades, interrupted saccades in late-onset Tay-Sachs disease and gaze-position dependent opsoclonus after concussion, which fail to properly shift between fixation and saccade modes. Insights and benefits gained from bi-directional collaborative exchange between clinical and basic scientists are emphasized. In the case of interrupted saccades, existing mathematical models were sufficiently detailed to provide support for the cause of interrupted saccades. In the case of gaze-position dependent opsoclonus, existing models could not explain the behavior, but further development provided a reasonable hypothesis for the mechanism underlying the behavior. Collaboration between clinical and basic science is a rich source of progress for developing biologically plausible models and understanding neurological disease. Approaching a clinical problem with a specific hypothesis (model) in mind often prompts new experimental tests and provides insights into basic mechanisms.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The goal of this short review is to call attention to a yawning gap of knowledge that separates two processes essential for saccade production. On the one hand, knowledge about the saccade generation circuitry within the brainstem is detailed and precise – push-pull interactions between gaze-shifting and gaze-holding processes control the time of saccade initiation, which begins when omnipause neurons are inhibited and brainstem burst neurons are excited. On the other hand, knowledge about the cortical and subcortical premotor circuitry accomplishing saccade initiation has crystalized around the concept of stochastic accumulation – the accumulating activity of saccade neurons reaching a fixed value triggers a saccade. Here is the gap: we do not know how the reaching of a threshold by premotor neurons causes the critical pause and burst of brainstem neurons that initiates saccades. Why this problem matters and how it can be addressed will be discussed. Closing the gap would unify two rich but curiously disconnected empirical and theoretical domains.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Prediction and time estimation are all but required for motor function in everyday life. In the context of eye movements, for instance, they allow predictive saccades and eye re-acceleration in anticipation of a target re-appearance. While the neural pathways involved are not fully understood, it is known that the frontal lobe plays an important role. As such, neurological disorders that affect it, such as frontotemporal (FTD) dementia, are likely to induce deficits in such movements. In this work, we study the performances of frontotemporal dementia patients in an oculomotor task designed to elicit predictive saccades at different rates, and compare them to young and older adults. Clear deficits in the production of predictive saccades were found in patients, in particular when the time between saccades was short (~500 ms). Furthermore, one asymptomatic C9ORF72 mutation bearer showed patterns of oculomotor behavior similar to FTD patients. He exhibited FTD symptoms within 3 years post-measure, suggesting that an impairment of oculomotor function could be an early clinical sign. Taken together, these results argue in favor of a role of the frontal lobe in predictive movements timing over short timescales, and suggest that predictive saccades in FTD patients warrant further investigation to fully assess their potential as a diagnostic aid.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Syndrome of oculopalatal tremor (OPT) causes pendular nystagmus of the eyes and its disabling consequence on the visual system. Classic pharmacotherapeutic studies revealed reduction in the eye velocity of the oscillatory waveforms. Subjective improvement in vision, however, remains out of proportionately low. Elegant models depicting quasi-sinusoidal coarse oscillations of the eyes highlighted two distinct oscillators; one at the inferior olive causing primary 2 Hz oscillations, while the second, independent oscillator, at the cerebellum adding the randomness to the waveform. Here we examined whether pharmacotherapy affects the randomness of the oscillatory waveform. Horizontal, vertical, and torsional angular eye positions were measured independently from both eyes as six subjects with OPT directed gaze toward a straight-ahead target. The measurements were performed before administration of alpha-2-delta calcium channel blocker (gabapentin) or NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine) and after the subjects were treated with each of these drugs for at least 8 days. Amplitude and velocity of eye oscillations were reduced by gabapentin and memantine, but there was an increase in the waveform randomness. We found that the increase in randomness was proportionate to the amount of reduction in the waveform velocity or amplitude. Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct patterns of oscillatory waveforms, with each subject belonging to a specific cluster group. The pharmacotherapy changed the waveform clustering pattern of the waveform in each subject. We conclude that in addition to incomplete resolution of the oscillation intensity, increased randomness could be one of the reasons why there is not enough clinical difference in the patients’ visual quality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=10827&query=">Frontal eye field inactivation alters the readout of superior colliculus activity for saccade generation in a task-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Saccades require a spatiotemporal transformation of activity between the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (iSC) and downstream brainstem burst generator. The dynamic linear ensemble-coding model (Goossens and Van Opstal <span class="a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r14">2006</span>) proposes that each iSC spike contributes a fixed mini-vector to saccade displacement. Although biologically-plausible, this model assumes cortical areas like the frontal eye fields (FEF) simply provide the saccadic goal to be executed by the iSC and brainstem burst generator. However, the FEF and iSC operate in unison during saccades, and a pathway from the FEF to the brainstem burst generator that bypasses the iSC exists. Here, we investigate the impact of large yet reversible inactivation of the FEF on iSC activity in the context of the model across four saccade tasks. We exploit the overlap of saccade vectors generated when the FEF is inactivated or not, comparing the number of iSC spikes for metrically-matched saccades. We found that the iSC emits fewer spikes for metrically-matched saccades during FEF inactivation. The decrease in spike count is task-dependent, with a greater decrease accompanying more cognitively-demanding saccades. Our results show that FEF integrity influences the readout of iSC activity in a task-dependent manner. We propose that the dynamic linear ensemble-coding model be modified so that FEF inactivation increases the gain of a readout parameter, effectively increasing the influence of a single iSC spike. We speculate that this modification could be instantiated by FEF and iSC pathways to the cerebellum that could modulate the excitability of the brainstem burst generator.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">When two-frame apparent motion stimuli are presented with an appropriate inter-stimulus interval (ISI), motion is perceived in the direction opposite to the actual image shift. Herein, we measured a simple eye movement, ocular following responses (OFRs), in macaque monkeys to examine the ISI reversal effect on oculomotor. Two-frame movies with an ISI induced reversed OFRs. Without ISI, the OFRs to the two-frame movie were induced in the direction of the stimulus shift. However, with ISIs ≥10 ms, OFRs in the direction opposite to the phase shift were observed. This directional reversal persisted for ISIs up to 160 ms; for longer ISIs virtually no ocular response was observed. Furthermore, longer exposure to the initial image (Motion onset delay: MOD) reduced OFRs. We show that these dependences on ISIs/MODs can be explained by the motion energy model. Furthermore, we examined the dependence on ISI reversal using various spatial frequencies. To account for our findings, the optimal frequency of the temporal filters of the energy model must decrease between 0.5 and 1 cycles/°, suggesting that there are at least two channels with different temporal characteristics. These results are consistent with those from humans, suggesting that the temporal filters embedded in human and macaque visual systems are similar. Thus, the macaque monkey is a good animal model for the early visual processing of humans to understand the neural substrates underlying the visual motion detectors that elicit OFRs.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Feed-forward deep neural networks have better performance in object categorization tasks than other models of computer vision. To understand the relationship between feed-forward deep networks and the primate brain, we investigated representations of upright and inverted faces in a convolutional deep neural network model and compared them with representations by neurons in the monkey anterior inferior-temporal cortex, area TE. We applied principal component analysis to feature vectors in each model layer to visualize the relationship between the vectors of the upright and inverted faces. The vectors of the upright and inverted monkey faces were more separated through the convolution layers. In the fully-connected layers, the separation among human individuals for upright faces was larger than for inverted faces. The Spearman correlation between each model layer and TE neurons reached a maximum at the fully-connected layers. These results indicate that the processing of faces in the fully-connected layers might resemble the asymmetric representation of upright and inverted faces by the TE neurons. The separation of upright and inverted faces might take place by feed-forward processing in the visual cortex, and separations among human individuals for upright faces, which were larger than those for inverted faces, might occur in area TE.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">In spite of their anatomical robustness, it has been difficult to establish the functional role of corticogeniculate circuits connecting primary visual cortex with the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) in the feedback direction. Growing evidence suggests that corticogeniculate feedback does not directly shape the spatial receptive field properties of LGN neurons, but rather regulates the timing and precision of LGN responses and the information coding capacity of LGN neurons. We propose that corticogeniculate feedback specifically stabilizes the response gain of LGN neurons, thereby increasing their information coding capacity. Inspired by early work by McClurkin et al. (<span class="a-plus-plus citation-ref citationid-c-r29">1994</span>), we manipulated the activity of corticogeniculate neurons to test this hypothesis. We used optogenetic methods to selectively and reversibly enhance the activity of corticogeniculate neurons in anesthetized ferrets while recording responses of LGN neurons to drifting gratings and white noise stimuli. We found that optogenetic activation of corticogeniculate feedback systematically reduced LGN gain variability and increased information coding capacity among LGN neurons. Optogenetic activation of corticogeniculate neurons generated similar increases in information encoded in LGN responses to drifting gratings and white noise stimuli. Together, these findings suggest that the influence of corticogeniculate feedback on LGN response precision and information coding capacity could be mediated through reductions in gain variability.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Miniature yoked eye movements, fixational saccades, are critical to counteract visual fading. Fixational saccades are followed by a return saccades forming squarewaves. Present in healthy states, squarewaves, if too many or too big, affect visual stability. Parkinson’s disease (PD), where visual deficits are not uncommon, is associated with the squarewaves that are excessive in number or size. Our working hypothesis is that the basal ganglia are at the epicenter of the abnormal fixational saccades and squarewaves in PD; the effects are manifested through their connections to the superior colliculus (affecting saccade frequency and amplitude) and the cerebellum (affecting velocity and amplitude). We predict that the subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) variably affects the amplitude, frequency, and velocity of fixational saccade and that the effect depends on the electrode’s proximity or the volume of activated tissue in the subthalamic nucleus’ connections with the superior colliculus or the cerebellum. We found that DBS modulated saccade amplitude, frequency, and velocity in 11 PD patients. Although all three parameters were affected, the extent of the effects varied amongst subjects. The modulation was dependent upon the location and size of the electrically activated volume of the subthalamic region.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The syndrome of oculopalatal tremor (OPT) featuring the olivo-cerebellar hypersychrony leads to disabling pendular nystagmus and palatal myoclonus. This rare disorder provides valuable information about the motor physiology and offers insights into the mechanistic underpinning of common movement disorders. This focused review summarizes the last decade of OPT research from our laboratory and addresses three critical questions: 1) How the disease of inferior olive affects the physiology of motor learning? We discovered that our brain’s ability to compensate for the impaired motor command and implement errors to correct future movements could be affected if the cerebellum is occupied in receiving and transmitting the meaningless signal. A complete failure of OPT patients to adapt to change in rapid eye movements (saccades) provided proof of this principle. 2) Whether maladaptive olivo-cerebellar circuit offers insight into the mechanistic underpinning of the common movement disorder, dystonia, characterized by abnormal twisting and turning of the body part. We discovered that the subgroup of patients who had OPT also had dystonia affecting the neck, trunk, limbs, and face. We also found that the subjects who had tremor predominant neck dystonia (without OPT) also had impaired motor learning on a long and short timescale, just like those with OPT. Altogether, our studies focused on dystonia suggested the evidence for the maladaptive olive-cerebellar system. 3) We discovered that the OPT subjects had difficulty in perceiving the direction of their linear forward motion, <em class="a-plus-plus">i.e.</em>, heading, suggesting that olivo-cerebellar hypersynchrony also affects perception.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">This study analyzed the characteristics of pursuit and assessed the influence of prior and visual information on eye velocity and saccades in amblyopic and control children, in comparison to adults. Eye movements of 41 children (21 amblyopes and 20 controls) were compared to eye movements of 55 adults (18 amblyopes and 37 controls). Participants were asked to pursue a target moving at a constant velocity. The target was either a ‘standard’ target, with a uniform color intensity, or a ‘noisy’ target, with blurry edges, to mimic the blurriness of an amblyopic eye. Analysis of pursuit patterns showed that the onset was delayed, and the gain was decreased in control children with a noisy target in comparison to amblyopic or control children with a standard target. Furthermore, a significant effect of prior and visual information on pursuit velocity and saccades was found across all participants. Moreover, the modulation of the effect of visual information on the pursuit velocity by group, that is amblyopes or controls with a standard target, and controls with a noisy target, was more limited in children. In other words, the effect of visual information was higher in control adults with a standard target compared to control children with the same target. However, in the case of a blurry target, either in control participants with a noisy target or in amblyopic participants with a standard target, the effect of visual information was larger in children.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>
                    </span>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Five patients (two females, mean age 66.8 years) developed encephalopathy after a mean of 12.6 days, since the onset of respiratory/constitutional symptoms related to COVID-19. Four patients suffered severe respiratory distress, three of which required invasive mechanical ventilation. Neurological manifestations included impaired consciousness, agitation, delirium, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing in all patients. Brain MRI showed non-specific findings. CSF analysis revealed normal cell count and protein levels. In all subjects, RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF tested negative. IVIg at 0.4 g/kg/die was commenced 29.8 days (mean, range: 19–55 days) after encephalopathy onset, leading to complete electroclinical recovery in all patients, with an initial improvement of neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in 3.4 days (mean, range: 1–10 days). No adverse events related to IVIg were observed.</p>

	<p>The way people represent and transform visuospatial information affects everyday activities including driving behavior. Mental rotation and perspective taking have recently been found to predict cognitive prerequisites for fitness-to-drive (FtD). We argue that the relationship between general cognitive status and FtD is mediated by spatial transformation skills. Here, we investigated the performance in the Mental Rotation Test (MRT) and the Perspective-Taking Test (PT) of 175 male active drivers (aged from 18 to 91 years), by administering the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to measure their global cognitive functioning. All participants were submitted to a computerized driving assessment measuring resilience of attention (DT), reaction speed (RS), motor speed (MS), and perceptual speed (ATAVT). Significant results were found for the effect of global cognitive functioning on perceptual speed through the full mediation of both mental rotation and perspective-taking skills. The indirect effect of global cognitive functioning through mental rotation was only found to significantly predict resilience of attention whereas the indirect effect mediated by perspective taking only was found to significantly predict perceptual speed. Finally, the negative effect of age was found on each driving measure. Results presented here, which are limited to male drivers, suggest that general cognitive efficiency is linked to spatial mental transformation skills and, in turn, to driving-related cognitive tasks, contributing to fitness-to-drive in the lifespan.</p>

	<p>Subjective cognitive decline is a symptom that may appear in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. This study examined the effects of smartphone-based calendar training and walking exercise regimen on postmenopausal women experiencing subjective cognitive decline. Experimental group 1 participated in both calendar training and walking exercise, group 2 participated in calendar training only, and the control group did not receive either intervention. Forty-two participants completed a cognitive function test and questionnaire upon entering the study and 12 weeks later. The controlled oral word association score increased in experimental groups 1 and 2 and decreased in the control group. Memory contentment increased in experimental group 1, maintained in experimental group 2, and decreased in the control group. Smartphone-based calendar training and a walking exercise regimen improved executive function and memory contentment in everyday life, but the effects on depressive symptoms and self-esteem were not significant. Our findings demonstrate that smartphone-based calendar training and walking exercise improved cognitive function and have potential as nonpharmacologic interventions to strengthen cognitive function in women experiencing subjective cognitive decline.</p>

                Activity-dependent long-term changes in synaptic transmission known as synaptic plasticity are fundamental processes in brain function and are recognized as the cellular basis of learning and memory. While the neuronal mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity have been largely identified, the involvement of astrocytes in these processes has been less recognized. However, astrocytes are emerging as important cells that regulate synaptic function by interacting with neurons at tripartite synapses.

                Oxytocin (OT), a hypothalamic neuropeptide that acts as a neuromodulator in the brain, orchestrates a variety of animal behaviors. However, the relationship between brain OT dynamics and complex animal behaviors remains largely elusive, partly because of the lack of a suitable technique for its real-time recording in vivo. Here, we describe MTRIAOT, a G protein-coupled receptor-based green fluorescent OT sensor with a large dynamic range, optimal affinity, ligand specificity to OT orthologs, minimal effects on downstream signaling, and long-term fluorescence stability. By combining viral gene delivery and fiber photometry-mediated fluorescence measurements, we demonstrated the utility of MTRIAOT for real-time detection of brain OT dynamics in living mice. Importantly, MTRIAOT-mediated measurements revealed "OT oscillation," a hitherto unknown rhythmic change in OT levels in the brain. MTRIAOT will allow the analysis of OT dynamics in a wide variety of physiological and pathological processes.

                Selective relationships are fundamental to humans and many other animals, but relationships between mates, family members, or peers may be mediated differently. We examined connections between social reward and social selectivity, aggression, and oxytocin receptor signaling pathways in rodents that naturally form enduring, selective relationships with mates and peers (prairie voles) or peers (meadow voles). Female prairie and meadow voles worked harder to access familiar vs. unfamiliar individuals, regardless of sex, and huddled extensively with familiar subjects. Male prairie voles also displayed strongly selective huddling preferences for familiar animals, but worked hardest to repeatedly access females vs. males, with no difference in effort by familiarity. This demonstrates a fundamental disconnect between motivation and social selectivity in males, and reveals a striking sex difference in pathways underlying social monogamy. Meadow voles exhibited social preferences but low social motivation, consistent with tolerance rather than reward supporting social groups in this species. Natural variation in oxytocin receptor genotype was associated with oxytocin receptor density, and both genotype and receptor binding predicted individual variation in prosocial and aggressive behaviors. These results provide a basis for understanding species, sex, and individual differences in the mechanisms underlying the role of social reward in social preference.

                BackgroundDomoic acid (DA) is a naturally occurring neurotoxin harmful to marine animals and humans. California sea lions exposed to DA in prey during algal blooms along the Pacific coast exhibit significant neurological symptoms, including epilepsy with hippocampal atrophy.

ObservationsHere we describe a xenotransplantation procedure to deliver interneuron progenitor cells into the damaged hippocampus of an epileptic sea lion with suspected DA toxicosis. The sea lion has had no evidence of seizures following the procedure, and clinical measures of well-being including weight and feeding habits have stabilized.

LessonsThese preliminary results suggest xenotransplantation has improved the quality-of-life (QOL) for this animal and holds tremendous therapeutic promise.

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Patients with Huntington’s disease (HD) have an increased incidence of diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction have not been entirely clarified. Revealing the pathogenesis of diabetes can provide a novel understanding of the onset and progression of HD, as well as potential clues for the development of new therapeutics. Here, we demonstrated that the mouse pancreatic insulinoma cell line NIT-1 expressing N-terminal mutant huntingtin (mHTT) containing 160 polyglutamine (160Q cells) displayed lower cell proliferative ability than the cells expressing N-terminal wild-type HTT containing 20 polyglutamine (20Q cells). In addition, 160Q cells were more prone to apoptosis and exhibited deficient glucose-stimulated insulin expression and secretion. Furthermore, insulin signaling molecule insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2) expression decreased and was recruited into mHTT aggregates. Consequently, glucose stimulation failed to activate the downstream molecule phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) in 160Q cells, leading to reduced phosphorylation levels of serine–threonine protein kinase AKT and forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). These data indicate that activation of the glucose-stimulated PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signaling pathway is significantly blocked in pancreatic β-cells in HD. Importantly, insulin treatment inhibited the aggregation of mHTT and significantly improved the activation of PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signaling in 160Q cells. These results suggest that the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 pathway might be due to the recruitment of IRS-2 into mHTT aggregates in HD β-cells, ultimately contributing to the impairment of pancreatic β-cells. In conclusion, our work provides new insight into the underlying mechanisms of the high incidence of diabetes and abnormal glucose homeostasis in HD.</p>

	<p>The risk of accidents while operating a drone is quite high. The most important solution is training for drone pilots. Drone pilot training can be done in both physical and virtual environments, but the probability of an accident is higher for pilot trainees, so the first method is to train in a virtual environment. The purpose of this study is to develop a new system to collect data on students’ educational development performance of students during the use of Gamified Drone Training Simulator and objectively analyze students’ development. A multimodal recording system that can collect simulator, keystroke, and brain activity data has been developed to analyze the cognitive and physical activities of participants trained in the gamified drone simulator. It was found that as the number of trials increased, participants became accustomed to the cognitive load of visual/auditory tasks and therefore the power in the alpha and beta bands decreased. It was observed that participants’ meditation and attention scores increased with the number of repetitions of the educational game. It can be concluded that the number of repetitions lowers stress and anxiety levels, increases attention, and thus enhances game performance.</p>

	<p>Reconsolidation is a process by which memories are destabilized, updated, and then restabilized. Strong memories are resistant to undergoing reconsolidation. Here, we addressed whether an overtrained fear memory could be made susceptible to reconsolidation by first extinguishing, and then renewing, the memory. Rats were trained with ten tone-footshock pairings, followed by eight days of tone extinction in the training context. The next day, rats were placed into a second context and memory for the tone was renewed/reactivated with a single tone presentation. Immediately following reactivation, rats received an injection of midazolam or vehicle. Rats were then tested for freezing to the tone in a third context. Midazolam had no effect in rats that did not undergo tone extinction, but significantly attenuated freezing to the tone in extinguished rats. Thus, rats that received tone extinction underwent tone memory reconsolidation following its renewal. In a second experiment, we administered the reactivation session and midazolam injections prior to extinction. Midazolam had no effect and rats extinguished at a rate similar to controls. These data suggest that strong emotional memories are capable of updating following weakening of memory expression through extinction.</p>

	<p>Objective: To characterize the effect of unilateral (single and two-level) lumbar facet/zygapophysial joint fixation on paraspinal muscle spindle activity immediately following L4 or L6 high velocity low amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) delivered at various thrust durations. Methods: Secondary analysis of immediate (≤2 s) post-HVLA-SM trunk muscle spindle response from two studies involving anesthetized adult cats (n = 39; 2.3–6.0 kg) with either a unilateral single (L5/6) or two-level (L5/6 and L6/7) facet joint fixation. All facet fixations were contralateral to L6 dorsal root recordings. HVLA-SM was delivered to the spinous process in a posterior-to-anterior direction using a feedback motor with a peak thrust magnitude of 55% of average cat body weight and thrust durations of 75, 100, 150, and 250 ms. Time to 1st action potential and spindle activity during 1 and 2 s post-HVLA-SM comparisons were made between facet joint fixation conditions and HVLA-SM segmental thrust levels. Results: Neither two-level facet joint fixation, nor HVLA-SM segmental level significantly altered immediate post-HVLA-SM spindle discharge at tested thrust durations (FDR &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Two-level facet joint fixation failed to alter immediate (≤2 s) post-HVLA-SM spindle discharge when compared to single-level facet joint fixation at any thrust duration. Segmental thrust level did not alter immediate post-HVLA-SM spindle response in two-level facet joint fixation preparations.</p>

	<p>Background: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The aim of the study was to determine serum concentrations of AGEs and their soluble receptor (sRAGE) in MS patients and healthy controls and to investigate their possible influence on disease activity. Methods: Serum concentrations of AGE and sRAGE in patients with MS and healthy controls were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The mean serum AGE concentration in patients with MS was higher than in healthy controls, whereas the mean serum sRAGE concentration was lower than in the control group. However, the differences were not statistically significant. In MS patients, serum AGE and sRAGE concentrations did not differ significantly, depending on the duration of the disease and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Conclusions: Multiple sclerosis may be accompanied by disturbances of the AGE-sRAGE axis. However, further studies are warranted to confirm it. The duration of the disease and the degree of disability do not seem to affect the progression of the glycation process, particularly in the stable phase of the disease.</p>

	<p>Azerbaijani 28-year-old female showed weakness (MRC (Medical Research Council Scale for Muscle Strength) grade 4 in the proximal part of the upper and MRC grade 2–3 in the lower extremities), difficulty in stair lifting, positive symptom of Hoover’s rising, «waddling gait», decline deep reflexes symmetrical, lack of surface reflexes, positive Babinsky’s reflex on the right, urinary incontinence during sneezing, prolonged walking and exercise from puberty. Additional methods made it possible to identify minor violations of conduction of the left ventricle, electromyography signs of primary muscular disease with predominant involvement of the proximal muscles of the lower extremities, elevation of serum creatine kinase (746.81 U/l), active foci of demyelination in the left frontal lobe, intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal IgG bands (type 2) in cerebrospinal fluid, atrophy and fatty degeneration of all muscles of the shins, homozygous Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) c.1855C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.Pro619Ser) in TRIM32 gene and heterozygous VUS c.2300C &amp;amp;gt; G (p.Thr767Arg) in KIF5A, c.2840G &amp;amp;gt; A (p.Arg947Lys) in MYH2, c.1502G &amp;amp;gt; C (p.Gly501Ala) in POMT1 genes. Comparison of the phenotypes of the mutations that have been identified with the clinical picture of the patient suggests that VUS c.1855C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.Pro619Ser) in the TRIM32 gene can be pathological. Summarizing, it can be argued that the cause of the identified disorders is a homozygous variant c.1855C &amp;amp;gt; T (p.Pro619Ser) in TRIM32 gene that causes LGMDR8 in a patient with MS.</p>

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive and irreversible disease and the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. In Spain, it affects around 120.000–150.000 individuals, and its prevalence is estimated to increase in the future. PD has a great impact on patients’ and caregivers’ lives and also entails a substantial socioeconomic burden. The aim of the present study was to examine the current situation and the 10-year PD forecast for Spain in order to optimize and design future management strategies. This study was performed using the modified Delphi method to try to obtain a consensus among a panel of movement disorders experts. According to the panel, future PD management will improve diagnostic capacity and follow-up, it will include multidisciplinary teams, and innovative treatments will be developed. The expansion of new technologies and studies on biomarkers will have an impact on future PD management, leading to more accurate diagnoses, prognoses, and individualized therapies. However, the socio-economic impact of the disease will continue to be significant by 2030, especially for patients in advanced stages. This study highlighted the unmet needs in diagnosis and treatment and how crucial it is to establish recommendations for future diagnostic and therapeutic management of PD.</p>

	<p>Biomarkers to detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD) would enable patients to gain access to appropriate services and may facilitate the development of new therapies. Given the large numbers of people affected by AD, there is a need for a low-cost, easy-to-use method to detect AD patients. Potentially, the electroencephalogram (EEG) can play a valuable role in this, but at present no single EEG biomarker is robust enough for use in practice. This study aims to provide a methodological framework for the development of robust EEG biomarkers to detect AD with clinically acceptable performance by exploiting the combined strengths of key biomarkers. A large number of existing and novel EEG biomarkers associated with slowing of EEG, reduction in EEG complexity. and decrease in EEG connectivity were investigated. Support vector machine and linear discriminate analysis methods were used to find the best combination of the EEG biomarkers to detect AD with significant performance. A total of 325,567 EEG biomarkers were investigated, and a panel of six biomarkers was identified and used to create a diagnostic model with high performance (≥85% for sensitivity and 100% for specificity).</p>

	<p>Background: Various three-dimensional (3D) glioblastoma cell culture models have a limited duration of viability. Our aim was to develop a long-term 3D glioblastoma model, which is necessary for reliable drug response studies. Methods: Human U87 glioblastoma cells were cultured in alginate microfibers for 28 days. Cell growth, viability, morphology, and aggregation in 3D culture were monitored by fluorescent and confocal microscopy upon calcein-AM/propidium iodide (CAM/PI) staining every seven days. The glioblastoma 3D model was validated using temozolomide (TMZ) treatments 3 days in a row with a recovery period. Cell viability by MTT and resistance-related gene expression (MGMT and ABCB1) by qPCR were assessed after 28 days. The same TMZ treatment schedule was applied in 2D U87 cell culture for comparison purposes. Results: Within a long-term 3D model system in alginate fibers, U87 cells remained viable for up to 28 days. On day 7, cells formed visible aggregates oriented to the microfiber periphery. TMZ treatment reduced cell growth but increased drug resistance-related gene expression. The latter effect was more pronounced in 3D compared to 2D cell culture. Conclusion: Herein, we described a long-term glioblastoma 3D model system that could be particularly helpful for drug testing and treatment optimization.</p>

The main goal of this analysis was to identify, using metabolomics, the common pathways that are modulated across multiple tissues (brown adipose tissue, liver, plasma, and brain) to evaluate two alternative...

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/pnas/UJrK">Cell-free reconstitution reveals the molecular mechanisms for the initiation of secondary siRNA biogenesis in plants [Plant Biology]</a></h4>

              
                Secondary small interfering RNA (siRNA) production, triggered by primary small RNA targeting, is critical for proper development and antiviral defense in many organisms. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) is a key factor in this pathway. However, how RDR specifically converts the targets of primary small RNAs into double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates...
