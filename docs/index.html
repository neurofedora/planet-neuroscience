              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17329">Transformer brain encoders explain human high-level visual responses</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major goal of neuroscience is to understand brain computations during visual processing in naturalistic settings. A dominant approach is to use image-computable deep neural networks trained with different task objectives as a basis for linear encoding models. However, in addition to requiring tuning a large number of parameters, the linear encoding approach ignores the structure of the feature maps both in the brain and the models. Recently proposed alternatives have focused on decomposing the linear mapping to spatial and feature components but focus on finding static receptive fields for units that are applicable only in early visual areas. In this work, we employ the attention mechanism used in the transformer architecture to study how retinotopic visual features can be dynamically routed to category-selective areas in high-level visual processing. We show that this computational motif is significantly more powerful than alternative methods in predicting brain activity during natural scene viewing, across different feature basis models and modalities. We also show that this approach is inherently more interpretable, without the need to create importance maps, by interpreting the attention routing signal for different high-level categorical areas. Our approach proposes a mechanistic model of how visual information from retinotopic maps can be routed based on the relevance of the input content to different category-selective regions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18117">Multi-Modal Spectral Parametrization Method (MMSPM) for analyzing EEG activity with distinct scaling regimes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.18117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aperiodic neural activity has been the subject of intense research interest lately as it could reflect on the cortical excitation/inhibition ratio, which is suspected to be affected in numerous clinical conditions. This phenomenon is characterized via the aperiodic scaling exponent $\beta$, equal to the spectral slope following log-log transformation of power spectra. Despite recent progress, however, most current methods do not take into consideration the plausible multimodal nature in the power spectra of neurophysiological recordings - i.e., $\beta$ might be different in low- ($\beta_{lo}$) and high-frequency ($\beta_{hi}$) regimes -, especially in case of $|\beta_{lo}|>|\beta_{hi}|$. Here we propose an algorithm, the multi-modal spectral parametrization method (MMSPM) that aims to account for this issue. MMSPM estimates $\beta_{lo}$ and $\beta_{hi}$ separately using a constrained, piece-wise regression technique, and also assesses if they are significantly different or instead the spectrum is indeed unimodal and can be characterized simply with broadband $\beta$. Here we present the MMSPM algorithm and evaluate its performance in silico on simulated power spectra. Then, we use MMSPM on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from 19 young, healthy volunteers, as well as on a separate dataset of EEG recordings from 30 schizophrenia patients and 31 healthy controls, and demonstrate that broadband (0.1-100 Hz and 0.5-45 Hz) EEG spectra can indeed present a bimodality pattern with significantly steeper low-range ($<\sim2$ Hz) and flatter high-range scaling regimes (i.e., $|\beta_{lo}|>|\beta_{hi}|$).
  Clinical relevance: The MMSPM method characterizes aperiodic neural activity in distinct scaling regimes, which can be relevant in numerous pathological conditions such as dementia or schizophrenia.

                arXiv:2505.17024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI alignment is a field of research that aims to develop methods to ensure that agents always behave in a manner aligned with (i.e. consistently with) the goals and values of their human operators, no matter their level of capability. This paper proposes an affectivist approach to the alignment problem, re-framing the concepts of goals and values in terms of affective taxis, and explaining the emergence of affective valence by appealing to recent work in evolutionary-developmental and computational neuroscience. We review the state of the art and, building on this work, we propose a computational model of affect based on taxis navigation. We discuss evidence in a tractable model organism that our model reflects aspects of biological taxis navigation. We conclude with a discussion of the role of affective taxis in AI alignment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01522">Are EEG functional networks really describing the brain? A comparison with other information-processing complex systems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.01522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional networks representing human brain dynamics have become a standard tool in neuroscience, providing an accessible way of depicting the computation performed by the brain in healthy and pathological conditions. Yet, these networks share multiple characteristics with those representing other natural and man-made complex systems, leading to the question of whether they are actually capturing the uniqueness of the human brain. By resorting to a large set of data representing multiple financial, technological, social, and natural complex systems, and by relying on Deep Learning classification models, we show how they are highly similar. We specifically reach the conclusion that, under some general reconstruction methodological choices, it is as difficult to understand whether a network represents a human brain or a financial market, as to diagnose a major pathology. This suggests that functional networks are describing information processing mechanisms that are common across complex systems; but that are not currently defining the uniqueness of the human mind. We discuss the consequence of these findings for neuroscience and complexity science in general, and suggest future avenues for exploring this interesting topic.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13361">Feedback-Driven Dynamical Model for Axonal Extension on Parallel Micropatterns</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.13361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in understanding neuronal development, a fully quantitative framework that integrates intracellular mechanisms with environmental cues during axonal growth remains incomplete. Here, we present a unified biophysical model that captures key mechanochemical processes governing axonal extension on micropatterned substrates. In these environments, axons preferentially align with the pattern direction, form bundles, and advance at constant speed. The model integrates four core components: (i) actin-adhesion traction coupling, (ii) lateral inhibition between neighboring axons, (iii) tubulin transport from soma to the growth cone, and (4) orientation dynamics guided by the substrate anisotropy. Dynamical systems analysis reveals that the saddle-node bifurcation in the actin adhesion subsystem drives a transition to a high-traction motile state, while traction feedback shifts a pitchfork bifurcation in the signaling loop, promoting symmetry breaking and robust alignment. An exact linear solution in the tubulin transport subsystem functions as a built-in speed regulator, ensuring stable elongation rates. Simulations using experimentally inferred parameters accurately reproduce elongation speed, alignment variance, and bundle spacing. The model provides explicit design rules for enhancing axonal alignment through modulation of substrate stiffness and adhesion dynamics. By identifying key control parameters, this work enables rational design of biomaterials for neural repair and engineered tissue systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18786">NeuroTree: Hierarchical Functional Brain Pathway Decoding for Mental Health Disorders</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.18786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mental disorders are among the most widespread diseases globally. Analyzing functional brain networks through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is crucial for understanding mental disorder behaviors. Although existing fMRI-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential in brain network feature extraction, they often fail to characterize complex relationships between brain regions and demographic information in mental disorders. To overcome these limitations, we propose a learnable NeuroTree framework that integrates a k-hop AGE-GCN with neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and contrastive masked functional connectivity (CMFC) to enhance similarities and dissimilarities of brain region distance. Furthermore, NeuroTree effectively decodes fMRI network features into tree structures, which improves the capture of high-order brain regional pathway features and enables the identification of hierarchical neural behavioral patterns essential for understanding disease-related brain subnetworks. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuroTree achieves state-of-the-art performance across two distinct mental disorder datasets. It provides valuable insights into age-related deterioration patterns, elucidating their underlying neural mechanisms.

                arXiv:2505.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a new single point metaheuristic optimization approach suitable for both continuous and discrete domains. The proposed algorithm, entitled Blindfolded Spiderman Optimization, follows a piecewise linear search trajectory where each line segment considers a move to an improved solution point. The trajectory resembles spiderman jumping from one building to the highest neighbor building in a blindfolded manner. Blindfolded Spiderman Optimization builds on top of the Buggy Pinball Optimization algorithm. Blindfolded Spiderman Optimization is tested on 16 mathematical optimization functions and one discrete problem of Unbounded Knapsack. We perform a thorough evaluation of Blindfolded Spiderman Optimization against established and state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization methods, including Whale Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing, Threshold Accepting, and Buggy Pinball Optimization considering various optimization domains and dimensions. We show that Blindfolded Spiderman Optimization achieves great performance on both continuous and discrete spaces, and superior performance compared to all single-point metaheuristic approaches considered.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17108">REMS: a unified solution representation, problem modeling and metaheuristic algorithm design for general combinatorial optimization problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.17108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with discrete variables and finite search space are critical across numerous fields, and solving them in metaheuristic algorithms is popular. However, addressing a specific COP typically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor adjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm redevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs into a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is valuable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to perform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a resource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the first time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP. Subsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified as assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and constraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the modeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified solution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure, destruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the development of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4 single-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured herein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading, assignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model these COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the designed metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than GUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and outperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17309">LaSER: How Learning Can Guide the Evolution of Equations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution and learning are two distinct yet complementary forms of adaptation. While evolutionary processes operate across generations via the selection of genotypes, learning occurs within the lifetime of an individual, shaping behavior through phenotypic adjustment. The Baldwin effect describes how lifetime learning can improve evolutionary search without altering inherited structures. While this has proven effective in areas like neuroevolution, where gradient-based learning is often used to fine-tune weights or behaviors produced by evolution, it remains underexplored in systems that evolve non-differentiable symbolic structures like Genetic Programming (GP). GP evolves explicit syntax trees that represent equations, offering strong interpretability but limited generalization due to the burden of discovering both useful representations and precise mappings.
  Here, we show for the first time that integrating a simple form of supervised learning, applied at the semantic or behavioral level during evaluation, can effectively guide the evolution of equations in GP. To achieve this, we propose a new GP pipeline, LaSER (Latent Semantic Evolutionary Regression), where each GP individual generates a semantic representation that is passed to a supervised learner. The quality of the learned mapping is used to assign fitness, without modifying the underlying syntax tree or evolutionary process.
  Across standard symbolic regression benchmarks, in terms of generalization ability, LaSER significantly outperforms traditional GP and, in several cases, matches or exceeds popular machine learning regressors, while preserving the symbolic interpretability. By separating evolution from learning, LaSER offers a practical route to integrating GP with modern ML workflows, and opens new avenues for research at the intersection of evolutionary computation and representation learning.

                arXiv:2505.17430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SEvoBench, a modern C++ framework for evolutionary computation (EC), specifically designed to systematically benchmark evolutionary single-objective optimization algorithms. The framework features modular implementations of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms, organized around three core components: (1) algorithm construction with reusable modules, (2) efficient benchmark problem suites, and (3) parallel experimental analysis. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the framework's superior performance in benchmark testing and algorithm comparison. Case studies further validate its capabilities in algorithm hybridization and parameter analysis. Compared to existing frameworks, SEvoBench demonstrates three key advantages: (i) highly efficient and reusable modular implementations of PSO and DE algorithms, (ii) accelerated benchmarking through parallel execution, and (iii) enhanced computational efficiency via SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) vectorization for large-scale problems.

                arXiv:2505.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts to improve the efficiency of neuromorphic and machine learning systems have focused on the development of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which provide hardware specialized for the deployment of neural networks, leading to potential gains in efficiency and performance. These systems typically feature an architecture that goes beyond the von Neumann architecture employed in general-purpose hardware such as GPUs. Neural networks developed for this specialised hardware then need to take into account the specifics of the hardware platform, which requires novel training algorithms and accurate models of the hardware, since they cannot be abstracted as a general-purpose computing platform. In this work, we present a bottom-up approach to train neural networks for hardware based on spiking neurons and synapses built on ferroelectric capacitor (FeCap) and Resistive switching non-volatile devices (RRAM) respectively. In contrast to the more common approach of designing hardware to fit existing abstract neuron or synapse models, this approach starts with compact models of the physical device to model the computational primitive of the neurons. Based on these models, a training algorithm is developed that can reliably backpropagate through these physical models, even when applying common hardware limitations, such as stochasticity, variability, and low bit precision. The training algorithm is then tested on a spatio-temporal dataset with a network composed of quantized synapses based on RRAM and ferroelectric leaky integrate-and-fire (FeLIF) neurons. The performance of the network is compared with different networks composed of LIF neurons. The results of the experiments show the potential advantage of using BRUNO to train networks with FeLIF neurons, by achieving a reduction in both time and memory for detecting spatio-temporal patterns with quantized synapses.

                arXiv:2505.17724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) is a mechanism to mediate interactions and protect the body from damage in a potentially dangerous environment. To better convey warning signals to users of prosthetic arms or autonomous robots and protect them by triggering a proper NWR, it is useful to use a biological representation of temperature information for fast and effective processing. In this work, we present a neuromorphic spiking network for heat-evoked NWR by mimicking the structure and encoding scheme of the reflex arc. The network is trained with the bio-plausible reward modulated spike timing-dependent plasticity learning algorithm. We evaluated the proposed model and three other methods in recent studies that trigger NWR in an experiment with radiant heat. We found that only the neuromorphic model exhibits the spatial summation (SS) effect and temporal summation (TS) effect similar to humans and can encode the reflex strength matching the intensity of the stimulus in the relative spike latency online. The improved bio-plausibility of this neuromorphic model could improve sensory feedback in neural prostheses.

                arXiv:2505.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proprioception, a key sensory modality in haptic perception, plays a vital role in perceiving the 3D structure of objects by providing feedback on the position and movement of body parts. The restoration of proprioceptive sensation is crucial for enabling in-hand manipulation and natural control in the prosthetic hand. Despite its importance, proprioceptive sensation is relatively unexplored in an artificial system. In this work, we introduce a novel platform that integrates a soft anthropomorphic robot hand (QB SoftHand) with flexible proprioceptive sensors and a classifier that utilizes a hybrid spiking neural network with different types of spiking neurons to interpret neuromorphic proprioceptive signals encoded by a biological muscle spindle model. The encoding scheme and the classifier are implemented and tested on the datasets we collected in the active exploration of ten objects from the YCB benchmark. Our results indicate that the classifier achieves more accurate inferences than existing learning approaches, especially in the early stage of the exploration. This system holds the potential for development in the areas of haptic feedback and neural prosthetics.

                arXiv:2505.17740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making accurate predictions of chaotic time series is a complex challenge. Reservoir computing, a neuromorphic-inspired approach, has emerged as a powerful tool for this task. It exploits the memory and nonlinearity of dynamical systems without requiring extensive parameter tuning. However, selecting and optimizing reservoir architectures remains an open problem. Next-generation reservoir computing simplifies this problem by employing nonlinear vector autoregression based on truncated Volterra series, thereby reducing hyperparameter complexity. Nevertheless, the latter suffers from exponential parameter growth in terms of the maximum monomial degree. Tensor networks offer a promising solution to this issue by decomposing multidimensional arrays into low-dimensional structures, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. This paper explores the application of a previously proposed tensor network model for predicting chaotic time series, demonstrating its advantages in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional echo state networks. Using a state-of-the-art tensor network approach enables us to bridge the gap between the tensor network and reservoir computing communities, fostering advances in both fields.

                arXiv:2505.17745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) streamlines the automation of optimization algorithm design through meta-learning. It typically employs a bi-level structure: the meta-level policy undergoes meta-training to reduce the manual effort required in developing algorithms for low-level optimization tasks. The original MetaBox (2023) provided the first open-source framework for reinforcement learning-based single-objective MetaBBO. However, its relatively narrow scope no longer keep pace with the swift advancement in this field. In this paper, we introduce MetaBox-v2 (https://github.com/MetaEvo/MetaBox) as a milestone upgrade with four novel features: 1) a unified architecture supporting RL, evolutionary, and gradient-based approaches, by which we reproduce 23 up-to-date baselines; 2) efficient parallelization schemes, which reduce the training/testing time by 10-40x; 3) a comprehensive benchmark suite of 18 synthetic/realistic tasks (1900+ instances) spanning single-objective, multi-objective, multi-model, and multi-task optimization scenarios; 4) plentiful and extensible interfaces for custom analysis/visualization and integrating to external optimization tools/benchmarks. To show the utility of MetaBox-v2, we carry out a systematic case study that evaluates the built-in baselines in terms of the optimization performance, generalization ability and learning efficiency. Valuable insights are concluded from thorough and detailed analysis for practitioners and those new to the field.

                arXiv:2505.17863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergence is a fascinating property of large language models and neural networks more broadly: as models scale and train for longer, they sometimes develop new abilities in sudden ways. Despite initial studies, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how and when these abilities emerge. To address this gap, we study the emergence over training of sparse attention, a critical and frequently observed attention pattern in Transformers. By combining theoretical analysis of a toy model with empirical observations on small Transformers trained on a linear regression variant, we uncover the mechanics driving sparse attention emergence and reveal that emergence timing follows power laws based on task structure, architecture, and optimizer choice. We additionally find that repetition can greatly speed up emergence. Finally, we confirm these results on a well-studied in-context associative recall task. Our findings provide a simple, theoretically grounded framework for understanding how data distributions and model design influence the learning dynamics behind one form of emergence.

Abstract: Designing effective black-box optimizers is hampered by limited problem-specific knowledge and manual control that spans months for almost every detail. In this paper, we present DesignX, the first automated algorithm design framework that generates an effective optimizer specific to a given black-box optimization problem within seconds. Rooted in the first principles, we identify two key sub-tasks: 1) algorithm structure generation and 2) hyperparameter control. To enable systematic construction, a comprehensive modular algorithmic space is first built, embracing hundreds of algorithm components collected from decades of research. We then introduce a dual-agent reinforcement learning system that collaborates on structural and parametric design through a novel cooperative training objective, enabling large-scale meta-training across 10k diverse instances. Remarkably, through days of autonomous learning, the DesignX-generated optimizers continuously surpass human-crafted optimizers by orders of magnitude, either on synthetic testbed or on realistic optimization scenarios such as Protein-docking, AutoML and UAV path planning. Further in-depth analysis reveals DesignX's capability to discover non-trivial algorithm patterns beyond expert intuition, which, conversely, provides valuable design insights for the optimization community. We provide DesignX's inference code at https://github.com/MetaEvo/DesignX.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in developing spiking neural networks (SNNs) as a potential solution to the energy challenges posed by conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, our theoretical understanding of SNNs remains relatively limited compared to the ever-growing body of literature on ANNs. In this paper, we study a discrete-time model of SNNs based on leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, referred to as discrete-time LIF-SNNs, a widely used framework that still lacks solid theoretical foundations. We demonstrate that discrete-time LIF-SNNs with static inputs and outputs realize piecewise constant functions defined on polyhedral regions, and more importantly, we quantify the network size required to approximate continuous functions. Moreover, we investigate the impact of latency (number of time steps) and depth (number of layers) on the complexity of the input space partitioning induced by discrete-time LIF-SNNs. Our analysis highlights the importance of latency and contrasts these networks with ANNs employing piecewise linear activation functions. Finally, we present numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings.

                arXiv:2406.01309v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is crucial to training reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, this design is non-trivial, even for domain experts, due to the subjective nature of certain tasks that are hard to quantify explicitly. In recent works, large language models (LLMs) have been used for reward generation from natural language task descriptions, leveraging their extensive instruction tuning and commonsense understanding of human behavior. In this work, we hypothesize that LLMs, guided by human feedback, can be used to formulate reward functions that reflect human implicit knowledge. We study this in three challenging settings -- autonomous driving, humanoid locomotion, and dexterous manipulation -- wherein notions of ``good" behavior are tacit and hard to quantify. To this end, we introduce REvolve, a truly evolutionary framework that uses LLMs for reward design in RL. REvolve generates and refines reward functions by utilizing human feedback to guide the evolution process, effectively translating implicit human knowledge into explicit reward functions for training (deep) RL agents. Experimentally, we demonstrate that agents trained on REvolve-designed rewards outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: As quantum computing technology continues to advance, various sectors, including industry, government, academia, and research, have increasingly focused on its future applications. With the integration of artificial intelligence techniques, multiple Quantum Neural Network (QNN) models have been proposed, including quantum convolutional neural networks, quantum long short-term memory networks, and quantum generative adversarial networks. Furthermore, optimization methods such as constrained optimization by linear approximation and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation have been explored. Therefore, this study proposes Hybrid Quantum Swarm Intelligence (HQSI), which constructs a QNN model as a forward propagation neural network. After measuring quantum states and obtaining prediction results, a classical computer-based swarm intelligence algorithm is employed for weight optimization. The training process iterates between quantum and classical computing environments. During the experimental phase, the proposed HQSI method is evaluated using an online certificate status protocol request traffic prediction task. Comparative analysis against state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms demonstrates that the proposed HQSI approach achieves more than a 50% reduction in error.

Abstract: Traditional spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be viewed as a combination of multiple subnetworks with each running for one time step, where the parameters are shared, and the membrane potential serves as the only information link between them. However, the implicit nature of the membrane potential limits its ability to effectively represent temporal information. As a result, each time step cannot fully leverage information from previous time steps, seriously limiting the model's performance. Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the brain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure that functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from earlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later stages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During forward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time steps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and integrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we theoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of vanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms together significantly and consistently improve the model performance on multiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%.

                arXiv:2407.21077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality instruction data for effective alignment, particularly in code generation tasks where expert curated datasets are expensive to produce. We present Genetic-Instruct, a scalable algorithm for synthesizing large-scale, high quality coding instructions using evolutionary principles. Starting from a small set of seed instructions, Genetic-Instruct generates diverse and challenging instruction-code pairs by leveraging an Instructor-LLM for generation, a Coder-LLM for code synthesis, and a Judge-LLM for automatic quality evaluation. Our proposed approach is highly parallelizable and effective even with a small seed data and weaker generator models. We generated more than 7.5 million coding instructions with the proposed approach. Then we evaluated it by fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic samples and demonstrated a significant improvement in their code generation capability compared to the other synthetic generation approaches and publicly available datasets. Our results highlight the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability of the Genetic-Instruct framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15643">Safe PDE Boundary Control with Neural Operators</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.15643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical world dynamics are generally governed by underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) with unknown analytical forms in science and engineering problems. Neural network based data-driven approaches have been heavily studied in simulating and solving PDE problems in recent years, but it is still challenging to move forward from understanding to controlling the unknown PDE dynamics. PDE boundary control instantiates a simplified but important problem by only focusing on PDE boundary conditions as the control input and output. However, current model-free PDE controllers cannot ensure the boundary output satisfies some given user-specified safety constraint. To this end, we propose a safety filtering framework to guarantee the boundary output stays within the safe set for current model-free controllers. Specifically, we first introduce a neural boundary control barrier function (BCBF) to ensure the feasibility of the trajectory-wise constraint satisfaction of boundary output. Based on the neural operator modeling the transfer function from boundary control input to output trajectories, we show that the change in the BCBF depends linearly on the change in input boundary, so quadratic programming-based safety filtering can be done for pre-trained model-free controllers. Extensive experiments under challenging hyperbolic, parabolic and Navier-Stokes PDE dynamics environments validate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving better general performance and boundary constraint satisfaction compared to the vanilla and constrained model-free controller baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/safe-pde-control.

                arXiv:2502.04593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.

">Combinatorial mechanisms specify cellular location and neurotransmitter identity during regeneration of planarian neurons</a></h4>

              
                During regenerative neurogenesis, neurons must be created in the right types and locations. Though regenerative neurogenesis is limited in humans, other animals use regenerative neurogenesis to faithfully restore form and function after brain injury. Planarians are flatworms with extraordinary capacity for brain regeneration. Planarians use pluripotent stem cells to create neurons after injury, rather than resident progenitors. In this context, genetic mechanisms that produce diverse neurons with correct local identity remain unknown. Here, we report the discovery of factors important for regenerative neurogenesis of dopaminergic neurons in the planarian central, peripheral, and pharyngeal nervous systems. Distinct genes promote dopaminergic neuronal identity and instruct neurons to inhabit regions of the nervous system. Our results demonstrate that planarian neuronal fate requires factors that simultaneously direct neurotransmitter choice and regional location. Our work suggests that combinatorial direction of cell type could inform and improve exogenous stem cell therapies aimed at precisely replacing neurons.

">Task-relevant cognitive maps in episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive maps support navigation by representing locations in internal spaces with Euclidean distances. Similar organizational principles may govern the representation of non-spatial sensory and conceptual features, enabling higher cognitive functions including decision making and model-based reinforcement learning. Previous studies have shown that medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures support the embedding of stimuli into cognitive maps. However, these studies investigated the generation of novel cognitive maps, while the recruitment of existing semantic knowledge into task-relevant representational spaces and their remapping according to changing goals has not been investigated. In addition, it is not clear how the MTL interacts with neocortical representations of task-relevant stimulus features and whether this influences the formation of novel episodic memory traces. Here we show that the neural representations of natural stimuli in both MTL and neocortex are organized in behaviorally relevant cognitive maps of conceptual features and influence the accessibility of novel memory traces. Cognitive maps organize information into internal spaces with Euclidean distances, adapt to ongoing task demands, and influence performance. Their representational structure matches neural similarities in the MTL, with a specific role of the hippocampus for task-dependent remapping. Further, we isolated task-relevant and stimulus-driven representations of natural stimuli and show how they contribute to the formation of memory traces. Together, our results suggest that conceptual representations are flexibly recruited in spatially organized cognitive maps of task-relevant features and that Euclidean distances in these cognitive maps affect subsequent memory.

">Age and Alzheimer's disease affect functional connectivity along separate axes of functional brain organization</a></h4>

              
                Aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with alterations in functional connectivity (FC), yet their spatial and temporal characteristics remain debated. Whole-cortex functional gradients, which organize regions along axes of functional similarity, are positioned here as a framework for understanding such alterations. Across two independent cohorts (BioFINDER-2, N=973; ADNI, N=129), we demonstrate that hyper- and hypoconnectivity in both healthy aging and biomarker-confirmed AD progression coexist systematically, forming consistent spatial patterns that align with two distinct axes of brain organization. Using a combination of longitudinal and non-linear analyses, we show that the early (but not late) stages of AD pathology accumulation is associated with functional alteration along the sensory-association axis, a pattern that vanishes in later stages of AD. However, functional alteration along the sensory-association axis is associated with worse cognition throughout the AD spectrum, and even in older adults without AD pathology, suggesting that these FC patterns may reflect a general neural response to cognitive strain. Independently of AD, older age was associated with alterations instead along the executive-nonexecutive axis, a finding that was consistent throughout the adult lifespan. These findings highlight the fundamental role of intrinsic functional organization in shaping how the brain responds to aging and to AD, helping to resolve previously reported discrepancies.

">Diffusion Neuroimaging of Speech Acquisition in Infants</a></h4>

              
                We utilize diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Baby Connectome Project to longitudinally characterize white matter tract maturation across motor, auditory, visual, ventral language, and dorsal language pathways in infants from birth to 24 months of age. Our analysis reveals three primary insights into the neural basis of early speech acquisition. First, association tracts (arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus) exhibit marked immaturity at birth but undergo rapid maturation paralleling motor tracts (corticospinal and thalamo-precentral tract). By 24 months, these association tracts approach maturity levels comparable to primary sensory tracts (acoustic and optic radiation), and the maturation of these motor and association tracts consistently correlate with infants' comprehension of gesture-based phrases. Second, these rapidly maturing association tracts correlate with nearly all developmental domains, including motor skill, social interaction, emotional regulation, living skill, and speech. Conversely, complex speech behaviors correlate broadly across nearly all examined tracts, underscoring extensive neural integration characterized by nonlinear mappings between neural substrates and developmental outcomes. Third, exploratory longitudinal mediation analyses suggest an asymmetric loop of communicative interactions in early infancy: gross-motor skill indirectly facilitates speech development through enhanced social interactions; while social interaction facilitates speech development by refining fine-motor skill. Collectively, these findings highlight motor development as a major developmental driver in early infancy and advocate an integrative, experience-dependent, and dynamic model of early speech acquisition. This study points to future research avenues focused on elucidating how social interactions function as a pivotal catalyst, aligning infants' neural and behavioral development --- from spontaneous, undifferentiated actions toward socially adaptive behaviors.

">Advanced neural activity mapping in brain organoids via field potential imaging with ultra-high-density CMOS microelectrodes.</a></h4>

              
                Human iPSC-derived brain organoids and assembloids have emerged as promising in vitro models for recapitulating human brain development, neurological disorders, and drug responses. However, detailed analysis of their electrophysiological properties requires advanced measurement techniques. Here, we present a novel analytical approach utilizing ultra-high-density (UHD) CMOS microelectrode arrays (MEAs) containing 236,880 electrodes (10.52m x 10.52m each) distributed over a broad sensing area of 32.45mm 2 for field potential imaging (FPI) of brain organoids. Neuronal activity was recorded simultaneously from over 46,000 electrodes interfaced with brain organoids, allowing for the identification of single-cell firing events and the assessment of neuronal network connectivity based on individual spikes. In midbrain organoids, administration of L-DOPA revealed both excitatory and inhibitory cellular responses, with a dose-dependent increase in the proportion of excitatory responses, suggesting enhanced network connectivity. Capitalizing on the spatial and temporal resolution of UHD-CMOS-MEAs, we introduced new endpoints for network activity: propagation speed and propagation area. In cortical organoids, application of the GABA A receptor antagonist picrotoxin led to increased propagation speed, whereas the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 resulted in a broad reduction of propagation area, along with localized increases. As FPI enables direct recording of electrical potential waveforms, frequency-domain analyses were also conducted. Spontaneous activity in cortical organoids exhibited region-specific frequency distributions, with gamma-band activity displaying distinct patterns compared to other frequency bands. Additionally, in midbrain-striatal assembloids, electrophysiological activity was observed in both regions. Connectivity analysis showed that treatment with 4-aminopyridine enhanced inter-organoid connection strength. This large-scale, single-cell-resolved recording approach using UHD-CMOS-MEAs facilitates comprehensive analysis of network connectivity, propagation velocity and propagation area, and frequency characteristics. It represents a powerful platform for advancing our understanding of the electrophysiological functions of brain organoids and assembloids, and holds significant potential for drug screening and disease modeling in human neuroscience research.

                Paulsen et al. demonstrate that multiple KSHV miRNAs suppress STING expression to evade innate immunity. Deletion of these miRNAs restores STING-dependent innate immunity, delaying KSHV lytic reactivation from latency. This study discovers a mechanism of viral immune evasion through miRNA-mediated regulation of the cGAS/STING pathway.

">A Forebrain Hub for Cautious Actions via the Midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive goal-directed behavior requires dynamic coordination of movement, motivation, and environmental cues. Among these, cautious actions, where animals adjust their behavior in anticipation of predictable threats, are essential for survival. Yet, their underlying neural mechanisms remain less well understood than those of appetitive behaviors. Using calcium imaging in freely moving mice, we show that glutamatergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are robustly engaged during cue-evoked avoidance and exploratory behavior, encoding both contraversive movement and cautious responding. Targeted lesions and optogenetic manipulations reveal that STN projections to the midbrain, but not to the globus pallidus, are necessary for executing cued avoidance. Moreover, the frequency of STN activation governs response timing, accelerating the initiation of goal-directed actions to the point that it becomes incompatible with passive response, without being aversive. These findings identify a critical role for the STN in orchestrating adaptive goal-directed behavior by directing timely actions via its midbrain projections.

">Transcriptional and functional profiles of muscarinic receptor-expressing neurons in primate lateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices</a></h4>

              
                Our data revealed that mAChR gene enrichment in ACC and LPFC are associated with between-region transcriptional differences in synapse plasticity pathways that aligned with functional experiments. The relative upregulation of genes promoting synapse formation in CHRM+ ExNs and more pronounced cholinergic suppression of excitatory synaptic currents in ACC, suggests a role of ACh for filtering and enhancing signal-to-noise (gain) of inputs, which can be at play during ACC-mediated tasks requiring high cognitive demand. Concomitantly, cholinergic increase in E:I ratio in LPFC may support working memory representations. The role of ACh in gain modulation has been observed in macaque primary visual cortex, rodent prefrontal and olfactory cortices, and medial temporal lobe areas. Our findings support the role of ACh as a modulator of synapse plasticity and E:I circuit dynamics within ACC and LPFC, which can endow flexibility for the processing of signals depending on the cholinergic tone and cell-specific activation of distinct muscarinic receptors.

                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to play a central role in human social perception, cognition, and behavior. In adults, the mPFC is involved in representing and interpreting the mental states in self and others. Developmental research using neuroimaging techniques like functional near-infrared spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging has begun to extend these findings into infancy. Novel evidence reviewed in this opinion demonstrates that infant mPFC (1) plays a specialized, proactive, and evaluative role in social perception, (2) is involved in connecting with other minds while interacting and when watching other minds interact, and (3) predicts overt social behavior beyond infancy. These findings suggest that, from early in human ontogeny, the mPFC plays a multifaceted role in social perception, cognition, and behavior.</p>

                Background The Thai version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI) has been verified among a variety of populations. However, there is a lack of existing research on its comprehensive psychometric properties, specifically when used with nursing students. This study examined the WHOQOL-BREF’s unique psychometric features with Thai nursing students in northeast Thailand. Methods In this cross-sectional study, Thai nursing students were recruited using multi-stage simple random sampling from universities located in the northeast of Thailand. The data was collected via self-assessment questionnaires, and the 3,570 participants were then randomly split into two subsamples (group 1, n=2,000, and group 2, n=1,570). After reducing the number of items using statistical methods, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was carried out on group 1 to explore the factor structure of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Finally, group 2 was used in a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the EFA’s modified structure along with an assessment of the construct validity of the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI. Results Principal component analysis on a random subsample supported a four-factor model with 24 items, originally suggested for factorial construct validity; these 24 items were distributed across the original four domain. The domain structure for the purpose showed a good fit in the CFA on the other subsample. Internal reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach’s alpha was greater than 0.70) for both the total scale and subscales. In terms of convergent validity, average variance extracted (AVE) revealed that all WHOQOL-BREF-THAI subscales achieved convergence, with AVE values ranging from 0.50 to 0.69. Conclusion These results reveal that the WHOQOL-BREF-THAI is a valid and reliable tool which health care providers can utilize to measure QOL among Thai nursing students. Therefore, the WHOQOL-BREF can serve as an essential tool for researching the factors influencing nursing students’ QOL, with implications for nursing education.

                Background This study explores the complex relationship between organizational politics, emotional intelligence and employee behavior in contemporary settings. Organizational politics, which is widespread in organizational settings, has a substantial impact on different aspects of employee behavior. Emotional Intelligence has become a vital factor in individuals’ capacity to successfully traverse the complexities of an organization. This study consolidates current material to offer insights into the impact of organizational politics on employee behavior and the mediating role of emotional intelligence in this connection. Methods A survey was undertaken with a sample size of 500 employees hailing from several Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) firms in the Dehradun (Uttarakhand) region. The study employed quantitative methodologies to investigate the correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics and Employee Behavior. The data were evaluated using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the hypothesized correlations and mediation effects. Results The study identified substantial correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics, and Employee Behavior. Emotional Intelligence was discovered to have a positive impact on Behavioral Dynamics. Perceived Organizational Politics had a substantial influence on both Emotional Intelligence and Behavioral Dynamics. Factors such as Need for Power, Relationship Conflict, Resource Constraints, Role Conflict, and Workforce Diversity were discovered to have an impact on Perceived Organizational Politics. Conclusions The results confirm strong connections between organizational politics, emotional intelligence, and employee behavior, highlighting the significance of these concepts in comprehending employee behavior in organizational environments. The study proposes that enhancing employees' emotional intelligence can alleviate the adverse effects of organizational politics, resulting in enhanced behavioral dynamics. The study also addresses the limits, outlines potential areas for further research, and highlights the managerial implications. It suggests that firms should prioritize the development of emotional intelligence to cultivate a favorable work environment.

                <p>by Yuxiang Zhan, Francesco Musella, Frank Alber</p>

The genome is organized into distinct chromatin compartments with at least two main classes, a transcriptionally active A and an inactive B compartment, broadly corresponding to euchromatin and heterochromatin. Chromatin regions within the same compartment preferentially interact with each other over regions in the opposite compartment. A/B compartments are traditionally identified from ensemble Hi-C contact frequency matrices using principal component analysis of their covariance matrices. However, defining compartments at the single-cell level from sparse single-cell Hi-C data is challenging, especially since homologous copies are often not resolved. To address this, we present MaxComp, an unsupervised method, for inferring single-cell A/B compartments based on 3D geometric considerations in single-cell chromosome structures—derived either from multiplexed FISH-omics imaging or 3D structure models derived from Hi-C data. By representing each 3D chromosome structure as an undirected graph with edge-weights encoding structural information, MaxComp reformulates compartment prediction as a variant of the Max-cut problem, solved using semidefinite graph programming (SPD) to optimally partition the graph into two structural compartments. Our results show that the population average of MaxComp single-cell compartment annotations closely matches those derived from ensemble Hi-C principal component analysis, demonstrating that compartmentalization can be recovered from geometric principles alone, using only the 3D coordinates and nuclear microenvironment of chromatin regions. Our approach reveals widespread cell-to-cell variability in compartment organization, with substantial heterogeneity across genomic loci. When applied to multiplexed FISH imaging data, MaxComp also uncovers relationships between compartment annotations and transcriptional activity at the single-cell level. In summary, MaxComp offers a new framework for understanding chromatin compartmentalization in single cells, connecting 3D genome architecture, and transcriptional activity with the cell-to-cell variations of chromatin compartments.

                <p>by Owen M. O’Connor, Mary J. Dunlop</p>

Deep learning-based methods for identifying and tracking cells within microscopy images have revolutionized the speed and throughput of data analysis. These methods for analyzing biological and medical data have capitalized on advances from the broader computer vision field. However, cell tracking can present unique challenges, with frequent cell division events and the need to track many objects with similar visual appearances complicating analysis. Existing architectures developed for cell tracking based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have tended to fall short in managing the spatial and global contextual dependencies that are crucial for tracking cells. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Cell-TRACTR (Transformer with Attention for Cell Tracking and Recognition), a novel deep learning model that uses a transformer-based architecture. Cell-TRACTR operates in an end-to-end manner, simultaneously segmenting and tracking cells without the need for post-processing. Alongside this model, we introduce the Cell-HOTA metric, an extension of the Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) metric that we adapted to assess cell division. Cell-HOTA differs from standard cell tracking metrics by offering a balanced and easily interpretable assessment of detection, association, and division accuracy. We test our Cell-TRACTR model on datasets of bacteria growing within a defined microfluidic geometry and mammalian cells growing freely in two dimensions. Our results demonstrate that Cell-TRACTR exhibits strong performance in tracking and division accuracy compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, while also meeting traditional benchmarks in detection accuracy. This work establishes a new framework for employing transformer-based models in cell segmentation and tracking.

                <p>by Tong Liu, Zihuan Liu, Wenke Sun, Adeethyia Shankar, Yongzhong Zhao, Xiaodi Wang</p>

Wavelet analysis has been recognized as a widely used and promising tool in the fields of signal processing and data analysis. However, the application of wavelet-based method in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is little known. Here, we present M-band wavelet-based scRNA-seq multi-view clustering of cells (WMC). We applied for integration of M-band wavelet analysis and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to a panel of single cell sequencing datasets by breaking up the data matrix into an approximation or low resolution component and <i>M</i>–1 detail or high resolution components. Our method is armed with multi-view clustering of cell types, identity, and functional states, enabling missing cell types visualization and new cell types discovery. Distinct to standard scRNA-seq workflow, our wavelet-based approach is a new addition to uncover rare cell types with a fine resolution.

                <p>by Joseph James Tharayil, Jorge Blanco Alonso, Silvia Farcito, Bryn Lloyd, Armando Romani, Elvis Boci, Antonino Cassara, Felix Schürmann, Esra Neufeld, Niels Kuster, Michael Reimann</p>

As the size and complexity of network simulations accessible to computational neuroscience grows, new avenues open for research into extracellularly recorded electric signals. Biophysically detailed simulations permit the identification of the biological origins of the different components of recorded signals, the evaluation of signal sensitivity to different anatomical, physiological, and geometric factors, and selection of recording parameters to maximize the signal information content. Simultaneously, virtual extracellular signals produced by these networks may become important metrics for neuro-simulation validation. To enable efficient calculation of extracellular signals from large neural network simulations, we have developed <i>BlueRecording</i>, a pipeline consisting of standalone Python code, along with extensions to the Neurodamus simulation control application, the CoreNEURON computation engine, and the SONATA data format, to permit online calculation of such signals. In particular, we implement a general form of the reciprocity theorem, which is capable of handling non-dipolar current sources, such as may be found in long axons and recordings close to the current source, as well as complex tissue anatomy, dielectric heterogeneity, and electrode geometries. To our knowledge, this is the first application of this generalized (i.e., non-dipolar) reciprocity-based approach to simulate EEG recordings. We use these tools to calculate extracellular signals from an <i>in silico</i> model of the rat somatosensory cortex and hippocampus and to study signal contribution differences between regions and cell types.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003189">Predictable motion is progressively extrapolated across temporally distinct processing stages in the human visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William Turner, Charlie Sexton, Philippa A. Johnson, Ella Wilson, Hinze Hogendoorn</p>

Neural processing of sensory information takes time. Consequently, to estimate the current state of the world, the brain must rely on predictive processes—for example, extrapolating the motion of a ball to determine its probable present position. Some evidence implicates early (pre-cortical) processing in extrapolation, but it remains unclear whether extrapolation continues during later-stage (cortical) processing, where further delays accumulate. Moreover, the majority of such evidence relies on invasive neurophysiological techniques in animals, with accurate characterization of extrapolation effects in the human brain currently lacking. Here, we address these issues by demonstrating how precise probabilistic maps can be constructed from human EEG recordings. Participants (<i>N</i> = 18, two sessions) viewed a stimulus moving along a circular trajectory while EEG was recorded. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification, we extracted maps of stimulus location over time and found evidence of a forwards temporal shift occurring across temporally distinct processing stages. This accelerated emergence of position representations indicates extrapolation occurring at multiple stages of processing, with representations progressively shifted closer to real-time. We further show evidence of representational overshoot during early-stage processing following unexpected changes to an object’s trajectory, and demonstrate that the observed dynamics can emerge without supervision in a simulated neural network via spike-timing-dependent plasticity.

                Background Stroke survivors, particularly those of working age, are at an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one–five years of the initial event, largely due to suboptimal management of risk factors. This study aimed to identify lifestyle and occupational factors associated with recurrent stroke in this demographic population. Methods This case-control study included 100 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke and 200 ischemic stroke survivors without recurrence, who were recruited from the hospital database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant factors associated with recurrence, which were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The mean age was 45.4 years (SD = 15.1) among cases and 50.6 years (SD = 6.5) among controls. The male-to-female ratios were 1.17:1 and 1.94:1 in the case and control groups, respectively. Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke included female sex (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI [1.10–3.29]), high fasting blood sugar (aOR: 3.70; 95% CI [1.66–8.27]), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 3.63; 95% CI [2.01–6.54]), sedentary lifestyle (aOR: 2.77; 95% CI [1.50–5.13]), and lack of workplace support for health (aOR: 2.02; 95% CI [1.13–3.63]). The associations between these factors and stroke recurrence varied according to the age group. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of modifiable lifestyle and occupational factors in stroke recurrence among working-age adults. Tailored age-specific prevention strategies—emphasizing physical activity, reduced alcohol use, and improved workplace health environments—may reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance health outcomes in this population.

                The alpine tree frog (Litoria verreauxii alpina) is a threatened species found only above 1,200 meters within the Australian Alps. This species’ distribution has been severely limited due to the pathogentic amphibian chytrid fungus, and current populations persist by recruitment. Here, we provide the first publicly available genome for the genus. We used PacBio HiFi reads as well as Omni-C scaffolding data to construct a high-quality genome. We also generated a reproduction focused transcriptome from brain, liver, and gonad tissues. The genome was 2.77 Gb in length and consisted of 962 contigs with a contig N50 of 37.2 Mb and an L50 of 19. This study provides the first publicly available reference genome for the Litoria genus to assist in conservation and reproduction focused works in amphibian management.

                This study explores the dynamics of mobile genetic elements in the infant gut after cesarean birth. Fernández-Pato et al. show that early infant gut mobilome is highly individual-specific and shaped by feeding mode. Antibiotic exposure at birth has minimal effect, and early mother–infant strain-sharing is rarely detected.

                Demeshkina and Ferré-D'Amaré purify stress granule cores from yeast and mammalian cells. These cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins are a conserved response of eukaryotic cells to stressors; their dysregulation is linked to diseases. These large-scale purifications enabled detailed proteomic and transcriptomic analyses that lay bare the complexity and heterogeneity of the particles.

However, such overt reporting has limitations, leading to research on physiological signals that disclose consciousness without relying on overt behaviour. In this Review, Kronemer, Bandettini and Gonzalez-Castillo explore such covert measures of consciousness in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92757">Commissureless acts as a substrate adapter in a conserved Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase pathway to promote axon growth across the midline</a></h4>

              
                In both vertebrates and invertebrates, commissural neurons prevent premature responsiveness to the midline repellant Slit by downregulating surface levels of its receptor Roundabout1 (Robo1). In <i>Drosophila</i>, Commissureless (Comm) plays a critical role in this process; however, there is conflicting data on the underlying molecular mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved PY motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of Comm are required allow the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of Robo1. Disruption of these motifs prevents Comm from localizing to Lamp1 positive late endosomes and to promote axon growth across the midline in vivo. In addition, we conclusively demonstrate a role for Nedd4 in midline crossing. Genetic analysis shows that <i>nedd4</i> mutations result in midline crossing defects in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic nerve cord, which can be rescued by introduction of exogenous Nedd4. Biochemical evidence shows that Nedd4 incorporates into a three-member complex with Comm and Robo1 in a PY motif-dependent manner. Finally, we present genetic evidence that Nedd4 acts with Comm in the embryonic nerve cord to downregulate Robo1 levels. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Comm promotes midline crossing in the nerve cord by facilitating Robo1 ubiquitination by Nedd4, ultimately leading to its degradation.

">A phase-based mechanism of attentional selection in the auditory system</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual targets are often easier to detect and process if they occur at a predictable time. This perceptual benefit of temporal predictability suggests that neural resources are allocated to specific moments predicted to be most informative, or away from those predicted to be distracting. The sensitivity to sensory information changes with the phase of neural oscillations. An alignment of oscillatory phase according to the predicted time and relevance of expected events has therefore been proposed as a mechanism underlying attentional selection. This hypothesis predicts that opposite phases are aligned to relevant and distracting events so that the former are amplified and the latter suppressed, but such an effect remained to be demonstrated. We presented 25 human participants with acoustic stimuli that occurred at a predictable or unpredictable time during a pitch-discrimination task. Temporal predictability did not only lead to faster reaction times, but it also aligned the phase of beta oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in anticipation of the stimulus. Crucially, the aligned phase was opposite, depending on whether the stimulus was relevant or a distractor for the task. Single-trial deviations from the mean aligned phases slowed down behavioural responses, demonstrating functional significance of the observed neural effects. All effects occurred in the absence of rhythmic stimulation, an important but rarely tested criterion to rule out spurious phase alignment from preceding events in a stimulus sequence. We therefore conclude that the alignment of oscillatory phase underlies the selection of sensory information in time. We speculate that beta oscillations allocate neural resources in networks comprising auditory and sensorimotor regions to the expected time of auditory information, facilitating behavioural responses to upcoming events.

">AMPA receptor activation within the prelimbic cortex is necessary for incubated cocaine-craving</a></h4>

              
                The incubation of craving is a behavioral phenomenon in which cue-elicited craving increases during a period of drug abstinence. Incubated cocaine-craving is associated with increased extracellular glutamate within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and this release, particularly within the prelimbic (PL) subregion, is necessary for incubated cocaine-craving. A potential candidate mediating these incubation-driving effects of glutamate release within the PL are alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. To investigate the role of mPFC AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in incubated craving, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 6 h/day for 10 consecutive days. Either during early or later withdrawal, rats were infused intra-PL with the AMPAR antagonist NBQX (0 or 1 {nu}g/0.5 {nu}l per side), followed by 30-min tests for cue-induced responding. Immunoblotting was also conducted to relate the expression of incubated cocaine- and sucrose-craving to AMPAR subunit expression within mPFC subregions. Intra-PL NBQX blocked incubated craving expressed in late, but not early, withdrawal. No incubation-related changes in AMPAR subunit expression were detected within the PL or IL of rats of either sex and no estrus-associated changes in subunit expression were detected in female rats exhibiting incubated cocaine-craving. In contrast, elevated GluA1 expression was observed within the IL of male rats exhibiting an incubation of sucrose-craving. Together, these findings indicate a necessary role for AMPARs within the PL in driving incubated cocaine-craving and suggest that AMPARs located within the IL may be involved also in sucrose-craving selectively in males.

">The representation of facial emotion expands from sensory to prefrontal cortex with development</a></h4>

              
                Facial expression recognition develops rapidly during infancy and improves from childhood to adulthood. As a critical component of social communication, this skill enables individuals to interpret others emotions and intentions. However, the brain mechanisms driving the development of this skill remain largely unclear due to the difficulty of obtaining data with both high spatial and temporal resolution from young children. By analyzing intracranial EEG data collected from childhood (5-10 years old) and post-childhood groups (13-55 years old), we find differential involvement of high-level brain areas in processing facial expression information. For the post-childhood group, both the posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) encode facial emotion features from a high-dimensional, continuous space. However, in children, the facial expression information is only significantly represented in the pSTC, not in the DLPFC. Further, the encoding of complex emotions in pSTC is shown to increase with age. Taken together, these data suggest that young children rely more on low-level sensory areas than on the prefrontal cortex for facial emotion processing, leading us to hypothesize that top-down modulation from prefrontal cortex to pSTC gradually matures during development to enable a full understanding of facial emotions, especially complex emotions which need social and life experience to comprehend.

                The human cerebellar cortex contains the highest density and number of neurons in the human brain, yet this thin and tightly-folded structure has remained largely inaccessible to in-vivo imaging. We introduce an imaging framework to enable high-resolution, comprehensive imaging of the human cerebellar cortex. We validated the in-vivo estimates of cortical morphology against post-mortem measures. Crucially, our findings challenge the commonly held view of the cerebellar cortex as being uniform. Our findings reveal interlobular heterogeneity in both cortical morphology and vascular organization. We demonstrate that this spatial heterogeneity correlates with granular layer cell density. This convergence of morphology, cytoarchitecture and vascularization offers new mechanistic insights and reframes how cerebellar structure and function should be interpreted in health and disease.

">Socio-emotional difficulties observed in alexithymia reflect altered interactions of the semantic and monoaminergic neuromodulatory brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Alexithymia is a multidimensional construct characterized by difficulties in identifying and describing feelings and reduced ability to engage in abstract thinking. Although often co-occurring with other psychological and neurodevelopmental conditions such as anxiety, depression and autism spectrum disorders, alexithymia is believed to be associated with unique alterations within the socio-emotional brain networks. With the semantic and neuromodulatory brainstem systems playing a key role in social and affective cognition, the current work aimed to study their contributions to alexithymia in unprecedented detail. First, we attempted to identify resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the social semantic hubs (superior anterior temporal lobe) and monoamine-producing regions (dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus) linked to each alexithymia domain. Secondly, by deploying tractography and graph analysis of the associated structural network, we intended to identify their potential anatomical correlates. Alexithymia was strongly associated with dysconnectivity within the semantic network, and altered functional connectivity between the neuromodulatory brainstem regions and cortical areas crucial for social cognition and emotion regulation, including medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. On the anatomical level, these findings were paralleled by negative links with network modularity, suggestive of less specialised neural processing, and decreased clustering coefficient of the semantic node in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Despite observing associations with trait-anxiety and emotion suppression for some of the highlighted findings, these phenomena did not mediate the effects of alexithymia. Therefore, the current work highlights the existence of functional and structural alterations within socio-emotional networks as neural markers of alexithymia.

">Multiscale Entropy of Resting-State fMRI Signals Reveals Differences in Brain Complexity in Autism</a></h4>

              
                Background: Atypical intrinsic brain activity has been widely observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet the temporal complexity of these neural signals remains underexplored. This study aimed to characterise differences in resting-state brain signal complexity between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls using multiscale entropy (MSE). Methods: Resting-state fMRI data were obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I), a large multi-site dataset including 397 participants (179 with ASC, 218 neurotypical controls; ASD: Mean age 16.43 years old, SD 7.17 years old; CON: Mean age 15.75 years old, SD 5.67 years old). Voxel-wise multiscale entropy (MSE) features were extracted across multiple temporal scales. Group comparisons were conducted using voxel-wise t-tests and mixed-effects models to identify region- and scale-specific alterations in brain signal complexity. Results: Individuals with ASD showed reduced MSE in prefrontal regions at coarser time scales and elevated MSE in posterior midline regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, at finer scales, followed by a decline across coarser scales. This pattern suggests a shift toward uncorrelated randomness in posterior regions and reduced long-range complexity in frontal areas. No significant associations were found between MSE features and ADOS scores. Conclusions: These findings reveal spatially and temporally specific alterations in brain signal complexity in ASD, particularly within the default mode network. Multiscale entropy provides a complementary approach to traditional connectivity and single-scale entropy analyses, offering novel insights into the organisation of intrinsic brain activity in neurodevelopmental conditions.

">Identification and optimization of trans-species reactive TfR1-binding VHH as tools for drug delivery across the blood brain barrier</a></h4>

              
                The treatment of brain diseases is hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a major obstacle for efficient brain exposure of therapeutic agents, in particular biotherapeutics. Different strategies are currently evaluated to enhance drug delivery across the BBB, among which the development of vector molecules that target specific receptors expressed by BBB endothelial cells and involved in receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). In this process, therapeutic cargos conjugated to optimized molecular vectors can undergo trans-endothelial transport and delivery in the brain parenchyma. The transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is enriched in brain endothelial cells and is one of the most studied receptors for drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). Several antibodies and molecules derived thereof that target TfR1 have been developed, but few display trans-species reactivity, hindering preclinical or clinical development. In the present study, we selected and characterized cross-species reactive Variable domain of Heavy chain only antibody from camelids (VHH), and in particular the C5 and B8, that bind rodent, rhesus monkey and human TfR1. When fused to a human Immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) Fc region, the C5 or B8 monomers or homodimers were up taken by engineered CHO cells expressing the rodent, human and rhesus monkey TfR1, and by rodent or human brain endothelial cells. Key human TfR1 amino-acid residues of the C5 and B8 epitopes were identified based on the generation of human TfR1 mutants. Assessment of their functional binding revealed an original binding region at the interface of the TfR1 dimer. Following systemic injection in mice of VHH-Fc fusions displaying different properties in terms of affinity and avidity toward TfR1, we demonstrated improved brain uptake compared to control molecules encompassing an irrelevant VHH. Brain delivery efficiency of the parental and optimized VHHTfR1 was further demonstrated using Neurotensin (NT)-induced hypothermia as a read-out in wild-type mice and in B-hTfR transgenic mice expressing the human TfR1 ectodomain. We established in vitro-in vivo correlations between the human TfR1 binding properties determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of VHH-NT affinity variants, and their potential to induce hypothermia in B-hTfR mice. We identified key human TfR1 binding parameters leading to efficient BBB transcytosis i.e: a rapid dissociation rate and intermediate affinity. Some of the C5 and B8 variants we engineered presented promising cross-species reactivity towards the murine but also rhesus monkey TfR1. We also generated variants with very similar human-rhesus monkey TfR1 binding properties and optimal affinities for TfR1-dependant transcytosis. These VHH could be further developed as molecular shuttles for the transport of imaging or therapeutic agents, including biomolecules, across the rodent, non-human primate and human BBB, allowing straightforward preclinical to clinical translation.

">Common pitfalls during model specification in psychophysiological interaction analysis</a></h4>

              
                Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis is a widely used regression method in functional neuroimaging for capturing task-dependent changes in connectivity from a seed region. The present work identifies, and provides corrections for, common methodological pitfalls in PPI analysis that compromise model validity. Firstly, if the seed time series is extracted with prewhitening, the temporal structure of the signal is altered and subsequent deconvolution of prewhitened data becomes suboptimal. Furthermore, prewhitening again during model fitting results in double prewhitening of the seed regressor. Secondly, a failure to mean-centre the task regressor when calculating the interaction term can also lead to model misspecification and potentially spurious inferences. By using simulations and empirical language fMRI data from the Australian Epilepsy Project, we demonstrate the adverse effects of these issues, and how they are resolved when corrected. A systematic review of current practices revealed widespread model misspecification, and underreporting of methods, in published PPI studies. We provide clearer reporting guidelines, and advocate for appropriate methods for handling of prewhitening and mean-centring to ensure the validity of PPI analyses.

">The Drosophila wing is a high-throughput and versatile screening tool for Tau-mediated disease mechanisms and drug discovery.</a></h4>

              
                Tau protein contributes to microtubule stability, which is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies. In these diseases, Tau molecules become hyperphosphorylated, misfolded and aggregated, propagating pathology across the brain. Studies dissecting disease mechanisms or screening disease-modifying therapies rely on animal models that unveil pathogenic events in vivo but also take several weeks or months to complete. Here we describe a versatile experimental paradigm that yields results in days and yet offers all the advantages of a genetically tractable in vivo system: the Drosophila wing disc. Mimicking neurotoxicity, human Tau expression causes cell death in the wing disc leading to quantifiable phenotypes in the adult wing. The neuroprotective peptide NAP ameliorates Tau toxicity in this system, validating it as a cost-effective drug screening tool. Phenocopying adult neurons, Tau toxicity in the wing disc is exacerbated by simulating hyper-phosphorylation and prevented by suppressing aggregation. Additionally, we show that the wing disc can dissect disease mechanisms that underpin clinically relevant Tau variants. Thus, the wing disc offers an in vivo experimental paradigm for fast and efficient exploration of disease mechanism and screening.

">Tau Oligomerization Drives Neurodegeneration via Nuclear Membrane Invagination and Lamin B Receptor Binding in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                The microtubule-associated protein tau aggregates into oligomeric complexes that highly correlate with Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Increasing evidence suggests that nuclear membrane disruption occurs in AD and related tauopathies, but whether this is a cause or consequence of neurodegeneration remains unclear. Using the optogenetically inducible 4R1N Tau::mCherry::Cry2Olig (optoTau) system in iPSC-derived neurons, we demonstrate that tau oligomerization triggers nuclear rupture and nuclear membrane invagination. Pathological tau accumulates at sites of invagination, inducing structural abnormalities in the nuclear envelope and piercing into the nuclear space. These findings were confirmed in the humanized P301S tau (PS19) transgenic mouse model, where nuclear envelope disruption appeared as an early-onset event preceding neurodegeneration. Further validation in post-mortem AD brain tissues revealed nuclear lamina disruption correlating with pathological tau emergence in early-stage patients. Notably, electron microscopy shows that tau-induced nuclear invagination triggers global chromatin reorganization, potentially driving aberrant gene expression and protein translation associated with AD. These findings suggest that nuclear membrane disruption is an early and possibly causative event in tau-mediated neurodegeneration, establishing a mechanistic link between tau oligomerization and nuclear stress. Further investigation into nuclear destabilization could inform clinical strategies for mitigating AD pathogenesis.

">Prelimbic cortical excitatory overdrive and inhibitory underdrive accompany environmental suppression of food seeking</a></h4>

              
                Cues associated with food, such as fast-food advertising, can provoke food cravings and may lead to unhealthy overeating. Environmental enrichment (EE) that enhances cognitive and physical stimulation can reduce cue-evoked sucrose seeking in mice and recruitment of sucrose cue-reactive neurons or 'neuronal ensembles' in the prelimbic cortex (PL), which regulates appetitive behaviors. Hence, EE provides us with a behavioral model and neuronal targets to identify 'anti-craving' relevant mechanisms. Here, we investigated in the PL how EE modulated neuronal excitability and activity patterns in cue-reactive neuronal populations. Chemogenetic inhibition of cue-reactive neurons in PL blocked cue-evoked sucrose seeking, thereby confirming the function of these neurons in sucrose cue memory. EE boosted the baseline excitability of 'originally', or before EE exposure, cue-reactive, excitatory pyramidal cells in PL. Furthermore, their sucrose cue-specificity was lost resulting in their persistent activation and non-cue selective activation or 'excitatory overdrive'. Furthermore, EE reduced recruitment of cue-reactive, inhibitory interneurons reflecting 'inhibitory underdrive'. Taken together, impaired neuronal food cue processing due to simultaneous prefrontal cortical excitatory 'overdrive' and inhibitory 'underdrive' likely underlies EE's anti-craving action, thereby serving as potential neurophysiological targets to develop novel medications that help control food cravings.

">A complex acoustical environment is necessary for maintenance and development in the zebra finch auditory pallium</a></h4>

              
                Postnatal experience is critical to auditory development in vertebrates. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia castanotis) provides a valuable model for understanding how complex social-acoustical environments influence development of the neural circuits that support perception of vocal communication signals. We previously showed that zebra finches raised in the rich acoustical environment of a breeding colony (colony-reared, CR) perform twice as well in an operant discrimination task as birds raised with only their families (pair-reared, PR), and we identified deficits in functional properties within the auditory pallium of PR birds that could explain this behavioral difference. Here, using single-unit extracellular recordings from the L3 subdivision of field L and caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) at three developmental timepoints (18--20, 30--35, and 90--110 days post hatch), we tracked how experience affects the emergence of these functional properties. Whereas CR birds showed stable single-unit response properties from fledging to adulthood alongside improvements in population-level encoding, PR birds exhibited progressive deterioration in neural function. Deficits in PR birds began emerging at 18 days for population metrics and by 30 days for single-unit properties, worsening into adulthood. These included altered spike waveforms, firing rates, selectivity, discriminability, coding efficiency, and noise invariance. Notably, these deficits occurred despite PR birds receiving normal exposure to the song of a male tutor, suggesting that learning to sing is robust enough to compensate for impaired auditory processing. Our findings demonstrate that a complex acoustical environment is necessary for both maintenance and development of the cortical-level auditory circuits that decode conspecific vocalizations.

">GABAergic signaling by VIP interneurons gates running-dependent visual recovery in the adult brain</a></h4>

              
                Experience-dependent plasticity in the adult visual cortex is enhanced by locomotion, a process mediated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. While VIP interneurons are known to signal through both Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and VIP peptide, the specific contributions of these pathways during different forms of plasticity remain unclear. Monocular deprivation (MD) in adult mice alters cortical responses, though more slowly and differently than during a critical period in early life. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging in awake adult mice to dissect the roles of VIP and GABA release from VIP interneurons during adult MD and subsequent binocular recovery. We found comparable level of ocular dominance shifts after MD in mice deficient in either peptidergic or GABA signaling, but disrupting GABA signaling impaired recovery of binocular responses. We also showed that running preferentially enhances contralateral eye responses in binocular primary visual cortex. However, this eye-specific modulation of visual responses by running was altered during recovery from MD and was dependent on VIP signaling pathways. These findings highlight the GABA-mediated inhibition by VIP interneurons as a critical pathway for promoting visual restoration in the adult brain.

">Early Indirect Neurogenesis transitions to late Direct Neurogenesis in mouse cerebral cortex development</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex must contain the appropriate numbers of neurons in each layer to acquire its proper functional organization. Accordingly, neurogenesis requires precise regulation along development. Cortical neurons are made either directly by Radial Glia Cells (RGCs) that self-consume, or indirectly from RGCs via Intermediate Progenitor Cells (IPCs) and largely preserving the RGC pool. According to the standing model of cortical development, Direct Neurogenesis predominates at early stages of development, and progressively shifts to Indirect Neurogenesis, which predominates at late stages. However, neurogenesis at early stages should be compatible with RGC amplification, and neurogenesis at late stages needs to involve RGC consumption, which seems in conflict with the standing model. Here we studied the modes of neurogenesis along cortical development using multiple approaches, including birthdating, live imaging and MADM clone labeling. Contrary to the established dogma, our data show that Indirect Neurogenesis clearly predominates at early developmental stages, gradually shifting to Direct Neurogenesis at late stages. These findings challenge the current model of cortical neurogenesis, and prompt a re-evaluation of previous and ongoing work about the genetic and molecular mechanisms regulating this process.

">A two-dimensional space of linguistic representations shared across individuals</a></h4>

              
                Our ability to extract meaning from linguistic inputs and package ideas into word sequences is supported by a network of left-hemisphere frontal and temporal brain areas. Despite extensive research, previous attempts to discover differences among these language areas have not revealed clear dissociations or spatial organization. All areas respond similarly during controlled linguistic experiments as well as during naturalistic language comprehension. To search for finer-grained organizational principles of language processing, we applied data-driven decomposition methods to ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI responses from eight participants listening to 200 linguistically diverse sentences. Using a cross-validation procedure that identifies shared structure across individuals, we find that two components successfully generalize across participants, together accounting for about 32% of the explainable variance in brain responses to sentences. The first component corresponds to processing difficulty, and the second--to meaning abstractness; we formally support this interpretation through targeted behavioral experiments and information-theoretic measures. Furthermore, we find that the two components are systematically organized within frontal and temporal language areas, with the meaning-abstractness component more prominent in the temporal regions. These findings reveal an interpretable, low-dimensional, spatially structured representational basis for language processing, and advance our understanding of linguistic representations at a detailed, fine-scale organizational level.

">The shape of attention: How cognitive goals sculpt cortical representation of speech.</a></h4>

              
                Perception requires more than passive sensing--it involves prioritizing the features most relevant to ongoing cognitive goals, a process guided by selective attention. A central question is whether attention operates by enhancing all features of a selected target, or by optimizing neural encoding around the specific demands of the task--i.e., is selective attention fundamentally anchored around task targets or around task goals? Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed two speech tasks--comprehension and detection--on identical auditory stimuli. Task difficulty was manipulated by introducing controlled background noise that increased cognitive demands without reducing speech intelligibility. We developed a novel EEG-based method, the Modulation Response Function (MRF), which captures cortical sensitivity to spectro-temporal features via spectrogram reconstruction. Behaviorally, comprehension performance declined with increased difficulty, with greater reliance on semantic cues, while detection performance remained near ceiling. Neurally, both envelope tracking and MRF magnitude were higher during comprehension, reflecting greater cognitive engagement. Critically, spectro-temporal tuning differed across tasks: formant-related modulations were selectively enhanced during comprehension, whereas pitch-related modulations were emphasized during detection. These findings support a discriminative model of attention, where cortical encoding is flexibly reshaped according to cognitive goals, selectively amplifying the features most relevant for successful task performance.

">Diencephalic and white matter knock-on effects in hippocampal amnesia - why they matter</a></h4>

              
                Studies of brain-behaviour relationships in hippocampal amnesia largely ignore the presence and explanatory potential of knock-on effects beyond the medial temporal lobes. In a large cohort of patients (n=38) with hippocampal damage due to autoimmune limbic encephalitis, we had reported evidence that extra-hippocampal structural and functional abnormalities in the broader hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network fully mediated the effects of hippocampal damage on several aspects of episodic memory. However, we had not examined the specific diencephalic nuclei affected or the white matter pathways that would help explain these remote effects. In this study, we used recently developed methods of automated segmentation of diencephalic nuclei, as well as a range of analyses of white matter integrity. As expected, we found atrophy in the anterior thalamic nuclei and in the mammillary bodies, but also in the laterodorsal, pulvinar, and dorsomedial nuclei. The extent of atrophy in some of these nuclei was comparable to, if not larger than that observed for the hippocampal formation, even though none of our patients' acute clinical scans disclosed thalamic damage. We also present evidence linking these volumes to patients' episodic memory impairment over and above any correlation with hippocampal/subicular subfield volumes. White matter integrity was strongly compromised in the hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network, and the volumetric relationship between the hippocampal formation and the mammillary bodies was at least partly mediated by the integrity of the fornix across patients, consistent with the assumption of Wallerian degeneration following focal medial temporal lobe damage. However, evidence for the specialisation of the hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network in recollection/recall was mixed, and white matter abnormalities extended to regions well beyond this network. Our findings highlight the need to longitudinally examine diencephalic and white matter integrity in cohorts of hippocampal damage with different aetiologies and update neuroanatomical models of this network.

                Most of the food produced globally is consumed in urban centres, and urban populations rely heavily on purchasing the foods they consume in place of growing, catching, or producing food themselves. Urban populations are thus highly dependent on the types of foods available to them and their relative prices. Rapid urbanization is catalysing changes across the food system and in turn, shaping urban diets. Traditionally viewed as a problem predominantly faced by rural areas, food insecurity and malnutrition (both undernutrition and overweight and obesity) are on the rise in urban areas globally. Likewise, urban environments can foster unsafe food environments, increasing the risk of foodborne illnesses and death. Considering an increasingly urbanized world, this paper describes critical links between food systems and urban health. It identifies housing development, digitalization, labour transitions and dietary transitions as emerging and interrelated trends that are changing the way people access, purchase and consume food in urban areas. This paper proposes potential interventions and tools for holistic, city-led policies and actions that make healthier and safer food more available and affordable for everyone, to inspire and encourage practitioners and policymakers at the city, regional, national and international levels to increase their ambition and act urgently.

                Pain and inflammation are the consequences of sore throat, dental and oral procedures, infections, ulcers and head and neck chemotherapy/radiotherapy, and their management is of fundamental importance to avoid distress in patients. Benzydamine hydrochloride (HCl) is a topical indolic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, endowed with analgesic and anesthetic activity, and with antimicrobial (including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria) and antifungal properties (targeting Candida albicans and non-albicans strains), used in odontostomatology, otorhinolaryngology, and gynecology for its properties. This molecule has a lipophilic nature, showing high affinity with cell membranes and exhibiting membrane stabilization properties, resulting in local anesthesia, an effect related also to the interaction of the drug with cationic channels. Unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzydamine HCl is a weak inhibitor of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase and consequently its primary mechanisms of action are not related to arachidonic acid metabolism and do not affect the biosynthesis of the inflammation mediators prostanoids, prostacyclin, thromboxane and leukotrienes. Benzydamine HCl is able to inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with consequent analgesia. Moreover, benzydamine HCl is able to inhibit leukocyte-endothelial interactions and platelet aggregation. Here we review the most updated clinical data available on benzydamine HCl local application as spray, mouthwash or gargling and evidence of its effectiveness in inflammatory and/or septic conditions in the otorhinolaryngology and odontostomatology settings, with particular reference to sore throat, oral inflammation, dental plaque, tonsillitis/tonsillectomy and chemo- or radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Novel formulations for oral and oromucosal/buccal/intraoral administration of benzydamine HCl are also reviewed, including in situ gelling formulations to be sprayed onto the damaged oral mucosa. Finally, novel data on the potential role of benzydamine HCl in nociceptor excitability are introduced.

                Background Schizophrenia (SCZD) is a mental disorder characterized by cognitive dysfunction, impaired decision-making abilities, abnormalities in brain functioning, and specific genetic markers. Ethnic and racial factors influence the development and presentation of schizophrenia, with different groups experiencing different levels of risk and exhibiting different patterns of mental disorders. Objective We sought to investigate the executive function and decision-making profile of Schizophrenia participants from Barranquilla, Colombia, which have a high genetic mixture and significant ethnic and racial diversity. Methods The sample consists of 40 individuals, 20 diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and 20 controls. We use the BANFE neuropsychological battery and the Iowa Gambling task to measure executive function and decision-making processes. Results The study found differences in cognitive performance, measured by the Neuropsychological Battery of Executive Functions and Frontal Lobes, in the medial orbit, anterior prefrontal, dorsolateral, and total executive function measures. In decision-making, as measured by the Iowa Gambling Test, there were also differences between the two groups, with those with schizophrenia performing worse and showing a preference for disadvantageous options. The study also found that there were no significant differences in socio-demographic characteristics between the two groups but that there were differences in terms of socio-economic status and educational level. Conclusion This study found that individuals with paranoid schizophrenia had significant differences in their prefrontal cortex compared to those without the condition, specifically in the dorsolateral and orbital-prefrontal cortex. These differences may be linked to difficulties adjusting to their environment and processing reinforcement, leading to impaired learning and arousal disturbances.

                Background Hitherto, BDNF levels in humans have been primarily measured in serum and/or plasma where these levels are readily measurable, but primarily reflect the content of BDNF in blood platelets. By contrast, previous attempts to measure BDNF levels in readily accessible human body fluids such as saliva have been complicated by a lack of sensitivity and/or specificity of BDNF ELISAs (see Discussion). Recently, the suitability of a highly sensitive BDNF ELISA assay was validated using mouse plasma and serum where conventional BDNF ELISA fail to detect BDNF. In this report, we demonstrate that BDNF levels in human saliva are extremely low, in the low pg/mL range, yet detectable in all saliva samples tested. Methods Saliva samples were collected from healthy volunteers by a passive drool method. All samples were aliquoted and immediately frozen to keep at -80°C until use. At the time of use, the samples were thawed, centrifuged to remove any remaining particles and BDNF measurement conducted by using a previously validated BDNF ELISA assay (see below). Recombinant mature BDNF was used as a reference. Results The intra-assay variability was in the range of CV = 1.8 to 4.9%. Saliva samples could be kept frozen at -80°C for 2 months until use for measurements, but more than 4 freeze and thaw cycles caused BDNF losses presumably due to structural change of the antigen. The measurements were not affected by the method of collection provided the samples were diluted at least 2-fold. Conclusions The results indicate that human saliva samples collected in a non-invasive fashion can be used as a source of material to try and correlate BDNF levels with human conditions of interest. These results also confirm those of an independent study published recently using the same BDNF ELISA kit to measure BDNF levels in human saliva samples.

Under <i>in vivo</i> conditions, CA1 pyramidal cells from the hippocampus display transitions from single spikes to bursts. It is believed that subthreshold hyperpolarization and depolarization, also known as down and up-states, play a pivotal role in these transitions. Nevertheless, a central impediment to correlating suprathreshold (spiking) and subthreshold activity has been the technical difficulties of this type of recordings, even with widely used calcium imaging or multielectrode recordings. Recent work using voltage imaging with genetically encoded voltage indicators has been able to correlate spiking patterns with subthreshold activity in a variety of CA1 neurons, and recent computational models have been able to capture these transitions. In this work, we used a computational model of a CA1 pyramidal cell to investigate the role of intrinsic conductances and oscillatory patterns in generating down and up-states and their modulation in the transition from single spiking to bursting. Specifically, the emergence of distinct spiking resonances between these two spiking modes that share the same voltage traces in the presence of theta or gamma oscillatory inputs, a phenomenon we call interleaved single and bursting spiking resonance. We noticed that these resonances do not necessarily overlap in frequency or amplitude, underscoring their relevance for providing flexibility to neural processing. We studied the conductance values of three current types that are thought to be critical for the bursting behavior: persistent sodium current (<i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>) and its conductance <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub>, delayed rectifier potassium (<i>I</i><sub>KDR</sub>) and its conductance <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub>, and hyperpolarization-activated current (<i>I</i><sub>h</sub>) and its conductance <i>G</i><sub>h</sub>. We conclude that the intricate interplay of ionic currents significantly influences the neuronal firing patterns, transitioning from single to burst firing during sustained depolarization. Specifically, the intermediate levels of <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub> and <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub> facilitate spiking resonance at gamma frequency inputs. The resonance characteristics vary between single and burst firing modes, each displaying distinct amplitudes and resonant frequencies. Furthermore, low <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub> and high <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub> values lock bursting to theta frequencies, while high <i>G</i><sub>NaP</sub> and low <i>G</i><sub>KDR</sub> values lock single spiking to gamma frequencies. Lastly, the duration of quiet intervals plays a crucial role in determining the likelihood of transitioning to either bursting or single spiking modes. We confirmed that the same features were present in previously recorded in vivo voltage-imaging data. Understanding these dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying neuronal excitability under <i>in vivo</i> conditions.

Bayesian accounts of perception, such as predictive processing, suggest that perceptions integrate expectations and sensory experience, and thus assimilate to expected values. Furthermore, more precise expectations should have stronger influences on perception. We tested these hypotheses using a within-subject paradigm that independently manipulated the mean, variance (precision), and skewness of cues presented as ratings from 10 prior participants. Forty-five participants reported their expectations regarding the painfulness of thermal stimuli or the visual contrast of flickering checkerboards. In a second session, similar (sham) cues were each followed by either a noxious thermal or a visual stimulus. Perceptions assimilated to cue-based expectations in both modalities, but precision effects were modality-specific: more precise cues enhanced assimilation in visual perception only, while higher uncertainty slightly increased reported pain. fMRI analysis revealed that the cues affected higher-level affective and cognitive systems–including assimilation to the cue mean in a neuromarker of endogenous pain processing and in the nucleus accumbens, and activity consistent with aversive prediction-error-like encoding in the periaqueductal gray during pain perception–but not early perceptual processing systems. Furthermore, behavioral and computational models of the expectation session revealed that expectations were biased towards extreme values in both modalities, and towards low-pain cues specifically. These findings suggest that predictive processing theories should be extended with mechanisms such as selective attention to outliers, and that expectation generation and its perceptual effects are mostly modality-specific and primarily influence higher-level processes rather than early perception, at least when cues are not reinforced.

Fungi can cause devastating invasive infections, typically in immunocompromised patients. Treatment is complicated both by the evolutionary similarity between humans and fungi and by the frequent emergence of drug resistance. Studies in fungal pathogens have long been slowed by a lack of high-throughput tools and community resources that are common in model organisms. Here we demonstrate a high-throughput transposon mutagenesis and sequencing (TN-seq) system in <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> that enables genome-wide determination of gene essentiality. We employed a random forest machine learning approach to classify the <i>C. neoformans</i> genome as essential or nonessential, predicting 1,465 essential genes, including 302 that lack human orthologs. These genes are ideal targets for new antifungal drug development. TN-seq also enables genome-wide measurement of the fitness contribution of genes to phenotypes of interest. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the genome-wide contribution of genes to growth in fluconazole, a clinically used antifungal. We show a novel role for the well-studied <i>RIM101</i> pathway in fluconazole susceptibility. We also show that insertions of transposons into the 5′ upstream region can drive sensitization of essential genes, enabling screenlike assays of both essential and nonessential components of the genome. Using this approach, we demonstrate a role for mitochondrial function in fluconazole sensitivity, such that tuning down many essential mitochondrial genes via 5′ insertions can drive resistance to fluconazole. Our assay system will be valuable in future studies of <i>C. neoformans</i>, particularly in examining the consequences of genotypic diversity.

                <p>Self-limited epilepsies of childhood are common and were considered benign. We aim to determine whether cognitive function in young adults who experienced epilepsy as children and are subsequently seizure-free and unmedicated differ from the general population. We report on a cross-sectional population-based study including 2,124,871 men and women aged 16–19 years. Participants &gt; 5 years following the last seizure and &gt; 2 years without anti-seizure medication (n = 3,452) had an odds ratio (OR) of having low cognitive function of 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24–1.68, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) using a multinominal regression model. Our results underscore the need to avoid the term “benign” in the classification of childhood epilepsies. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>In our study, we selected pilot trainees as subjects and utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to analyze the impact of flight training on their brains. After examining the correlations between classical and sub-band brain regions and behavioral tests, we discovered that flight training induced changes in the superior frontal gyrus, posterior central gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus of the pilot trainees' brains.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In this study, we aimed to investigate changes in the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mALFF) in different frequency bands in flight trainees using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) technology to explore the impact of flight training on brain functional changes. The study included 39 flight trainees and 37 well-matched healthy controls. MATLAB software was used to perform two-sample <i>t</i>-tests on the mALFF values of the subjects in different frequency bands to identify intergroup differences. SPSS software was used to perform correlation analysis between the different brain areas and the results of the Berg Card Sorting Test (BCST). The results revealed significant differences in mALFF values in multiple brain areas, including the left medial superior frontal gyrus and the left postcentral gyrus, between the two groups. Sub-bands revealed more differential brain areas compared to the classical band, and these differential brain areas were significantly correlated with the total accuracy of the BCST. Under resting conditions, flight trainees who underwent flight training showed significant differences from the control group in brain regions related to cognitive executive control, somatosensory function, memory function, and other functions. This may be related to the learning of critical flight skills, such as emergency operations, maneuvering the aircraft for takeoff, landing, and re-flight during executive flight training. Meanwhile, the sub-band is more sensitive to information about brain functional activities than the classical band, which provides a new perspective for further exploring the changes in pilot brain functional mechanisms in the future.</p>
