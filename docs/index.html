	<p>Background/Objectives: Studies on executive functions in child sex offenders relate their findings to the presence of pedophilia, but they are not able to distinguish between paraphilia and abuse. It is therefore this lack of a distinction that leads us to complement the existing information. Thus, the purpose of this review is to find all available evidence on the neurocognitive and neuroanatomical differences in executive functions among pedophilic and non-pedophilic child sex offenders, and non-offender pedophiles. Methods: The present review, in accordance with the PRISMA statement, ran a systematic search of three databases (Web of Science, Scopus and ProQuest). This search identified 5697 potential articles, but only 16 studies met all the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe, using a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample. Results: The results showed alterations in frontal, temporal and parietal structures related to executive functions (e.g., response inhibition) in child sexual offenders, regardless of the presence of pedophilia. Conclusions: In summary, there are differences in brain structure underlying executive functions related to child sexual abuse, but not to pedophilia as such.</p>

                <p>Brain oscillations in the alpha-band (8&ndash;14&nbsp;Hz) have been linked to specific processes in attention and perception. In particular, decreases in posterior alpha-amplitude are thought to reflect activation of perceptually relevant brain areas for target engagement, while alpha-amplitude increases have been associated with inhibition for distractor suppression. Traditionally, these alpha-changes have been viewed as two facets of the same process. However, recent evidence calls for revisiting this interpretation. Here, we recorded MEG/EEG in 32 participants (19 females) during covert visuospatial attention shifts (spatial cues) and two control conditions (neutral cue, no-attention cue), while tracking fixational eye movements. In disagreement with a single, perceptually relevant alpha-process, we found the typical alpha-modulations contra- and ipsilateral to the attention focus to be triple dissociated in their timing, topography, and spectral features: Ipsilateral alpha-increases occurred early, over occipital sensors, at a high alpha-frequency (10&ndash;14&nbsp;Hz) and were expressed during spatial attention (alpha spatial cue &gt; neutral cue). In contrast, contralateral alpha-decreases occurred later, over parietal sensors, at a lower alpha-frequency (7&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) and were associated with attention deployment in general (alpha spatial and neutral cue &lt; no-attention cue). Additionally, the lateralized early alpha-increases but not alpha-decreases during spatial attention coincided in time with directionally biased microsaccades. Overall, this suggests that the attention-related early alpha-increases and late alpha-decreases reflect distinct, likely reflexive versus endogenously controlled attention mechanisms. We conclude that there is more than one perceptually relevant posterior alpha-oscillation, which need to be dissociated for a detailed account of their roles in perception and attention.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e1017242024?rss=1">Nonresolving Neuroinflammation Regulates Axon Regeneration in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) lesions retain increased densities of microglia and macrophages. In acute SCI, macrophages induce growth cone collapse and facilitate axon retraction away from lesion boundaries. Little is known about the role of sustained inflammation in chronic SCI or whether chronic inflammation affects regeneration. We used the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor inhibitor, PLX-5622, to deplete microglia and macrophages months after complete crush SCI in female mice. Transcriptional analyses revealed a significant inflammatory depletion within chronic SCI lesions after PLX-5622 treatment. Both transcriptional analyses and immunohistochemistry revealed that Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells repopulate to predepleted densities after treatment removal. Neuronal-enriched transcripts were significantly elevated in mice after inflammatory repopulation, but no significant effects were observed with inflammatory depletion alone. Axon densities also significantly increased within the lesion after PLX-5622 treatment and after repopulation. To better examine the effect of chronic inflammation on axon regeneration, we tested PLX-5622 treatment in neuronal-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) knock-out (PTEN-KO) mice. PTEN-KO was delivered using spinal injections of retrogradely transported adeno-associated viruses (AAVrg's). PTEN-KO did not further increase axon densities within the lesion beyond the effects induced by PLX-5622. Axons that grew within the lesion were histologically identified as 5-HT<sup>+</sup> and CGRP<sup>+</sup>, both of which are not robustly transduced by AAVrg's. Our work identified that increased macrophage/microglial densities in the chronic SCI environment may be actively retained by homeostatic mechanisms likely affiliated with a sustained elevated expression of CSF1 and other chemokines. Finally, we identify a novel role of sustained inflammation as a prospective barrier to axon regeneration in chronic SCI.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e1473242024?rss=1">Optogenetic Control of Dopamine Receptor 2 Reveals a Novel Aspect of Dopaminergic Neurotransmission in Motor Function</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a crucial role in motor function through the coordination of dopamine receptor (DRD) subtypes, such as DRD1 and DRD2, thus the functional imbalance of these receptors can lead to Parkinson's disease. However, due to the complexity of dopaminergic circuits in the brain, it is limited to investigating the individual functions of each DRD subtype in specific brain regions. Here, we developed a light-responsive chimeric DRD2, OptoDRD2, which can selectively activate DRD2-like signaling pathways with spatiotemporal resolution. OptoDRD2 was designed to include the light-sensitive component of rhodopsin and the intracellular signaling domain of DRD2. Upon illumination with blue light, OptoDRD2 triggered DRD2-like signaling pathways, such as G&alpha;i/o subtype recruitment, a decrease in cAMP levels, and ERK phosphorylation. To explore unknown roles of DRD2 in glutamatergic cell populations of basal ganglia circuitry, OptoDRD2 was genetically expressed in excitatory neurons in lateral globus pallidus (LGP) of the male mouse brain. The optogenetic stimulation of OptoDRD2 in the LGP region affected a wide range of locomotion-related parameters, such as increased frequency of movement and decreased immobility time, resulting in the facilitation of motor function of living male mice. Therefore, our findings indicate a potentially novel role for DRD2 in the excitatory neurons of the LGP region, suggesting that OptoDRD2 can be a valuable tool enabling the investigation of unknown roles of DRD2 at specific cell types or brain regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e1587242024?rss=1">Interactions between Arousal State and CO2 Determine the Activity of Central Chemoreceptor Neurons That Drive Breathing</a></h4>

              
                <p>The homeostatic regulation of pulmonary ventilation, and ultimately arterial PCO<SUB>2</SUB>, depends on interactions between respiratory chemoreflexes and arousal state. The ventilatory response to CO<SUB>2</SUB> is triggered by neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) that function as sensors of central pH, which can be identified in adulthood by the expression of Phox2b and neuromedin B. Here, we examine the dynamic response of genetically defined RTN neurons to hypercapnia and arousal state in freely behaving adult male and female mice using the calcium indicator jGCaMP7 and fiber photometry. We found that hypercapnia vigorously activates RTN neurons with a low CO<SUB>2</SUB> recruitment threshold and with response kinetics that match respiratory activity whereas hypoxia had little effect. RTN activity increased transiently during wakefulness and respiratory-related arousals and rose persistently during rapid eye movement sleep, and their CO<SUB>2</SUB> response persisted under anesthesia. Complementary studies using inhibitory optogenetics show that RTN activity supports eupneic breathing under anesthesia as well as during states of high arousal, but their activity is redundant for voluntary breathing patterns. Collectively, this study demonstrates that CO<SUB>2</SUB>-activated RTN neurons are exquisitely sensitive to the arousal state, which determines their contribution to alveolar ventilation in relation to arterial PCO<SUB>2</SUB>.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e1940232024?rss=1">Revealing the Spatial Pattern of Brain Hemodynamic Sensitivity to Healthy Aging through Sparse Dynamic Causal Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>Age-related changes in the BOLD response could reflect neurovascular coupling modifications rather than simply impairments in neural functioning. In this study, we propose the use of a sparse dynamic causal model (sDCM) to decouple neuronal and vascular factors in the BOLD signal, with the aim of characterizing the whole-brain spatial pattern of hemodynamic sensitivity to healthy aging, as well as to test the role of hemodynamic features as independent predictors in an age-classification model. sDCM was applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of a cohort of 126 healthy individuals in a wide age range (31 females), providing reliable estimates of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) for each subject and each region of interest. Then, some features characterizing each HRF curve were extracted and used to fit a multivariate logistic regression model predicting the age class of each individual. Ultimately, we tested the final predictive model on an independent dataset of 338 healthy subjects (173 females) selected from the Human Connectome Project in Aging and Development cohorts. Our results entail the spatial heterogeneity of the age effects on the hemodynamic component, since its impact resulted to be strongly region- and population-specific, discouraging any space-invariant&ndash;corrective procedures that attempt to correct for vascular factors when carrying out functional studies involving groups with different ages. Moreover, we demonstrated that a strong interaction exists between certain right-hemisphere hemodynamic features and age, further supporting the essential role of the hemodynamic factor as independent predictor of biological aging, rather than a simple confounding variable.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e2284232024?rss=1">Early Neural Development of Social Interaction Perception: Evidence from Voxel-Wise Encoding in Young Children and Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>From a young age, children have advanced social perceptual and reasoning abilities. However, the neural development of these abilities is still poorly understood. To address this gap, we used fMRI data collected while 122 3&ndash;12-year-old children (64 females) and 33 adults (20 females) watched an engaging and socially rich movie to investigate how the cortical basis of social processing changes throughout development. We labeled the movie with visual and social features, including motion energy, presence of a face and a social interaction, theory of mind (ToM) events, valence, and arousal. Using a voxel-wise encoding model trained on these features, we found that models based on visual (motion energy) and social (faces, social interaction, ToM, valence, and arousal) features can both predict brain activity in children as young as 3&nbsp;years old across the cortex, with particularly high predictivity in motion-selective middle temporal region and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Furthermore, models based on individual social features showed that while there may be some development throughout childhood, social interaction information in the STS is present in children as young as 3&nbsp;years old and appears adult-like by age 7. The current study, for the first time, links neural activity in children to predefined social features in a narrative movie and suggests social interaction perception is supported by early developing neural responses in the STS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/1/e0080242024?rss=1">Computational and Neural Evidence for Altered Fast and Slow Learning from Losses in Problem Gambling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Learning occurs across multiple timescales, with fast learning crucial for adapting to sudden environmental changes, and slow learning beneficial for extracting robust knowledge from multiple events. Here, we asked if miscalibrated fast vs slow learning can lead to maladaptive decision-making in individuals with problem gambling. We recruited participants with problem gambling (PG; N = 20; 9 female and 11 male) and a recreational gambling control group without any symptoms associated with PG (N = 20; 10 female and 10 male) from the community in Los Angeles, CA. Participants performed a decision-making task involving reward-learning and loss-avoidance while being scanned with fMRI. Using computational model fitting, we found that individuals in the PG group showed evidence for an excessive dependence on slow timescales and a reduced reliance on fast timescales during learning. fMRI data implicated the putamen, an area associated with habit, and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in slow loss-value encoding, with significantly more robust encoding in medial PFC in the PG group compared to controls. The PG group also exhibited stronger loss prediction error encoding in the insular cortex. These findings suggest that individuals with PG have an impaired ability to adjust their predictions following losses, manifested by a stronger influence of slow value learning. This impairment could contribute to the behavioral inflexibility of problem gamblers, particularly the persistence in gambling behavior typically observed in those individuals after incurring loss outcomes.</p>

                <p>Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy has regenerative potentials to treat various pathological conditions including neurological diseases. MSCs isolated from various organs can differentiate into specific cell types to repair organ damages. However, their paracrine mechanisms are predicted to predominantly mediate their immunomodulatory, proangiogenic, and regenerative properties. While preclinical studies highlight the significant potential of MSC therapy in mitigating neurological damage from stroke and traumatic brain injury, the variability in clinical trial outcomes may stem from the inherent heterogeneity of somatic MSCs. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an ideal alternative resource for the unlimited expansion and biomanufacturing of MSCs. Thus, we investigated how iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) influence properties of iPSC-derived neurons. Our findings demonstrate that the secretome from iMSCs possesses neurotrophic effects, improving neuronal survival and promoting neuronal outgrowth and synaptic activity in vitro. Additionally, the iMSCs enhance metabolic activity via mitochondrial respiration in neurons, both in vitro and in mouse models. Glycolytic pathways also increased following the administration of iMSC secretome to iPSC-derived neurons. Consistently, in vivo experiments showed that intravenous administration of iMSCs compensated for the elevated energetic demand in male mice with irradiation-induced brain injury by restoring synaptic metabolic activity during acute brain damage. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging also detected an increase in brain glucose uptake following iMSC administration. Together, our results highlight the potential of iMSC-based therapy in treating neuronal damage in various neurological disorders, while paving the way for future research and potential clinical applications of iMSCs in regenerative medicine.</p>

                <p>Although the therapeutic potential of microRNA-mediated gene regulation has been investigated, its precise functional regulatory mechanism in neuropathic pain remains incompletely understood. In this study, we elucidate that miR-216a-3p serves as a critical noncoding RNA involved in the modulation of trigeminal-mediated neuropathic pain. By conducting RNA-seq and qPCR analysis, we observed a notable decrease of miR-216a-3p in the injured trigeminal ganglia (TG) of male rats. Intra-TG administration of miR-216a-3p agomir or lentiviral-mediated overexpression of miR-216a-3p specifically in sensory neurons of injured TGs alleviated established neuropathic pain behaviors, while downregulation of miR-216a-3p (pharmacologically or genetically) in naive rats induced pain behaviors. Moreover, nerve injury significantly elevated the histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) trimethylation (H3K27me3) levels in the ipsilateral TG, thereby suppressing the SRY-box TF 10 (SOX10) binding to the <I>miR-216a-3p</I> promoter and resulting in the reduction of miR-216a-3p. Inhibiting the enzymes responsible for catalyzing H3K27me3 restored the nerve injury-induced reduction in miR-216a-3p expression and markedly ameliorated neuropathic pain behaviors. Furthermore, miR-216a-3p targeted stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), and the decreased miR-216a-3p associated with neuropathic pain caused a significant upregulation in the protein abundance of STIM1. Conversely, overexpression of miR-216a-3p in the injured TG suppressed the upregulation of STIM1 expression and reversed the mechanical allodynia. Together, the mechanistic understanding of H3K27me3-dependent SOX10/miR-216a-3p/STIM1 signaling axial in sensory neurons may facilitate the discovery of innovative therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain management.</p>

                <p>The interplay between attention, alertness, and motor planning is crucial for our manual interactions. To investigate the neural bases of this interaction and challenge the views that attention cannot be disentangled from motor planning, we instructed human volunteers of both sexes to plan and execute reaching movements while attending to the target, while attending elsewhere, or without constraining attention. We recorded reaction times to reach initiation and pupil diameter and interfered with the functions of the medial posterior parietal cortex (mPPC) with online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the causal role of this cortical region in the interplay between spatial attention and reaching. We found that mPPC plays a key role in the spatial association of reach planning and covert attention. Moreover, we have found that alertness, measured by pupil size, is a good predictor of the promptness of reach initiation only if we plan a reach to attended targets, and mPPC is causally involved in this coupling. Different from previous understanding, we suggest that mPPC is neither involved in reach planning per se, nor in sustained covert attention in the absence of a reach plan, but it is specifically involved in attention functional to reaching.</p>

                <p>Intracranial potentials are used as functional biomarkers of neural networks. As potentials spread away from the source populations, they become mixed in the recordings. In humans, interindividual differences in the gyral architecture of the cortex pose an additional challenge, as functional areas vary in location and extent. We used source separation techniques to disentangle mixing potentials obtained by exploratory deep arrays implanted in epileptic patients of either sex to gain access to the number, location, relative contribution, and dynamics of coactive sources. The unique spatial profiles of separated generators made it possible to discern dozens of independent cortical areas for each patient, whose stability maintained even during seizure, enabling the follow up of activity for days and across states. Through matching these profiles to MRI, we associated each with limited portions of sulci and gyri and determined the local or remote origin of the corresponding sources. We also plotted source-specific 3D coverage across arrays. In average, individual recording sites are contributed to by 3&ndash;5 local and distant generators from areas up to several centimeters apart. During seizure, 13&ndash;85% of generators were involved, and a few appeared anew. Significant bias in location assignment using raw potentials is revealed, including numerous false positives when determining the site of origin of a seizure. This is not amended by bipolar montage, which introduce additional errors of its own. In this way, source disentangling reveals the multisource nature and far intracranial spread of potentials in humans, while efficiently addressing patient-specific anatomofunctional cortical divergence.</p>

                <p>Neonatal hypoxia (Hx) causes white matter (WM) injury, particularly in the cerebellum. We previously demonstrated that Hx-induced reduction of cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) activity results in locomotor deficits. Yet, the mechanism of Hx-induced cerebellar WM injury and associated locomotor abnormalities remains undetermined. Here, we show that the cerebellar WM injury and linked locomotor deficits are driven by PC activity and are reversed when PC activity is restored. Using optogenetics and multielectrode array recordings, we manipulated PC activity and captured the resulting cellular responses in WM oligodendrocyte precursor cells and GABAergic interneurons. To emulate the effects of Hx, we used light-activated halorhodopsin targeted specifically to the PC layer of normal mice. Suppression of PC firing activity at P13 and P21 phenocopied the locomotor deficits observed in Hx. Moreover, histopathologic analysis of the developing cerebellar WM following PC inhibition (P21) revealed a corresponding reduction in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, akin to our findings in Hx mice. Conversely, PC stimulation restored PC activity, promoted oligodendrocyte maturation, and enhanced myelination, resulting in reversed Hx-induced locomotor deficits. Our findings highlight the crucial role of PC activity in cerebellar WM development and locomotor performance following neonatal injury. </p>

">Auditory tract maturation in early infancy: Links to speech production</a></h4>

              
                Infants exhibit remarkable language acquisition abilities, supported by highly plastic neural substrates that dynamically interact with early speech experiences. However, the developmental mechanisms of these neural substrates and their specific role in speech acquisition remain incompletely understood. Here, we present NeoAudi Tract (NAT), a robust automated toolbox for extracting the full set of auditory tracts in infants from birth to 24 months using $3$T diffusion MRI data. By characterizing the microstructural changes in these tracts, we demonstrate a gradual and continuous maturation process of the auditory system. Additionally, we identify significant correlations between auditory tract maturation and both textit{fine-motor skills} and textit{expressive language} $t$-scores from the Mullen Scales of Early Learning tests. Our findings highlight the role of the auditory system in speech production and indicate the intertwined development of auditory and motor systems that underlies speech acquisition, particularly during perceptual reorganization.

">Developmental synaptic pruning in the olivo-cerebellar circuit sculpts predictive processing</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic pruning is a dominant process of circuit assembly, known to eliminate a large proportion of synapses formed during development. Yet, very little is understood about how the drastic elimination of a large number of synapses affects circuit computation and behavior. Here, using the olivocerebellar system of larval zebrafish, we first establish the timelines of olivary climbing fiber to Purkinje neuron synaptic pruning. We then show that during this window, encoding of sensory-motor mismatches is improved, sensory representations are fine-tuned, and predictive signals are more robust. All of these lead to faster and better behavioral responses which are adaptable to current sensory input. Thus, developmental synaptic pruning makes circuits fit for complex computations such as predictive processing.

">Rotationally Stable Dynamics Over Long Timescales Emerge in Neuronal Development</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal networks must balance the need for stable yet flexible dynamics. This is evident during brain development, when synaptic plasticity during critical windows enables adaptability to changing environments whilst ensuring the stability of population dynamics. The emergence of population dynamics that balance stability and flexibility during development is poorly understood. Here, we investigated developmental brain dynamics in larval zebrafish, using in vivo 2-photon imaging to record single-cell activity across major brain regions from 3-8 days post-fertilisation, a highly plastic period in which hunting behaviours are established. Our findings revealed region-specific trajectories in the development of such dynamic regimes: the telencephalon exhibited increased neuronal excitability and long-range correlations, alongside the emergence of scale invariant avalanche dynamics indicative of enhanced flexibility. Conversely, while other regions showed increased state transitions over development, the telencephalon demonstrated a surprising rise in state stability, characterized by slightly longer dwell times and drastically reduced angular velocity in state space. Remarkably, such rotationally stable dynamics persisted up to 5 seconds into the future, indicating the emergence of strong attractors supporting stability over long timescales. Notably, we observed that telencephalon dynamics were maintained near to but not at a phase transition, thus allowing for robust responses while remaining adaptable to novel inputs. Our results highlight regionally-specific trajectories in the relationship between flexibility and stability, illustrating how developing neuronal populations can self-organize to balance these competing demands.

">Nurr1 orchestrates claustrum development and functionality</a></h4>

              
                Claustrum is known the most widely interconnected tissue with almost all brain subareas to coordinate multiple cognitive behaviors in spite of the lasting controversy on its role in consciousness formation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying its development and behavioral control. Here we show that Nurr1 (Nr4a2) is the key factor orchestrating claustral morphogenesis, functional connectivity and thus behaviors. Nurr1 deficient claustral cells over-migrate into insular cortex, shaping claustrum into an abnormal wing-like structure, and ectopically turn on insular cortical genetic program. Accordingly, functional connectivity associated with claustrum and relevant behaviors are dysregulated by Nurr1 deficiency. Additionally, Nurr1 regulates claustral neuron positioning by suppressing G-protein signaling.

">Nerve Growth Factor Signaling Tunes Axon Maintenance Protein Abundance and Kinetics of Wallerian Degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurotrophic factors are critical for establishing functional connectivity in the nervous system and sustaining neuronal survival through adulthood. As the first neurotrophic factor purified, nerve growth factor (NGF) is extensively studied for its prolific role in axon outgrowth, pruning, and survival. Applying NGF to diseased neuronal tissue is an exciting therapeutic option and understanding how NGF regulates local axon susceptibility to pathological degeneration is critical for exploiting its full potential. Our study identifies surprising connections between NGF signaling and proteostasis of axon maintenance factors. NGF deprivation increases Nmnat2 and Stmn2 protein levels in axon segments with a corresponding delay in Wallerian degeneration. Conversely, acute NGF stimulation reduces local abundance of these axon maintenance factors and accelerates Wallerian degeneration. Pharmacological studies implicate phospholipase C as the key effector in TrkA activation, which drives degradation of palmitoylated Stmn2. While seemingly opposed to neuroprotective activities well-documented for NGF, downregulating Nmnat2 and Stmn2 favors axonal outgrowth over transient hyper-susceptibility to Sarm1-dependent degeneration. This new facet of NGF biology has important implications for axonal remodeling during development and sustained integrity through adulthood.

">Cortical responses to conflicting binocular stimuli in mouse primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Binocular vision requires that the brain integrate information coming from each eye. These images are combined (fused) to generate a meaningful composite image. Differences between images, within a range, provide useful information about depth (stereopsis). Interocular disparities that are not effectively combined result in diplopia and rivalry. The neural mechanisms underlying these binocular interactions remain poorly understood. Using a combination of visually evoked potential (VEP) recordings, unit recordings, and 2-photon calcium imaging in the binocular region of mouse primary visual cortex (bV1), we probed the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of two distinct forms of disparate binocular signals. Using a dichoptic display, introduction of a spatial interocular phase disparity in grating stimuli reduced VEP magnitude through decreased neuronal firing in the early phase of the response (40-80 ms after stimulus onset, corresponding to the VEP negativity). Introduction of an interocular orientation disparity also decreased VEP magnitude, but this difference was driven by an increase in firing in the late portion of the visual response (100-200 ms after stimulus onset, corresponding to the VEP positivity). This increase in activity was observed for both regular-spiking (putative excitatory) and fast-spiking (putative parvalbumin-positive inhibitory) units. By contrast, visually evoked calcium responses of somatostatin-positive interneurons decreased with introduction of the interocular orientation disparity. Based on these results, we propose that interocular phase differences largely suppress bV1 responses via feedforward thalamocortical interactions, whereas interocular orientation differences prolong visually evoked activity in bV1 through somatostatin-positive interneuron-mediated disinhibition.

                Neurons located in the layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ECII) are the primary site of pathological tau accumulation and neurodegeneration at preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exploring the alterations that underlie the early degeneration of these cells is essential to develop therapies that delay disease onset. Here we performed cell-type specific profiling of the EC at the onset of human AD neuropathology. We identify an early response to amyloid pathology by microglia and oligodendrocytes. More importantly, we find that the Reelin signaling pathway is already impaired at this early disease stage, particularly in ECII neurons. This indicates that dysregulation of this pathway, with emerging genetic association with AD, plays a pivotal role in the selective vulnerability of the EC and in the onset of AD neuropathology.

">Different mechanisms link gain and loss of kinesin functions to axonal degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Axons are the slender, often meter-long projections of neurons that form the biological cables wiring our bodies. Most of these delicate structures must survive for an organism's lifetime, meaning up to a century in humans. Long-term maintenance and sustained functionality of axons requires motor protein-driven transport distributing life-sustaining materials and organelles to places of need. It seems therefore plausible that loss of motor function can cause axon degeneration; however, also gain-of-function conditions were linked to disorders including motor neuron disease or spastic paraplegia. To understand this phenomenon, we studied ~40 genetic manipulations of motor proteins, cargo linkers and regulators of reactive oxygen species in one standardised Drosophila primary neuron system. Using axonal microtubule bundle organisation as a relevant readout reflecting the state of axon integrity, we found that losses of Dynein heavy chain, KIF1A/Unc-104 and KIF5/Kinesin heavy chain (Khc) all cause bundle disintegration in the form of chaotically curled microtubules. Detailed functional studies of Khc and its adaptor proteins revealed that losses of mitochondrial or lysosomal transport cause ROS dyshomeostasis, which is a condition that inducing MT-curling in fly and mouse neurons alike. We find that hyper-activated Khc induces the same MT-curling phenotype, not through ROS but directly through enhanced mechanical forces. Studies with loss of Unc-104 and expression of an ALS-linked mutant form of the human Khc orthologue KIF5A suggest that the two mechanisms apply to motors beyond Khc. We discuss a model which can explain the surprising common outcome of both conditions and examine its relevance for understanding motor-linked neurodegeneration.

">Brain activation for language and its relationship to cognitive and linguistic measures</a></h4>

              
                Language learning and use are complex cognitive skills requiring domain-general cognition and sensori-motor skills, these also being important for numerical and music processing. Previous studies have explored behavioural associations across domains and neural underpinnings of specific abilities, yet less work has examined these questions together in the same participants. We collected data from 152 participants on behavioural measures of language, reading, multilingual experience, cognition, musicality, arithmetic, and motor skills, along with fMRI data during L1 story listening. Participants varied in multilingual language experience and reading aptitudes, including both typical (TRs) and dyslexic readers (DRs). Using multivariate Partial Least Squares correlation, we identified a main component linking cognitive, linguistic, and phonological measures to brain areas underlying lexico/semantics, combinatorial processing, and amodal semantic processing. A second analysis excluding DRs showed closer associations between cognitive/linguistic, literacy, phonological and memory processes within the same brain network as in the full sample. Here, we also isolated additional, complementary components, including one involving speed, automatization and lexical access, linked to auditory and motor brain areas. This suggests greater coherence and more integrated, 'expert' processing in TRs. This work is a first step in exploring complex relationships between language and non-linguistic functions that are important to it.

">Detection of HTTex1p by western blot and immunostaining of HD human and mouse brain using neo-epitope antibody P90 highlights impact of CAG repeat expansion on its size, solubility, and response to MSH3 silencing</a></h4>

              
                HTT1a has been identified in human and mouse HD brain as the pathogenic exon 1 mRNA generated from aberrant splicing between exon 1 and 2 that contributes to aggregate formation and neuronal dysfunction (Sathasivam et al., 2013). Detection of the HTT exon 1 protein (HTTex1p) has been accomplished with surrogate antibodies in fluorescence-based reporter assays (MSD, HTRF), and immunoprecipitation assays, in HD postmortem cerebellum and knock-in mice but direct detection by SDS-PAGE and western blot assay has been lacking. Here proteins in subcellular fractions prepared from human and mouse HD brain were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by western blot with neo-epitope monoclonal antibodies (P90-1B12 and 11G2) directed to the C-terminal 8 residues of HTTex1p. In human HD putamen and cortex, HTTex1p migrated at 56-60 kD and at higher molecular masses (HMM) consistent with the presence of CAG repeat expansion in HTT1a. HTTex1p in control brain was low or undetectable. Immunofluorescence labeling of human HD cortex using P90-11G2 revealed small aggregates that sparsely populated the neuropil in layers 3 and 5. In caudate putamen of 6 month old HD knock-in mice (Q50, Q80, Q111, Q140 and Q175) HTTex1p migration was inversely correlated with CAG repeat length and appeared as a SDS soluble high molecular mass (HMM) smear in HD Q111, Q140 and Q175 mice but not in Q50 and Q80 mice indicating a CAG repeat size threshold for detecting HTTex1p aggregation. Migration of HTTex1p and HMM smear changed with age in caudate putamen of Q111, Q175 and YAC128 mice. Treating HD Q111 mice with siRNA to MSH3, a modifier of CAG repeat expansion, significantly reduced levels of the HMM smear indicating that the effects of curbing CAG repeat expansion was quantifiable. These results show that P90 antibodies can be used in western blot assays and immunostaining to track and quantify HTTex1p levels, subcellular localization, and solubility.

">Circuit dynamics of approach-avoidance conflict in humans</a></h4>

              
                Debilitating anxiety is pervasive in the modern world. Choices to approach or avoid are common in everyday life and excessive avoidance is a cardinal feature of all anxiety disorders. Here, we used intracranial EEG to define a distributed prefrontal-limbic circuit dynamics supporting approach and avoidance. Presurgical epilepsy patients (n=20) performed an approach-avoidance conflict decision-making task inspired by the arcade game Pac-Man, where participants trade-off real-time harvesting rewards with potential losses from attack. As patients approached increasing rewards and threats, we found evidence of a limbic circuit mediated by increased theta power in the hippocampus, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which then drops rapidly during avoidance. Theta band connectivity between these regions increases during approach and falls during avoidance, with OFC serving as a connector in this circuit with high theta coherence across limbic regions, but also with regions outside of the limbic system, including the lateral prefrontal cortex. Importantly, the degree of OFC-driven connectivity predicts how long participants approach, with enhanced network synchronicity extending approach times. Finally, under ghost attack, the system dynamically switches to a sustained increase in high-frequency activity (70-150Hz) in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), marking the retreat from the ghost. The results provide evidence for a distributed prefrontal-limbic circuit, mediated by theta oscillations, underlying approach-avoidance conflict.

">Persistent DNA methylation and downregulation of homeostatic genes in astrocytes after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus: Implications for epileptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, affecting millions of patients worldwide. Retrospective studies in Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients have shown a high incidence of an initial precipitating event (IPE) in early childhood followed by a silent period where epileptogenesis occurs to end up in chronic epilepsy. Epileptogenesis, the process through which a normal brain undergoes structural and functional changes leading to epilepsy, remains an enigmatic phenomenon. We hypothesized that epigenetics may be involved in epileptogenesis and specifically astrocytes could be affected by pathological remodeling. To study this process, we used three approaches: The lithium-pilocarpine model of TLE in rats, primary astroglial cultures exposed to epileptogenic HMGB1, and brain tissue samples resected from TLE patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. We found that the IPE achieved by lithium-pilocarpine treatment (127/30 mg/kg IP) induced the hypermethylation of astrocytes at 7-, 21-, and 35 days post-IPE, indicating persistent epigenetic alterations in astrocytes during the epileptogenic period. In addition, we observed the downregulation of homeostatic astroglial genes AQP4; glutamine synthase (GS), and Kir4.1 with increased proinflammatory genes (C3, MAFG) and DNMT expression. These alterations were mimicked in primary astrocyte cultures exposed to the epileptogenic DAMP HMGB1 (500 ng/ml; 18 hours) that also induced the hypermethylation of homeostatic astroglial genes. Astrocytes from TLE patients' brains showed reactive astrogliosis, increased DNA methylation, and downregulation of homeostatic genes Kir4.1 and GS. These findings show that astrocytes are pathologically altered during the epileptogenic period, combining the proinflammatory gain of function with the loss of homeostatic profile. This may sustain the long-term alterations underlining epileptogenesis.

	<p>Background: The Default Mode Network (DMN) is involved in self-referential and emotional processes, while the insula integrates emotional and interoceptive signals. Functional connectivity between the insula and the DMN is proposed to enhance these processes by linking internal bodily states with self-referential thoughts and emotional regulation. Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a measure of parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity, has been associated with the capacity to regulate autonomic arousal. This study explored the relationship between insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN functional connectivity and HRV. We hypothesized that (1) insula&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional activity and volume would be related to HRV; (2) insula activation would be functionally connected with the DMN; and (3) stronger insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity would correlate with higher HRV. Methods: Forty-three healthy adults underwent a structural and functional MRI acquisition to assess insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity during resting state. HRV was measured also at rest using the BIOPAC system. Results: A significant positive correlation was found between insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity, but no correlation was observed between insula&amp;amp;ndash;DMN connectivity and HRV. We also found a positive significant association between left insula volume and HRV. Conclusions: These findings suggest that while the AI and DMN are functionally interconnected, this connectivity may not be directly related to HRV. The results highlight the complexity of the relationship between brain connectivity and autonomic function, suggesting that other factors may influence HRV.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is a validated procedure for the treatment of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus. To select shunt-responsive patients, infusion and tap tests can be used. Only gait is evaluated after the procedure to establish a potential improvement. In this study, we present our Hydro-Real-Time Neuropsychological Testing protocol to assess the feasibility of performing an ultra-fast assessment of patients during the infusion and tap test. Methods: We tested 57 patients during the infusion and tap test to obtain real-time feedback on their cognitive status. Data were obtained immediately before the infusion phase (T0), when the pressure plateau was reached (T1), and immediately after cerebrospinal fluid subtraction (T2). Based on cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, 63.15% of the patients presented a resistance to outflow &amp;amp;gt; 12 mmHg/mL/min, while 88% had a positive tap test response. Results: Compared to T0, cerebrospinal fluid removal significantly improved performance on tasks exploring executive functions (counting backward, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; verbal fluency, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Patients were significantly faster at counting backward at T2 vs. T1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) and at T2 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and were significantly faster at counting forward at T2 vs. T1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005), suggesting an improvement in speed at T2. There was a significantly smaller index at T1 vs. T0 (p = 0.005) and at T2 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), suggesting a more marked improvement in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; executive abilities at T2 and a smaller improvement at T1. Regarding verbal fluency, patients were worse at T1 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and at T2 vs. T0 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Patients&amp;amp;rsquo; performance can be monitored during the infusion and tap test as significant changes in executive functions are observable. In future, this protocol might help improve patients&amp;amp;rsquo; selection for surgery.</p>

<p>Retinal abnormalities are observed in the early stages of neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Detection of retinal abnormalities in early stage, can prevent the increase in neurological diseases.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neurological diseases are central nervous system (CNS) disorders affecting the whole body. Early diagnosis of the diseases is difficult due to the lack of disease-specific tests. Adding new biomarkers external to the CNS facilitates the diagnosis of neurological diseases. In this respect, the retina has a common embryologic origin with the CNS. Retinal imaging technologies including optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used in the understanding and processual monitoring of neurological diseases. Retinal imaging has been recently recognized as a potential source of biomarkers for neurological diseases, increasing the number of studies in this direction. In this review, the association of retinal abnormalities with Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is explained. Structural and functional abnormalities in retina as a predictive marker may facilitate early diagnosis of diseases. Although not all retinal abnormalities are predictive of neurologic diseases, changes in the retinal layers including retinal pigment epithelium and plexiform layers should suggest the risk of PD, MS, ALS, and AD.</p>

<p>Striatonigral dopamine D1 receptors' signal asymmetrically producing more cAMP and GABA release at their terminals, which produces higher motor activity initiated in the right hemisphere respect left when receptors are activated.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Lateralization of motor behavior, a common phenomenon in humans and several species, is modulated by the basal ganglia, a site pointed out for the interhemispheric differences related to lateralization. Our study aims to shed light on the potential role of the striatonigral D1 receptor in functional asymmetry in normal conditions through neurochemical and behavioral means. We found that D1 receptor activation and D1/D3 receptor coactivation in striatonigral neurons leads to more cAMP production by adenylyl cyclase in the striatum and GABA release in their terminals in the right hemisphere compared to the left. These differences are linked to a higher receptor sensitivity and potentially a better coupling of G<sub>olf</sub> proteins. When we assessed motor behavior through intranigral injection of the D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 in the left or right substantia nigra, we found higher contralateral circling when injected on the right side. Thus, differences in motor activity correlate with neurochemical data, indicating that D1 receptor signaling plays a significant role in motor asymmetry.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>During the 1990s and early 2000s, research in humans and in the nonhuman primate model of human amnesia revealed that tasks involving free viewing of images provided an exceptionally sensitive measure of recognition memory. Performance on these tasks was sensitive to damage restricted to the hippocampus as well as to damage that included medial temporal lobe cortices. Early work in my laboratory used free-viewing tasks to assess the neurophysiological correlates of recognition memory, and the use of naturalistic visual exploration opened rich avenues to assess other aspects of the impact of eye movements on neural activity in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Here, I summarize two main lines of this work and some of the stories of the trainees who made essential contributions to these discoveries.</p>

                Mitochondrial DNA encodes 13 OXPHOS subunits, which are synthesized inside the organelle. To address how mitochondrial gene expression integrates into cellular physiology, Yousefi et al. established a fluorescence-based high-throughput screen for mitochondrial translation, combining fluorescent labeling of mitochondrial translation products with siRNA-mediated knockdown. This work identifies kinases affecting mitochondrial translation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97654">Downregulation of semaphorin 4A in keratinocytes reflects the features of non-lesional psoriasis</a></h4>

              
                Psoriasis is a multifactorial disorder mediated by IL-17-producing T cells, involving immune cells and skin-constituting cells. Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A), an immune semaphorin, is known to take part in T helper type 1/17 differentiation and activation. However, Sema4A is also crucial for maintaining peripheral tissue homeostasis and its involvement in skin remains unknown. Here, we revealed that while Sema4A expression was pronounced in psoriatic blood lymphocytes and monocytes, it was downregulated in the keratinocytes of both psoriatic lesions and non-lesions compared to controls. Imiquimod application induced more severe dermatitis in Sema4A knockout (KO) mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The naïve skin of Sema4A KO mice showed increased T cell infiltration and IL-17A expression along with thicker epidermis and distinct cytokeratin expression compared to WT mice, which are hallmarks of psoriatic non-lesions. Analysis of bone marrow chimeric mice suggested that Sema4A expression in keratinocytes plays a regulatory role in imiquimod-induced dermatitis. The epidermis of psoriatic non-lesion and Sema4A KO mice demonstrated mTOR complex 1 upregulation, and the application of mTOR inhibitors reversed the skewed expression of cytokeratins in Sema4A KO mice. Conclusively, Sema4A-mediated signaling cascades can be triggers for psoriasis and targets in the treatment and prevention of psoriasis.

                Molecular chaperones are vital proteins that maintain protein homeostasis by assisting in protein folding, activation, degradation, and stress protection. Among them, heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) stands out as an essential proteostasis hub in eukaryotes, chaperoning hundreds of ‘clients’ (substrates). After decades of research, several ‘known unknowns’ about the molecular function of Hsp90 remain unanswered, hampering rational drug design for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative, and other diseases. We highlight three fundamental open questions, reviewing the current state of the field for each, and discuss new opportunities, including single-molecule technologies, to answer the known unknowns of the Hsp90 chaperone.

">Impact of bacterial translocation in stroke outcome. Soluble CD14 as early clinical marker and effect of TLR4</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial infections are among the most common complications in stroke patients. While some factors triggering these infections are well established, bacterial translocation (BT) from the intestine to other organs represents another significant factor to consider. In our study, we observed a high percentage of animals with intestinal barrier dysfunction (GBD) and BT following stroke, with typical intestinal bacteria even detected in the lungs. Moreover, this process not only exacerbates peripheral/central inflammation but also increases lesion size. In this context, our data in stroke patients demonstrate the presence of GBD, associated with elevated levels of soluble CD14 as a marker, and its strong correlation with neurological status, infarct volume, and the development of infections. Finally, our findings highlight the neuroprotective effects of the absence or pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 using ApTOLL, which not only reduces infarct volume and inflammation but also mitigates GBD/BT processes following experimental stroke.

">Evidence for distinct networks underlying symptom clusters of posttraumatic stress disorder</a></h4>

              
                Background: Clinical and psychometric evidence has long supported a multidimensional model of PTSD, with symptom subcategories derived from factor analytic methods. Although research on the biological bases of PTSD as a unitary construct is profuse, comparatively few studies have examined the neural mechanisms underlying subcategories of PTSD symptoms. The present study aimed to provide the first evidence of causal relationships between brain structure and PTSD symptom subcategories, using a lesion-behavior mapping approach. Methods: Using a group of male combat veterans with focal penetrating traumatic brain injuries (n = 177), we determined the effects of focal damage on the PTSD symptom subcategories of hyperarousal, avoidance, and re-experiencing. Results: Our findings revealed two distinct networks that underlie symptom subcategories of PTSD: (1) an amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex network underlying hyperarousal and avoidance symptoms, in which amygdala damage acts as a risk factor for the development of these symptoms, while vmPFC damage acts as a protective factor against the same symptoms; and (2) a hippocampal network underlying re-experiencing and avoidance, in which hippocampal damage acts as a protective factor against these symptoms. Conclusions: The present study provides novel insights regarding the causal role of key brain regions in the heterogeneous expression of PTSD symptoms. Results not only contribute to a more complete picture of the neural mechanisms underlying PTSD, but may also aid in the future development of individualized therapeutic strategies that target specific symptom profiles.

">Disrupted Maternal Behavior in Morphine-Dependent Pregnant Rats and Anhedonia in their Offspring</a></h4>

              
                It is currently estimated that every 15 minutes an infant is born with opioid use disorder and undergoes intense early life trauma due to opioid withdrawal. Clinical research on the long-term consequences of gestational opioid exposure reports increased rates of social, conduct, and emotional disorders in these children. Here, we investigate the impact of perinatal opioid exposure (POE) on behaviors associated with anhedonia and stress in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Young adult female rats were administered morphine via programmable, subcutaneous micro-infusion pumps before, during, and through one week post gestation. Maternal behavior was examined for fragmentation and entropy for the first two postnatal weeks; offspring were assessed for sucrose preference, social behavior, and stress responsivity. Overall, dams that received morphine across gestation displayed significantly less pup-directed behavior with increased fragmentation for nursing and higher entropy scores. In adolescence, male and female rat offspring exposed to morphine displayed reduced sucrose preference and, as adults, spent significantly less time socially interacting with familiar conspecifics. Changes in social behaviors were linked to increased activity in nondopaminergic mesolimbic reward brain regions. Although no treatment effects were observed in forced swim test performance, corticosterone levels were significantly increased in POE adult males. Together, these results suggest that perinatal morphine exposure results in anhedonic behavior, possibly due to fragmented and unpredictable maternal behavior in opioid-dependent dams.

">Predictive routing emerges from self-supervised stochastic neural plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiology studies propose that predictive coding is implemented via alpha/beta (8-30 Hz) rhythms that prepare specific pathways to process predicted inputs. This leads to a state of relative inhibition, reducing feedforward gamma (40-90 Hz) rhythms and spiking to predictable inputs. We refer to this model as predictive routing. It is currently unclear which circuit mechanisms implement this push-pull interaction between alpha/beta and gamma rhythms. To explore how predictive routing is implemented, we developed a self-supervised learning algorithm we call generalized Stochastic Delta Rule (gSDR). It was necessary to develop this learning rule because manual tuning of parameters (frequently used in computational modeling) is inefficient to search through a non-linear parameter space that defines how neuronal rhythms emerge and interact. We used gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits and validated the algorithm on simple tasks, e.g., tuning membrane potentials and firing rates. We next applied gSDR to model observed neurophysiology. We asked the model to reproduce a shift from baseline oscillatory dynamics (~<20Hz) to stimulus induced gamma (~40-90Hz) dynamics recorded in the macaque monkey visual cortex. This gamma-band oscillation during stimulation emerged by self-modulation of synaptic weights via gSDR. We further showed that the gamma-beta push-pull interactions implied by predictive routing could emerge via stochastic modulation of both local inhibitory circuitry as well as top-down modulatory inputs to a network. To summarize, we implemented gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits based on a series of objectives. gSDR succeeded in implementing these objectives. This revealed the inhibitory neuron mechanisms underlying the gamma-beta push-pull dynamics that are observed during predictive processing tasks in systems and cognitive neuroscience.

">Top-down inputs are controlled by somatostatin-expressing interneurons during associative learning</a></h4>

              
                Associative learning links sensory signals to their behavioral meaning by combining bottom-up inputs with top-down contextual information, enabling decision-making based on expected outcomes. It triggers plastic changes of neuronal responses in both excitatory and inhibitory cell populations. However, the role of inhibition in shaping this plasticity remains debated. Here we used chronic extracellular electrophysiology and optogenetic manipulation of inhibitory neurons and top-down inputs in mice learning an auditory discrimination task. We found that learning enhances stimulus selectivity in a subset of neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Interestingly, somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons decrease their response to the rewarded cue and bidirectionally regulate associative learning. More specifically, an increased activity of SST neurons impairs learning by altering bottom-up signaling, whereas the reduction of their activity facilitates learning by gating top-down inputs from the orbitofrontal cortex. These findings demonstrate that inhibition plays a critical role in gating top-down inputs to primary sensory cortices involved in associative learning.

">Supervised Spike Sorting Feasibility of Noisy Single-Electrode Extracellular Recordings: Systematic Study of Human C-Nociceptors recorded via Microneurography</a></h4>

              
                Sorting spikes from noisy single-channel in-vivo extracellular recordings is challenging, particularly due to the lack of ground truth data. Microneurography, an electrophysiological technique for studying peripheral sensory systems, employs experimental protocols that time-lock a subset of spikes. Stable propagation speed of nerve signals enables reliable sorting of these spikes. Leveraging this property, we established ground truth labels for data collected in two European laboratories and designed an open-source pipeline to process data across diverse hardware and software systems. Using the labels derived from the time-locked spikes, we employed a supervised approach instead of the unsupervised methods typically used in spike sorting. We evaluated multiple low-dimensional representations of spikes and found that raw signal features consistently outperformed more complex approaches, which are effective in brain recordings. However, the choice of the optimal features remained dataset-specific, influenced by the similarity of average spike shapes and the number of fibers contributing to the signal. Based on our findings, we recommend tailoring lightweight algorithms to individual recordings and assessing the "sortability feasibility" based on achieved accuracy and the research question before proceeding with sorting of non-time-locked spikes. Our approach provides the foundation for further development of spike sorting algorithms in noisy extracellular recordings of neural activity.

">Discovery of neuronal cell types by pairing whole cell reconstructions with RNA expression profiles</a></h4>

              
                Effective classification of neuronal cell types requires both molecular and morphological descriptors to be collected in situ at single cell resolution. However, current spatial transcriptomics techniques are not compatible with imaging workflows that successfully reconstruct the morphology of complete axonal projections. Here, we introduce a new methodology that combines tissue clearing, submicron whole-brain two photon imaging, and Expansion-Assisted Iterative Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (EASI-FISH) to assign molecular identities to fully reconstructed neurons in the mouse brain, which we call morphoFISH. We used morphoFISH to molecularly identify a previously unknown population of cingulate neurons projecting ipsilaterally to the dorsal striatum and contralaterally to higher-order thalamus. By pairing whole-brain morphometry, improved techniques for nucleic acid preservation and spatial gene expression, morphoFISH offers a quantitative solution for discovery of multimodal cell types and complements existing techniques for characterization of increasingly fine-grained cellular heterogeneity in brain circuits.

">Graph neural networks for integrated information and major complex estimation</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the potential of graph neural networks (GNNs) for estimating the system-level integrated information and major complex in integrated information theory (IIT) 3.0. Owing to the hierarchical complexity of IIT 3.0, tasks such as calculating integrated information and identifying major complex are computationally prohibitive for large systems, thereby restricting the applicability of IIT 3.0 to small systems. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a GNN model with transformer convolutional layers characterized by multi-head attention mechanisms for estimating the major complex and its integrated information. In our approach, exact solutions for integrated information and major complex are obtained for systems with 5, 6, and 7 nodes, and two evaluations are conducted: (1) a non-extrapolative setting in which the model is trained and tested on a mixture of systems with 5, 6, and 7 nodes, and (2) an extrapolative setting in which systems with 5 and 6 nodes are used for training and systems with 7 nodes are used for testing. The results indicate that the estimation performance in the extrapolative setting remains comparable to that in the non-extrapolative setting, showing no significant degradation. In an additional experiment, the model is trained on systems with 5, 6, and 7 nodes and tested on a larger system of 100 nodes, composed of two subsystems of 50 nodes each, with limited inter-subsystem connectivity resembling a split-brain configuration. When the connectivity between the subsystems is low, "local integration" emerges, meaning that a single subsystem forms a major complex. As the connectivity increases, local integration rapidly disappears, and the integrated information gradually rises toward "global integration," in which a large portion of the entire system forms a major complex. Overall, our findings suggest that GNNs can potentially be used for estimating integrated information, major complex, and other IIT-related quantities.

">Sleep patterns predicting stress resilience are dependent on sex</a></h4>

              
                Sleep disturbances and stress have a well-established link with neuropsychiatric illness; however, the nature of this relationship remains unclear. Recently, studies using the mouse social-defeat stress model revealed a causal role for non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in the maladaptive behavioral responses to stress. These results suggest a novel function for NREM sleep; as a response by cortical neurons to mitigate the maladaptive effects of stress. A major limitation in many social defeat studies has been the exclusion of females. Women exhibit a greater prevalence of both affective disorders and sleep disturbances compared to men, thus there is a clear need to understand sleep - stress interactions in females. The present study adapts recently developed female social-defeat stress models to allow social-defeat and EEG in male - female pairs. Our findings duplicated the behavioral responses that occurred in other female, nondiscriminatory, and male models of social-defeat stress. Analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, before exposure to stress, revealed that susceptibility to the behavioral effects of stress was associated with increased post-defeat NREM sleep--exclusively in females. In males, increased NREM sleep after social defeat stress occurred only in resilient mice. A potential cause of these sleep differences was also identified prior to stress exposure; we identified sex differences in recovery from NREM-sleep loss, thus, suggesting a sex-difference in the homeostatic process regulating sleep. These contrasting responses reveal sexual dimorphism in both NREM sleep predicting resilience and NREM sleep changes induced by social-defeat stress. When considered in the context of existing human literature, these findings suggest that sex is a major factor influencing the interaction of sleep with maladaptive behavioral responses to stress.

">Personalized cue-reactive delta-theta oscillations guide deep brain stimulation for opioid use disorder</a></h4>

              
                Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a significant public health concern, with over 30% failing available treatment. Severe SUD is characterized by drug-cue reactivity that predicts treatment-failure. We leveraged this pathophysiological feature to personalize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens region (NAc) in an SUD patient. While this DBS lead was externalized for clinical purposes, we administered a personalized drug cue-reactivity task while recording NAc electrophysiology. We identified a cue-evoked signal in the ventral NAc associated with intensification of opioid-related cravings, which attenuated with therapeutic stimulation delivered to this same area. DBS was then programmed to engage this subregion within NAc to account for the biomarker location, heralding the potential for personalized strategies to optimize DBS for SUD.

">Mitochondrial Complex I and ROS control synapse function through opposing pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Neurons require high amounts energy, and mitochondria help to fulfill this requirement. Dysfunctional mitochondria trigger problems in various neuronal tasks. Using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse, we previously reported that Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunits were required for maintaining NMJ function and growth. Here we report tissue-specific adaptations at the NMJ when MCI is depleted. In Drosophila motor neurons, MCI depletion causes profound cytological defects and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). But instead of diminishing synapse function, neuronal ROS triggers a homeostatic signaling process that maintains normal NMJ excitation. We identify molecules mediating this compensatory response. MCI depletion in muscles also enhances local ROS. But high levels of muscle ROS cause destructive responses: synapse degeneration, mitochondrial fragmentation, and impaired neurotransmission. In humans, mutations affecting MCI subunits cause severe neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The tissue-level effects that we describe in the Drosophila system are potentially relevant to forms of mitochondrial pathogenesis.

">Cortical Changes Associated with Isha Kriya Meditation Revealed by Encephalography in Novice and Experienced Meditators - a Longitudinal Pilot Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Isha Kriya (IK) is a widely available meditation practice that incorporates breathing regulation that has shown to improve self-reported symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression. An increasing amount of research has been published on the effects of various meditative practices on scalp electroencephalography (EEG). However, the effects of IK on cortical activity have not been reported previously. Methods: Healthy volunteers aged 18 years or older were invited to participate. Participants were categorized as novice or experienced in meditation. EEG spectral features, computed during the eyes-closed condition before and soon after each IK meditation practice, were evaluated both at the start and after 6 weeks of IK meditation training. Results: This longitudinal study examined the effects of IK meditation on cortical state and trait patterns in a cohort of eight participants who practiced IK meditation over a period of 6 weeks. Across the two sessions, a simultaneous increase in global periodic alpha power was observed in multiple subjects (N=6) but this was not observed in all subjects/sessions. We observed an increase in periodic theta band power, particularly in the frontal regions, which emerged as a common state effect in all participants. Longitudinally, we observed an increased periodic gamma power in the resting state EEG in all the experienced meditators in the parietal occipital region. The changes in novices on the other hand was in the alpha and beta bands. Conclusion: Overall, in this pilot study, we report the changes in the quantitative EEG of the practitioners of Isha Kriya meditation over a 6-week cycle and investigated the difference between the start and end of that period at an individual level. We recommend future studies with a larger sample size and over a longer duration.

">Osmolarity regulates C. elegans egg-laying behavior via parallel chemosensory and biophysical mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Animals alter their behavior in response to changes in the environment. Upon encountering hyperosmotic conditions, the nematode worm C. elegans initiates avoidance and cessation of egg-laying behavior. While the sensory pathway for osmotic avoidance is well-understood, less is known about how egg laying is inhibited. We analyzed egg-laying behavior after acute and chronic shifts to and from hyperosmotic media. Animals on 400 mM sorbitol stop laying eggs immediately but then resume ~3 hours later, after accumulating additional eggs in the uterus. Surprisingly, the hyperosmotic cessation of egg laying did not require known osmotic avoidance signaling pathways. Acute hyperosmotic shifts in hyperosmotic-resistant mutants overproducing glycerol also blocked egg laying, but these animals resumed egg laying more quickly than similarly treated wild-type animals. These results suggest that hyperosmotic conditions disrupt a "high-inside" hydrostatic pressure gradient required for egg laying. Consistent with this hypothesis, animals adapted to hyperosmotic conditions laid more eggs after acute shifts back to normosmic conditions. Optogenetic stimulation of the HSN egg-laying command neurons in hyper-osmotic treated animals led to fewer and slower egg-laying events, an effect not seen following direct optogenetic stimulation of the postsynaptic vulval muscles. Hyperosmotic conditions also affected egg-laying circuit activity with the vulval muscles showing reduced Ca2+ transient amplitudes and frequency even after egg-laying resumes. Together, these results indicate that hyperosmotic conditions regulate egg-laying via two parallel mechanisms: a sensory pathway that acts to reduce HSN excitability and neurotransmitter release, and a biophysical mechanism where a hydrostatic pressure gradient reports egg accumulation in the uterus.

">Bipolar and schizophrenia risk gene AKAP11 encodes an autophagy receptor coupling the regulation of PKA kinase network homeostasis to synaptic transmission</a></h4>

              
                Human genomic studies have identified protein-truncating variants in AKAP11 associated with both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, implicating a shared disease mechanism driven by loss-of-function. AKAP11, a protein kinase A (PKA) adaptor, plays a key role in degrading the PKA-RI complex through selective autophagy. However, the neuronal functions of AKAP11 and the impact of its loss-of-function remains largely uncharacterized. Through multi-omics approaches, cell biology, and electrophysiology analysis in mouse models and human induced neurons, we delineated a central role of AKAP11 in coupling PKA kinase network regulation to synaptic transmission. Loss of AKAP11 disrupted PKA activity and impaired cellular functions that significantly overlap with pathways associated with the psychiatric disease. Moreover, we identified interactions between AKAP11, the PKA-RI adaptor SPHKAP, and the ER-resident autophagy-related proteins VAPA/B, which co-adapt and mediate PKA-RI degradation. Notably, AKAP11 deficiency impaired neurotransmission and decreased presynaptic protein levels in neurons, providing key insights into the mechanism underlying AKAP11-associated psychiatric diseases.

	<p>Background: Elastic image fusion (EIF) using an intraoperative CT (iCT) scan may enhance neuronavigation accuracy and compensate for brain shift. Objective: To evaluate the safety and reliability of the EIF algorithm (Virtual iMRI Cranial 4.5, Brainlab AG, Munich Germany, for the identification of residual tumour in glioblastoma surgery. Moreover, the impact of brain shift on software reliability is assessed. Methods: This ambispective study included 80 patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma. Pre-operative MRI was elastically fused with an intraoperative CT scan (BodyTom; Samsung-Neurologica, Danvers, MA, USA) acquired at the end of the resection. Diagnostic specificity and the sensitivity of each tool was determined. The impact of brain shift on residual tumour was statistically analysed. An analysis of accuracy was performed through Target Registration Error (TRE) measurement after rigid image fusion (RIF) and EIF. A qualitative evaluation of each Virtual MRI image (VMRI) was performed. Results: VMRI identified residual tumour in 26/80 patients (32.5%), confirmed by post-operative MRI (true positive). Of these, 5 cases were left intentionally due to DES-positive responses, 8 cases underwent near maximal or subtotal resection, and 13 cases were not detected by iCT. However, in the other 27/80 cases (33.8%), VMRI reported residual tumour that was present neither on iCT nor on post-operative MRI (false positive). i-CT showed a sensitivity of 56% and specificity of 100%; VMRI demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 50%. Spearman correlation analysis showed a moderate correlation between pre-operative volume and VMRI tumour residual. Moreover, tumour involving insula or infiltrating more than one lobe displayed higher median values (p = 0.023) of virtual residual tumour. A statistically significant reduction towards lower TRE values after EIF was observed for test structures. Conclusions: Virtual iMRI was proven to be a feasible option to detect residual tumour. Its integration within a multimodal imaging protocol may provide neurosurgeons with intraoperatively updated imaging.</p>

                <p>Lysosomes and related precursor organelles robustly build up in swollen axons that surround amyloid plaques and disrupted axonal lysosome transport has been implicated in worsening Alzheimer's pathology. Our prior studies have revealed that loss of Adaptor protein-4 (AP-4) complex function, linked primarily to spastic paraplegia (HSP), leads to a similar build of lysosomes in structures we term "AP-4 dystrophies." Surprisingly, these AP-4 dystrophies were also characterized by enrichment of components of APP processing machinery, &beta;-site cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and Presenilin 2. Our studies examining whether the abnormal axonal lysosome buildup resulting from AP-4 loss could lead to amyloidogenesis revealed that the loss of AP-4 complex function in an Alzheimer's disease model resulted in a strong increase in size and abundance of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and corpus callosum as well as increased microglial association with the plaques. Interestingly, we found a further increase in enrichment of the secretase, BACE1, in the axonal swellings of the plaques of Alzheimer model mice lacking AP-4 complex compared with those having normal AP-4 complex function, suggestive of increased amyloidogenic processing under this condition. Additionally, the exacerbation of plaque pathology was region specific as it did not increase in the cortex. The burden of the AP-4 linked axonal dystrophies/AP-4 dystrophies was higher in the corpus callosum and hippocampus compared with the cortex, establishing the critical role of AP-4-dependent axonal lysosome transport and maturation in regulating amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein processing.</p>

The 3D structure of RNA critically influences its functionality, and understanding this structure is vital for deciphering RNA biology. Experimental methods for determining RNA structures are labour-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming. Computational approaches have emerged as valuable tools, leveraging physics-based-principles and machine learning to predict RNA structures rapidly. Despite advancements, the accuracy of computational methods remains modest, especially when compared to protein structure prediction. Deep learning methods, while successful in protein structure prediction, have shown some promise for RNA structure prediction as well, but face unique challenges. This study systematically benchmarks state-of-the-art deep learning methods for RNA structure prediction across diverse datasets. Our aim is to identify factors influencing performance variation, such as RNA family diversity, sequence length, RNA type, multiple sequence alignment (MSA) quality, and deep learning model architecture. We show that generally ML-based methods perform much better than non-ML methods on most RNA targets, although the performance difference isn’t substantial when working with unseen novel or synthetic RNAs. The quality of the MSA and secondary structure prediction both play an important role and most methods aren’t able to predict non-Watson-Crick pairs in the RNAs. Overall among the automated 3D RNA structure prediction methods, DeepFoldRNA has the best prediction followed by DRFold as the second best method. Finally, we also suggest possible mitigations to improve the quality of the prediction for future method development.

Menon</p>

BharatSim is an open-source agent-based modelling framework for the Indian population. It can simulate populations at multiple scales, from small communities to states. BharatSim uses a synthetic population created by applying statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to survey data from multiple sources, including the Census of India, the India Human Development Survey, the National Sample Survey, and the Gridded Population of the World. This synthetic population defines individual agents with multiple attributes, among them age, gender, home and work locations, pre-existing health conditions, and socio-economic and employment status. BharatSim’s domain-specific language provides a framework for the simulation of diverse models. Its computational core, coded in <i>Scala</i>, supports simulations of a large number of individual agents, up to 50 million. Here, we describe the design and implementation of BharatSim, using it to address three questions motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic in India: (i) When can schools be safely reopened given specified levels of hybrid immunity?, (ii) How do new variants alter disease dynamics in the background of prior infections and vaccinations? and (iii) How can the effects of varied non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) be quantified for a model Indian city? Through its India-specific synthetic population, BharatSim allows disease modellers to address questions unique to this country. It should also find use in the computational social sciences, potentially providing new insights into emergent patterns in social behaviour.

                <p>by Ethan Kulman, Rui Kuang, Quaid Morris</p>

Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer, i.e., <i>cancer phylogenies</i>, offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies. Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing. However, these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations, or, in some cases, fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Here, we introduce <i>Orchard</i>, a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations. Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, a novel result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). Remarkably, Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1,000 mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations.

                <p>by Ryohei Shibue, Tomoharu Iwata</p>

Spike train modeling across large neural populations is a powerful tool for understanding how neurons code information in a coordinated manner. Recent studies have employed marked point processes in neural population modeling. The marked point process is a stochastic process that generates a sequence of events with marks. Spike train models based on such processes use the waveform features of spikes as marks and express the generative structure of the unsorted spikes without applying spike sorting. In such modeling, the goal is to estimate the joint mark intensity that describes how observed covariates or hidden states (e.g., animal behaviors, animal internal states, and experimental conditions) influence unsorted spikes. A major issue with this approach is that existing joint mark intensity models are not designed to capture high-dimensional and highly nonlinear observations. To address this limitation, we propose a new joint mark intensity model based on a variational autoencoder, capable of representing the dependency structure of unsorted spikes on observed covariates or hidden states in a data-driven manner. Our model defines the joint mark intensity as a latent variable model, where a neural network decoder transforms a shared latent variable into states and marks. With our model, we derive a new log-likelihood lower bound by exploiting the variational evidence lower bound and upper bound (e.g., the <i>χ</i> upper bound) and use this new lower bound for parameter estimation. To demonstrate the strength of this approach, we integrate our model into a state space model with a nonlinear embedding to capture the hidden state dynamics underlying the observed covariates and unsorted spikes. This enables us to reconstruct covariates from unsorted spikes, known as neural decoding. Our model achieves superior performance in prediction and decoding tasks for synthetic data and the spiking activities of place cells.

                <p>by Faye Orcales, Lucy Moctezuma Tan, Meris Johnson-Hagler, John Matthew Suntay, Jameel Ali, Kristiene Recto, Phelan Glenn, Pleuni Pennings</p>

Antibiotic resistance is a global public health concern. Bacteria have evolved resistance to most antibiotics, which means that for any given bacterial infection, the bacteria may be resistant to one or several antibiotics. It has been suggested that genomic sequencing and machine learning (ML) could make resistance testing more accurate and cost-effective. Given that ML is likely to become an ever more important tool in medicine, we believe that it is important for pre-health students and others in the life sciences to learn to use ML tools. This paper provides a step-by-step tutorial to train 4 different ML models (logistic regression, random forests, extreme gradient-boosted trees, and neural networks) to predict drug resistance for <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolates and to evaluate their performance using different metrics and cross-validation techniques. We also guide the user in how to load and prepare the data used for the ML models. The tutorial is accessible to beginners and does not require any software to be installed as it is based on Google Colab notebooks and provides a basic understanding of the different ML models. The tutorial can be used in undergraduate and graduate classes for students in Biology, Public Health, Computer Science, or related fields.

<p>There are no dramatically effective pharmacological treatments for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a complex disease with multiple underlying mechanisms, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome alteration, and antiretroviral activity. We sifted through 15 years of reviews by a group called ALSUntangled to identify 8 alternative and off-label treatments that target ≥1 of these mechanisms, and have ≥1 human trial suggesting meaningful benefits. Given the overlapping pathological mechanisms of the highlighted products, we suggest that combinations of these treatments targeting diverse mechanisms might be worthwhile for future amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy development.

                <p>Oropouche virus (OROV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) in the <i>Orthobunyavirus</i> genus and <i>Peribunyaviridae</i> viral family that is endemic to parts of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. It has recently emerged in Cuba, and travel-imported cases are recently being reported in the United States and Europe. Typically maintained in a sylvatic cycle between certain forest sloths, non-human primates, birds, and mosquitoes, OROV disease outbreaks can occur in an urban cycle between certain biting midges and/or mosquitoes and humans. Clinically, approximately 60% of infections are symptomatic with an abrupt fever and non-specific influenza-like illness within 3 to 10 days. Many initial OROV infections can present similarly to chikungunya, dengue, and Zika virus infections. Interestingly, OROV infections can follow a biphasic course with recurrence of symptoms approximately 1 week after initial symptom onset. Concerningly, similar to Zika virus, it appears that vertical transmission of OROV may occur with potentially adverse effects on fetal development including miscarriages. Neuroinvasion of OROV occurs in animal models, and human cases of meningitis, encephalitis, and peri-infectious Guillain-Barré syndrome have all been reported. Diagnosis is either through detection of OROV nucleic acid, OROV immunoglobulin M, or OROV neutralizing antibodies in the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. No antiviral treatments are available, and there are no current vaccines. Preventing mosquito and biting midge bites is key. Neurologists should be aware of and report any potential neuroinvasive OROV disease cases to local/state/territorial health departments. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:28–33</p>

                <p>Obesity is implicated in the development of multiple sclerosis (MS), but its effect on disability is less well-established. This study examined the effects of various obesity measures on MS severity in 12,584 MS cases, using Mendelian randomization to mitigate confounding. Results showed a significant association between higher genetically-determined body mass index (N = 806,834) and increased MS severity (<i>P</i> = 0.02). This finding was supported by additional measures of general obesity but not adiposity distribution. The convergence of this genetic evidence with prior observational studies strengthens the association between obesity and adverse long-term disability in MS, suggesting weight management as a potential therapeutic strategy.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Clemastine has emerged as a promising therapy for the restoration of neurologic function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). However, clemastine and other agents with prodifferentiative effects on oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in rodent models have underperformed in clinical trials. We hypothesized that the preclinical studies showed more robust effects because of the abundance of OPCs in rodent models. To better examine the therapeutic potential of clemastine, we examined its effect on demyelinated white matter lesions in rabbits, which exhibit progenitor densities and limited remyelination more closely matching those found in tissues from patients with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used lysolecithin to induce demyelination in white matter of New Zealand rabbits and then administered oral clemastine (10mg/kg/day) for various periods before assessing the OPC and oligodendrocyte (OL) populations in these lesions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Daily administration of clemastine for the full study period (56 days) increased oligodendrogenesis in white matter lesions. However, shorter durations of treatment failed to increase overall OL density despite enhancing OPC-to-OL differentiation. This effect was due to exhaustion of the OPC pool, as the differentiating progenitors were not replaced because of reduced OPC proliferation. Notably, delayed administration of clemastine led to an accumulation of activated OPCs expressing markers of senescence.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although capable of driving OL differentiation, clemastine treatment in rabbits hampered progenitor pool replenishment, induced senescence, and promoted conversion of microglia/macrophages to a proinflammatory phenotype. Whether these effects would also occur in humans or with other prodifferentiative therapies should be studied further, but our data suggest the need to carefully consider progenitor dynamics in the treatment of MS.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is currently scarce data on the electroclinical characteristics of epilepsy associated with synapsin 1 (<i>SYN1</i>) pathogenic variations. We examined clinical and electro-encephalographic (EEG) features in patients with epilepsy and <i>SYN1</i> variants, with the aim of identifying a distinctive electroclinical pattern.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected and reviewed demographic, genetic, and epilepsy data of 19 male patients with <i>SYN1</i> variants. Specifically, we analyzed interictal EEG data for all patients, and electro-clinical data from 10 epileptic seizures in 5 patients, using prolonged video-EEG monitoring recordings. Inter-ictal EEG functional connectivity parameters and frequency spectrum of the 10 patients over 12 years of age, were computed and compared with those of 56 age- and sex-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The main electroclinical features of epilepsy in patients with <i>SYN1</i> were (1) EEG background and organization mainly normal; (2) interictal abnormalities are often rare or not visible on EEG; (3) more than 60% of patients had reflex seizures (cutaneous contact with water and defecation being the main triggers) isolated or associated with spontaneous seizures; (4) electro-clinical semiology of seizures was mainly temporal or temporo-insulo/perisylvian with a notable autonomic component; and (5) ictal EEG showed a characteristic rhythmic theta/delta activity predominating in temporo-perisylvian regions at the beginning of most seizures. Comparing patients with <i>SYN1</i> to healthy subjects, we observed a shift to lower frequency bands in power spectrum of interictal EEG and an increased connectivity in both temporal regions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A distinct epilepsy syndrome emerges in patients with <i>SYN1</i>, with a rather characteristic clinical and EEG pattern suggesting predominant temporo-insular involvement. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:34–50</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>De novo variants in <i>cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase</i> (<i>CUL3</i>) have been strongly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), but no large case series have been reported so far. Here, we aimed to collect sporadic cases carrying rare variants in <i>CUL3</i>, describe the genotype–phenotype correlation, and investigate the underlying pathogenic mechanism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Genetic data and detailed clinical records were collected via multicenter collaboration. Dysmorphic facial features were analyzed using GestaltMatcher. Variant effects on CUL3 protein stability were assessed using patient-derived T-cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We assembled a cohort of 37 individuals with heterozygous <i>CUL3</i> variants presenting a syndromic NDD characterized by intellectual disability with or without autistic features. Of these, 35 have loss-of-function (LoF) and 2 have missense variants. <i>CUL3</i> LoF variants in patients may affect protein stability leading to perturbations in protein homeostasis, as evidenced by decreased ubiquitin-protein conjugates in vitro. Notably, we show that 4E-BP1 (EIF4EBP1), a prominent substrate of CUL3, fails to be targeted for proteasomal degradation in patient-derived cells.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further refines the clinical and mutational spectrum of <i>CUL3</i>-associated NDDs, expands the spectrum of cullin RING E3 ligase-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, and suggests haploinsufficiency via LoF variants is the predominant pathogenic mechanism.

                <h2>Background</h2>
<p>The study aimed to compare outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in pediatric patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA) versus cardioembolism (CE).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from the Save ChildS and KidClot cohorts were merged. Children with AIS because of FCA or CE that underwent MT were included. The study used the Childhood Arterial Ischemic Stroke Standardized Classification and Diagnostic Evaluation (CASCADE) for stroke cause assessment. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models were used to analyze final modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) scores, periprocedural complications, and functional outcomes assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 6 to 12 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The analysis included 60 children with 14 FCA and 46 CE cases. CE etiology was associated with better revascularization (good to excellent thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scores) and shift toward better outcomes (common adjusted odds ratio of mRs for CE vs FCA: 0.27, 95% CI: [0.06–0.97], <i>p</i> = 0.039), with no difference in favorable outcome rates. FCA was associated with significantly lower rates of excellent revascularization (21% vs 65%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No difference in complications' rates was observed between the groups (7.2% in FCA vs 5.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.69).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found that pediatric AIS because of CE etiology has more favorable procedural outcomes compared to FCA following MT. This translated to mixed functional outcomes that may be more favorable in the CE group. These findings highlight the need for further research to refine treatment protocols for pediatric stroke, particularly in understanding and managing FCA in children.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), the most common pathology associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), is not always visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), causing surgical delays and reduced postsurgical seizure-freedom. We developed an open-source software to characterize and localize HS to aid the presurgical evaluation of children and adults with suspected TLE.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included a multicenter cohort of 365 participants (154 HS; 90 disease controls; 121 healthy controls). HippUnfold was used to extract morphological surface-based features and volumes of the hippocampus from T1-weighted MRI scans. We characterized pathological hippocampi in patients by comparing them to normative growth charts and analyzing within-subject feature asymmetries. Feature asymmetry scores were used to train a logistic regression classifier to detect and lateralize HS. The classifier was validated on an independent multicenter cohort of 275 patients with HS and 161 healthy and disease controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>HS was characterized by decreased volume, thickness, and gyrification alongside increased mean and intrinsic curvature. The classifier detected 90.1% of unilateral HS patients and lateralized lesions in 97.4%. In patients with MRI-negative histopathologically-confirmed HS, the classifier detected 79.2% (19/24) and lateralized 91.7% (22/24). The model achieved similar performances on the independent cohort, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new data. Individual patient reports contextualize a patient's hippocampal features in relation to normative growth trajectories, visualise feature asymmetries, and report classifier predictions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Automated and Interpretable Detection of Hippocampal Sclerosis (AID-HS) is an open-source pipeline for detecting and lateralizing HS and outputting clinically-relevant reports. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:62–75</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The introduction of disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) has led to a deceleration of disease course over the years. Although decreased relapse rate constitutes a factor, the role of relapse-associated worsening (RAW) and progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) in MS course deceleration is still unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively examined long-term Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression in patients referred to the MS Center of Montichiari (Italy) and diagnosed with relapsing–remitting MS from 1980 to 2022. To isolate PIRA, we deducted all EDSS changes associated with relapses from overall EDSS change. We compared the relative contribution of PIRA and RAW to EDSS progression in patients diagnosed in different periods using mixed-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,405 patients were included in the study, of whom 231 were diagnosed in 1980–1996 (pre-treatment era), 577 in 1997–2008 (injectable disease-modifying therapy era), and 597 after 2008 (oral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and anti-CD20 era). Across ages, both PIRA and RAW were reduced in patients diagnosed in more recent periods as compared with earlier periods. The average contribution of PIRA to overall EDSS progression was already predominant in patients diagnosed in 1980–1996 (78%) and in 1997–2008 (76%), but it was significantly increased (<i>p</i> = 0.0009) in patients diagnosed in later years (87%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The deceleration of MS course observed throughout the years is determined not only by fewer RAW events, but also by a reduction in PIRA. However, the shift toward a mostly relapse-independent progression highlights the importance of evaluating new therapies based on their effect on PIRA. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:95–103</p>

<p>We included 10 participants who underwent STN-DBS and presented severe preoperative FOG, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. We used segmented DBS electrodes to investigate whether directing the predicted volume of tissue activated (VTA) to overlap the central STN preferentially improved gait and balance disorders compared to directional DBS applied in the more posterior STN (sensorimotor). We also assessed non-directional (ring-mode) STN-DBS. Our primary outcome was gait and balance control measured using instrumented gait recordings. Each patient had a pre-operative structural and diffusion-weighted imaging to model individual VTAs and to examine cortico-subthalamic connectivity. We used linear mixed-effects models to contrast the effects of central STN-dDBS, posterior STN-dDBS, and ring-mode STN-DBS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Central STN-dDBS produced significantly better improvement in gait and balance control compared to posterior STN-dDBS (<i>p</i> = 0.027), with fewer FOG episodes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Conversely, ring-mode STN-DBS resulted in worsened postural control compared to central STN-dDBS (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The cortico-subthalamic connectivity with the STN VTAs involved mostly primary sensorimotor, premotor, and medial frontal cortices, with a higher overall cortico-STN connectivity with ring-mode STN-DBS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Central STN-dDBS represents the best option to improve gait and balance disorders in PD patients, including FOG. Our findings raise the possibility of reprogramming STN-DBS toward the central area in selected patients with disabling FOG and/or postural instability after surgery.

<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Pathological studies suggest that multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions endure multiple waves of damage and repair; however, the dynamics and characteristics of these processes are poorly understood in patients living with MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 128 MS patients (75 relapsing–remitting, 53 progressive) and 72 healthy controls who underwent advanced magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination at baseline and 2 years later. Magnetization transfer saturation and multi-shell diffusion imaging were used to quantify longitudinal changes in myelin and axon volumes within MS lesions. Lesions were grouped into 4 classes (repair, damage, mixed repair damage, and stable). The frequency of each class was correlated to clinical measures, demographic characteristics, and levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stable lesions were the most frequent (<i>n</i> = 2,276; 44%), followed by lesions with patterns of “repair” (<i>n</i> = 1,352; 26.2%) and damage (<i>n</i> = 1,214; 23.5%). The frequency of “repair” lesion was negatively associated with disability (β = −0.04; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and sNfL (β = −0.16; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at follow-up. The frequency of the “damage” class was higher in progressive than relapsing–remitting patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and was related to disability (baseline: β = −0.078; follow-up: β = −0.076; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and age (baseline: β = −0.078; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Stable lesions were more frequent in relapsing–remitting than in progressive patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and in younger patients versus older (β = −0.07; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline. Further, “mixed” lesions were most frequent in older patients (β = 0.004; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at baseline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings show that repair and damage processes within MS lesions occur across the entire disease spectrum and that their frequency correlates with patients disability, age, disease duration, and extent of neuroaxonal damage. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:134–148</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After severe corticospinal tract damage poststroke in humans, some recovery of strength and movement proximally is evident. It is possible that alternate motor pathways, such as the reticulospinal tract, may be upregulated to compensate for the loss of corticospinal tract input. We investigated the extent of reticulospinal tract excitability modulation and its inter-dependence on the severity of corticospinal tract damage after stroke in humans.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a novel startle conditioned transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm to elicit ipsilateral motor evoked potentials, an index of reticulospinal tract excitability, in 22 chronic stroke participants with mild to severe corticospinal tract damage and 14 neurotypical age-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was higher in the paretic arm of people with severe corticospinal tract damage compared to their non-paretic arm, people with mild corticospinal tract damage, and age-matched controls. Interestingly, ipsilateral motor evoked potential presence was correlated with motor impairment across the entire stroke cohort, whereby individuals with worse impairment exhibited more frequent ipsilateral motor evoked potentials (ie, higher reticulospinal tract excitability).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Following severe corticospinal tract damage, upregulated reticulospinal tract activity may compensate for a loss of corticospinal tract input, providing some proximal recovery of isolated and within-synergy movements, but deficits in performing out of synergy movements and finger fractionation remain. Interventions aimed at modulating the reticulospinal tract could be beneficial or detrimental to ameliorating motor impairment depending on the degree of reliance on this pathway for residual motor output.

                <p>Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was shown to be safe and efficacious in patients with large core stroke in multiple randomized controlled trials. However, the impact of reperfusion and other procedural metrics on EVT outcomes in this population has not been well-characterized.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From the SELECT2 trial, we evaluated the association between reperfusion status, first-pass effect (near-complete or complete reperfusion [extended thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (eTICI) 2c-3] in 1 pass), procedure time and primary technique (aspiration vs stent-retriever) with functional outcomes in patients receiving EVT across ASPECTS (3 vs 4 vs 5) and core estimate strata (&lt;70 vs ≥70ml, &lt;100 vs ≥100ml, and &lt;150 vs ≥150ml).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 180 patients who received thrombectomy, 144 (80%) achieved successful reperfusion (eTICI 2b-3) and demonstrated better clinical outcomes (adjusted generalized odds ratios [aGenOR]: 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–2.15), compared with unsuccessful reperfusion. Results were consistent across ASPECTS and core estimate strata. Additionally, complete or near-complete reperfusion (eTICI 2c-3) was associated with better functional outcome (aGenOR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.33–2.97) in patients achieving successful reperfusion. Functional outcome point estimates favored those with first-pass-effect (42 of 167 (25%), aGenOR: 1.46, 95% CI: 0.96–2.24). Longer procedure time was associated with worse modified Rankin scale (mRS) distribution (aGenOR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87–0.96, <i>p</i>-value = 0.001 for 10 minutes increment). Aspiration-first technique was used in 43 of 154 (25%) patients and was not associated with higher reperfusion (88% vs 78%, <i>p</i> = 0.18) or better functional outcome (aGenOR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.50–1.10) as compared with stent-retriever first.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Successful reperfusion resulted in improved clinical outcomes in large core patients across baseline ischemic core strata. Near complete or complete reperfusion was further associated with better outcomes, whereas prolonged procedures were associated with worse outcomes. Results were consistent regardless of the technique used. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:175–184</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) poses high mortality and morbidity rates with limited evidence-based therapeutic approaches. We aimed to evaluate the current evidence for the role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in the management of ICH.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This systematic review and meta-analysis followed recommended guidelines and protocols. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception up to April 12, 2024. The inclusion was restricted to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of high quality, ensuring they were not deemed to have a high risk of bias in any of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2) domains. Primary outcomes were good functional outcome (modified Rankin scale, 0–3) and mortality beyond 90 days. Secondary outcomes were early mortality within 30 days and rebleeding rates. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fourteen high-quality RCTs were included. There were 3,027 patients with ICH (1,475 randomized to MIS, and 1,452 randomized to medical management or craniotomy). Of included patients, 1,899 (62.7%) were males. MIS resulted in higher odds of achieving long-term good functional outcome (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.25–1.82]), lower odds of long-term mortality (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.57–0.90]) and lower odds of early mortality (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.95]). Rebleeding rates were similar (OR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.55–2.19]). The treatment effect of MIS was consistent across multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including individuals with deep ICH.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This meta-analysis provides high-quality clinical trial evidence supporting the use of MIS as a primary treatment strategy in the management of ICH. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:185–194</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27069?af=R">Mapping Functional Connectivity Signatures of Pharmacoresistant Focal Cortical Dysplasia‐Related Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine common network alterations in focal cortical dysplasia pharmacoresistant epilepsy (FCD-PRE) using functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective imaging cohort from Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA) from January, 2011 to January, 2022. Patients with 3-T MRI-confirmed FCD-PRE underwent rsfMRI as part of routine clinical care. Patients were included if they were age 5–22 years at the time of the scan, and had a minimum of 18 months of follow-up. Healthy, typically-developing controls were included from Children's National Hospital (n = 16) and matched from Human Connectome Project-Development public dataset (n = 100).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 42 FCD-PRE patients (20 M:22 F, aged 14.2 ± 4.1 years) and 116 healthy controls (56 M:60 F, aged 13.7 ± 3.3 years) with rsfMRI were included. Seed-based functional connectivity maps were generated for each FCD, and each seed was used to generate a patient-specific z-scored connectivity map on 116 controls. FCD-PRE patients had mutual altered connectivity in regions of dorsal attention, default mode, and control networks. Functional connectivity was diminished within the FCD dominant functional network, as well as in homotopic regions. Cluster specific connectivity patterns varied by pathological subtype. Higher FCD connectivity to the limbic network was associated with increased odds of Engel I outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates diminished functional connectivity patterns in FCD-PRE, which may represent a neuromarker for the disease, independent of FCD location, involving the dorsal attention, default mode, and control functional networks. Higher connectivity to the limbic network is associated with a seizure-free outcome. Future multicenter, prospective studies are needed to allow for much earlier detection of signatures of treatment-resistant epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:51–61</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the longitudinal dynamics of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) under B-cell depleting therapy (BCDT) and their capacity to prognosticate future progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) events.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 362 pwMS (1,480 samples) starting BCDT in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Cohort were included. sGFAP levels in 2,861 control persons (4,943 samples) provided normative data to calculate adjusted Z scores.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Elevated sGFAP levels (Z score &gt;1) at 1 year were associated with a higher hazard for PIRA (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.80 [95% CI: 1.17–2.78]; <i>p</i> = 0.0079) than elevated sNfL levels (HR, 1.45 [0.95–2.24], <i>p</i> = 0.0886) in a combined model. Independent of PIRA events, sGFAP levels longitudinally increased by 0.49 Z score units per 10 years follow-up (estimate, 0.49 [0.29, 0.69], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). In patients experiencing PIRA, sGFAP Z scores were 0.52 Z score units higher versus stable patients (0.52 [0.22, 0.83], <i>p</i> = 0.0009). Different sNfL Z score trajectories were found in pwMS with versus without PIRA (interaction <i>p</i> = 0.0028), with an average decrease of 0.92 Z score units per 10 years observed without PIRA (−0.92 [−1.23, −0.60], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), whereas levels in patients with PIRA remained high.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elevated sGFAP and lack of drop in sNfL after BCDT start are associated with increased risk of future PIRA. These findings provide a rationale for combined monitoring of sNfL and sGFAP in pwMS starting BCDT to predict the risk of PIRA, and to use sGFAP as an outcome in clinical trials aiming to impact on MS progressive disease biology.

                Zhou et al. found that CDK1 can phosphorylate IMPDH2 and suppress its basal enzymatic activity and allosteric regulation. FGFR signaling activation promotes PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of IMPDH2 and thereby enhances guanine nucleotide synthesis for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Consequently, elevation of IMPDH2 activity by FGFR activation contributes to tumor cell growth.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99757">Aberrant auditory prediction patterns robustly characterize tinnitus</a></h4>

              
                Phantom perceptions like tinnitus occur without any identifiable environmental or bodily source. The mechanisms and key drivers behind tinnitus are poorly understood. The dominant framework, suggesting that tinnitus results from neural hyperactivity in the auditory pathway following hearing damage, has been difficult to investigate in humans and has reached explanatory limits. As a result, researchers have tried to explain perceptual and potential neural aberrations in tinnitus within a more parsimonious predictive-coding framework. In two independent magnetoencephalography studies, participants passively listened to sequences of pure tones with varying levels of regularity (i.e. predictability) ranging from random to ordered. Aside from being a replication of the first study, the pre-registered second study, including 80 participants, ensured rigorous matching of hearing status, as well as age, sex, and hearing loss, between individuals with and without tinnitus. Despite some changes in the details of the paradigm, both studies equivalently reveal a group difference in neural representation, based on multivariate pattern analysis, of upcoming stimuli before their onset. These data strongly suggest that individuals with tinnitus engage anticipatory auditory predictions differently to controls. While the observation of different predictive processes is robust and replicable, the precise neurocognitive mechanism underlying it calls for further, ideally longitudinal, studies to establish its role as a potential contributor to, and/or consequence of, tinnitus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98344">TCR transgenic clone selection guided by immune receptor analysis and single-cell RNA expression of polyclonal responders</a></h4>

              
                Since the precursor frequency of naive T cells is extremely low, investigating the early steps of antigen-specific T cell activation is challenging. To overcome this detection problem, adoptive transfer of a cohort of T cells purified from T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic donors has been extensively used but is not readily available for emerging pathogens. Constructing TCR transgenic mice from T cell hybridomas is a labor-intensive and sometimes erratic process, since the best clones are selected based on antigen-induced CD69 upregulation or IL-2 production in vitro, and TCR chains are polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-cloned into expression vectors. Here, we exploited the rapid advances in single-cell sequencing and TCR repertoire analysis to select the best clones without hybridoma selection, and generated CORSET8 mice (<b>COR</b>ona <b>S</b>pike <b>E</b>pitope specific CD8 <b>T</b> cell), carrying a TCR specific for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Implementing newly created DALI software for TCR repertoire analysis in single-cell analysis enabled the rapid selection of the ideal responder CD8 T cell clone, based on antigen reactivity, proliferation, and immunophenotype in vivo. Identified TCR sequences were inserted as synthetic DNA into an expression vector and transgenic CORSET8 donor mice were created. After immunization with Spike/CpG-motifs, mRNA vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection, CORSET8 T cells strongly proliferated and showed signs of T cell activation. Thus, a combination of TCR repertoire analysis and scRNA immunophenotyping allowed rapid selection of antigen-specific TCR sequences that can be used to generate TCR transgenic mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98867">NK cell exhaustion in Wilson’s disease revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing predicts the prognosis of cholecystitis</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic abnormalities associated with liver disease have a significant impact on the risk and prognosis of cholecystitis. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated this issue using Wilson’s disease (WD) as a model, which is a genetic disorder characterized by impaired mitochondrial function and copper metabolism. Our retrospective clinical study found that WD patients have a significantly higher incidence of cholecystitis and a poorer prognosis. The hepatic immune cell landscape using single-cell RNA sequencing showed that the tissue immune microenvironment is altered in WD, mainly a major change in the constitution and function of the innate immune system. Exhaustion of natural killer (NK) cells is the fundamental factor, supported by the upregulated expression of inhibitory receptors and the downregulated expression of cytotoxic molecules, which was verified in clinical samples. Further bioinformatic analysis confirmed a positive correlation between NK cell exhaustion and poor prognosis in cholecystitis and other inflammatory diseases. The study demonstrated dysfunction of liver immune cells triggered by specific metabolic abnormalities in WD, with a focus on the correlation between NK cell exhaustion and poor healing of cholecystitis, providing new insights into the improvement of inflammatory diseases by assessing immune cell function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98535">Flamingo participates in multiple models of cell competition</a></h4>

              
                The growth and survival of cells with different fitness, such as those with a proliferative advantage or a deleterious mutation, is controlled through cell competition. During development, cell competition enables healthy cells to eliminate less fit cells that could jeopardize tissue integrity, and facilitates the elimination of pre-malignant cells by healthy cells as a surveillance mechanism to prevent oncogenesis. Malignant cells also benefit from cell competition to promote their expansion. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the mechanisms governing cell competition, particularly those common to developmental competition and tumorigenesis, are poorly understood. Here, we show that in <i>Drosophila</i>, the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Flamingo (Fmi) is required by winners to maintain their status during cell competition in malignant tumors to overtake healthy tissue, in early pre-malignant cells when they overproliferate among wildtype cells, in healthy cells when they later eliminate pre-malignant cells, and by supercompetitors as they compete to occupy excessive territory within wildtype tissues. ‘Would-be’ winners that lack Fmi are unable to overproliferate, and instead become losers. We demonstrate that the role of Fmi in cell competition is independent of PCP, and that it uses a distinct mechanism that may more closely resemble one used in other less well-defined functions of Fmi.

">Neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental roles for bulk lipid transporters VPS13A and BLTP2 in movement disorders</a></h4>

              
                Background: Bridge-like lipid transfer proteins (BLTPs) mediate bulk lipid transport at membrane contact sites. Mutations in BLTPs are linked to both early-onset neurodevelopmental and later-onset neurodegenerative diseases, including movement disorders. The tissue specificity and temporal requirements of BLTPs in disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Objectives: To determine the age-of-onset and tissue-specific roles of VPS13A and BLTP2 in movement disorder pathogenesis using Drosophila models. Methods: We generated tissue-specific knockdowns of the VPS13A ortholog (Vps13) and the BLTP2 ortholog (hobbit) in neurons and muscles of Drosophila. We analyzed age-dependent locomotor behavior, neurodegeneration, and synapse development and function. Results: Neuron-specific loss of the VPS13A ortholog caused neurodegeneration followed by age-onset movement deficits and reduced lifespan, while muscle-specific loss affected only lifespan, revealing neurodegeneration and myopathy as independent comorbidities in VPS13A disease. In contrast, neuronal loss of the BLTP2 ortholog resulted in severe early-onset locomotor defects without neurodegeneration, while muscle loss impaired synaptogenesis and neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Conclusions: VPS13A maintains neuronal survival, while BLTP2 orchestrates synaptic development. VPS13A function in muscle does not play a role in movement defects. The phenotypic specificity of BLTP function provides mechanistic insights into distinct disease trajectories for BLTP-associated movement disorders.

">Weight Transfer in the Reinforcement Learning Model of Songbird Acquisition</a></h4>

              
                Song acquisition behavior observed in the songbird system provides a notable example of learning through trial-and-error which parallels human speech acquisition. Studying songbird vocal learning can offer insights into mechanisms underlying human language. We present a computational model of song learning that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and Hebbian learning and agrees with known songbird circuitry. The song circuit outputs activity from nucleus RA, which receives two primary inputs: timing information from area HVC and stochastic activity from nucleus LMAN. Additionally, song learning relies on Area X, a basal ganglia area that receives dopaminergic inputs from VTA. In our model, song is first acquired in the HVC-to-Area X connectivity, employing an RL mechanism that involves node perturbation. This information is then consolidated into HVC-to-RA synapses through a Hebbian mechanism. The transfer of weights from Area X to RA takes place via the thalamus, utilizing a specific form of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Thus, we present a computational model grounded in songbird circuitry in which the optimal policy is initially guided by RL and subsequently transferred to another circuit through Hebbian plasticity.

">When do measured representational distances reflect the neural representational geometry?</a></h4>

              
                The representational geometry of a brain region can be characterized by the distances among neural activity patterns for a set of experimental conditions. Researchers routinely estimate representational distances from brain-activity measurements that either sparsely sample the underlying neural population (e.g. neural recordings) or pool across the activity of many neurons (e.g. fMRI voxels). Here we use theory and simulations to clarify under what circumstances representational distances estimated from brain-activity measurements reflect the representational geometry of the underlying neural population, and what distortions must be expected under other circumstances. We demonstrate that the estimated representational distances are undistorted if single neurons are sampled at random. For voxels that take non-negatively weighted linear combinations, the resulting geometry is linearly distorted, correctly reflecting the population-mean dimension, while downscaling all orthogonal dimensions, for which the averaging cancels a large portion of the signal. Surprisingly, removing the mean from voxel patterns recovers the underlying representational geometry exactly in expectation under idealized conditions. This explains why the correlation distance, the most popular measure of representational dissimilarity in neuroimaging studies, ``works" so well, yielding geometries that can appear similar between fMRI and neural recordings. The Euclidean (or Mahalanobis) distance computed after removing the mean of each pattern (without normalizing its variance) is an attractive alternative to the correlation distance in that it corrects for the inflated relative contribution of the population-mean dimension, while avoiding the drawback of the correlation distance: it can be large for confusable low-norm patterns, failing to reflect decodability. Our results demonstrate that measured representational distances reflect the neural representational geometry when (1) single neurons are sampled at random or (2) the weights with which the measured responses sample the neurons are drawn i.i.d. and (2a) the weights are drawn from a zero-mean distribution or (2b) the population mean is the same for all conditions or (2c) the mean is removed from each estimated pattern. We discuss practical implications for analyses of neural representational geometries.

">The deep winding at the brain surface: replicating a historical report associating the 'bridged' central sulcus with the pli de passage fronto-parietal moyen</a></h4>

              
                In 1876, the anatomist Heschl surveyed 1,087 brains identifying six cases of a unilateral "bridged" central sulcus (CS) at the brain surface. He also measured the height of a minor "deep winding" at the same location within the CS in the remaining 1,081 brains, reporting a distribution skewed towards significantly increased heights. These observations supported his hypothesis that the "bridged" CS represents an extreme form of the "deep winding" within the CS. In this replication we examined structural MRI data from an equally large dataset of 1,112 participants of the Human Connectome Project young adult (HCP-YA) dataset. Through visual inspection, we identified nine cases of a "bridged" CS, confirming its prevalence of less than 1%. The height of the "deep winding", referred to in the HCP-YA dataset as the pli de passage fronto-parietal moyen (PPfpm), was extracted from 1,983 MRI-based hemispheric depth profiles. The resulting PPfpm height distribution, although wider, still mirrored Heschls findings, showing a similar skew towards larger heights. Further analyses of the twin data within the HCP-YA dataset indicated a slightly increased prevalence of the "bridged" CS in monozygotic and dizygotic twins compared to non-twin individuals, though no concordance of "bridged" CS was observed in monozygotic twin pairs. This replication study validates both of Heschls observations, describes additional factors that might influence the prevalence of the "bridged" CS, and refines the characterization of the "deep winding" height distribution. Together, these findings reaffirm and expand historical insights into the intricate anatomical organization of the CS.

	<p>Background/Objectives: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) alternates short periods of intense exercise with recovery, effectively enhancing cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, and strength in various populations. Concurrently, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) supports neuronal resilience and activity-dependent plasticity, which are vital for learning and memory. This study aims to systematically review changes in BDNF levels in response to HIIT, with three primary objectives: evaluating the benefits of HIIT for BDNF modulation, assessing methodological quality and the risk of bias in reviewed studies, and identifying patterns in BDNF response based on HIIT protocols and population characteristics. Methods: Comprehensive database searches were conducted in PubMed and SPORTDiscus to identify relevant studies published up to April 2024. Given the diversity in study designs and outcomes, a narrative synthesis was performed rather than a meta-analysis. Bias was evaluated using visualization tools such as RobVis, and the review was conducted by a single researcher, which may limit its comprehensiveness. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, with most indicating significant increases in BDNF levels post-HIIT, suggesting HIIT&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential to enhance neuroplasticity and cognitive functions. However, variations in BDNF responses were observed across different HIIT protocols and study populations. Some studies reported decreases or no change in BDNF levels, reflecting the complex regulation of BDNF influenced by factors such as exercise intensity, duration, and individual variability. Conclusions: HIIT shows promise as an intervention for increasing BDNF levels, with potential benefits for brain health and cognitive function. These findings underscore the need for further research to confirm the optimal conditions under which HIIT can effectively enhance neurological outcomes. Future studies should explore standardized HIIT protocols and the long-term impact of HIIT on BDNF and neuroplasticity.</p>

	<p>Speech is a highly skilled motor activity that shares a core problem with other motor skills: how to reduce the massive degrees of freedom (DOF) to the extent that the central nervous control and learning of complex motor movements become possible. It is hypothesized in this paper that a key solution to the DOF problem is to eliminate most of the temporal degrees of freedom by synchronizing concurrent movements, and that this is performed in speech through the syllable&amp;amp;mdash;a mechanism that synchronizes consonantal, vocalic, and laryngeal gestures. Under this hypothesis, syllable articulation is enabled by three basic mechanisms: target approximation, edge-synchronization, and tactile anchoring. This synchronization theory of the syllable also offers a coherent account of coarticulation, as it explicates how various coarticulation-related phenomena, including coarticulation resistance, locus, locus equation, diphone, etc., are byproducts of syllable formation. It also provides a theoretical basis for understanding how suprasegmental events such as tone, intonation, phonation, etc., are aligned to segmental events in speech. It may also have implications for understanding vocal learning, speech disorders, and motor control in general.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Stressors occurring across the life course are considered to have a cumulative impact on health, but there is no instrument for assessing lifetime stressor exposure in Korea. Therefore, we validated the Stress and Adversity Inventory (Adult STRAIN) in Korean. Methods: We translated the Adult STRAIN into Korean and examined its concurrent, predictive, and comparative predictive validity in 218 Korean adults (79 men, 139 women; Mage = 29.5; 19&amp;amp;ndash;50 years old) recruited from a psychiatric setting. We assessed concurrent validity using Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlations, predictive validity using multiple regression models, and comparative predictive validity using multivariate logistic regression to identify participants with lifetime psychiatric diagnoses. Results: The Korean STRAIN exhibited sufficient usability and acceptability; good concurrent validity with other measures of early adversity, life events, and perceived stress (rs = 0.48&amp;amp;ndash;0.61); and strong predictive validity in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms (&amp;amp;beta; = 0.08&amp;amp;ndash;0.47; &amp;amp;Delta;R2 = 0.11&amp;amp;ndash;0.21). Each domain of Korean-style stress, based on the timing, type, life domain, and sociopsychological characteristics of stress exposure, showed a different distribution of lifetime psychiatric diagnosis probabilities (odds ratios = 1.20&amp;amp;ndash;4.85). Finally, the test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability for total lifetime stressor count and severity over four weeks was high. Conclusions: The Korean STRAIN is a practical, valid, and reliable instrument for researchers and clinicians to efficiently assess lifetime stressor exposure.</p>

	<p>Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of observing actions at different speeds on the speed of motor task performance in subsequent actions. Methods: Sixty individuals, divided equally between those with non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) and asymptomatic subjects, were enrolled. Participants were further split into subgroups to observe lumbar flexion and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test actions at either a slow or fast pace, following a randomized assignment. For post-video observation, participants replicated the observed actions three times without specific performance instructions, allowing for the assessment of their execution speed. Results: The analysis revealed that individuals observing actions at a faster pace executed the subsequent motor tasks significantly quicker than their counterparts who viewed the same actions at a slower speed. This was consistent across both NSCLBP sufferers and asymptomatic subjects, indicating that the action observation (AO) speed directly influenced the execution speeds of lumbar flexion and TUG test movements. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that AO speed significantly affects the pace of motor execution, irrespective of NSCLBP presence. This underscores the potential of utilizing varied AO speeds as a strategic component in clinical practice, particularly for enhancing motor planning and execution in physical therapy settings. The study highlights the importance of incorporating AO speed variations into therapeutic interventions for improving patient outcomes in motor task performance.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Computer-aided schizophrenia (SZ) detection methods mainly depend on electroencephalogram and brain magnetic resonance images, which both capture physical signals from patients&amp;amp;rsquo; brains. These inspection techniques take too much time and affect patients&amp;amp;rsquo; compliance and cooperation, while difficult for clinicians to comprehend the principle of detection decisions. This study proposes a novel method using face diagnosis images based on traditional Chinese medicine principles, providing a non-invasive, efficient, and interpretable alternative for SZ detection. Methods: An innovative face diagnosis image analysis method for SZ detection, which learns feature representations based on Vision Transformer (ViT) directly from face diagnosis images. It provides a face features distribution visualization and quantitative importance of each facial region and is proposed to supplement interpretation and to increase efficiency in SZ detection while keeping a high detection accuracy. Results: A benchmarking platform comprising 921 face diagnostic images, 6 benchmark methods, and 4 evaluation metrics was established. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves SZ detection performance with a 3&amp;amp;ndash;10% increase in accuracy scores. Additionally, it is found that facial regions rank in descending order according to importance in SZ detection as eyes, mouth, forehead, cheeks, and nose, which is exactly consistent with the clinical traditional Chinese medicine experience. Conclusions: Our method fully leverages semantic feature representations of first-introduced face diagnosis images in SZ, offering strong interpretability and visualization capabilities. It not only opens a new path for SZ detection but also brings new tools and concepts to the research and application in the field of mental illness.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) can boost motor recovery after a stroke. Certain movement phases are more responsive to NIBS, so a system that auto-detects these phases would optimize stimulation timing. This study assessed the effectiveness of various machine learning models in identifying movement phases in hemiparetic individuals undergoing simultaneous NIBS and EEG recordings. We hypothesized that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of NIBS, would enhance EEG signals related to movement phases and improve classification accuracy compared to sham stimulation. Methods: EEG data from 10 chronic stroke patients and 11 healthy controls were recorded before, during, and after tDCS. Eight machine learning algorithms and five ensemble methods were used to classify two movement phases (hold posture and reaching) during each of these periods. Data preprocessing included z-score normalization and frequency band power binning. Results: In chronic stroke participants who received active tDCS, the classification accuracy for hold vs. reach phases increased from pre-stimulation to the late intra-stimulation period (72.2% to 75.2%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Late active tDCS surpassed late sham tDCS classification (75.2% vs. 71.5%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Linear discriminant analysis was the most accurate (74.6%) algorithm with the shortest training time (0.9 s). Among ensemble methods, low gamma frequency (30&amp;amp;ndash;50 Hz) achieved the highest accuracy (74.5%), although this result did not achieve statistical significance for actively stimulated chronic stroke participants. Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms showed enhanced movement phase classification during active tDCS in chronic stroke participants. These results suggest their feasibility for real-time movement detection in neurorehabilitation, including brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces for stroke recovery.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: There is a need in Korea for research estimating the impact of aging using the Useful Field Of View (UFOV) test, which can evaluate visual function for elderly drivers. Methods: This observational study involved young people in their twenties and thirties, later-middle-aged people in their fifties or older, and elderly people 65 or older recruited from the Gangwon-do region. UFOV testing was conducted on the participants where the participants completed a questionnaire about general and driving-related characteristics. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to analyze the mean difference by age group, and a Pearson correlation analysis was carried out to evaluate the correlation between age and visual function. In addition, a simple linear regression analysis was conducted to verify UFOV subdomains that can confirm changes according to age increasing. Results: Findings after analyzing UFOV subtest differences by age group revealed significant differences in the visual function index of the young, later-middle-aged, and elderly in all three tests, and the difference between the later-middle-aged and old groups was only found in divided attention. The correlation between age and visual function was significant in all three subtests. And all three subtests were confirmed to be indicators that can verify changes according to increasing age. Conclusions: This study showed that visual function significantly decreases with age. Selective attention was confirmed as a visual function type that changes sensitively according to increasing age.</p>

	<p>Background: The segmentation of electroencephalography (EEG) signals into a limited number of microstates is of significant importance in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Currently, the microstate analysis algorithm based on global field power has demonstrated its efficacy in clustering resting-state EEG. The task-related EEG was extensively analyzed in the field of brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs); however, its primary objective is classification rather than segmentation. Methods: We propose an innovative algorithm for analyzing task-related EEG microstates based on spatial patterns, Riemannian distance, and a modified deep autoencoder. The objective of this algorithm is to achieve unsupervised segmentation and clustering of task-related EEG signals. Results: The proposed algorithm was validated through experiments conducted on simulated EEG data and two publicly available cognitive task datasets. The evaluation results and statistical tests demonstrate its robustness and efficiency in clustering task-related EEG microstates. Conclusions: The proposed unsupervised algorithm can autonomously discretize EEG signals into a finite number of microstates, thereby facilitating investigations into the temporal structures underlying cognitive processes.</p>

	<p>Background: The spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals of the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s gray matter (GM) have been interpreted as representations of neural activity variations. In previous research, white matter (WM) signals, often considered noise, have also been demonstrated to reflect characteristics of functional activity and interactions among different brain regions. Recently, functional gradients have gained significant attention due to their success in characterizing the functional organization of the whole brain. However, previous studies on brain functional gradients have predominantly focused on GM, neglecting valuable functional information within WM. Methods: In this paper, we have elucidated the symmetrical nature of the functional hierarchy in the left and right brain hemispheres in healthy individuals, utilizing the principal functional gradient of the whole-brain WM while also accounting for gender differences. Results: Interestingly, both males and females exhibit a similar degree of asymmetry in their brain regions, albeit with distinct regional variations. Additionally, we have thoroughly examined and analyzed the distribution of functional gradient values in the spatial structure of the corpus callosum (CC) independently, revealing that a simple one-to-one correspondence between structure and function is absent. This phenomenon may be associated with the intricacy of their internal structural connectivity. Conclusions: We suggest that the functional gradients within the WM regions offer a fresh perspective for investigating the structural and functional characteristics of WM and may provide insights into the regulation of neural activity between GM and WM.</p>

	<p>Background: Cognitive functions are the basis for the development of language skills. Cognitive disorders occur in schizophrenia and may be present even before the first symptoms of psychosis. Language deficits are also mentioned as one of the diagnostic symptoms of this disease. Methods: A literature search was performed using the PubMed database. Articles comparing linguistic and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia were searched for. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, twenty-six original articles were selected. Results: Most studies have observed a partial correlation between language and cognitive deficits. The correlation most often involved some cognitive functions or some components of language assessment. Conclusions: The correlation reported in many studies shows that there is a correlation between language and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. However, numerous studies contradict these reports. It is, therefore, possible that this correlation exists, but not in all patients. Future research should therefore be aimed at identifying in which patients this correlation is present.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic disease caused by aberration of chromosome 22 that results in some phenotypic features and developmental disorders. This paper presents a cross-sectional study on speech and communication of Polish children with 22q11DS. Methods: Individuals affected with 22q11DS may show difficulties in functioning, including speech and hearing. Therefore, we prepared a speech development questionnaire and employed it to obtain data from parents (or legal guardians) of 54 children with 22q11DS. The questionnaire covered the following speech and communication development stages: babbling, using first words, first sentences, verbal and non-verbal communication, speech disfluencies, hearing loss, speech intelligibility, difficulties in interpersonal contact, and participation in speech therapy. The obtained answers underwent statistical analysis to verify relationships between the stages of personal development and selected dysfunctions and disorders. Results: In the study group we observed delays in achieving subsequent speech developmental stages and that hearing loss was associated with delays in producing first words. Hearing loss was reported in about a quarter of cases, but a significant proportion of children (55.56%) reported speech disfluencies, which had not been emphasized in previous works, where hearing loss is considered a common co-occurring disorder. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that this may represent a phenomenon associated with 22q11DS that warrants further investigation using standardized tests for assessing disfluencies. Additionally, we observed that speech therapists and caregivers were perceived as not fully aware of the speech development impairments caused by 22q11DS. These preliminary observations point to the need for future studies and increased awareness efforts in this area.</p>

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability. These symptoms often lead to significant postural deformities and an increased risk of falls, severely impacting the quality of life. Conventional rehabilitation methods have shown benefits, but recent advancements suggest that virtual reality (VR) could offer a promising alternative. This scoping review aims to analyze the current literature to evaluate the effectiveness of VR in the postural rehabilitation of patients with PD. A scientific literature search was performed using the following databases: PubMed, PEDro, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. Our selection criteria included studies that compared VR-based rehabilitation to traditional methods regarding posture-related outcomes. We identified and analyzed nine RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. The results consistently demonstrated that VR-based rehabilitation leads to greater improvements in balance and gait compared to conventional therapy. Key findings include significant enhancements in balance confidence and postural control and a reduction in fall rates. The superior efficacy of VR-based rehabilitation can be attributed to its engaging and immersive nature, which enhances patient motivation and adherence to therapy. VR allows for precise, repeatable training scenarios tailored to individual patient needs, providing a safe environment to practice and improve motor skills. In conclusion, VR-based rehabilitation represents an innovative approach with substantial potential to improve the quality of life for PD patients. However, limitations such as small sample sizes and short intervention durations in existing studies highlight the need for larger multicenter trials with longer follow-up periods to confirm these findings.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cognitive training paradigms rely on the idea that consistent practice can drive neural plasticity, improving not only connectivity within critical brain networks, but also ultimately result in overall enhancement of trained cognitive functions, irrespective of the specific task. Here we opted to investigate the temporal dynamics of neural activity and cognitive performance during a structured cognitive training program. Methods: A group of 20 middle-aged participants completed 20 training sessions over 10 weeks. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) parameters, including alpha and theta power, alpha/theta ratio, and fronto-parietal coherence, were analyzed at four time points to assess changes in neural activity. Results: Results revealed significant overall improvements in the trained task (n-back) performance, without an effect on the untrained task (OSPAN). qEEG analyses showed increased change in posterior (and a less robust in frontal) alpha power, particularly during mid-training, suggesting an improved neural efficiency in regions associated with attentional allocation and task engagement. Theta power remained stable across sessions, indicating a limited influence on neural processes underlying working memory and attentional control. The parietal alpha/theta ratio showed weak increases during mid-training, reflecting subtle shifts in the neural efficacy and cognitive engagement. There were no significant changes in functional connectivity between frontal and parietal locations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cognitive training primarily influences localized neural activity, rather than network-level connectivity. This lack of a longer-range network-level effect might also explain the failure of cognitive training paradigms to induce performance enhancements on the untrained tasks.</p>

	<p>The interaction between Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and sleep deprivation has recently gained attention in the scientific literature, and recent advances suggest that AD epidemiology management should coincide with the management of sleeping disorders. This review focuses on the aspects of the mechanisms underlying the link between AD and insufficient sleep with progressing age. We also provide information which could serve as evidence for future treatments of AD from the early stages in connection with sleep disorder medication.</p>

                <p>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) has revealed new levels of cellular organization and diversity within the human brain. However, full-length mRNA isoforms are not resolved in typical snRNA-seq analyses using short-read sequencing that cannot capture full-length transcripts. Here we combine standard 10x Genomics short-read snRNA-seq with targeted PacBio long-read snRNA-seq to examine isoforms of genes associated with neurological diseases at the single-cell level from prefrontal cortex samples of diseased and nondiseased human brain, assessing over 165,000 cells. Samples from 25 postmortem donors with Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or Parkinson's disease (PD), along with age-matched controls, were compared. Analysis of the short-read libraries identified shared and distinct gene expression changes across the diseases. The same libraries were then assayed using enrichment probes to target 50 disease-related genes followed by long-read PacBio sequencing, enabling linkage between cell type and isoform expression. Vast mRNA isoform diversity was observed in all 50 targeted genes, even those that were not differentially expressed in the short-read data. We also developed an informatics method for detection of isoform structural differences in novel isoforms versus the reference annotation. These data expand available single-cell datasets of the human prefrontal cortical transcriptome with combined short- and long-read sequencing across AD, DLB, and PD, revealing increased mRNA isoform diversity that may contribute to disease features and could potentially represent therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Treatment for major depressive disorder (depression) often has partial efficacy and a large portion of patients are treatment resistant. Recent studies implicate reduced somatostatin (SST) interneuron inhibition in depression, and new pharmacology boosting this inhibition via positive allosteric modulators of α5-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (α5-PAM) offers a promising effective treatment. However, testing the effect of α5-PAM on human brain activity is limited, meriting the use of detailed simulations. We utilized our previous detailed computational models of human depression microcircuits with reduced SST interneuron inhibition and α5-PAM effects, to simulate EEG of individual microcircuits across depression severity and α5-PAM doses. We developed machine learning models that predicted optimal dose from EEG with high accuracy and recovered microcircuit activity and EEG. This study provides dose prediction models for α5-PAM administration based on EEG biomarkers of depression severity. Given limitations in doing the above in the living human brain, the results and tools we developed will facilitate translation of α5-PAM treatment to clinical use.

                <p>by Nyall Jamieson, Christiana Charalambous, David M. Schultz, Ian Hall</p>

Understanding the temporal relationship between key events in an individual’s infection history is crucial for disease control. Delay data between events, such as infection and symptom onset times, is doubly censored because the exact time at which these key events occur is generally unknown. Current mathematical models for delay distributions are derived from heuristic justifications. Here, we derive a new model for delay distributions, specifically for incubation periods, motivated by bacterial-growth dynamics that lead to the Burr family of distributions being a valid modelling choice. We also incorporate methods within these models to account for the doubly censored data. Our approach provides biological justification in the derivation of our delay distribution model, the results of fitting to data highlighting the superiority of the Burr model compared to currently used models when the mode of the distribution is clearly defined or when the distribution tapers off. Under these conditions, our results indicate that the derived Burr distribution is a better-performing model for incubation-period data than currently used methods, with the derived Burr distribution being 13 times more likely to be a better-performing model than the gamma distribution for Legionnaires’ disease based on data from a known outbreak.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In 1979, I joined Jim Ranck's group in Brooklyn and began recording hippocampal neurons. The first project was to record single neurons across three behaviors in different chambers: pellet retrieval on a radial-arm maze, bar-pressing for food reward in an operant chamber, and maternal pup-retrieval in a large home box. We found spatial firing in all three chambers, with a single-neuron's firing pattern unpredictable from one chamber to the next. We interpreted the spatial firing patterns as representing “context.” Later, in the 1980s, I began collaborating with Bob Muller (and Jim Ranck). In the first of a pair of 1987 papers, we used computerized data acquisition, recorded in simple, reduced environments to demonstrate robust, stable place cell firing and the characteristic features of firing fields. In the second paper we showed that when a rat is transferred from one environment to another, the set of place cells “remaps.” “Remapping” was defined later, in a pair of 1990 papers. “Context” was introduced in the early three-behavior experiment but was not discussed in the 1987 papers. What is the true relationship between the biological observation of “remapping” and the psychological concept of “context”? This difficult question is addressed here and in more detail in our recent paper.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among patients with acute stroke, we aimed to identify those who will later develop central post-stroke pain (CPSP) versus those who will not (non-pain sensory stroke [NPSS]) by assessing potential differences in somatosensory profile patterns and evaluating their potential as predictors of CPSP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a prospective longitudinal study on 75 acute stroke patients with somatosensory symptoms, we performed quantitative somatosensory testing (QST) in the acute/subacute phase (within 10 days) and on follow-up visits for 12 months. Based on previous QST studies, we hypothesized that QST values of cold detection threshold (CDT) and dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA) would differ between CPSP and NPSS patients before the onset of pain. Mann–Whitney <i>U</i>-tests and mixed analysis of variances with Bonferroni corrections were performed to compare z-normalized QST scores between both groups.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 26 patients (34.7%) developed CPSP. In the acute phase, CPSP patients showed contralesional cold hypoesthesia compared to NPSS patients (<i>p</i> = 0.04), but no DMA differences. Additional exploratory analysis showed NPSS patients exhibit cold hyperalgesia on the contralesional side compared to the ipsilesional side, not seen in CPSP patients (<i>p</i> = 0.011). A gradient-boosting approach to predicting CPSP from QST patterns before pain onset had an overall accuracy of 84.6%, with a recall and precision of 75%. Notably, both in the acute and the chronic phase, approximately 80% of CPSP and NPSS patients showed bilateral QST abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cold perception differences between CPSP and NPSS patients appear early post stroke before pain onset. Prediction of CPSP through QST patterns seems feasible. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97228">N-acetylation of α-synuclein enhances synaptic vesicle clustering mediated by α-synuclein and lysophosphatidylcholine</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we reported that α-synuclein (α-syn) clusters synaptic vesicles (SV) Diao et al., 2013, and neutral phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) can mediate this clustering Lai et al., 2023. Meanwhile, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of α-syn such as acetylation and phosphorylation play important yet distinct roles in regulating α-syn conformation, membrane binding, and amyloid aggregation. However, how PTMs regulate α-syn function in presynaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, based on our previous findings, we further demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation, which occurs under physiological conditions and is irreversible in mammalian cells, significantly enhances the functional activity of α-syn in clustering SVs. Mechanistic studies reveal that this enhancement is caused by the N-acetylation-promoted insertion of α-syn’s N-terminus and increased intermolecular interactions on the LPC-containing membrane. N-acetylation in our work is shown to fine-tune the interaction between α-syn and LPC, mediating α-syn’s role in synaptic vesicle clustering.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95106">Telomere length sensitive regulation of interleukin receptor 1 type 1 (IL1R1) by the shelterin protein TRF2 modulates immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                Telomeres are crucial for cancer progression. Immune signalling in the tumour microenvironment has been shown to be very important in cancer prognosis. However, the mechanisms by which telomeres might affect tumour immune response remain poorly understood. Here, we observed that interleukin-1 signalling is telomere-length dependent in cancer cells. Mechanistically, non-telomeric TRF2 (telomeric repeat binding factor 2) binding at the IL-1-receptor type-1 (IL1R1) promoter was found to be affected by telomere length. Enhanced TRF2 binding at the <i>IL1R1</i> promoter in cells with short telomeres directly recruited the histone-acetyl-transferase (HAT) p300, and consequent H3K27 acetylation activated IL1R1. This altered NF-kappa B signalling and affected downstream cytokines like <i>IL6, IL8,</i> and <i>TNF</i>. Further, <i>IL1R1</i> expression was telomere-sensitive in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) clinical samples. Infiltration of tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) was also sensitive to the length of tumour cell telomeres and highly correlated with <i>IL1R1</i> expression. The use of both IL1 Receptor antagonist (IL1RA) and <i>IL1R1</i> targeting ligands could abrogate M2 macrophage infiltration in TNBC tumour organoids. In summary, using TNBC cancer tissue (&gt;90 patients), tumour-derived organoids, cancer cells, and xenograft tumours with either long or short telomeres, we uncovered a heretofore undeciphered function of telomeres in modulating IL1 signalling and tumour immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97350">Eco-evolutionary dynamics of adapting pathogens and host immunity</a></h4>

              
                As pathogens spread in a population of hosts, immunity is built up, and the pool of susceptible individuals are depleted. This generates selective pressure, to which many human RNA viruses, such as influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2, respond with rapid antigenic evolution and frequent emergence of immune evasive variants. However, the host’s immune systems adapt, and older immune responses wane, such that escape variants only enjoy a growth advantage for a limited time. If variant growth dynamics and reshaping of host-immunity operate on comparable time scales, viral adaptation is determined by eco-evolutionary interactions that are not captured by models of rapid evolution in a fixed environment. Here, we use a Susceptible/Infected model to describe the interaction between an evolving viral population in a dynamic but immunologically diverse host population. We show that depending on strain cross-immunity, heterogeneity of the host population, and durability of immune responses, escape variants initially grow exponentially, but lose their growth advantage before reaching high frequencies. Their subsequent dynamics follows an anomalous random walk determined by future escape variants and results in variant trajectories that are unpredictable. This model can explain the apparent contradiction between the clearly adaptive nature of antigenic evolution and the quasi-neutral dynamics of high-frequency variants observed for influenza viruses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90029">Three-dimensional single-cell transcriptome imaging of thick tissues</a></h4>

              
                Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) allows genome-scale imaging of RNAs in individual cells in intact tissues. To date, MERFISH has been applied to image thin-tissue samples of ~10 µm thickness. Here, we present a thick-tissue three-dimensional (3D) MERFISH imaging method, which uses confocal microscopy for optical sectioning, deep learning for increasing imaging speed and quality, as well as sample preparation and imaging protocol optimized for thick samples. We demonstrated 3D MERFISH on mouse brain tissue sections of up to 200 µm thickness with high detection efficiency and accuracy. We anticipate that 3D thick-tissue MERFISH imaging will broaden the scope of questions that can be addressed by spatial genomics.

                Learning alters cortical representations and improves perception. Apical tuft dendrites in cortical layer 1, which are unique in their connectivity and biophysical properties, may be a key site of learning-induced plasticity. We used both two-photon and SCAPE microscopy to longitudinally track tuft-wide calcium spikes in apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in barrel cortex as mice learned a tactile behavior. Mice were trained to discriminate two orthogonal directions of whisker stimulation. Reinforcement learning, but not repeated stimulus exposure, enhanced tuft selectivity for both directions equally, even though only one was associated with reward. Selective tufts emerged from initially unresponsive or low-selectivity populations. Animal movement and choice did not account for changes in stimulus selectivity. Enhanced selectivity persisted even after rewards were removed and animals ceased performing the task. We conclude that learning produces long-lasting realignment of apical dendrite tuft responses to behaviorally relevant dimensions of a task.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102667">Target protein identification in live cells and organisms with a non-diffusive proximity tagging system</a></h4>

              
                Identifying target proteins for bioactive molecules is essential for understanding their mechanisms, developing improved derivatives, and minimizing off-target effects. Despite advances in target identification (target-ID) technologies, significant challenges remain, impeding drug development. Most target-ID methods use cell lysates, but maintaining an intact cellular context is vital for capturing specific drug–protein interactions, such as those with transient protein complexes and membrane-associated proteins. To address these limitations, we developed POST-IT (Pup-On-target for Small molecule Target Identification Technology), a non-diffusive proximity tagging system for live cells, orthogonal to the eukaryotic system. POST-IT utilizes an engineered fusion of proteasomal accessory factor A and HaloTag to transfer Pup to proximal proteins upon directly binding to the small molecule. After significant optimization to eliminate self-pupylation and polypupylation, minimize depupylation, and optimize chemical linkers, POST-IT successfully identified known targets and discovered a new binder, SEPHS2, for dasatinib, and VPS37C as a new target for hydroxychloroquine, enhancing our understanding these drugs’ mechanisms of action. Furthermore, we demonstrated the application of POST-IT in live zebrafish embryos, highlighting its potential for broad biological research and drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96536">A transcription network underlies the dual genomic coordination of mitochondrial biogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the expression of genes encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. However, aside from a handful transcription factors regulating specific subsets of mitochondrial genes, the overall architecture of the transcriptional control of mitochondrial biogenesis remains to be elucidated. The mechanisms coordinating these two genomes are largely unknown. We performed a targeted RNAi screen in developing eyes with reduced mitochondrial DNA content, anticipating a synergistic disruption of tissue development due to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deficiency. Among 638 transcription factors annotated in the <i>Drosophila</i> genome, 77 were identified as potential regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. Utilizing published ChIP-seq data of positive hits, we constructed a regulatory network revealing the logic of the transcription regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Multiple transcription factors in core layers had extensive connections, collectively governing the expression of nearly all mitochondrial genes, whereas factors sitting on the top layer may respond to cellular cues to modulate mitochondrial biogenesis through the underlying network. CG1603, a core component of the network, was found to be indispensable for the expression of most nuclear mitochondrial genes, including those required for mtDNA maintenance and gene expression, thus coordinating nuclear genome and mtDNA activities in mitochondrial biogenesis. Additional genetic analyses validated YL-1, a transcription factor upstream of CG1603 in the network, as a regulator controlling CG1603 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis.

                TIPE (<i>TNFAIP8</i>) has been identified as an oncogene and participates in tumor biology. However, how its role in the metabolism of tumor cells during melanoma development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that TIPE promoted glycolysis by interacting with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in melanoma. We found that TIPE-induced PKM2 dimerization, thereby facilitating its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. TIPE-mediated PKM2 dimerization consequently promoted HIF-1α activation and glycolysis, which contributed to melanoma progression and increased its stemness features. Notably, TIPE specifically phosphorylated PKM2 at Ser 37 in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner. Consistently, the expression of TIPE was positively correlated with the levels of PKM2 Ser37 phosphorylation and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in melanoma tissues from clinical samples and tumor bearing mice. In summary, our findings indicate that the TIPE/PKM2/HIF-1α signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in promoting CSC properties by facilitating the glycolysis, which would provide a promising therapeutic target for melanoma intervention.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100011">Passive accumulation of alkaloids in inconspicuously colored frogs refines the evolutionary paradigm of acquired chemical defenses</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the origins of novel, complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here, we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics, we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95488">Impact of the clinically approved BTK inhibitors on the conformation of full-length BTK and analysis of the development of BTK resistance mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), autoimmune disorders, and multiple sclerosis. Since the approval of the first BTK inhibitor (BTKi), Ibrutinib, several other inhibitors including Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib, and Pirtobrutinib have been clinically approved. All are covalent active site inhibitors, with the exception of the reversible active site inhibitor Pirtobrutinib. The large number of available inhibitors for the BTK target creates challenges in choosing the most appropriate BTKi for treatment. Side-by-side comparisons in CLL have shown that different inhibitors may differ in their treatment efficacy. Moreover, the nature of the resistance mutations that arise in patients appears to depend on the specific BTKi administered. We have previously shown that Ibrutinib binding to the kinase active site causes unanticipated long-range effects on the global conformation of BTK (Joseph et al., 2020). Here, we show that binding of each of the five approved BTKi to the kinase active site brings about distinct allosteric changes that alter the conformational equilibrium of full-length BTK. Additionally, we provide an explanation for the resistance mutation bias observed in CLL patients treated with different BTKi and characterize the mechanism of action of two common resistance mutations: BTK T474I and L528W.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95988">Unveiling chemotherapy-induced immune landscape remodeling and metabolic reprogramming in lung adenocarcinoma by scRNA-sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Chemotherapy is widely used to treat lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients comprehensively. Considering the limitations of chemotherapy due to drug resistance and other issues, it is crucial to explore the impact of chemotherapy and immunotherapy on these aspects. In this study, tumor samples from nine LUAD patients, of which four only received surgery and five received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, were subjected to scRNA-seq analysis. In vitro and in vivo assays, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Seahorse assay, and tumor xenograft models, were carried out to validate our findings. A total of 83,622 cells were enrolled for subsequent analyses. The composition of cell types exhibited high heterogeneity across different groups. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that chemotherapy drove significant metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells and macrophages. We identified two subtypes of macrophages: Anti-mac cells (CD45+CD11b+CD86+) and Pro-mac cells (CD45+CD11b+ARG +) and sorted them by flow cytometry. The proportion of Pro-mac cells in LUAD tissues increased significantly after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pro-mac cells promote tumor growth and angiogenesis and also suppress tumor immunity. Moreover, by analyzing the remodeling of T and B cells induced by neoadjuvant therapy, we noted that chemotherapy ignited a relatively more robust immune cytotoxic response toward tumor cells. Our study demonstrates that chemotherapy induces metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment of LUAD, particularly affecting the function and composition of immune cells such as macrophages and T cells. We believe our findings will offer insight into the mechanisms of drug resistance and provide novel therapeutic targets for LUAD in the future.

	<p>Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of motor and non-motor symptoms (NMSs) that significantly impact patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life. This review aims to synthesize the current literature on the application of brain stimulation techniques, including non-invasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (tFUS), and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), as well as invasive approaches like deep brain stimulation (DBS). We explore the efficacy and safety profiles of these techniques in alleviating both motor impairments, such as bradykinesia and rigidity, and non-motor symptoms, including cognitive decline, depression, and impulse control disorders. Current findings indicate that while non-invasive techniques present a favorable safety profile and are effective for milder symptoms, invasive methods like DBS provide significant relief for severe cases that are unresponsive to other treatments. Future research is needed to optimize stimulation parameters, establish robust clinical protocols, and expand the application of these technologies across various stages of PD. This review underscores the potential of brain stimulation as a vital therapeutic tool in managing PD, paving the way for enhanced treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background: Spatial working memory is crucial for processing visual and spatial information, serving as a foundation for complex cognitive tasks. However, the effects of prolonged sleep deprivation on its dynamics and underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the specific trends and neural mechanisms underlying spatial working memory alterations during 36 h of acute sleep deprivation. Methods: Twenty participants underwent a 36 h protocol of acute sleep deprivation. Utilizing the spatial 2-back task for assessing spatial working memory, combined with event-related potential (ERP) technology, we compared behavioral and neural responses at four critical time points&amp;amp;mdash;before deprivation, and after 12, 24, and 36 h of sleep deprivation&amp;amp;mdash;to uncover dynamic cognitive changes. Results: The findings indicate that the impact of sleep deprivation on spatial working memory exhibits significant temporal dependence. After 24 h of deprivation, both behavioral performance and ERP component amplitudes showed significant declines. During the period from 24 to 36 h, the amplitudes of the P2, N2, and P3 components exhibited a recovery trend, potentially reflecting neural compensatory mechanisms. Conclusions: The impact of 36 h acute sleep deprivation on spatial working memory is characterized by time-dependent and phase-specific effects. Initially, sleep deprivation leads to severe cognitive depletion, followed by an adaptive compensatory phase where neural mechanisms may partially restore function. These findings highlight the non-linear nature of cognitive impairment due to sleep deprivation, involving complex self-regulatory and compensatory mechanisms, with implications for understanding cognitive resilience and adaptive processes.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Autistic adults are more likely to be unemployed compared to neurotypical adults and those with disability. To address these poorer employment outcomes, it is important to consider factors that may be impacting on autistic adults&amp;amp;rsquo; employment outcomes. Anxiety is a common co-occurring condition for autistic adults; however, there is little research on how anxiety affects or influences autistic people&amp;amp;rsquo;s experience across the employment-seeking process. The aim of this study was to explore whether anxiety is perceived to affect autistic adults&amp;amp;rsquo; ability to engage in employment-seeking tasks. Methods: Online, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 autistic adults (22&amp;amp;ndash;52 years) who were actively seeking employment or had sought employment in the last 18 months. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were generated from the data analysis. Theme 1, Finding the &amp;amp;ldquo;sweet spot&amp;amp;rdquo;, identified some level of anxiety&amp;amp;mdash;but not too much&amp;amp;mdash;was helpful in performing the employment-seeking tasks and this &amp;amp;ldquo;spot&amp;amp;rdquo; could vary depending on the person and the task. Theme 2, Anxiety affects the ability to perform and function, encapsulates the autistic person&amp;amp;rsquo;s experience when anxiety is too high. The third theme, The &amp;amp;ldquo;vicious cycle&amp;amp;rdquo; of anxiety and employment-seeking behaviours, explores participants&amp;amp;rsquo; ongoing experience of anxiety on their employment-seeking behaviours. Conclusions: The findings suggest that autistic job candidates would benefit from tailored accommodations and adjustments offered throughout the recruitment process, to reduce anxiety and improve employment-seeking outcomes for autistic candidates.</p>

	<p>Brain connectivity analysis plays a crucial role in unraveling the complex network dynamics of the human brain, providing insights into cognitive functions, behaviors, and neurological disorders. Traditional graph-theoretical methods, while foundational, often fall short in capturing the high-dimensional and dynamic nature of brain connectivity. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful approach for this purpose, with the potential to improve diagnostics, prognostics, and personalized interventions. This review examines recent studies leveraging GNNs in brain connectivity analysis, focusing on key methodological advancements in multimodal data integration, dynamic connectivity, and interpretability across various imaging modalities, including fMRI, MRI, DTI, PET, and EEG. Findings reveal that GNNs excel in modeling complex, non-linear connectivity patterns and enable the integration of multiple neuroimaging modalities to provide richer insights into both healthy and pathological brain networks. However, challenges remain, particularly in interpretability, data scarcity, and multimodal integration, limiting the full clinical utility of GNNs. Addressing these limitations through enhanced interpretability, optimized multimodal techniques, and expanded labeled datasets is crucial to fully harness the potential of GNNs for neuroscience research and clinical applications.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The Sound Sensitivity Symptoms Questionnaire version 2 (SSSQ2) is a brief clinical tool with six items designed to be used (1) as a measure for severity of sound sensitivity symptoms in general (based on its total score) and (2) as a checklist to screen different forms of sound sensitivity. The objective of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the SSSQ2. Method: This was a cross-sectional study. A total of 451 people completed the online survey. A total of 154 people completed the survey twice with a two-week interval to establish test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability. The average age of the participants was 36.5 years (range 18 to 86 years). Results: Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the SSSQ2 is a one-factor questionnaire. Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;alpha; was 0.80. The test&amp;amp;ndash;retest reliability was good for the total SSSQ2 score and was moderate for the sum of items 1 and 3 (indicating loudness hyperacusis), item 2 (for pain hyperacusis), item 4 (for misophonia), item 5 (for fear hyperacusis), and item 6 (for noise sensitivity). The minimum amount of change that constitutes a true change in the total SSSQ2 score is &amp;amp;ge;5 points. Conclusions: The SSSQ2 can be used in clinical practice or research setting to measure the severity of general sound sensitivity as a one-factor questionnaire with acceptable internal consistency and good reliability. In addition, the individual items in the SSSQ2 can be used as a checklist to screen for various forms of sound sensitivity.</p>

	<p>Background/objectives: Negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders are related to impaired social functioning and lower quality of life, making accurate assessment important. To date, most tools for assessing negative symptoms are observational, which can be influenced by the raters&amp;amp;rsquo; experience and opinion. Self-rating scales, like the Self-Evaluation of Negative Symptoms (SNS), could complement observer ratings by adding information from the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s perspective. Here, we aim to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Dutch translation of the SNS and the relationship between the SNS and functional outcomes. Methods: The SNS was added to the Pharmacotherapy Monitoring Outcome Survey (PHAMOUS)-protocol for adults with a DSM-5 classification of a disorder in the psychosis spectrum. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the construct validity of the five subscales of the SNS. Correlational analyses were performed between the SNS and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Health of Nation Outcomes Scales (HoNOS), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), Functional Remission tool (FR) and the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (ManSA). Results: A total of 247 patients participated in this study. Internal consistency was good (&amp;amp;alpha; = 0.87). CFA confirmed the five-factor structure of the SNS. The SNS was significantly correlated (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) with the PANSS positive (r = 0.31), PANSS negative (r = 0.33), HoNOS (r = 0.37), FR (r = 0.27) and the ManSA (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.40). Conclusions: The Dutch SNS shows good psychometric properties and is related to functional outcomes and quality of life. The SNS can be valuable in complementing current observational-based instruments, and future research may investigate whether the SNS can be used as a standalone measurement tool for the assessment of negative symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/12/ENEURO.0209-24.2024?rss=1">Minimal Variation in Functional Connectivity in Relation to Daily Affect</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reported associations between functional connectivity and affective disorder symptoms are minimally reproducible, which can partially be attributed to difficulty capturing highly variable clinical symptoms in cross-sectional study designs. "Dense sampling" protocols, where participants are sampled across multiple sessions, can overcome this limitation by studying associations between functional connectivity and variable clinical states. Here, we characterized effect sizes for the association between functional connectivity and time-varying positive and negative daily affect in a nonclinical cohort. Data were analyzed from 24 adults who attended four research visits, where participants self-reported daily affect using the PANAS-X questionnaire and completed 39&nbsp;min of functional magnetic resonance imaging across three passive viewing conditions. We modeled positive and negative daily affect in relation to network-level functional connectivity, with hypotheses regarding within-network connectivity of the default mode, salience/cingulo-opercular, frontoparietal, dorsal attention, and visual networks and between-network connectivity of affective subcortical regions (amygdala and nucleus accumbens) with both default mode and salience/cingulo-opercular networks. Effect sizes for associations between affect and network-level functional connectivity were small and nonsignificant across analyses. We additionally report that functional connectivity variance is largely attributable to individual identity with small relative variance (&lt;3%) accounted for by within-subject daily affect variation. These results support previous reports that functional connectivity is dominated by stable subject-specific connectivity patterns, while additionally suggesting relatively minimal influence of day-to-day affect. Researchers planning studies examining functional connectivity in relation to daily affect, or other varying stable states, should therefore anticipate small effect sizes and carefully consider power in study planning.</p>

                <p>Preterm infants are at risk for brain injury and neurodevelopmental impairment due, in part, to white matter injury following chronic hypoxia exposure. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which neonatal hypoxia disrupts early neurodevelopment are poorly understood. Here, we constructed a brain-wide map of the regenerative response to newborn brain injury using high-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics to analyze over 800,000 cells in a mouse model of chronic neonatal hypoxia. Additionally, we developed a new method for inferring condition-associated differences in cell type spatial proximity, enabling the identification of niche-specific changes in cellular architecture. We observed hypoxia-associated changes in region-specific cell states, cell type composition, and spatial organization. Importantly, our analysis revealed mechanisms underlying reparative neurogenesis and gliogenesis, while also nominating pathways that may impede circuit rewiring following neonatal hypoxia. Altogether, our work provides a comprehensive description of the molecular response to newborn brain injury.</p>

                <p>by Yongqi Bu, Jiaxuan Liang, Zhen Li, Jianbo Wang, Jun Wang, Guoxian Yu</p>

Diagnosing cancer subtypes is a prerequisite for precise treatment. Existing multi-omics data fusion-based diagnostic solutions build on the requisite of sufficient samples with complete multi-omics data, which is challenging to obtain in clinical applications. To address the bottleneck of collecting sufficient samples with complete data in clinical applications, we proposed a flexible integrative model (CancerSD) to diagnose cancer subtype using limited samples with incomplete multi-omics data. CancerSD designs contrastive learning tasks and masking-and-reconstruction tasks to reliably impute missing omics, and fuses available omics data with the imputed ones to accurately diagnose cancer subtypes. To address the issue of limited clinical samples, it introduces a category-level contrastive loss to extend the meta-learning framework, effectively transferring knowledge from external datasets to pretrain the diagnostic model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that CancerSD not only gives accurate diagnosis, but also maintains a high authenticity and good interpretability. In addition, CancerSD identifies important molecular characteristics associated with cancer subtypes, and it defines the Integrated CancerSD Score that can serve as an independent predictive factor for patient prognosis.
