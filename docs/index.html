                arXiv:2412.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-quality neurostimulation, driven by the development of brain-computer interfaces, has outpaced the capabilities of passive microelectrode-arrays, which are limited by channel-count and biocompatibility. This work proposes a back-end-of-line (BEOL) process for 1024-channel stimulator with bioelectrodes and waterproof encapsulation to stimulate dorsal root ganglion neurons. We introduce an active-matrix neurostimulator based on n-type low-temperature poly-silicon thin-film transistor, adding PEDOT:PSS and SU-8 as bioelectrodes and encapsulation. This enables precise stimulation of DRG neurons, addressing key challenges in neurostimulation systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01836">Eye dominance and testing order effects in the circularly-oriented macular pigment optical density measurements that rely on the perception of structured light-based stimuli</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychophysical discrimination of structured light (SL) stimuli may be useful in screening for various macular disorders, including degenerative macular diseases. The circularly-oriented macular pigment optical density (coMPOD), calculated from the discrimination performance of SL-induced entoptic phenomena, may reveal a novel functional biomarker of macular health. In this study, we investigated the potential influence of eye dominance and testing order effects on SL-based stimulus perception, factors that potentially influence the sensitivity of screening tests based on SL technology. A total of 28 participants (aged 18-38 years) were selected for the study after undergoing a comprehensive eye examination. A psychophysical task was performed where various SL-based entoptic images with multiple azimuthal fringes rotating with a specific temporal frequency were projected onto the participants' retinas. By occluding the central areas of entoptic images, we measured the retinal eccentricity ($R$) of the perceivable area of the stimuli. The slope of the coMPOD profile ($a$-value) was calculated for each participant using a spatiotemporal sensitivity model that takes into account the perceptual threshold measurements of structured light stimuli with varying spatial densities and temporal frequencies. The Pearson correlation coefficient between eye dominance and testing order effects was $r=0.8$ ($p<0.01$). The Bland-Altman plots for both factors indicated zero bias. The results indicate repeatable measurements for both eyes, implying minimal impact from eye dominance and testing order on SL-based stimulus perception. The results provide a foundation for future studies exploring the clinical utility of SL tools in eye health.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02424">Hierarchical feature extraction on functional brain networks for autism spectrum disorder identification with resting-state fMRI data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder of the central nervous system, which occurs most frequently in childhood and is characterized by unusual and repetitive ritualistic behaviors. Currently, diagnostic methods primarily rely on questionnaire surveys and behavioral observation, which may lead to misdiagnoses due to the subjective evaluation and measurement used in these traditional methods. With the advancement in medical imaging, MR imaging-based diagnosis has become an alternative and more objective approach. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid neural Network model for ASD identification, termded ASD-HNet, to hierarchically extract features on the functional brain networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. This hierarchical method can better extract brain representations, improve the diagnostic accuracy, and help us better locate brain regions related to ASD. Specifically, features are extracted from three scales: local regions of interest (ROIs) scale, community-clustering scale, and the whole-communities scale. For the ROI scale, graph convolution is used to transfer features between ROIs. At the community cluster scale, functional gradients are introduced, the clustering algorithm K-Means is used to automatically cluster ROIs with similar functional gradients into several communities, and features of ROIs belonging to the same community are extracted to characterize these communities. At global information integration scale, we extract global features from community-scale brain networks to characterize the whole brain networks. We validate the effectiveness of our method using the public dataset of Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I), and elucidate the interpretability of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASD-HNet can yield superior performance than compared methods.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02529">Active learning of neural population dynamics using two-photon holographic optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in techniques for monitoring and perturbing neural populations have greatly enhanced our ability to study circuits in the brain. In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02078">A Simple Channel Compression Method for Brain Signal Decoding on Classification Task</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.02078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the application of brain-computer interface (BCI), while pursuing accurate decoding of brain signals, we also need consider the computational efficiency of BCI devices. ECoG signals are multi-channel temporal signals which is collected using a high-density electrode array at a high sampling frequency. The data between channels has a high similarity or redundancy in the temporal domain. The redundancy of data not only reduces the computational efficiency of the model, but also overwhelms the extraction of effective features, resulting in a decrease in performance. How to efficiently utilize ECoG multi-channel signals is one of the research topics. Effective channel screening or compression can greatly reduce the model size, thereby improving computational efficiency, this would be a good direction to solve the problem. Based on previous work [1], this paper proposes a very simple channel compression method, which uses a learnable matrix to perform matrix multiplication on the original channels, that is, assigning weights to the channels and then linearly add them up. This effectively reduces the number of final channels. In the experiment, we used the vision-based ECoG multi-classification dataset owned by our laboratory to test the proposed channel selection (compression) method. We found that the new method can compress the original 128-channel ECoG signal to 32 channels (of which subject MonJ is compressed to 8 channels), greatly reducing the size of the model. The demand for GPU memory resources during model training is reduced by about 68.57%, 84.33% for each subject respectively; the model training speed also increased up around 3.82, 4.65 times of the original speed for each subject respectively. More importantly, the performance of the model has improved by about 1.10% compared with our previous work, reached the SOTA level of our unique visual based ECoG dataset

                arXiv:2412.02143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial navigation ability is essential for daily functioning, and the Wayfinding Questionnaire (WQ) is a validated self-report tool assessing this ability through 22 items across three subscales: Navigation and Orientation (11 items), Distance Estimation (3 items), and Spatial Anxiety (8 items). This study introduces the Persian translation of the WQ, adapted for Persian-speaking populations using a rigorous forward-backward translation, cognitive debriefing, and cultural adaptation process to ensure alignment with the original tool's reliability and validity. The Persian WQ provides a complete assessment of spatial navigation skills and identifies potential navigation challenges. Furthermore, the Persian WQ serves as a valuable resource for future research exploring spatial navigation and memory in diverse populations.

                arXiv:2412.02515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As numerical simulations grow in complexity, their demands on computing time and energy increase. Hardware accelerators offer significant efficiency gains in many computationally intensive scientific fields, but their use in computational neuroscience remains limited. Neuromorphic substrates, such as the BrainScaleS architectures, offer significant advantages, especially for studying complex plasticity rules that require extended simulation runtimes. This work presents the implementation of a calcium-based plasticity rule that integrates calcium dynamics based on the synaptic tagging-and-capture hypothesis on the BrainScaleS-2 system. The implementation of the plasticity rule for a single synapse involves incorporating the calcium dynamics and the plasticity rule equations. The calcium dynamics are mapped to the analog circuits of BrainScaleS-2, while the plasticity rule equations are numerically solved on its embedded digital processors. The main hardware constraints include the speed of the processors and the use of integer arithmetic. By adjusting the timestep of the numerical solver and introducing stochastic rounding, we demonstrate that BrainScaleS-2 accurately emulates a single synapse following a calcium-based plasticity rule across four stimulation protocols and validate our implementation against a software reference model.

                arXiv:2405.20658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous brain activity in the absence of external stimuli is not random but contains complex dynamical structures such as neuronal avalanches with power-law duration and size distributions. These experimental observations have been interpreted as supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the brain is operating near a critical point of phase transition between two states, and attracted much attention. Here, we show that a dynamical state of coherent bursting, with power-law distributed avalanches and features as observed in experiments, emerges in networks of adaptive neurons with stochastic input when excitation is sufficiently strong and balanced by adaptation. We demonstrate that these power-law distributed avalanches are direct consequences of stochasticity and coherent bursting, which in turn is the result of a balance between excitation and adaptation. Our work thus shows that the observed dynamical features of neuronal avalanches can arise from collective stochastic dynamics of adaptive neurons under suitable conditions and need not be signatures of criticality.

                arXiv:2406.08385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While extensive research has been conducted on chaos emerging from a dynamical system's temporal dynamics, our research examines extreme sensitivity to initial conditions in discrete-time dynamical systems from a geometrical perspective. Specifically, we develop methods of detecting, classifying, and quantifying geometric structures that lead to chaotic behavior in maps, including certain bifurcations, fractal geometry, strange attractors, multistability, fractal basin boundaries, and Wada basins of attraction. We also develop slow-fast dynamical systems theory for discrete-time systems, with a specific application to modeling the spiking and bursting behavior emerging from the electrophysiology of biological neurons. Our research mainly focuses on two simple low-dimensional slow-fast Rulkov maps, which model both non-chaotic and chaotic spiking-bursting neuronal behavior. We begin by exploring the maps' individual dynamics and parameter spaces, performing bifurcation analyses, describing and quantifying their chaotic dynamics, and modeling an injection of current into them. Then, by putting these neurons into different physical arrangements and coupling them with a flow of current, we find that complex dynamics and geometries emerge from the existence of multistability and final state sensitivity in higher-dimensional state space. We then analyze the complexity and fractalization of these coupled neuron systems' attractors and basin boundaries using our mathematical and computational methods. This paper begins with a conversational introduction to the geometry of chaos, then integrates mathematics, physics, neurobiology, computational modeling, and electrochemistry to present original research that provides a novel perspective on how types of geometrical sensitivity to initial conditions appear in discrete-time neuron systems.

Abstract: When it was first introduced, the Chips-n-Salsa Java library provided stochastic local search and related algorithms, with a focus on self-adaptation and parallel execution. For the past four years, we expanded its scope to include evolutionary computation. This paper concerns the evolutionary algorithms that Chips-n-Salsa now provides, which includes multiple evolutionary models, common problem representations, a wide range of mutation and crossover operators, and a variety of benchmark problems. Well-defined Java interfaces enable easily integrating custom representations and evolutionary operators, as well as defining optimization problems. Chips-n-Salsa's evolutionary algorithms include implementations with adaptive mutation and crossover rates, as well as both sequential and parallel execution. Source code is maintained on GitHub, and immutable artifacts are regularly published to the Maven Central Repository to enable easily importing into projects for reproducible builds. Effective development processes such as test-driven development, as well as a variety of static analysis tools help ensure code quality.

                arXiv:2412.02009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms rely very heavily on randomized behavior. Execution speed, therefore, depends strongly on how we implement randomness, such as our choice of pseudorandom number generator, or the algorithms used to map pseudorandom values to specific intervals or distributions. In this paper, we observe that the standard bit-flip mutation of a genetic algorithm (GA), uniform crossover, and the GA control loop that determines which pairs of parents to cross are all in essence binomial experiments. We then show how to optimize each of these by utilizing a binomial distribution and sampling algorithms to dramatically speed the runtime of a GA relative to the common implementation. We implement our approach in the open-source Java library Chips-n-Salsa. Our experiments validate that the approach is orders of magnitude faster than the common GA implementation, yet produces solutions that are statistically equivalent in solution quality.

                arXiv:2412.02437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of mechanistic models of physical systems is essential for understanding their behavior and formulating predictions that can be validated experimentally. Calibration of these models, especially for complex systems, requires automated optimization methods due to the impracticality of manual parameter tuning. In this study, we use an autoencoder to automatically extract relevant features from the membrane trace of a complex neuron model emulated on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic system, and subsequently leverage sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), a simulation-based inference algorithm, to approximate the posterior distribution of neuron parameters. Our results demonstrate that the autoencoder is able to extract essential features from the observed membrane traces, with which the SNPE algorithm is able to find an approximation of the posterior distribution. This suggests that the combination of an autoencoder with the SNPE algorithm is a promising optimization method for complex systems.

                arXiv:2412.02619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As numerical simulations grow in size and complexity, they become increasingly resource-intensive in terms of time and energy. While specialized hardware accelerators often provide order-of-magnitude gains and are state of the art in other scientific fields, their availability and applicability in computational neuroscience is still limited. In this field, neuromorphic accelerators, particularly mixed-signal architectures like the BrainScaleS systems, offer the most significant performance benefits. These systems maintain a constant, accelerated emulation speed independent of network model and size. This is especially beneficial when traditional simulators reach their limits, such as when modeling complex neuron dynamics, incorporating plasticity mechanisms, or running long or repetitive experiments. However, the analog nature of these systems introduces new challenges. In this paper we demonstrate the capabilities and advantages of the BrainScaleS-1 system and how it can be used in combination with conventional software simulations. We report the emulation time and energy consumption for two biologically inspired networks adapted to the neuromorphic hardware substrate: a balanced random network based on Brunel and the cortical microcircuit from Potjans and Diesmann.

                arXiv:2412.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-dimensional sliding puzzles are constructed on the vertices of a $d$-dimensional hypercube, where $2^d-l$ vertices are distinctly coloured. Rings with the same colours are initially set randomly on the vertices of the hypercube. The goal of the puzzle is to move each of the $2^d-l$ rings to pre-defined target vertices on the cube. In this setting, the $k$-rule constraint represents a generalisation of edge collision for the movement of colours between vertices, allowing movement only when a hypercube face of dimension $k$ containing a ring is completely free of other rings. Starting from an initial configuration, what is the minimum number of moves needed to make ring colours match the vertex colours? An algorithm that provides us with such a number is called God's algorithm. When such an algorithm exists, it does not have a polynomial time complexity, at least in the case of the 15-puzzle corresponding to $k=1$ in the cubical puzzle. This paper presents a comprehensive computational study of different scenarios of the higher-dimensional puzzle. A benchmark of three computational techniques, an exact algorithm (the A* search) and two approximately optimal search techniques (an evolutionary algorithm (EA) and reinforcement learning (RL)) is presented in this work. The experiments show that all three methods can successfully solve the puzzle of dimension three for different face dimensions and across various difficulty levels. When the dimension increases, the A* search fails, and RL and EA methods can still provide a generally acceptable solution, i.e. a distribution of a number of moves with a median value of less than $30$. Overall, the EA method consistently requires less computational time, while failing in most cases to minimise the number of moves for the puzzle dimensions $d=4$ and $d=5$.

                arXiv:2412.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive challenge in wireless networks and many other domains, often compromising the performance of machine learning and deep learning models. To address this, we propose a novel framework, FGATT, that combines the Fuzzy Graph Attention Network (FGAT) with the Transformer encoder to perform robust and accurate data imputation. FGAT leverages fuzzy rough sets and graph attention mechanisms to capture spatial dependencies dynamically, even in scenarios where predefined spatial information is unavailable. The Transformer encoder is employed to model temporal dependencies, utilizing its self-attention mechanism to focus on significant time-series patterns. A self-adaptive graph construction method is introduced to enable dynamic connectivity learning, ensuring the framework's applicability to a wide range of wireless datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with substantial missing data. The proposed model is well-suited for applications in wireless sensor networks and IoT environments, where data integrity is critical.

                arXiv:2412.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.

Abstract: Determining hidden shared patterns behind dynamic phenomena can be a game-changer in multiple areas of research. Here we present the principles and show a method to identify hidden shared dynamics from time series by a two-module, feedforward neural network architecture: the Mapper-Coach network. We reconstruct unobserved, continuous latent variable input, the time series generated by a chaotic logistic map, from the observed values of two simultaneously forced chaotic logistic maps. The network has been trained to predict one of the observed time series based on its own past and conditioned on the other observed time series by error-back propagation. It was shown, that after this prediction have been learned successfully, the activity of the bottleneck neuron, connecting the mapper and the coach module, correlated strongly with the latent shared input variable. The method has the potential to reveal hidden components of dynamical systems, where experimental intervention is not possible.

                arXiv:2411.18410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) require significant amounts of data and computational resources to achieve high effectiveness in performing the tasks for which they are trained. To reduce resource demands, various techniques, such as Neuron Pruning, are applied. Due to the complex structure of ANNs, interpreting the behavior of hidden layers and the features they recognize in the data is challenging. A lack of comprehensive understanding of which information is utilized during inference can lead to inefficient use of available data, thereby lowering the overall performance of the models. In this paper, we introduce a method for integrating Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the context of image recognition. This method significantly enhances the performance of neural networks by leveraging a broader range of information present in the data, enabling the model to make more informed and accurate predictions. Our approach, further referred to as Vector Stitching, involves combining raw image data with additional topological information derived through TDA methods. This approach enables the neural network to train on an enriched dataset, incorporating topological features that might otherwise remain unexploited or not captured by the network's inherent mechanisms. The results of our experiments highlight the potential of incorporating results of additional data analysis into the network's inference process, resulting in enhanced performance in pattern recognition tasks in digital images, particularly when using limited datasets. This work contributes to the development of methods for integrating TDA with deep learning and explores how concepts from Information Theory can explain the performance of such hybrid methods in practical implementation environments.

                arXiv:2402.11748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sound source localisation is used in many consumer devices, to isolate audio from individual speakers and reject noise. Localization is frequently accomplished by ``beamforming'', which combines phase-shifted audio streams to increase power from chosen source directions, under a known microphone array geometry. Dense band-pass filters are often needed to obtain narrowband signal components from wideband audio. These approaches achieve high accuracy, but narrowband beamforming is computationally demanding, and not ideal for low-power IoT devices. We demonstrate a novel method for sound source localisation on arbitrary microphone arrays, designed for efficient implementation in ultra-low-power spiking neural networks (SNNs). We use a Hilbert transform to avoid dense band-pass filters, and introduce a new event-based encoding method that captures the phase of the complex analytic signal. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for SNN methods, comparable with traditional non-SNN super-resolution beamforming. We deploy our method to low-power SNN inference hardware, with much lower power consumption than super-resolution methods. We demonstrate that signal processing approaches co-designed with spiking neural network implementations can achieve much improved power efficiency. Our new Hilbert-transform-based method for beamforming can also improve the efficiency of traditional DSP-based signal processing.

                Climate change significantly affects smallholder farmers, whose livelihoods are closely tied to the environment. This study explores factors influencing the adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices and their impact on crop productivity among small-scale farmers in Nyimba District, Zambia. Data were collected from 194 households across 12 villages, and logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses were employed to identify key factors and evaluate CSA’s effects on crop yields. Findings revealed that CSA adoption is influenced by factors such as education level, household size, fertilizer use, age, gender, farming experience, livestock ownership, income, farmland size, marital status, and access to climate-related information. CSA adopters experienced a 20.20% increase in overall crop yields compared to non-adopters, with a 21.50% increase in maize yields specifically. The study underscores the need for targeted interventions to support CSA adoption through education, improved dissemination of climate information, and access to critical resources such as improved seeds and financial services. This research offers insights for policymakers and extension services to develop evidence-based strategies enhancing resilience and productivity among smallholder farmers in response to climate challenges.

                <p>by Elif Köksal-Ersöz, Pascal Benquet, Fabrice Wendling</p>

Neuroplasticity refers to functional and structural changes in brain regions in response to healthy and pathological activity. Activity dependent plasticity induced by epileptic activity can involve healthy brain regions into the epileptogenic network by perturbing their excitation/inhibition balance. In this article, we present a new neural mass model, which accounts for neuroplasticity, for investigating the possible mechanisms underlying the epileptogenic network expansion. Our multiple-timescale model is inspired by physiological calcium-mediated synaptic plasticity and pathological extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) dependent plasticity dynamics. The model highlights that synaptic plasticity at excitatory connections and structural changes in the inhibitory system can transform a healthy region into a secondary epileptic focus under recurrent seizures and interictal activity occurring in the primary focus. Our results suggest that the latent period of this transformation can provide a window of opportunity to prevent the expansion of epileptogenic networks, formation of an epileptic focus, or other comorbidities associated with epileptic activity.

                <p>by Ikram Mahmoudi, Chloé Quignot, Carla Martins, Jessica Andreani</p>

Protein-RNA interactions play a critical role in many cellular processes and pathologies. However, experimental determination of protein-RNA structures is still challenging, therefore computational tools are needed for the prediction of protein-RNA interfaces. Although evolutionary pressures can be exploited for structural prediction of protein-protein interfaces, and recent deep learning methods using protein multiple sequence alignments have radically improved the performance of protein-protein interface structural prediction, protein-RNA structural prediction is lagging behind, due to the scarcity of structural data and the flexibility involved in these complexes. To study the evolution of protein-RNA interface structures, we first identified a large and diverse dataset of 2,022 pairs of structurally homologous interfaces (termed structural interologs). We leveraged this unique dataset to analyze the conservation of interface contacts among structural interologs based on the properties of involved amino acids and nucleotides. We uncovered that 73% of distance-based contacts and 68% of apolar contacts are conserved on average, and the strong conservation of these contacts occurs even in distant homologs with sequence identity below 20%. Distance-based contacts are also much more conserved compared to what we had found in a previous study of homologous protein-protein interfaces. In contrast, hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and π-stacking interactions are very versatile in pairs of protein-RNA interologs, even for close homologs with high interface sequence identity. We found that almost half of the non-conserved distance-based contacts are linked to a small proportion of interface residues that no longer make interface contacts in the interolog, a phenomenon we term “interface switching out”. We also examined possible recovery mechanisms for non-conserved hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, uncovering diverse scenarios of switching out, change in amino acid chemical nature, intermolecular and intramolecular compensations. Our findings provide insights for integrating evolutionary signals into predictive protein-RNA structural modeling methods.

Sensorimotor learning is supported by multiple competing processes that operate concurrently, making it a challenge to elucidate their neural underpinnings. Here, using human functional MRI, we identify 3 distinct axes of connectivity between the motor cortex and other brain regions during sensorimotor adaptation. These 3 axes uniquely correspond to subjects’ degree of implicit learning, performance errors and explicit strategy use, and involve different brain networks situated at increasing levels of the cortical hierarchy. We test the generalizability of these neural axes to a separate form of motor learning known to rely mainly on explicit processes and show that it is only the Explicit neural axis, composed of higher-order areas in transmodal cortex, that predicts learning in this task. Together, our study uncovers multiple distinct patterns of functional connectivity with motor cortex during sensorimotor adaptation, the component processes that these patterns support, and how they generalize to other forms of motor learning.

Genomic data collected from viral outbreaks can be exploited to reconstruct the dispersal history of viral lineages in a two-dimensional space using continuous phylogeographic inference. These spatially explicit reconstructions can subsequently be used to estimate dispersal metrics that can be informative of the dispersal dynamics and the capacity to spread among hosts. Heterogeneous sampling efforts of genomic sequences can however impact the accuracy of phylogeographic dispersal metrics. While the impact of spatial sampling bias on the outcomes of continuous phylogeographic inference has previously been explored, the impact of sampling intensity (i.e., sampling size) when aiming to characterise dispersal patterns through continuous phylogeographic reconstructions has not yet been thoroughly evaluated. In our study, we use simulations to evaluate the robustness of 3 dispersal metrics — a lineage dispersal velocity, a diffusion coefficient, and an isolation-by-distance (IBD) signal metric — to the sampling intensity. Our results reveal that both the diffusion coefficient and IBD signal metrics appear to be the most robust to the number of samples considered for the phylogeographic reconstruction. We then use these 2 dispersal metrics to compare the dispersal pattern and capacity of various viruses spreading in animal populations. Our comparative analysis reveals a broad range of IBD patterns and diffusion coefficients mostly reflecting the dispersal capacity of the main infected host species but also, in some cases, the likely signature of rapid and/or long-distance dispersal events driven by human-mediated movements through animal trade. Overall, our study provides key recommendations for the use of lineage dispersal metrics to consider in future studies and illustrates their application to compare the spread of viruses in various settings.

                <p>by Benedict G. Hogan, Mary Caswell Stoddard</p>

Hyperspectral imaging—a technique that combines the high spectral resolution of spectrophotometry with the high spatial resolution of photography—holds great promise for the study of animal coloration. However, applications of hyperspectral imaging to questions about the ecology and evolution of animal color remain relatively rare. The approach can be expensive and unwieldy, and we lack user-friendly pipelines for capturing and analyzing hyperspectral data in the context of animal color. Fortunately, costs are decreasing and hyperspectral imagers are improving, particularly in their sensitivity to wavelengths (including ultraviolet) visible to diverse animal species. To highlight the potential of hyperspectral imaging for animal coloration studies, we developed a pipeline for capturing, sampling, and analyzing hyperspectral data (here, in the 325 nm to 700 nm range) using avian museum specimens. Specifically, we used the pipeline to characterize the plumage colors of the King bird-of-paradise (<i>Cicinnurus regius</i>), Magnificent bird-of-paradise (<i>C</i>. <i>magnificus</i>), and their putative hybrid, the King of Holland’s bird-of-paradise (<i>C</i>. <i>magnificus x C</i>. <i>regius</i>). We also combined hyperspectral data with 3D digital models to supplement hyperspectral images of each specimen with 3D shape information. Using visual system-independent methods, we found that many plumage patches on the hybrid King of Holland’s bird-of-paradise are—to varying degrees—intermediate relative to those of the parent species. This was true of both pigmentary and structurally colored plumage patches. Using visual system-dependent methods, we showed that only some of the differences in plumage patches among the hybrid and its parent species would be perceivable by birds. Hyperspectral imaging is poised to become the gold standard for many animal coloration applications: comprehensive reflectance data—across the entire surface of an animal specimen—can be obtained in a matter of minutes. Our pipeline provides a practical and flexible roadmap for incorporating hyperspectral imaging into future studies of animal color.

                <p>by Neha Malhotra, Sangmi Oh, Peter Finin, Jessica Medrano, Jenna Andrews, Michael Goodwin, Tovah E. Markowitz, Justin Lack, Helena I. M. Boshoff, Clifton Earl Barry III</p>

Mycobacterial species in nature are found in abundance in sphagnum peat bogs where they compete for nutrients with a variety of microorganisms including fungi. We screened a collection of fungi isolated from sphagnum bogs by co-culture with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) to look for inducible expression of antitubercular agents and identified 5 fungi that produced cidal antitubercular agents upon exposure to live <i>Mtb</i>. Whole genome sequencing of these fungi followed by fungal RNAseq after <i>Mtb</i> exposure allowed us to identify biosynthetic gene clusters induced by co-culture. Three of these fungi induced expression of patulin, one induced citrinin expression and one induced the production of nidulalin A. The biosynthetic gene clusters for patulin and citrinin have been previously described but the genes involved in nidulalin A production have not been described before. All 3 of these potent electrophiles react with thiols and treatment of <i>Mtb</i> cells with these agents followed by <i>Mtb</i> RNAseq showed that these natural products all induce profound thiol stress suggesting a rapid depletion of mycothiol. The induction of thiol-reactive mycotoxins through 3 different systems in response to exposure to <i>Mtb</i> suggests that fungi have identified this as a highly vulnerable target in a similar microenvironment to that of the caseous human lesion.

                Background Ischemic stroke is a primary contributor to both mortality and disability on a global scale. The triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index), which measures insulin resistance, has been found as a possible predictor of outcomes of cerebrovascular events. Objective To examine the correlation between TyG index and outcomes in patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke. Methods This retrospective analysis of 200 patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke was carried out at the department of medicine, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar between 1st August 2022 and 31st December 2023. Triglyceride/glucose ratio was determined using the formula TyG = ln [Fasting triglycerides (mg/dl)/Fasting glucose (mg/dl)]/2. Patients were categorized into two Group A (TyG index < 8.8) and Group B (TyG index > 8.8). Demographic data, clinical features, and stroke outcomes, such as death and functional status (assessed by the modified Rankin Scale [mRS]), were compared between the two groups. Results Group A contained (112) patients and Group B (88). Both Group A and Group B had 51.8% (n=58) and 51.1% (n=45) male patients respectively. The mean age of patients in Group A was 65.4 ± 10.2 years and 67.1 ± 11.5 years in group B. 30-day mortality in group A was 8.0% (n=9) and 18.2% (n=16) in group B (p value 0.03). The median mRS score at 3 months in group A was 2.5 versus 3.5 in group B (p value = 0.02). Patients in Group B had longer hospital stay (10.5 ± 3.1days vs. 8.2 ± 2.4days, p = 0.01) and higher frequency of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (15% vs. 7%, p = 0.05). Conclusion In ischemic stroke patients, 30-day mortality was more common with TyG index >8.8 and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) functional status at 3 months was better in TyG index <8.8.

                Abstract* Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer, and is characterized by rapid progression and poor patient survival. Genetic mutations play a significant role in cancer development and recurrence. This study investigated the role of Mucin 19 (MUC19), a member of the mucin family that has been implicated in cancer progression. We aimed to assess whether MUC19 mutations are associated with a worse prognosis in patients with GBM and explore its potential as a therapeutic target. Methods Data from 16 independent GBM patient datasets were retrieved from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, comprising over 5,600 patients. These patients were categorized into two groups based on their survival status: living and deceased. Clinical attributes, including mutation frequencies and survival outcomes, were analyzed to identify significant genetic alterations in the deceased group. MUC19 is one of the most prominent mutations. To functionally investigate the role of MUC19, we conducted RNA interference (RNAi) experiments using A172 glioblastoma cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to MUC19 (siMUC19) was used to knock down MUC19 expression, whereas the negative control group was treated with non-targeting siRNA. The effects on cell viability, proliferation, and MUC19 expression were also assessed. Results Our analysis identified 10 significantly mutated genes in deceased GBM patients, with MUC19 showing the most prominent association with poor outcome. siRNA-mediated knockdown of MUC19 resulted in a significant reduction in cell growth and viability compared to the control group, supporting its role in GBM progression. Conclusion MUC19 plays a significant role in GBM progression, and its suppression leads to reduced tumor cell growth. These findings suggest that MUC19 may be a promising therapeutic target for improving outcomes in patients with GBM. Further research is needed to explore its potential in clinical settings.

                Background This study investigates the influence of perceived follower–leader congruence in basic moral behaviors, as defined by the morality-as-cooperation theory (MAC), on the perceived level of ethical leadership. Although important for the leadership theory and practice, this association is scarcely covered by the literature. Methods The study employed a mixed-methods approach, consisting of a one-site quantitative survey in Phase 1 carried out in a Russophone logistics company, and a follow-up series of semi-structured interviews within the same population in Phase 2. Results The results of Phase 1 showed a moderate positive correlation (r(54) = [.34;.64], p < .05) between perceived congruence in each MAC element and the perceived level of ethical leadership, whereas the findings from Phase 2 demonstrated that this association is causal. Moreover, the research unexpectedly revealed that the influence of the congruence in care for kin, heroism, and deference is mediated by the congruence in loyalty to the group and reciprocity, with the significance level at p < .05 for all indirect effects. The study also found a moderating role of duration of leader’s moral behavior observation by followers. Conclusions This research advances ethical leadership literature by applying the MAC theory to studying the antecedents of the perceived leaders’ ethicality and revealing the mediating role of some basic moral values in assessing a leader’s ethicality. Besides, the study contributes to the cross-cultural validity of both MAC and ethical leadership theories by testing the respective instruments in a Russophone organization.

                Endometriosis is a benign, estrogen-dependent, persistent chronic inflammatory heterogeneous condition that features fibrotic adhesions caused by periodic bleeding. The characteristic ectopic lesions are marked by a widely spread dense fibrotic interstitium comprising of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, collagen fibers, extracellular proteins, inflammatory cells, and active angiogenesis. Fibrosis is now recognized as a critical component of endometriosis because of which current treatments, such as hormonal therapy and surgical excision of lesions are largely ineffective with severe side effects, high recurrence rates, and significant morbidity. The symptoms include dysmenorrhea (cyclic or noncyclic), dyspareunia, abdominal discomfort, and infertility. The significant lack of knowledge regarding the underlying root causes, etiology, and complex pathogenesis of this debilitating condition, hinders early diagnosis and implement effective therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects presenting substantial hurdles in endometriosis management. Emerging research offer a close relationship between endometriosis and fibrosis, which is believed to be tightly linked to pain, a primary contributor to the deterioration of the patient’s quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiological cellular and molecular signaling pathways behind endometriosis-associated fibrosis are poorly addressed. The available experimental disease models have tremendous challenges in reproducing the human characteristics of the disease limiting the treatment effectiveness. Future translational research on the topic has been hindered by the lack of an adequate fibrotic model of endometriosis emphasizing the necessity of etiological exploration. This review article focuses on recent developments in the field and highlight the necessity for novel fibrotic models for early diagnosis, a better understanding the disease’s etiology and develop effective anti-fibrotic treatments. By addressing these knowledge gaps, we want to open fresh avenues for a thorough investigation and extended research in the field of endometriosis.

                The dorsal striatum is instrumental in regulating motor control and goal-directed behaviors. The classical description of the two output pathways of the dorsal striatum highlights their antagonistic control over actions. However, recent experimental evidence implicates both pathways and their coordinated activities during actions. In this review, we examine the different models proposed for striatal encoding of actions during self-paced behaviors and how they can account for evidence harvested during goal-directed behaviors. We also discuss how the activation of striatal ensembles can be reshaped and reorganized to support the formation of instrumental learning and behavioral flexibility. Future work integrating these considerations may resolve controversies regarding the control of actions by striatal networks.

The presence of such disease-specific suppressive granulocytes (DSSGs) correlates with glioma grades and poor clinical outcomes. Blockage of DSSGs, which partly originate from the skull bone marrow and meninges, strongly delays tumor progression.

                Sadeghi et al. show that signaling pathways initiated by mutant EGFR, unlike the ligand-activated wild-type EGFR, are associated with defective autophosphorylation of the receptor. The distinctive autophosphorylation patterns on mutant EGFR lead to selective activation of PKCα, which promotes anchorage-independent growth and survival in an mTORC1-dependent manner.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87992">Multimodal neural correlates of childhood psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                Complex structural and functional changes occurring in typical and atypical development necessitate multidimensional approaches to better understand the risk of developing psychopathology. Here, we simultaneously examined structural and functional brain network patterns in relation to dimensions of psychopathology in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development dataset. Several components were identified, recapitulating the psychopathology hierarchy, with the general psychopathology (<i>p</i>) factor explaining most covariance with multimodal imaging features, while the internalizing, externalizing, and neurodevelopmental dimensions were each associated with distinct morphological and functional connectivity signatures. Connectivity signatures associated with the <i>p</i> factor and neurodevelopmental dimensions followed the sensory-to-transmodal axis of cortical organization, which is related to the emergence of complex cognition and risk for psychopathology. Results were consistent in two separate data subsamples and robust to variations in analytical parameters. Although model parameters yielded statistically significant brain-behavior associations in unseen data, generalizability of the model was rather limited for all three latent components (<i>r</i> change from within- to out-of-sample statistics: LC1<sub>within</sub>=0.36, LC1<sub>out</sub>=0.03; LC2<sub>within</sub>=0.34, LC2<sub>out</sub>=0.05; LC3<sub>within</sub>=0.35, LC3<sub>out</sub>=0.07). Our findings help in better understanding biological mechanisms underpinning dimensions of psychopathology, and could provide brain-based vulnerability markers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91663">Sympathetic motor neuron dysfunction is a missing link in age-associated sympathetic overactivity</a></h4>

              
                Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system is a hallmark of aging. The cellular mechanisms behind this overactivity remain poorly understood, with most attention paid to likely central nervous system components. In this work, we hypothesized that aging also affects the function of motor neurons in the peripheral sympathetic ganglia. To test this hypothesis, we compared the electrophysiological responses and ion-channel activity of neurons isolated from the superior cervical ganglia of young (12 weeks), middle-aged (64 weeks), and old (115 weeks) mice. These approaches showed that aging does impact the intrinsic properties of sympathetic motor neurons, increasing spontaneous and evoked firing responses. A reduction of M current emerged as a major contributor to age-related hyperexcitability. Thus, it is essential to consider the effect of aging on motor components of the sympathetic reflex as a crucial part of the mechanism involved in sympathetic overactivity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101702">TPR is required for cytoplasmic chromatin fragment formation during senescence</a></h4>

              
                During oncogene-induced senescence there are striking changes in the organisation of heterochromatin in the nucleus. This is accompanied by activation of a pro-inflammatory gene expression programme - the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) - driven by transcription factors such as NF-κB. The relationship between heterochromatin re-organisation and the SASP has been unclear. Here we show that TPR, a protein of the nuclear pore complex basket required for heterochromatin re-organisation during senescence, is also required for the very early activation of NF-κB signalling during the stress-response phase of oncogene-induced senescence. This is prior to activation of the SASP and occurs without affecting NF-κB nuclear import. We show that TPR is required for the activation of innate immune signalling at these early stages of senescence and we link this to the formation of heterochromatin-enriched cytoplasmic chromatin fragments thought to bleb off from the nuclear periphery. We show that HMGA1 is also required for cytoplasmic chromatin fragment formation. Together these data suggest that re-organisation of heterochromatin is involved in altered structural integrity of the nuclear periphery during senescence, and that this can lead to activation of cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing, NF-κB signalling, and activation of the SASP.

                This study investigates the effects of two parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs, rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34), on bone regeneration and osseointegration in a postmenopausal osteoporosis model using beagle dogs. Twelve osteoporotic female beagles were subjected to implant surgeries and assigned to one of three groups: control, rhPTH(1-34), or dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34). Bone regeneration and osseointegration were evaluated after 10 weeks using micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT), histological analyses, and serum biochemical assays. Results showed that the rhPTH(1-34) group demonstrated superior improvements in bone mineral density, trabecular architecture, and osseointegration compared to controls, while the dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) group exhibited similar, though slightly less pronounced, anabolic effects. Histological and TRAP assays indicated both PTH analogs significantly enhanced bone regeneration, especially in artificially created bone defects. The findings suggest that both rhPTH(1-34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) hold potential as therapeutic agents for promoting bone regeneration and improving osseointegration around implants in osteoporotic conditions, with implications for their use in bone-related pathologies and reconstructive surgeries.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88231">Understanding genetic variants in context</a></h4>

              
                Over the last three decades, human genetics has gone from dissecting high-penetrance Mendelian diseases to discovering the vast and complex genetic etiology of common human diseases. In tackling this complexity, scientists have discovered the importance of numerous genetic processes – most notably functional regulatory elements – in the development and progression of these diseases. Simultaneously, scientists have increasingly used multiplex assays of variant effect to systematically phenotype the cellular consequences of millions of genetic variants. In this article, we argue that the context of genetic variants – at all scales, from other genetic variants and gene regulation to cell biology to organismal environment – are critical components of how we can employ genomics to interpret these variants, and ultimately treat these diseases. We describe approaches to extend existing experimental assays and computational approaches to examine and quantify the importance of this context, including through causal analytic approaches. Having a unified understanding of the molecular, physiological, and environmental processes governing the interpretation of genetic variants is sorely needed for the field, and this perspective argues for feasible approaches by which the combined interpretation of cellular, animal, and epidemiological data can yield that knowledge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98540">RNA tertiary structure and conformational dynamics revealed by BASH MaP</a></h4>

              
                The functional effects of an RNA can arise from complex three-dimensional folds known as tertiary structures. However, predicting the tertiary structure of an RNA and whether an RNA adopts distinct tertiary conformations remains challenging. To address this, we developed BASH MaP, a single-molecule dimethyl sulfate (DMS) footprinting method and DAGGER, a computational pipeline, to identify alternative tertiary structures adopted by different molecules of RNA. BASH MaP utilizes potassium borohydride to reveal the chemical accessibility of the N7 position of guanosine, a key mediator of tertiary structures. We used BASH MaP to identify diverse conformational states and dynamics of RNA G-quadruplexes, an important RNA tertiary motif, in vitro and in cells. BASH MaP and DAGGER analysis of the fluorogenic aptamer Spinach reveals that it adopts alternative tertiary conformations which determine its fluorescence states. BASH MaP thus provides an approach for structural analysis of RNA by revealing previously undetectable tertiary structures.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94342">The potassium channel subunit KV1.8 (Kcna10) is essential for the distinctive outwardly rectifying conductances of type I and II vestibular hair cells</a></h4>

              
                In amniotes, head motions and tilt are detected by two types of vestibular hair cells (HCs) with strikingly different morphology and physiology. Mature type I HCs express a large and very unusual potassium conductance, g<sub>K,L</sub>, which activates negative to resting potential, confers very negative resting potentials and low input resistances, and enhances an unusual non-quantal transmission from type I cells onto their calyceal afferent terminals. Following clues pointing to K<sub>V</sub>1.8 (<i>Kcna10</i>) in the Shaker K channel family as a candidate g<sub>K,L</sub> subunit, we compared whole-cell voltage-dependent currents from utricular HCs of K<sub>V</sub>1.8-null mice and littermate controls. We found that K<sub>V</sub>1.8 is necessary not just for g<sub>K,L</sub> but also for fast-inactivating and delayed rectifier currents in type II HCs, which activate positive to resting potential. The distinct properties of the three K<sub>V</sub>1.8-dependent conductances may reflect different mixing with other K<sub>V</sub> subunits that are reported to be differentially expressed in type I and II HCs. In K<sub>V</sub>1.8-null HCs of both types, residual outwardly rectifying conductances include K<sub>V</sub>7 (<i>Knq</i>) channels. Current clamp records show that in both HC types, K<sub>V</sub>1.8-dependent conductances increase the speed and damping of voltage responses. Features that speed up vestibular receptor potentials and non-quantal afferent transmission may have helped stabilize locomotion as tetrapods moved from water to land.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87120">An acute microglial metabolic response controls metabolism and improves memory</a></h4>

              
                Chronic high-fat feeding triggers metabolic dysfunction including obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes. How high-fat intake first triggers these pathophysiological states remains unknown. Here, we identify an acute microglial metabolic response that rapidly translates intake of high-fat diet (HFD) to a surprisingly beneficial effect on metabolism and spatial/learning memory. High-fat intake rapidly increases palmitate levels in cerebrospinal fluid and triggers a wave of microglial metabolic activation characterized by mitochondrial membrane activation and fission as well as metabolic skewing toward aerobic glycolysis. These effects are detectable throughout the brain and can be detected within as little as 12 hr of HFD exposure. In vivo, microglial ablation and conditional DRP1 deletion show that the microglial metabolic response is necessary for the acute effects of HFD. <sup>13</sup>C-tracing experiments reveal that in addition to processing via β-oxidation, microglia shunt a substantial fraction of palmitate toward anaplerosis and re-release of bioenergetic carbons into the extracellular milieu in the form of lactate, glutamate, succinate, and intriguingly, the neuroprotective metabolite itaconate. Together, these data identify microglia as a critical nutrient regulatory node in the brain, metabolizing away harmful fatty acids and liberating the same carbons as alternate bioenergetic and protective substrates for surrounding cells. The data identify a surprisingly beneficial effect of short-term HFD on learning and memory.

	<p>Background/objectives: Lower limb cutaneous reflex amplitudes can modulate across gait, which helps humans adjust rhythmic motor outputs to maintain balance in an ever-changing environment. Preliminary evidence suggests people who suffer from repetitive ankle sprains and residual feelings of giving way demonstrate altered cutaneous reflex patterns in the gastrocnemius. However, before cutaneous reflex assessment can be implemented as a clinical outcome measure, there is a need to substantiate these early findings by measuring reflex amplitudes across longer latency periods and exploring the variability of reflexes within each subject. Methods: Forty-eight subjects with and without chronic ankle instability (CAI) walked on a treadmill at 4 km/h while activity of the lateral gastrocnemius (LG) was measured via surface electromyography. Non-noxious stimulations were elicited randomly to the ipsilateral sural nerve at the mid-stance phase of gait, and reflex amplitudes were calculated offline by comparing muscle activity during unstimulated and stimulated gait cycles. Two primary outcome measures were compared between groups at the middle latency (MLR: 80&amp;amp;ndash;120 ms) and late latency (LLR: 120&amp;amp;ndash;150 ms) time windows: (1) average reflex amplitudes and (2) standard deviation of reflex amplitudes for each subject across 10 trials. Results: Both groups demonstrated an equal amount of LG inhibition at the MLR and LG facilitation at the LLR. However, subjects with CAI showed significantly higher variability in LLR amplitude across trials than healthy controls. Conclusions: Increased variability of cutaneous reflex amplitudes may relate to symptoms associated with CAI. These findings suggest that reflex variability following sural nerve stimulation could serve as an objective measure to track treatment progress in patients with CAI, offering clinicians a new tool for conducting rehabilitation assessments in a controlled environment.</p>

	<p>Age-associated alterations in the brain lead to cognitive deterioration and neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). This review with a particular focus on Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), emphasizes the burgeoning significance of the gut microbiota (GMB) in neuroinflammation and its impact on the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis (GBA), a communication conduit between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS). Changes in the gut microbiome, including diminished microbial diversity and the prevalence of pro-inflammatory bacteria, are associated with AD pathogenesis. Promising therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, and prebiotics, may restore gut health and enhance cognitive performance. Clinical data remain insufficient, necessitating further research to elucidate causes, enhance therapy, and consider individual variances. This integrative approach may yield innovative therapies aimed at the GMB to improve cognitive function and brain health in older people.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas remain a significant concern in spinal neurosurgery, particularly following dural closure. The incidence of dural tears during spinal surgery is estimated between 1.6% and 10%. While direct suturing remains the gold standard, it has a failure rate of 5&amp;amp;ndash;10%. Various materials and techniques have been used to enhance dural closure. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of non-penetrating titanium clips (AnastoClip&amp;amp;reg;) for dural closure in intradural spinal lesion surgeries. Methods: A prospective analysis was conducted on 272 patients who were operated on for intradural spinal lesions from August 2017 to December 2023. Dural closure was performed using non-penetrating titanium clips with sealant, and, in select cases, autologous grafts. Postoperative care included early mobilization and routine MRI to assess outcomes. A comparative analysis was performed with a cohort of 81 patients treated with traditional sutures. Results: Among the 272 patients, postoperative CSF leaks occurred in 32 cases (11.76%), requiring various management approaches. Thirteen cases required surgical revision, while others resolved with external lumbar drainage or fluid aspiration. Compared to the suture group, which had a fistula rate of 23.46%, the titanium clip group had a significantly lower fistula rate. Logistic regression analysis did not find statistically significant associations between fistula risk and clinical factors. Conclusions: Non-penetrating titanium clips provide an effective alternative to sutures for dural closure, reducing CSF leak rates. They preserve dural integrity, reduce operative time, and avoid imaging artifacts, making them a viable advancement in spinal surgery with outcomes comparable to, or better than, traditional techniques.</p>

                Background Several scholars defined the concepts of fuzzy soft set theory and their application on decision-making problem. Based on this concept, researchers defined the generalised fuzzy soft set and its applications. However, to the best of the author’s knowledge, the generalised fuzzy soft set has not been dealing with in the generalised fuzzy soft code set. In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalised fuzzy soft code set and its application. Methods The theory of fuzzy soft sets and its application, generalised fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy codes in different years were studied with various researchers. To derive a generalised fuzzy soft code set, we apply the concepts of generalised fuzzy soft set and a new view of fuzzy codes and its application. A new aspect of this paper is to introduce the definition of generalised fuzzy soft code sets and its application on medical diagnosis and decision-makings. Results Generalised fuzzy soft code is the most powerful and effective extension of fuzzy soft sets that deal with the choice’s parameterized values. It is an extended model of fuzzy soft sets and a new mathematical tool with significant advantages for handling uncertain information and is proposed by combining the concept of fuzzy soft sets and fuzzy code sets. This paper introduces the concept of generalised fuzzy soft code and its properties. Conclusions In this study, we combine generalised fuzzy soft set and a different approach to coding theory to introduce generalisation of fuzzy soft codes. The paper also considers the relation between generalised fuzzy soft code and its application. We discussed the matrix representation of generalised fuzzy soft code. Furthermore, a demonstration example illustrates how the strategy could be effectively applied to various problems.

                Background To supplement the extant literature on the economics of employing persons of disability, the present study explores the challenges and opportunities companies face with the employment of people with disabilities. Despite legal frameworks and growing awareness, individuals with disabilities often face significant barriers to securing meaningful employment. Misconceptions about their capabilities and concerns over potential costs persist, overshadowing evidence of economic and social benefits. This study explores these dynamics, emphasizing the potential advantages of inclusive hiring practices for organizations. Methods Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with HR managers from five South Tyrolean companies across diverse industries. Participants were selected based on criteria such as company size (minimum 35 employees) and HR management experience (at least 3 years). Interviews focused on exploring workplace adjustments, employment motivations, challenges, and barriers, generating qualitative insights into inclusion practices. Results The study identified several advantages of employing individuals with disabilities, including low turnover rates, increased employee motivation, and a positive workplace atmosphere. Most companies incurred minimal costs for workplace adjustments. Challenges included insufficient understanding among staff, difficulty matching job roles with capabilities, and bureaucratic obstacles. The experts also noted a lack of job applications from individuals with disabilities, potentially due to low confidence or family overprotection. Conclusions Employing people with disabilities can be economically profitable and is not limited to social aspects alone. Existing barriers can often be dismantled without significant financial or time investment, with obstacles being readily overcome. This article contributes to a better understanding of challenges and opportunities of employing staff with disabilities and demonstrates the conditions under which economic benefits emerge for companies. The findings are discussed from an economical and social/cultural perspective with practical implications for human resource practice and operation management.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservati</a></h4>

              
                Backround/Objectives We investigated a technique that facilitates the coiling of a regular straight catheter (with integral stylet) behind the sciatic nerve in an ultrasound (US) regional anaesthesia simulator, and then applied our findings to a series of orthopedic-trauma patients. Methods We conducted a randomized study of two methods of perineural catheter advancement in a sciatic nerve block Blue Phantom simulator. Two groups of twenty catheters each (method A and method B) were evaluated under real-time ultrasound imaging. The needle in-plane/nerve in-short-axis technique was applied. In method A the catheter was advanced beyond the needle tip with the integral stylet extending along its entire length; in method B the catheter was advanced after its integral stylet was retracted by 6 cm, thus providing flexibility to the catheter’s distal end. Additionally, to assess the procedural effectiveness of method B coiling technique, a pilot study was conducted examining 25 perineural catheters coiled underneath the sciatic nerve in trauma-orthopaedic patients to document any catheter tip displacement from their initial position (for 36 hours postoperatively). Results In the simulation study, method B led to a significantly higher percentage (18/20:90%) of coiled catheters than method A (3/20:15%). Two coiled catheters of method B were found kinked/obstructed. In our patients, after catheter insertion, the distal end of 2/25 (8%) coiled catheters was obstructed. One perineural catheter was dislodged. For the remaining 22 (88%) catheters, ultrasound imaging demonstrated that local anaesthetic infusion made contact with the sciatic nerve, indicating no displacement of the catheter’s distal end postoperatively. Conclusion Regular straight perineural catheters can be coiled if their integral stylet is partially retracted. This coiling method offers extra catheter length adjacent to the nerve structure which potentially mitigates catheter tip displacement.

                Background Livelihood diversification involves households earning through various economic activities, such as non-farm businesses, entrepreneurship, and off-farm jobs, improving sustainability, resilience, risk sharing, employment opportunities, and reducing poverty and food insecurity. However, little research has been done on the status, factors and relation of livelihood diversification and food security. This study explores the relationship between food security and livelihood diversification in the Chencha district of southern Ethiopia, focusing on determinants and their connection with household food security. Methods Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 303 randomly selected households using surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and observations. Data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, Ordered probit regression and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results The result revealed that subsistence farming (52.1%) and weaving (38.6%) activities were reported as the primary and secondary main income sources of households. A majority of households (90.7%) diversified their livelihood. Based on income share, non-farm, on-farm, and off-farm income sources contributed, 72.96%, 25.3%, and 1.74% of total household income, respectively. Formal employment, weaving, barber/hairdresser, cattle production and sale, cereal production, and vegetable production (Potato) were highly paying livelihood activities in order. Households who combined on-farm, off-farm, and non-farm have gained far larger mean income followed by on-farm and non-farm strategies. Ordered Probit model results showed that landholding size, livestock holding size, and access to farmer training center (FTC) have positively affected the extent of livelihood diversification. Positive association was found between livelihood diversification and the food security status of households. Conclusion thus, the majority of weaving-based livelihood groups diversify their livelihood activities to on-farm, off-farm, and non-farm activities. Hence, supporting the weaving activity and motivating females’ participation, increasing other livelihood options, and modernizing the system with appropriate training, education, and market linkage seems inevitable.

                Background Prosthodontics significantly impacts oral health-related quality of life, especially oral comfort, functions, aesthetics, and overall well-being. This discipline is grounded in a solid academic and evidence-based understanding of fundamental principles for managing dental diseases and aims to restore the health of teeth and supporting tissues and compensate missing ones. Dental education is evolving quickly with the rise of digital dentistry, especially in prosthodontics. Integrating augmented reality simulations and haptic feedback has significantly advanced this transformation. This systematic review protocol intends to determine the effectiveness of haptic simulators in prosthodontics training during preclinical dental education. Methods An exhaustive search strategy will be employed, exploring PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science and Cochrane Central to select relevant studies, thereby enhancing the robustness of the review findings. Boolean operators (AND,OR) were utilized to assemble MeSH terms and relevant keywords. Titles and abstracts screening to identify studies that satisfy the eligibility criteria was followed by the quality and risk of bias assessment for the selected studies, via the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Data will be collected via standard form. Reviewers disagreement will be solved throughout debate, or by referring to a third opinion. This protocol will adhere the recommendations appointed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Discussion The outcomes of this systematic review are highly significant for dental education exploring the importance of enhancing haptic simulation during preclinic prosthetic training. Recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of virtual reality (VR) in relation to traditional preclinical training methods is crucial for developing effective educational strategies. This understanding can lead to enhanced training outcomes and increased student satisfaction, which in turn contributes to improved quality of clinical prosthetic services.

<p>Spinal and vagal afferents project to all layers of the rat atrium, with distinct patterns in each layer. In the epicardium, spinal afferents make close contacts with cardiac ganglionic neurons and adipose tissue, whereas vagal afferents selectively form pericellular terminal structures around small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells. In the myocardium, spinal afferents display a range of axonal projections, from simple to complex branching patterns, whereas vagal afferents form specialized intramuscular endings. In the endocardium, some spinal afferents branch into free nerve endings, whereas vagal afferents form many distinct “flower-sprays” and end-net terminals.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The spinal afferent innervation of the heart helps to regulate cardiac functions by sending sensory information through the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) to the brain. However, the distribution and morphology of spinal afferents in the heart are not well characterized due to tracer selections, the surgical access to upper thoracic DRGs, and the thickness of the heart tissues. In this study, we injected tracer dextran biotin (DB) into the left DRGs (C8-T3) of male Sprague–Dawley rats (3–5 months). After 16 days, flat-mounts of the whole left and right atria were prepared and diaminobenzidine stained. Then, the DB-labeled axons in the tissues were imaged, traced, and digitized using the Neurolucida system. Our results showed that the DB-labeled axons from left DRGs entered the left precaval vein and projected to the left and right atria, with predominant projection in the left atrial wall. DB-labeled varicose axons were observed in different layers, mostly in the epicardium and myocardium, but much less in the endocardium. In those layers, these spinal afferent axons branched out into simple to complex terminal arborizations, forming close appositions with cardiac muscles, intrinsic cardiac ganglia, blood vessels, and fat tissue. This work, for the first time, characterized cardiac spinal afferent distribution of the rat atria using anterograde tracing, which will provide the foundation for future studies of topographical cardiac spinal afferent innervation and remodeling in heart disease models.</p>

During morphogenesis, cells precisely generate forces that drive cell shape changes and cellular motion. These forces predominantly arise from contractility of the actomyosin cortex, allowing for cortical tension, protrusion formation, and cell division. Image-based force inference can derive such forces from microscopy images, without complicated and time-consuming experimental set-ups. However, current methods do not account for common effects, such as physical confinement and local force generation. Here we propose a force-inference method based on a biophysical model of cell shape, and assess relative cellular surface tension, adhesive tension between cells, as well as cytokinesis and protrusion formation. We applied our method on fluorescent microscopy images of the early <i>C. elegans</i> embryo. Predictions for cell surface tension at the 7-cell stage were validated by measurements using cortical laser ablation. Our non-invasive method facilitates the accurate tracking of force generation, and offers many new perspectives for studying morphogenesis.

                <p>by Adrián F. Amil, Albert Albesa-González, Paul F. M. J. Verschure</p>

Theta-band oscillations (3–8 Hz) in the mammalian hippocampus organize the temporal structure of cortical inputs, resulting in a phase code that enables rhythmic input sampling for episodic memory formation and spatial navigation. However, it remains unclear what evolutionary pressures might have driven the selection of theta over higher-frequency bands that could potentially provide increased input sampling resolution. Here, we address this question by introducing a theoretical framework that combines the efficient coding and neural oscillatory sampling hypotheses, focusing on the information rate (bits/s) of phase coding neurons. We demonstrate that physiologically realistic noise levels create a trade-off between the speed of input sampling, determined by oscillation frequency, and encoding precision in rodent hippocampal neurons. This speed-precision trade-off results in a maximum information rate of ∼1–2 bits/s within the theta frequency band, thus confining the optimal oscillation frequency to the low end of the spectrum. We also show that this framework accounts for key hippocampal features, such as the preservation of the theta band along the dorsoventral axis despite physiological gradients, and the modulation of theta frequency and amplitude by running speed. Extending the analysis beyond the hippocampus, we propose that theta oscillations could also support efficient stimulus encoding in the visual cortex and olfactory bulb. More broadly, our framework lays the foundation for studying how system features, such as noise, constrain the optimal sampling frequencies in both biological and artificial brains.

Biological signalling systems are complex, and efforts to build mechanistic models must confront a huge parameter space, indirect and sparse data, and frequently encounter multiscale and multiphysics phenomena. We present HOSS, a framework for Hierarchical Optimization of Systems Simulations, to address such problems. HOSS operates by breaking down extensive systems models into individual pathway blocks organized in a nested hierarchy. At the first level, dependencies are solely on signalling inputs, and subsequent levels rely only on the preceding ones. We demonstrate that each independent pathway in every level can be efficiently optimized. Once optimized, its parameters are held constant while the pathway serves as input for succeeding levels. We develop an algorithmic approach to identify the necessary nested hierarchies for the application of HOSS in any given biochemical network. Furthermore, we devise two parallelizable variants that generate numerous model instances using stochastic scrambling of parameters during initial and intermediate stages of optimization. Our results indicate that these variants produce superior models and offer an estimate of solution degeneracy. Additionally, we showcase the effectiveness of the optimization methods for both abstracted, event-based simulations and ODE-based models.

Human facial shape, while strongly heritable, involves both genetic and structural complexity, necessitating precise phenotyping for accurate assessment. Common phenotyping strategies include simplifying 3D facial features into univariate traits such as anthropometric measurements (e.g., inter-landmark distances), unsupervised dimensionality reductions (e.g., principal component analysis (PCA) and auto-encoder (AE) approaches), and assessing resemblance to particular facial gestalts (e.g., syndromic facial archetypes). This study provides a comparative assessment of these strategies in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 3D facial shape. Specifically, we investigated inter-landmark distances, PCA and AE-derived latent dimensions, and facial resemblance to random, extreme, and syndromic gestalts within a GWAS of 8,426 individuals of recent European ancestry. Inter-landmark distances exhibit the highest SNP-based heritability as estimated via LD score regression, followed by AE dimensions. Conversely, resemblance scores to extreme and syndromic facial gestalts display the lowest heritability, in line with expectations. Notably, the aggregation of multiple GWASs on facial resemblance to random gestalts reveals the highest number of independent genetic loci. This novel, easy-to-implement phenotyping approach holds significant promise for capturing genetically relevant morphological traits derived from complex biomedical imaging datasets, and its applications extend beyond faces. Nevertheless, these different phenotyping strategies capture different genetic influences on craniofacial shape. Thus, it remains valuable to explore these strategies individually and in combination to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors underlying craniofacial shape and related traits.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an important genomic biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment, and sequencing-based approaches are often applied to identify MSI because of its fastness and efficiency. These approaches, however, may fail to identify MSI on one or more sub-clones for certain cancers with a high degree of heterogeneity, leading to erroneous diagnoses and unsuitable treatments. Besides, the computational cost of identifying sub-clonal MSI can be exponentially increased when multiple sub-clones with different length distributions share MSI status. Herein, this paper proposes “scMSI”, an accurate and efficient estimation of sub-clonal MSI to identify the microsatellite status. scMSI is an integrative Bayesian method to deconvolute the mixed-length distribution of sub-clones by a novel alternating iterative optimization procedure based on a subtle generative model. During the process of deconvolution, the optimized division of each sub-clone is attained by a heuristic algorithm, aligning with clone proportions that adhere optimally to the sample’s clonal structure. To evaluate the performance, 16 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, exhibiting positive responses to the treatment despite having negative MSI status based on sequencing-based approaches, were considered. Excitingly, scMSI reported MSI on sub-clones successfully, and the findings matched the conclusions on immunohistochemistry. In addition, testing results on a series of experiments with simulation datasets concerning a variety of impact factors demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of scMSI in detecting MSI on sub-clones over existing approaches. scMSI provides a new way of detecting MSI for cancers with a high degree of heterogeneity.

When making risky choices in social contexts, humans typically combine social information with individual preferences about the options at stake. It remains unknown how such decisions are made when these preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, as might be the case for individuals confronting novel options or experiencing cognitive impairment. Thus, we examined participants with lesions in insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, key regions implicated in risky decision-making, as they played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others’ choices. Participants in both lesion groups showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options. For socially situated decisions, these participants showed increased conformity with the choices of others, independent from social utility-based computations. These findings suggest that in social contexts, following others’ choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted.

                <p>by Lalit Pandey, Donsuk Lee, Samantha M. W. Wood, Justin N. Wood</p>

How do newborns learn to see? We propose that visual systems are space-time fitters, meaning visual development can be understood as a blind fitting process (akin to evolution) in which visual systems gradually adapt to the spatiotemporal data distributions in the newborn’s environment. To test whether space-time fitting is a viable theory for learning how to see, we performed parallel controlled-rearing experiments on newborn chicks and deep neural networks (DNNs), including CNNs and transformers. First, we raised newborn chicks in impoverished environments containing a single object, then simulated those environments in a video game engine. Second, we recorded first-person images from agents moving through the virtual animal chambers and used those images to train DNNs. Third, we compared the viewpoint-invariant object recognition performance of the chicks and DNNs. When DNNs received the same visual diet (training data) as chicks, the models developed common object recognition skills as chicks. DNNs that used time as a teaching signal—space-time fitters—also showed common patterns of successes and failures across the test viewpoints as chicks. Thus, DNNs can learn object recognition in the same impoverished environments as newborn animals. We argue that space-time fitters can serve as formal scientific models of newborn visual systems, providing image-computable models for studying how newborns learn to see from raw visual experiences.

                <p>by Jan Stasinski, Halgurd Taher, Jil Mona Meier, Michael Schirner, Dionysios Perdikis, Petra Ritter</p>

Simulations of large-scale brain dynamics are often impacted by overexcitation resulting from heavy-tailed structural network distributions, leading to biologically implausible simulation results. We implement a homeodynamic plasticity mechanism, known from other modeling work, in the widely used Jansen-Rit neural mass model for The Virtual Brain (TVB) simulation framework. We aim at heterogeneously adjusting the inhibitory coupling weights to reach desired dynamic regimes in each brain region. We show that, by using this dynamic approach, we can control the target activity level to obtain biologically plausible brain simulations, including post-synaptic potentials and blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity. We demonstrate that the derived dynamic Feedback Inhibitory Control (dFIC) can be used to enable increased variability of model dynamics. We derive the conditions under which the simulated brain activity converges to a predefined target level analytically and via simulations. We highlight the benefits of dFIC in the context of fitting the TVB model to static and dynamic measures of fMRI empirical data, accounting for global synchronization across the whole brain. The proposed novel method helps computational neuroscientists, especially TVB users, to easily “tune” brain models to desired dynamical regimes depending on the specific requirements of each study. The presented method is a steppingstone towards increased biological realism in brain network models and a valuable tool to better understand their underlying behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012555">Stable developmental patterns of gene expression without morphogen gradients</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maciej Majka, Nils B. Becker, Pieter Rein ten Wolde, Marcin Zagorski, Thomas R. Sokolowski</p>

Gene expression patterns in developing organisms are established by groups of cross-regulating target genes that are driven by morphogen gradients. As development progresses, morphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent pattern without stabilizing positional cues and at risk of rapid deterioration due to the inherently noisy biochemical processes at the cellular level. But remarkably, gene expression patterns remain spatially stable and reproducible over long developmental time spans in many biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an enhanced sampling method (Non-Stationary Forward Flux Sampling) and a recently developed stability theory to address how spatiotemporal integrity of a gene expression pattern is maintained in developing tissue lacking morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model consisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a prototypical stripe pattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor expression domains alternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains, inspired by the gap gene system in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo. We find that tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level can prolong stability of the expression patterns by orders of magnitude, enabling stable patterns over developmentally relevant times in the absence of morphogen gradients. The optimal parameter regime found in simulations of the embryo model closely agrees with the predictions of our coarse-grained stability theory. To elucidate the origin of stability, we analyze a reduced phase space defined by two measures of pattern asymmetry. We find that in the optimal regime, intact patterns are protected via restoring forces that counteract random perturbations and give rise to a metastable basin. Together, our results demonstrate that metastable attractors can emerge as a property of stochastic gene expression patterns even without system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory interactions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.

                <p>by Anna N. Osiecka, Przemysław Bryndza, Elodie F. Briefer, Katarzyna Wojczulanis-Jakubas</p>

How well does the information contained in vocal signals travel through the environment? To assess the efficiency of information transfer in little auk (<i>Alle alle</i>, an Arctic seabird) calls over distance, we selected two of the social call types with the highest potential for individuality coding. Using available recordings of known individuals, we calculated the apparent source levels, with apparent maximum peak sound pressure level (ASPL) of 63 dB re 20 μPa at 1 m for both call types. Further, we created a sound attenuation model using meteorological data collected in the vicinity of the little auk colony in Hornsund, Spitsbergen. Using this model, we modelled the calls to reflect higher frequency filtering and sound level loss occurring during spherical spreading in perfect local conditions, down to the putative hearing threshold of the species, calculated to equal ASPL of signals “propagated” to roughly one kilometre. Those modelled calls were then used in a permuted discriminant function analysis, support vector machine models, and linear models of Beecher’s information statistic, to investigate whether transmission loss will affect the retention of individual information of the signal. Calls could be correctly classified to individuals above chance level independently of the distance, down to and over the putative physiological hearing threshold. Interestingly, the information capacity of the signal did not decrease with its filtering and attenuation. While this study touches on signal properties purely and cannot provide evidence of the actual use by the animals, it shows that little auk signals can theoretically travel long distances with negligible information loss, and supports the hypothesis that vocalisations could facilitate long-distance communication in the species.

The intestinal epithelium is a polarized monolayer of cells, with an apical side facing the lumen and a basal side facing the blood stream. In mice, both proteins and mRNAs have been shown to exhibit global basal-apical polarization; however, polarization in the human intestine has not been systematically explored. Here, we employed laser-capture microdissection to isolate apical and basal epithelial segments from intestinal tissues of 8 individuals and performed RNA sequencing and mass-spectrometry proteomics. We find a substantial polarization of mRNA molecules that largely overlaps polarization patterns observed in mice. This mRNA polarization remains consistent across different zones of the intestinal villi and is generally correlated with the polarization of proteins. Our protein analysis exposes streamlined intracellular nutrient transport and processing and reveals that mitochondria and ribosomes are less polarized in humans compared to mice. Our study provides a resource for understanding human intestinal epithelial biology.

                <p>by Xiaoyu Tian, Hanyu Wang, Song Liu, Wei Liu, Kaiyue Zhang, Xiaohan Gao, Qingchao Li, Huijie Zhao, Liangran Zhang, Peiwei Liu, Min Liu, Youjun Wang, Xueliang Zhu, Rutao Cui, Jun Zhou</p>

Production of melanin pigments is a protective mechanism of the skin against ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage and carcinogenesis. However, the molecular basis for melanogenesis is still poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate a critical interplay between the primary cilium and the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) signaling. Our data show that UV and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) trigger cilium formation in human melanocytes and melanoma cells. Deficiency of MC1R or the presence of its red hair color (RHC) variations significantly attenuates the UV/α-MSH-induced ciliogenesis. Further investigation reveals that MC1R enters the cilium upon UV/α-MSH stimulation, which is facilitated by the interaction of MC1R with the BBSome and the palmitoylation of MC1R. MC1R interacts with the BBSome through the second and third intercellular loops, which contain the common RHC variant alleles (R151C and R160W). These RHC variants of MC1R exhibit attenuated ciliary localization, and enforced ciliary localization of these variants elevates melanogenesis. Ciliary MC1R triggers a sustained cAMP signaling and selectively stimulates Sox9, which appears to up-regulate melanogenesis-related genes as the transcriptional cofactor for MITF. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized nexus between MC1R and cilia and suggest an important mechanism for RHC variant-related pigmentary defects.

                <p>by Xitong Chen, Stephanie C. Leach, Juniper Hollis, Dillan Cellier, Kai Hwang</p>

Cognitive flexibility relies on hierarchically structured task representations that organize task contexts, relevant environmental features, and subordinate decisions. Despite ongoing interest in the human thalamus, its role in cognitive control has been understudied. This study explored thalamic representation and thalamocortical interactions that contribute to hierarchical cognitive control in humans. We found that several thalamic nuclei, including the anterior, mediodorsal, ventrolateral, and pulvinar nuclei, exhibited stronger evoked responses when subjects switch between task contexts. Decoding analysis revealed that thalamic activity encodes task contexts within the hierarchical task representations. To determine how thalamocortical interactions contribute to task representations, we developed a thalamocortical functional interaction model to predict task-related cortical representation. This data-driven model outperformed comparison models, particularly in predicting activity patterns in cortical regions that encode context representations. Collectively, our findings highlight the significant contribution of thalamic activity and thalamocortical interactions for contextually guided hierarchical cognitive control.

Active conductances tune the kinetics of axonal action potentials (APs) to support specialized functions of neuron types. However, the temporal characteristics of voltage signals strongly depend on the size of neuronal structures, as capacitive and resistive effects slow down voltage discharges in the membranes of small elements. Axonal action potentials are particularly sensitive to these inherent biophysical effects because of the large diameter variabilities within individual axons, potentially implying bouton size-dependent synaptic effects. However, using direct patch-clamp recordings and voltage imaging in small hippocampal axons in acute slices from rat brains, we demonstrate that AP shapes remain uniform within the same axons, even across an order of magnitude difference in caliber. Our results show that smaller axonal structures have more Kv1 potassium channels that locally re-accelerate AP repolarization and contribute to size-independent APs, while they do not preclude the plasticity of AP shapes. Thus, size-independent axonal APs ensure consistent digital signals for each synapse within axons of same types.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002926">A chromosomal mutation is superior to a plasmid-encoded mutation for plasmid fitness cost compensation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rosanna C. T. Wright, A. Jamie Wood, Michael J. Bottery, Katie J. Muddiman, Steve Paterson, Ellie Harrison, Michael A. Brockhurst, James P. J. Hall</p>

Plasmids are important vectors of horizontal gene transfer in microbial communities but can impose a burden on the bacteria that carry them. Such plasmid fitness costs are thought to arise principally from conflicts between chromosomal- and plasmid-encoded molecular machineries, and thus can be ameliorated by compensatory mutations (CMs) that reduce or resolve the underlying causes. CMs can arise on plasmids (i.e., plaCM) or on chromosomes (i.e., chrCM), with contrasting predicted effects upon plasmid success and subsequent gene transfer because plaCM can also reduce fitness costs in plasmid recipients, whereas chrCM can potentially ameliorate multiple distinct plasmids. Here, we develop theory and a novel experimental system to directly compare the ecological effects of plaCM and chrCM that arose during evolution experiments between Pseudomonas <i>fluorescens</i> SBW25 and its sympatric mercury resistance megaplasmid pQBR57. We show that while plaCM was predicted to succeed under a broader range of parameters in mathematical models, chrCM dominated in our experiments, including conditions with numerous recipients, due to a more efficacious mechanism of compensation, and advantages arising from transmission of costly plasmids to competitors (plasmid “weaponisation”). We show analytically the presence of a mixed Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) regime for CMs, driven by trade-offs with horizontal transmission, that offers one possible explanation for the observed failure of plaCM to dominate even in competition against an uncompensated plasmid. Our results reveal broader implications of plasmid-bacterial evolution for plasmid ecology, demonstrating the importance of specific compensatory mutations for resistance gene spread. One consequence of the superiority of chrCM over plaCM is the likely emergence in microbial communities of compensated bacteria that can act as “hubs” for plasmid accumulation and dissemination.

                <p>by Sarah Wettstadt, Francisco J. Marcos-Torres, Joaquín R. Otero-Asman, Alicia García-Puente, Álvaro Ortega, María A. Llamas</p>

Competitive bacteria like the human pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> can acquire iron from different iron carriers, which are usually internalized via outer membrane TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs). Production of TBDRs is promoted by the presence of the substrate. This regulation often entails a signal transfer pathway known as cell-surface signaling (CSS) that involves the TBDR itself that also functions as transducer (and is thus referred to as TBDT), a cytoplasmic membrane-bound anti-σ factor, and an extracytoplasmic function σ (σ<sup>ECF</sup>) factor. TBDTs contain an extra N-terminal domain known as signaling domain (SD) required for the signal transfer activity of these receptors. In the current CSS model, presence of the signal allows the interaction between the TBDT and the anti-σ factor in the periplasm, promoting the proteolysis of the anti-σ factor and in turn the σ<sup>ECF</sup>-dependent transcription of response genes, including the TBDT gene. However, recent evidence shows that σ<sup>ECF</sup> activity does not depend on this interaction, suggesting that the contact between these 2 proteins fulfills a different role. Using the <i>P</i>. <i>aeruginosa</i> Fox CSS system as model, we show here that the SD of the FoxA TBDT already interacts with the C-terminal domain of the FoxR anti-σ factor in absence of the signal. This interaction protects FoxR from proteolysis in turn preventing transcription of σ<sup>FoxI</sup>-dependent genes. By structural modeling of the FoxR/FoxA<sup>SD</sup> interaction, we have identified the interaction sites between these 2 proteins and provide the molecular details of this interaction. We furthermore show that to exert this protective role, FoxA undergoes proteolytic cleavage, denoting a change in the paradigm of the current CSS model.

                <p>by Xin Yuan, Hailiang Li, Fang Guo</p>

Organisms detect temperature signals through peripheral neurons, which relay them to central circadian networks to drive adaptive behaviors. Despite recent advances in <i>Drosophila</i> research, how circadian circuits integrate temperature cues with circadian signals to regulate sleep/wake patterns remains unclear. In this study, we used the FlyWire brain electron microscopy connectome to map neuronal connections, identifying lateral posterior neurons LPNs as key nodes for integrating temperature information into the circadian network. LPNs receive input from both circadian and temperature-sensing neurons, promoting sleep behavior. Through connectome analysis, genetic manipulation, and behavioral assays, we demonstrated that LPNs, downstream of thermo-sensitive anterior cells (ACs), suppress activity-promoting lateral dorsal neurons LNds via the AstC pathway, inducing sleep Disrupting LPN-LNd communication through either <i>AstCR1</i> RNAi in LNds or in an <i>AstCR1</i> mutant significantly impairs the heat-induced reduction in the evening activity peak. Conversely, optogenetic calcium imaging and behavioral assays revealed that cold-activated LNds subsequently stimulate LPNs through NPF-NPFR signaling, establishing a negative feedback loop. This feedback mechanism limits LNd activation to appropriate levels, thereby fine-tuning the evening peak increase at lower temperatures. In conclusion, our study constructed a comprehensive connectome centered on LPNs and identified a novel peptidergic circadian feedback circuit that coordinates temperature and circadian signals, offering new insights into the regulation of sleep patterns in <i>Drosophila</i>.

                <p>by Jonathan M. Werner, Jesse Gillis</p>

Human neural organoids offer an exciting opportunity for studying inaccessible human-specific brain development; however, it remains unclear how precisely organoids recapitulate fetal/primary tissue biology. We characterize field-wide replicability and biological fidelity through a meta-analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for first and second trimester human primary brain (2.95 million cells, 51 data sets) and neural organoids (1.59 million cells, 173 data sets). We quantify the degree primary tissue cell type marker expression and co-expression are recapitulated in organoids across 10 different protocol types. By quantifying gene-level preservation of primary tissue co-expression, we show neural organoids lie on a spectrum ranging from virtually no signal to co-expression indistinguishable from primary tissue, demonstrating a high degree of variability in biological fidelity among organoid systems. Our preserved co-expression framework provides cell type-specific measures of fidelity applicable to diverse neural organoids, offering a powerful tool for uncovering unifying axes of variation across heterogeneous neural organoid experiments.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Evidence from neurophysiological and genetic studies demonstrates that <i>activity sparsity</i>—the proportion of neurons that are active at a given time in a population—systematically varies across the canonical trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus. Recent work has also shown that sparsity varies across the hippocampal dorsoventral (long) axis, wherein activity is sparser in ventral than dorsal regions. While the hippocampus has a critical role in long-term memory (LTM), whether sparsity across the trisynaptic circuit and hippocampal long axis is task-dependent or invariant remains unknown. Importantly, representational sparsity has significant implications for neural computation and theoretical models of learning and memory within and beyond the hippocampus. Here we used functional molecular imaging to quantify sparsity in the rat hippocampus during performance of the Morris water task (MWT) and contextual fear discrimination (CFD) – two popular and distinct assays of LTM. We found that activity sparsity is highly reliable across memory tasks, wherein activity increases sequentially across the trisynaptic circuit (DG &lt; CA3 &lt; CA1) and decreases across the long axis (ventral&lt;dorsal). These results have important implications for models of hippocampal function and suggest that activity sparsity is a preserved property in the hippocampal system across cognitive settings.</p>

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has generated significant impacts on the forestry sector. Employment layoffs have led to an increase in return migration, resulting in additional labor supply and heightened family economic burdens. This research employs the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework to examine and predict sustainable forest management practices among families managing customary forests and village forests in Bali. Methods Purposive sampling was used to collect data from 71 managers of customary forests and village forests in Tenganan and Wanagiri. Partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the acquired data. Results The findings demonstrated that TPB can explain the sustainable forest management. The incorporation of an additional construct, Tri Hita Karana (THK), enhanced the model’s predictive power for both managerial intentions and behaviors in sustainable forest management. Specifically, THK influences management intentions through the mediation of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Conclusions This study established that THK, a fundamental value system in Balinese society, serves an antecedent predictor of behavioral intentions toward sustainable forest management. The relationship between THK and sustainable forest management intentions is mediated by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. This research makes significant theoretical and managerial contributions. First, it validates the established TPB framework within the context of COVID-19’s impact in Bali. Additionally, it provides scholars with insights for identifying other potential constructs that may influence forest land managers’ behavior.

                Background The purpose of the study was to assess the obstacles faced by diabetes patients in their self-care and determine the factors associated with these obstacles. The management of diabetes mellitus (DM) extends beyond the clinician’s efforts, with the responsibility of the care also being shared by the patient to achieve better treatment outcomes and prevent complications. Self-care management is the most important part of DM treatment, which includes diet, regular exercise, blood glucose monitoring, medication and foot care. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 107 type 2 DM patients aged >18 years using the Diabetes Obstacles Questionnaire-30. Patients scoring a mean response score >3 were considered to have an obstacle. We included age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), duration of DM and blood glucose levels as factors for regression analysis and a P value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results A large majority (64.5%, n = 69) of our participants were aged above 55 years and belonged to lower socio-economic status (65.4%, n = 70). Family history of DM was present in 41% (n=44) of the participants. The median duration of DM among the participant was 10 (4 – 7) years. In our study, the participants faced obstacles for two items in the domains: Support from Friends & Family (mean score: 3.73) and Knowledge of the Disease (mean score: 3.58). A multinominal regression analysis revealed SES was predictive of participants who could not understand information from literature with a P. value of 0.002 (OR: 3.65, CI: 1.60-8.338). Conclusion The two major obstacles to self-management practices that were identified were in the domains of Support from Friends and Family, and Knowledge of the Disease. Socioeconomic status was identified to be a predictive factor associated with the participants who are not able to understand information from the literature.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98449">Human airway macrophages are metabolically reprogrammed by IFN-γ resulting in glycolysis-dependent functional plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Airway macrophages (AM) are the predominant immune cell in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection, making them a target for host directed therapy. Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism. A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung resident AM. We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM; as a model of blood derived macrophages) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94703">Taste triggers a homeostatic temperature control in hungry flies</a></h4>

              
                Hungry animals consistently show a desire to obtain food. Even a brief sensory detection of food can trigger bursts of physiological and behavioral changes. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the sensation of food triggers the acute behavioral response remain elusive. We have previously shown in <i>Drosophila</i> that hunger drives a preference for low temperature. Because <i>Drosophila</i> is a small ectotherm, a preference for low temperature implies a low body temperature and a low metabolic rate. Here, we show that taste-sensing triggers a switch from a low to a high temperature preference in hungry flies. We show that taste stimulation by artificial sweeteners or optogenetics triggers an acute warm preference, but is not sufficient to reach the fed state. Instead, nutrient intake is required to reach the fed state. The data suggest that starvation recovery is controlled by two components: taste-evoked and nutrient-induced warm preferences, and that taste and nutrient quality play distinct roles in starvation recovery. Animals are motivated to eat based on time of day or hunger. We found that clock genes and hunger signals profoundly control the taste-evoked warm preferences. Thus, our data suggest that the taste-evoked response is one of the critical layers of regulatory mechanisms representing internal energy homeostasis and metabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97793">The neural dynamics of positive and negative expectations of pain</a></h4>

              
                Pain is heavily modulated by expectations. Whereas the integration of expectations with sensory information has been examined in some detail, little is known about how positive and negative expectations are generated and their neural dynamics from generation over anticipation to the integration with sensory information. The present preregistered study employed a novel paradigm to induce positive and negative expectations on a trial-by-trial basis and examined the neural mechanisms using combined EEG-fMRI measurements (n=50). We observed substantially different neural representations between the anticipatory and the actual pain period. In the anticipation phase i.e., before the nociceptive input, the insular cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed increased activity for directed expectations regardless of their valence. Interestingly, a differentiation between positive and negative expectations within the majority of areas only occurred after the arrival of nociceptive information. FMRI-informed EEG analyses could reliably track the temporal sequence of processing showing an early effect in the DLPFC, followed by the anterior insula and late effects in the ACC. The observed effects indicate the involvement of different expectation-related subprocesses, including the transformation of visual information into a value signal that is maintained and differentiated according to its valence only during stimulus processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94706">Ligand response of guanidine-IV riboswitch at single-molecule level</a></h4>

              
                Riboswitches represent a class of non-coding RNA that possess the unique ability to specifically bind ligands and, in response, regulate gene expression. A recent report unveiled a type of riboswitch, known as the guanidine-IV riboswitch, which responds to guanidine levels to regulate downstream genetic transcription. However, the precise molecular mechanism through which the riboswitch senses its target ligand and undergoes conformational changes remain elusive. This gap in understanding has impeded the potential applications of this riboswitch. To bridge this knowledge gap, our study investigated the conformational dynamics of the guanidine-IV riboswitch RNA upon ligand binding. We employed single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to dissect the behaviors of the aptamer, terminator, and full-length riboswitch. Our findings indicated that the aptamer portion exhibited higher sensitivity to guanidine compared to the terminator and full-length constructs. Additionally, we utilized Position-specific Labelling of RNA (PLOR) combined with smFRET to observe, at the single-nucleotide and single-molecule level, the structural transitions experienced by the guanidine-IV riboswitch during transcription. Notably, we discovered that the influence of guanidine on the riboswitch RNA’s conformations was significantly reduced after the transcription of 88 nucleotides. Furthermore, we proposed a folding model for the guanidine-IV riboswitch in the absence and presence of guanidine, thereby providing insights into its ligand-response mechanism.

">Environmental exposures and familial background alter the induction of neuropathology and inflammation after SARS-CoV-2 infection.</a></h4>

              
                AbstractBasal ganglia disease has been reported as a post-infection sequela of several viruses, with documentation of this phenomenon from the H1N1 Spanish flu to the recent COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.

">A signal of temporal integration in the human auditory brain: psychological insights, EEG evidence, and clinical application</a></h4>

              
                Temporal integration, the process by which the auditory system combines sound information over a curtain period to form a coherent auditory object, is essential for coherent auditory perception, yet its neural mechanisms remain underexplored. We use a "transitional click train" paradigm, which concatenates two click trains with slightly differing inter-click intervals (ICIs), to investigate temporal integration in the human cortex. Using a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG), we recorded responses from 42 healthy participants exposed to regular and irregular transitional click trains and conducted change detection tasks. Regular transitional click trains elicited significant change responses in the human cortex, indicative of temporal integration, whereas irregular trains did not. These neural responses were modulated by ICI length, ICI contrast, and regularity. Behavioral data mirrored EEG findings, showing enhanced detection for regular conditions compared to irregular conditions and pure tones. Furthermore, variations in change responses were associated with decision-making processes. Temporal continuity was critical, as introducing gaps between click trains diminished both behavioral and neural responses. In clinical assessments, 22 coma patients exhibited diminished or absent change responses, effectively distinguishing them from healthy individuals. Our findings identify distinct neural markers of temporal integration and highlight the potential of transitional click trains for clinical diagnostics.

">RIG-I mediated neuron-specific IFN type 1 signaling in FUS-ALS induces neurodegeneration and offers new biomarker-driven individualized treatment options for (FUS-)ALS</a></h4>

              
                Recent research has demonstrated significant aberrant activation of the innate immune system in ALS model systems due to mutations in SOD1, TARDBP and C9orf72 through stimulation of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway. This pathway can be activated, for example, by cGAS-STING-dependent sensing of cytosolic DNA that accumulates as a result of chronic DNA damage and defective mitochondria, both of which have been identified as early pathology in FUS-ALS spinal motor neurons (sMNs). Therefore, we analysed innate immune pathways in isogenic and non-isogenic FUSmut iPSC-derived sMNs, which revealed upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and activation of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway in FUSmut sMNs. Notably, we found evidence for accumulation of cytosolic dsRNA and its sensor RIG-I in FUS-ALS. RIG-I, but not MDA5, was found to be significantly upregulated in FUSmut sMNs, and siRNA-mediated knockdown abolished the increased IFN1 activation in FUSmut sMNs. In post-mortem analysis, RIG-I was highly expressed in the remaining alpha-MNs. IFN treatment of FUSwt sMNs phenocopied the axonal degeneration of FUSmut sMNs. Mechanistically, DNA damage induction did not increase ISG expression, but dsRNA was increased in the mitochondria of FUSmut sMNs. Mitochondrial transcription, a known source of dsRNA, was found to be upregulated in compartmental axonal RNAseq analysis and its inhibition reduced ISGs in FUS-ALS sMNs. Furthermore, the JAK-STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib alleviated the upregulated ISG expression and reversed the axonal degeneration of sMNs. Finally, we analysed ISG expression in peripheral blood samples from 18 FUS-ALS patients, eight of whom had a significantly elevated interferon signature. Blood ISGs correlated with disease progression rate and negatively with disease duration. RIG-I-mediated innate immune activation in sMNs may be an interesting novel individualised biomarker-driven therapeutic target in (FUS-) ALS.

">Early-life adversity alters adult nucleus incertus neurons: implications for neuronal mechanisms of increased stress and compulsive behavior vulnerability</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUNDEarly-life stress (ELS) arising from physical and emotional abuse disrupts normal brain development and impairs hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function, increasing the risk of psychopathological disorders and compulsive behaviors in adulthood. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. The brainstem nucleus incertus (NI) is a highly stress-sensitive locus, involved in behavioral activation and stress-induced reward (food/alcohol) seeking, but its sensitivity to ELS remains unexplored.

METHODSWe used neonatal maternal separation stress in rats as a model for ELS and examined its impact on stress-related mRNA and neuropeptide expression in the NI, using fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Using whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings we determined the influence of ELS on the synaptic activity, excitability, and electrophysiological properties of NI neurons. Using c-Fos protein expression we also assessed the impact of ELS on the sensitivity of NI neurons to acute restraint stress in adulthood.

RESULTSELS weakened the acute stress responsiveness of NI neurons, and caused dendritic shrinkage, impaired synaptic transmission and altered electrophysiological properties of NI neurons in a cell-type-specific manner. Additionally, ELS increased the expression of mRNA encoding corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 and the nerve-growth factor receptor, TrkA in adult NI.

CONCLUSIONSThe multiple, cell-type specific changes in the expression of neuropeptides and molecules associated with stress and substance abuse in the NI, as well as impairments in NI neuron morphology and electrophysiology caused by early-life stress and observed in the adult brain, may contribute to the increased susceptibility to stress and compulsive behaviors observed in individuals with a history of ELS.

">How much is 'enough'? Considerations for functional connectivity reliability in pediatric naturalistic fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) measurements are important for robust and reproducible findings, yet pediatric functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) faces unique challenges due to head motion and bias toward shorter scans. Passive viewing conditions during fMRI offer advantages for scanning pediatric populations, but FC reliability under these conditions remains underexplored. Here, we used precision fMRI data collected across three passive viewing conditions to directly compare FC reliability profiles between 25 pre-adolescent children and 25 adults, with each participant providing over 2.8 hours of data over four sessions. We found that FC test-retest correlations increased asymptotically with scan length, with children requiring nearly twice the post-censored scan time (24.6 minutes) compared to adults (14.4 minutes) to achieve comparable reliability, and that this effect was only partly attributable to head motion. Reliability differences between lower-motion adults and higher-motion children were spatially non-uniform and largest in ventral anterior temporal and frontal regions. While averaging features within functional networks improved intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) reliability, values for higher-motion children remained in the poor-to-fair ICC range even with 48 minutes of total scan time. Viewing conditions with greater engagement reduced head motion in children but had lower FC reliability compared to less engaging 'low-demand' videos, suggesting complex state- or condition-related trade-offs. These findings have important implications for developmental neuroimaging study design, particularly for higher motion pediatric populations.

                Making decisions based on noisy sensory information is a crucial function of the brain. Various decisions take each sensory signals uncertainty into account. Here, we investigated whether perceptual inferences rely on accurate estimates of sensory uncertainty. Participants completed a set of auditory, visual, and audiovisual spatial as well as temporal tasks. We fitted Bayesian observer models of each task to every participants complete dataset. Crucially, in some model variants the uncertainty estimates employed for perceptual inferences were independent of the actual uncertainty associated with the sensory signals. Model comparisons and analysis of the best-fitting parameters revealed that, in unimodal and bimodal contexts, participants perceptual decisions relied on overconfident estimates of auditory spatial and audiovisual temporal uncertainty. These findings challenge the ubiquitous assumption that human behavior optimally accounts for sensory uncertainty regardless of sensory domain.

                We demonstrate here that astrocytes in the striatum interact with striatal dopamine in bidirectional signaling with dopamine release actively driving surges in astrocytic Ca++, which in turn modulate and reduce subsequent dopamine release. These Ca++ surges accurately predict behavioral state changes from task-engaged to task-disengaged states, but fail to predict detailed action parameters. We propose that interactions between striatal astrocytes and dopamine are strong candidates to modulate nigro-striato-nigral loop function underlying on-going behavioral state dynamics.

">Reproducible Brain Entropy (BEN) Alterations During Rumination</a></h4>

              
                Rumination, characterized by recurrent and repetitive thinking, is closely associated with mental disorders such as depression. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this mental state remain poorly understood. In this study, we use a relatively novel neuroimaging analysis method-Brain Entropy (BEN) to quantitatively assess the irregularity, disorder, and complexity of brain activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of rumination. We utilized a publicly available MRI dataset from three different scanners. The dataset included 41 healthy adult participants who completed identical fMRI tasks on IPCASGE, PKUGE, and PKUSIEMENS scanners. The time interval between the two visits was 22.0 +/- 14.6 days. The fMRI session included four runs: resting state, sad memory, rumination, and distraction. Whole brain voxel-wise BEN differences of task state and resting state, rumination and sad memory, distraction and sad memory, and rumination and distraction were tested and overlap regions after thresholded (p<0.05) across the three scanners were identified as exhibiting significant differences. The results demonstrate distinct alterations in BEN across mental states. Compared to the sad memory condition, decreased BEN was found in the visual cortex (VC) during rumination and decreased BEN in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu) during distraction. However, when compared to distraction, rumination showed increased BEN in the PCC/PCu. These findings suggest that rumination involves heightened internal focus and reduced processing of external environmental information. This study highlights BEN as a valuable metric for elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying rumination and its role in depression.

">The VGCC auxiliary subunit α2δ1 is an extracellular GluA1 interactor and regulates LTP, spatial memory, and seizure susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent synaptic accumulation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and subsequent long-term synaptic strengthening underlie different forms of learning and memory. The AMPAR subunit GluA1 amino-terminal domain is essential for synaptic docking of AMPAR during LTP, but the precise mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Using unbiased proteomics, we identified the epilepsy and intellectual disability-associated VGCC auxiliary subunit 2{delta}1 as a candidate extracellular AMPAR slot. Presynaptic 2{delta}1 deletion in CA3 affects synaptic AMPAR incorporation during long-term potentiation, but not basal synaptic transmission, at CA1 synapses. Consistently, mice lacking 2{delta}1 in CA3 display a specific impairment in CA1-dependent spatial memory, but not in memory tests involving other cortical regions. Decreased seizure susceptibility in mice lacking 2{delta}1 in CA3 suggests a regulation of circuit excitability by 2{delta}1/AMPAR interactions. Our study sheds light on the regulation of activity-dependent AMPAR trafficking, and highlights the synaptic organizing roles of 2{delta}1

">ARBEL: A Machine Learning Tool with Light-Based Image Analysis for Automatic Classification of 3D Pain Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                A detailed analysis of pain-related behaviors in rodents is essential for exploring both the mechanisms of pain and evaluating analgesic efficacy. With the advancement of pose-estimation tools, automatic single-camera video animal behavior pipelines are growing and integrating rapidly into quantitative behavioral research. However, current existing algorithms do not consider an animals body-part contact intensity with- and distance from- the surface, a critical nuance for measuring certain pain-related responses like paw withdrawals (flinching) with high accuracy and interpretability. Quantifying these bouts demands a high degree of attention to body part movement and currently relies on laborious and subjective human visual assessment. Here, we introduce a supervised machine learning algorithm, ARBEL: Automated Recognition of Behavior Enhanced with Light, that utilizes a combination of pose estimation together with a novel light-based analysis of body part pressure and distance from the surface, to automatically score pain-related behaviors in freely moving mice in three dimensions. We show the utility and accuracy of this algorithm for capturing a range of pain-related behavioral bouts using a bottom-up animal behavior platform, and its application for robust drug-screening. It allows for rapid objective pain behavior scoring over extended periods with high precision. This open-source algorithm is adaptable for detecting diverse behaviors across species and experimental platforms.

">Voluntary locomotion induces an early and remote hemodynamic decrease in the large cerebral veins</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Behavior regulates dural and cerebral vessels, with spontaneous locomotion inducing dural vessel constriction and increasing stimulus-evoked cerebral hemodynamic responses. It is vital to investigate the function of different vascular network components, surrounding and within the brain, to better understand the role of the neurovascular unit in health and neurodegeneration. Aim: We characterized locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses across vascular compartments of the whisker barrel cortex: artery, vein, parenchyma, draining and meningeal vein. Approach: Using 2D-OIS, hemodynamic responses during locomotion were recorded in 9-12-month-old awake mice: wild-type, Alzheimer's disease (AD), atherosclerosis or mixed (atherosclerosis/AD) models. Within somatosensory cortex, responses were taken from pial vessels inside the whisker barrel region ([WBR]: "whisker artery" and "whisker vein"), a large vein from the sagittal sinus adjacent to the WBR (draining vein), and meningeal vessels from the dura mater (which do not penetrate cortical tissue). Results: We demonstrate that locomotion evokes an initial decrease in total hemoglobin (HbT) within the draining vein before the increase in HbT within WBR vessels. The locomotion event size influences the magnitude of the HbT increase in the pial vessels of the WBR, but not of the early HbT decrease within the draining veins. Following locomotion onset, an early HbT decrease was also observed in the overlying meningeal vessels, which unlike within the cortex did not go on to exceed baseline HbT levels during the remainder of the locomotion response. We show that locomotion-induced hemodynamic responses are altered in disease in the draining vein and whisker artery, suggesting this could be an important neurodegeneration biomarker. Conclusion: This initial reduction in HbT within the draining and meningeal veins potentially serves as a 'space saving' mechanism, allowing for large increases in cortical HbT associated with locomotion. Given this mechanism is impacted by disease it may provide an important target for vascular-based therapeutic interventions.

">Similarity in Early Life Stress Exposure is Associated with Similarity in Neural Representations in Early Adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Early life stress (ELS) has profound implications for developmental trajectories, yet the neural mechanisms underlying its long-term effects remain incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined whether interindividual similarity in ELS exposure aligns with similarity in neural representations and behavioral task performance in early adulthood. Leveraging a 20-year longitudinal dataset of Finnish families, we evaluated 87 young adults who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotional go/no-go task. Intersubject representational similarity analysis (IS-RSA) was used to assess the associations between pairwise similarities in prospectively or retrospectively measured ELS, neural representations in 360 cortical regions, and task performance. We incorporated multidimensional scaling and Procrustes alignment to visualize interindividual differences in representational spaces. Prospective ELS, but not Retrospective ELS, was significantly associated with neural representational similarity across 40 cortical regions, including the anterior insula, frontal operculum, and anterior cingulate cortex. Higher Prospective ELS was also linked to reduced detection sensitivity, mediated by neural responses to angry facial expressions. These findings highlight the systematic and chronic effects of more moderate ELS on brain development and emphasize the value of prospective measurements and advanced similarity analyses in capturing the nuanced influences of ELS. By integrating spatial and shape analytical techniques, the present study provides new insights into the long-term neurobiological correlates of ELS and introduces novel methodological tools for neurodevelopmental research.

">The effects of varying intensities of unilateral handgrip fatigue on bilateral movement</a></h4>

              
                The human ability to maintain adequate movement quality despite muscle fatigue is of critical importance to master physically demanding activities of daily life and for retaining independence following motor impairments. Many real-life situations call for asymmetrical activation of extremity muscles leading to unilateral manifestations of muscle fatigue. Repeated unilateral handgrip contractions at submaximal force have been shown to be associated with neural dynamics in both contralateral and ipsilateral cortical motor areas and improved response times of the contralateral, unfatigued homologue in a button-press task. However, it remains unclear whether the observed improvement in contralateral response latency translates into higher-level benefits in movement quality. To investigate this, 30 healthy participants underwent unilateral handgrip fatiguing tasks at 5%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force. Subsequently, bimanual movement quality was assessed in an object-hit task using a Kinarm robot. The protocol at 50% and 75% of MVC elicited clear signs of muscle fatigue compared to the control condition (5%) measured by a decline in force, post-exercise deterioration in MVC, characteristic changes in surface electromyography magnitudes, and increases in ratings of perceived exertion. No change was observed on kinematic measures in the object-hit task for both arms indicating that unilateral handgrip fatigue did not elicit measurable effects on higher-level movement quality on the ipsilateral or contralateral homologue. Previously reported improvements on contralateral response latency were not found to translate into advanced movement quality benefits.

">Decoding task representations that support generalization in hierarchical task</a></h4>

              
                Task knowledge is encoded hierarchically such that complex tasks are composed of simpler tasks. This compositional organization also supports generalization to facilitate learning of related but novel complex tasks. To study how the brain implements composition and generalization in hierarchical task learning, we trained human participants on two complex tasks that shared a simple task and tested them on a novel complex task whose composition could be inferred via the shared simple task. Behaviorally, we observed faster learning of the novel complex task than control tasks (i.e., behavioral generalization effect). Using electroencephalogram (EEG) data, we could decode the constituent simple tasks when a complex task was performed (i.e., EEG composition effect). Crucially, the shared simple task, although not part of the novel complex task, could be reliably decoded from the novel complex task. The decoding strength was also correlated with EEG composition effect and behavioral generalization effect. The findings demonstrate how generalization in task learning is implemented via task reinstatement.

">The efficacy of resting-state fMRI denoising pipelines for motion correction and behavioural prediction.</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a pivotal tool for mapping the functional organization of the brain and its relation to individual differences in behaviour. One challenge for the field is that rs-fMRI signals are contaminated by multiple sources of noise that can contaminate these rs-fMRI signals, affecting the reliability and validity of any derivative phenotypes and attenuating their correlations with behaviour. Here, we investigate the efficacy of different noise mitigation pipelines, including white-matter and cerebrospinal fluid regression, independent component analysis (ICA) - based artefact removal, volume censoring, global signal regression (GSR), and diffuse cluster estimation and regression (DiCER), in simultaneously achieving two objectives: mitigating motion-related artifacts and augmenting brain-behaviour associations. Our analysis, which employed three distinct quality control metrics to evaluate motion influence and a kernel ridge regression for behavioural predictions of 81 different behavioural variables across two independent datasets, revealed that no single pipeline universally excels at achieving both objectives consistently across different cohorts. Pipelines combining ICA-FIX and GSR demonstrate a reasonable trade-off between motion reduction and behavioural prediction performance, but inter-pipeline variations in predictive performance are modest.

">Overactivation of prefrontal astrocytes impairs cognition through the metabolic pathway of central kynurenines</a></h4>

              
                Astrocyte dysfunctions have long been implicated in psychiatric and cognitive disorders, yet the precise mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. Here, we show that chemogenetic activation of prefrontal astrocytes in mice impairs short-term memory and sensorimotor gating and attenuates the activation of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the prefrontal cortex. These alterations are accompanied by increases in prefrontal levels of kynurenic acid (KYNA), a key metabolite of the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, known to be produced by astrocytes, which serves as an endogenous antagonist of NMDA receptors. Pharmacological inhibition of kynurenine aminotransferase II, the key enzyme mediating the transamination of KYN to KYNA, reinstates the astrocyte-mediated impairments in short-term memory and sensorimotor gating, and normalizes the deficits in prefrontal PV interneuron activation. Our study identifies a mechanistic link between overactivation of prefrontal astrocytes, increased production of KYNA, and cognitive as well as cellular dysfunctions involved in major psychiatric disorders and beyond.

                Precise regulation of the chromatin environment through post-translational histone modification modulates transcription and controls brain development. Not surprisingly, mutations in a large number of histone-modifying enzymes underlie complex brain disorders. In particular, the histone methyltransferase ASH1L modifies histone marks linked to transcriptional activation and has been implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of ASH1L-asociated disease remain underexplored. We generated human isogenic stem cells with a mutation in ASH1Ls catalytic domain. We find that ASH1L dysfunction results in reduced neurite outgrowth, which correlates with alterations in the chromatin profile of activating and repressive histone marks, as well as the dysregulation of gene programs important for neuronal structure and function implicated in neuropsychiatric disease. We also identified a novel regulatory node implicating both the SP and Kruppel-like families of transcription factors and ASH1L relevant to human neuronal development. Finally, we rescue cellular defects linked to ASH1L dysfunction by leveraging two independent epigenetic mechanisms that promote transcriptional activation. In summary, we identified an ASH1L-driven epigenetic and transcriptional axis essential for human brain development and complex brain disorders that provide insights into future therapeutic strategies for ASH1L-related disorders.

">Hyperactive neuronal networks facilitate tau spread in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Pathological tau spreads throughout the brain along neuronal connections in Alzheimers disease (AD), but the mechanisms that underlie this process are poorly understood. Given the high incidence and deleterious consequences of epileptiform activity in AD, we hypothesized neuronal hyperactivity and seizures are key factors in tau spread. To examine these interactions, we created a novel mouse model involving the cross of targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP) mice and the 5 times familial AD (5XFAD; 5X-TRAP) model allowing for the permanent fluorescent labelling of neuronal activity. To establish a causal role of seizures in tau spread, we seeded mice with human AD brain-derived tau lysate and induced seizures with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling. Comprehensive brain mapping of tau pathology and neuronal activity revealed that basal hyperactivity in 5X-TRAP mice was associated with increased tau spread, which was exacerbated by seizure induction through activated networks and correlated with memory deficits. Computational modeling revealed that anterograde tau spread was elevated in 5X-TRAP mice and that regional neuronal activity was predictive of tau spread to that brain region. On a cellular level, we found that in both saline and PTZ-treated 5X-TRAP mice, hyperactive neurons disproportionately contributed to the spread of tau. Further, we found that Synaptogyrin-3, a synaptic vesicle protein that interacts with tau, was increased following PTZ kindling in 5X-TRAP mice, possibly indicative of a synaptic mechanism underlying seizure-exacerbated tau spread. Importantly, postmortem AD brain tissue from patients with a history of seizures showed increased tau pathology in patterns indicative of increased spread and increased Synaptogyrin-3 levels compared to those without seizures. Overall, our study identifies neuronal hyperactivity and seizures as key factors underlying the pathobiological and cognitive progression of AD. Therapies targeting these factors should be tested clinically to slow tau spread and AD progression.

">Integrated phenomenology and brain connectivity demonstrate changes in nonlinear processing in jhana advanced meditation</a></h4>

              
                We present a neurophenomenological case study investigating distinct neural connectivity regimes during an advanced concentrative absorption meditation called jhana (ACAM-J),characterized by highly-stable attention and mental absorption. Using EEG recordings and phenomenological ratings (29 sessions) from a meditator with +20,000 hours of practice, we evaluated connectivity metrics tracking distinct large-scale neural interactions: nonlinear (WSMI and Directed Information), capturing non-oscillatory dynamics; and linear (WPLI) connectivity metrics, capturing oscillatory synchrony. Results demonstrate ACAM-J are better distinguished by non-oscillatory compared to oscillatory dynamics across multiple frequency ranges. Furthermore, combining attention-related phenomenological ratings with WSMI improves Bayesian decoding of ACAM-J compared to neural metrics alone. Crucially, deeper ACAM-J indicate an equalization of feedback and feedforward processes, suggesting a balance of internally- and externally-driven information processing. Our results reveal distinct neural dynamics during ACAM-J, offering insights into refined conscious states and highlighting the value of nonlinear neurophenomenological approaches to studying attentional states.

">Hydrogel encapsulation of a designed fluorescent protein biosensor for continuous measurements of sub-100 nanomolar nicotine</a></h4>

              
                The reinforcing and addictive properties of nicotine result from concentration- and time-dependent activation, desensitization, and upregulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, time-resolved [nicotine] measurement in people who consume nicotine is challenging, as current approaches are expensive, invasive, tedious, and discontinuous. To address the challenge of continuous nicotine monitoring in human biofluids, we report the encapsulation of a purified, previously developed fluorescent biosensor protein, iNicSnFR12, into acrylamide hydrogels and PEGDA hydrogels. We optimized the hydrogels for optical clarity and straightforward slicing. With fluorescence photometry of the hydrogels in microscopes and a miniscope, [nicotine] is detected at the smoking- and vaping- relevant level of 10 - 100 nM (1.62 - 16.2 ng/ml). Concentration-response relations are consistent with previous measurements on isolated iNicSnFR12. Leaching of iNicSnFR12 from the hydrogel and inactivation of iNicSnFR are minimal for several days, and nicotine can be detected for at least 10 months after casting. This work provides the molecular, photophysical, and instrumental bases for personal, wearable continuous [nicotine] monitoring, with straightforward extensions to existing, homologous 'iDrugSnFR' proteins for other abused and prescribed drugs.

">MEG signals reveal arm posture coding and intrinsic movement plans in parietofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Movement planning processes must account for body posture to accurately convert sensory signals into movement plans. While movement plans can be computed relative to the world (extrinsic), intrinsic muscle commands tuned for current limb posture are ultimately needed to execute spatially accurate movements. The whole-brain topology and dynamics of this process are largely unknown. Here, we use high spatiotemporal resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans combined with a Pro-/Anti-wrist pointing task with 2 opposing forearm postures to investigate this question. First, we computed cortical source activity in 16 previously identified bilateral cortical areas (Alikhanian, et al., Frontiers in Neuroscience 2013). We then contrasted oscillatory activity related to opposing wrist postures to find posture coding and test when and where extrinsic and intrinsic motor codes occurred. We found a distinct pair of overlapping networks coding for posture (predominantly in {gamma} band) vs. posture-specific movement plans ( and {beta}). Some areas (e.g., pIPS) only showed extrinsic motor coding, and others (e.g., AG) only showed intrinsic coding, but the majority showed both types of codes. In the latter case, intrinsic codes appeared slightly before extrinsic codes and persisted in parallel across different cortical areas. These findings are consistent with two cortical networks for 1) direct feed-forward sensorimotor transformations to intrinsic muscle coordinates (for rapid control) and 2) computations of extrinsic spatial coordinates, possibly for use in higher-level aspects of visually-guided action, such as spatial updating and internal performance monitoring.

Significance statement / author summaryIt is thought that the brain incorporates posture into extrinsic spatial codes to compute intrinsic (muscle-centered) motor commands, but the whole-brain temporal dynamics of this process is unknown. Here we employed human magneto-encephalography (MEG) to track this process across 16 bilateral cortical sites. We identified two, largely overlapping subnetworks for posture-dependent intrinsic codes, and extrinsic spatial coding. Surprisingly, the direct transformation from sensorimotor coordinates to intrinsic commands preceded the appearance of extrinsic codes, suggesting that extrinsic motor codes are derived from intrinsic codes for higher-level cognitive purposes.

">Asynchronous subunit transitions precede acetylcholine receptor activation</a></h4>

              
                Rapid communication at synapses is facilitated by postsynaptic receptors, which convert a chemical signal into an electrical response. In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transition through a series of intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation. These transitions are usually framed in terms of a mechanism where agonist binding and channel activation are separate events. Here, we collect cryo-EM images over a range of agonist concentrations to define structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. We show that agonist binding to a single agonist site stabilizes an intermediate state where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit has transitioned to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Binding of agonist to the second agonist site fully activates the remaining subunits leading to hydration of the ion pore. Uniting this cryo-EM derived intermediate structure with single-channel recordings leads to a model where individual acetylcholine receptor subunits asynchronously undergo conformational transitions, and thus a sequential activation mechanism that has implications for the entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.

">Synaptic acetylcholine induces sharp wave ripples in the basolateral amygdala through nicotinic receptors</a></h4>

              
                While the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is critical in the consolidation of emotional memories, mechanisms underlying memory consolidation in this region are not well understood. In the hippocampus, memory consolidation depends upon network signatures termed sharp wave ripples (SWR). These SWRs largely occur during states of awake rest or slow wave sleep and are inversely correlated with cholinergic tone. While high frequency cholinergic stimulation can inhibit SWRs through muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, it is unclear how nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or different cholinergic firing patterns may influence SWR generation. SWRs are also present in BLA in vivo. Interestingly, the BLA receives extremely dense cholinergic inputs, yet the relationship between acetylcholine (ACh) and BLA SWRs is unexplored. Here, using brain slice electrophysiology in male and female mice, we show that brief stimulation of ACh inputs to BLA reliably induces SWRs that resemble those that occur in the BLA in vivo. Repeated ACh-SWRs are induced with single pulse stimulation at low, but not higher frequencies. ACh-SWRs are driven by nicotinic receptors which recruit different classes of local interneurons and trigger glutamate release from external inputs. In total, our findings establish a previously undefined mechanism for SWR induction in the brain. They also challenge the previous notion of neuromodulators as purely modulatory agents gating these events but instead reveal these systems can directly instruct SWR induction with temporal precision. Further, these results intriguingly suggest a new role for the nicotinic system in emotional memory consolidation.

">Microglial engulfing of glutamatergic inputs and diminished excitability of D1 medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens by peripheral inflammatory insult</a></h4>

              
                Neuroimmune responses to systemic inflammation can generate anxiodepressive behaviors and psychomotor slowing. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a neural hub encoding mood and motivation that contributes to the locomotor and mood dampening effects of neuroinflammation. Dopamine receptor 1 mediums spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) of the NAc regulate locomotor activity, motivated behavior and emotional states and are modulated by microglial reactivity. Here, we evaluated sickness- and anxiety-like behaviors along with D1-MSN activity and microglial responses in the NAc to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. LPS stimulated anxiety-like behavior, blunted locomotion and reduced cFos expression in D1-MSNs of the NAc core and shell of male mice. These effects associated with reduced excitatory inputs (EPSCs) onto D1-MSNs as measured by whole cell patch-clamp. To determine if microglia contribute to changes in MSN activity, Ca2+ imaging of primary cultures containing NAc neurons with or without primary NAc microglia was performed. The presence of microglia decreased the activity of LPS-treated MSNs in response to dopamine and glutamate application and LPS stimulated microglial phagocytosis of MSN processes in co-cultures. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that in vivo LPS treatment enhanced morphological indices of microglia reactivity and engulfment of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) inputs in the NAc. Our results suggest that LPS reduces locomotion and stimulates anxiety via increasing microglia engulfment of excitatory inputs onto D1-MSNs, and highlight changes in NAc microglia phagocytic activity in the behavioral consequences of neuroinflammation.

">Characterizing vascular function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, and mixed Alzheimer's and atherosclerosis</a></h4>

              
                SignificanceAlzheimers disease does not occur in isolation and there are many comorbidities associated with the disease - especially diseases of the vasculature. Atherosclerosis is a known risk factor for the subsequent development of Alzheimers disease, therefore understanding how both diseases interact will provide a greater understanding of co-morbid disease progression and aid the development of potential new treatments.

AimThe current study characterizes hemodynamic responses and cognitive performance in APP/PS1 Alzheimers mice, atherosclerosis mice, and a mixed disease group (APP/PS1 & atherosclerosis) between the ages of 9 and 12 months.

ApproachWhisker-evoked hemodynamic responses and recognition memory were assessed in awake mice, immunohistochemistry to assess amyloid pathology, and histology to characterize atherosclerotic plaque load.

ResultsWe observed hemodynamic deficits in atherosclerosis mice (vs Alzheimers, mixed disease or wild-type mice), with reduced short-duration stimulus-evoked hemodynamic responses occurring when there was no concurrent locomotion during the stimulation period. Mixed Alzheimers and atherosclerosis models did not show differences in amyloid beta coverage in the cortex or hippocampus or atherosclerotic plaque burden in the aortic arch vs relevant Alzheimers or atherosclerosis controls. Consistent with the subtle vascular deficits and no pathology differences, we also observed no difference in performance on the novel object recognition task across groups.

ConclusionsThese results emphasize the importance of experimental design for characterizing vascular function across disease groups, as locomotion and stimulus duration impacted the ability to detect differences between groups. Whilst atherosclerosis did reduce hemodynamic responses, these were recovered in the presence of co-occurring Alzheimers disease which may provide targets for future studies to explore the potentially contrasting vasodilatory mechanisms these diseases impact.

">Connectivity in the human and the monkey brain probes causal involvement of the fornix in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by memory loss and severe deficits in cognitive function associated with neural degeneration in a network of brain regions. However, little is known about those regions' connectivity patterns and how that differs from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or healthy aging. To address that, we used diffusion-weighted MRI to determine connectivity across 11 key memory-related regions and their unique set of connections (connectivity fingerprints) to 14 white matter (WM) tracts. One WM tract particularly important for memory, and attractive target for therapeutic interventions in AD, is the fornix. However, determining fornix-specific contributions to memory deficits or therapeutic benefits is difficult, partly because the fornix carries numerous subcortical and cortical projections. To explore that, we additionally examined MRI-derived connectivity across homologous structures in non-human primates before and after fornix transections. We report several important findings. First, that connectivity between the hippocampus and the anterior thalamus (ATh) is strongly compromised in cognitive decline, as is fornix integrity. We also found strong reductions in the hippocampus-fornix and ATh-fornix connectivity in AD, demonstrating that fingerprint divergence across groups in hippocampal CA1 and ATh can identify differences between people with AD and MCI. In AD, we observed also elevated connectivity between WM tracts and the hippocampus or the ATh, suggesting a compensatory mechanism, which, importantly, depends on a viable fornix. We finally demonstrate that certain thalamic nuclei and hippocampal subfields link through the retrosplenial cortex in both species, highlighting its potential role as an alternative target for interventions in memory disorders.

                Background: Evidence suggests a non-specific mapping between psychiatric disorders and underlying neurobiological substrates. A dimensional psychopathology framework may prove useful for organizing observed neurobiological alterations along broad psychopathological dimensions. Methods: We applied latent class analysis to identify clinical cohorts of symptomatic homogeneity to represent the clinical end of specific psychopathological dimensions (i.e., internalizing/externalizing, p-factor), using baseline data (N = 11860) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. These cohorts were compared against neurotypical individuals in terms of deviations from the normality of cortical development, quantified using autoencoder-based normative models, to reveal cortical abnormalities. Results: We identified cortical thickness as an important MRI-derived index of psychopathology and revealed distinct structural abnormalities to broad psychopathological dimensions. Conclusion: This study highlights the value of person-centered analytic techniques, combined with normative modeling, to complement traditional associational methodologies in revealing neurobiological correlates of dimensional psychopathologies.

">Impact of a transient neonatal visual deprivation on the development of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex in humans</a></h4>

              
                How does experience shape the development of visual brain regions? We demonstrate that a transient period of visual deprivation early in life in humans leads to permanent alteration in the function of the early visual cortex (EVC), while leaving the categorical coding of downstream ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) mostly unaffected. We used fMRI to characterize the brain response to five categories (faces, bodies, objects, buildings and words) in a rare group of cataract-reversal individuals who experienced a transient period of blindness early in life, and in matched participants with typical visual development. We show that the encoding of low-level visual properties is impaired in EVC in cataract-reversal participants, while the categorical response in the VOTC is preserved. When altering the visual properties of our stimuli to mimic in controls the deficit of EVC response of the cataract, we observe a cascading alteration of the categorical coding from EVC to VOTC that is not observed in the cataract-reversal group. Our results show that a typical visual categorical organization develops in VOTC despite a period of visual deprivation early in life and in the presence of impaired processing in EVC. A deep neural network exposed to a visual diet that emulates the experience of our participants reproduced our brain observations within an artificial system. These findings emphasize how specific visual regions are differently affected by a period of visual deprivation early in life, with information encoded in EVC being permanently affected, while the categorical coding in VOTC shows resilience to deprivation.

">Emotion processing in mothers with bonding disorder during the first year postpartum: Results of an adapted fMRI emotional GoNoGo Task</a></h4>

              
                Maternal bonding refers to the unique emotional connection between a mother and her baby that gradually develops during the pre- and postpartum period. However, 3-24% of women report bonding disorders (BD), often accompanied by constraints for the mother-infant relationship with consequences for child development. The underlying neural patterns are not clarified yet. Our present study investigates the neural and behavioral patterns that underlie the processing of emotional infant stimuli over the 1 year postpartum. Mothers with and without BD (N = 45) completed an adapted (newly developed) Emotional Infant GoNoGo Task while fMRI scanning at 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum. Our results show that response inhibition towards emotional infant faces elicits stronger results than towards adult faces in all mothers. While behavioral performance in BD is impaired, the neural responses to emotional infant faces as compared to neutral faces are increased at 3 months postpartum in limbic structures such as the anterior cingulate and insula, as well as nucleus caudatus. At 6 and 12 months behavioral reactions assimilate in BD to those of healthy controls, while differences in neural reactions between BD and healthy controls increase at 6 months and decrease again at 12 months. These effects are independent of depressive symptoms. Our findings point to an experience-based adaptive process of emotion processing and responses to infants affect during the first year postpartum as a specific characteristic of clinical bonding disorder and thus might point to potential or future therapeutic interventions targeting emotion processing and regulation in mothers with BD.

Key Findings We present an adapted version of an Emotional GoNoGo Task for fMRI with infant stimuli: Behavioral inhibition towards emotional infant faces leads to increased activity in emotion regulation networks compared to adult faces in women during the 1st year postpartum.
 Women with postpartum bonding disorder (BD) show increased neural reactions (ACC, NCl Caudate, Insula) towards emotional baby faces (not adult faces, irrespectively of instructed inhibition and of valence) compared to a healthy control group (CG) at 3 months postpartum.
 On a behavioural level, women with BD show increased reaction times to positive emotional adult faces and higher error rates during the inhibition of reaction towards emotional baby faces at 3 months.
 Differences in neural reactions to emotional baby faces between BD and CG increase at 6 months and decrease again at 12 months, while behavioral reactions in BD assimilate to those of CG

">Purinergic Receptor P2Y13 Controls Activation and Mode of Division in Subependymal Adult Neural Stem Cells</a></h4>

              
                The subependymal zone (SEZ) of the mammalian brain is the most active germinal area that continues to generate newborn neurons throughout life. This area harbors a population of neural stem cells (NSCs) that can be found in different states of activation, each differing in proliferative capacity and molecular signature: quiescent NSCs (qNSCs), primed NSCs and activated NSCs (aNSCs). There is currently a void in terms of the specific markers available to effectively discern between these transient states. Likewise, the molecular signaling mechanisms controlling the transition from quiescence to activation and the subsequent mode of division remain largely unexplored. Here, we present evidence that the metabotropic P2Y13 purinergic receptor plays a critical role in regulating adult neurogenesis. We found that P2Y13 is specifically expressed in NSCs within the adult SEZ and that its levels can be used to distinguish qNSCs from aNSCs. Moreover, we identified the metabotropic P2Y13 purinergic receptor as a pivotal modulator of NSC dynamics, influencing both the balance between NSC quiescence and activation and the mode of NSC division at the subependymal zone.

	<p>Background: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a prevalent psychopathological condition, affecting 0.7&amp;amp;ndash;2.7% of the general population. Given the known link between identity formation and the temporal, metacognitive, and narrative processes that contribute to its coherence, the aim of the present systematic review is to synthesize the current literature about the relationship between identity diffusion and lived time in adult patients with BPD. This would enhance knowledge and treatments, leading to a better understanding of the implications of time processes on identity diffusion in BPD. Methods: According to PRISMA guidelines, the main databases were consulted, and specific eligibility criteria were applied. The selection leads to the inclusion of 15 articles, investigating through integrated techniques the lived time, memory, self-reported narratives, and metacognition in BPD subjects. Results: A general agreement among researchers was found, confirming greater difficulty for BPD subjects in producing autobiographical stories, logically and temporally integrated, characterized by positive content. Functional and structural alterations were detected to explain narrative incoherence, as well as symptoms such as emotional dysregulation and cognitive biases. Conclusions: The difficulty for BPD subjects in producing a coherent personal narrative has been interpreted as a correlation of anomalies in autobiographical memories and consequently identities, which were equally compromised by the experience of discontinuity in the temporal structure. This would confirm the hypothesis of the temporal fragmentation of the self in BPD. Although some limitations have been encountered, we suggest that the understanding of identity diffusion and lived time in BPD subjects could represent a useful guide for further research.</p>

	<p>The advent of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells has recently changed the prognosis of relapsing/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, showing response rates as high as 60 to 80%. Common toxicities reported in the pivotal clinical trials include the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), a stereotyped encephalopathy related to myeloid cell activation and blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier dysfunction, presenting with a distinctive cascade of dysgraphia, aphasia, disorientation, attention deficits, vigilance impairment, motor symptoms, seizures, and diffuse brain oedema. The tremendous oncological efficacy of CAR-T cells observed in systemic B-cell malignancies is leading to their growing use in patients with primary or secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas and in patients with solid tumours, including several CNS cancers. Early studies conducted in adult and paediatric patients with solid CNS tumours reported a distinct profile of neurotoxicity referred to as Tumour inflammation-associated neurotoxicity (TIAN), corresponding to local inflammation at the tumour site manifesting with focal neurological deficits or mechanical complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus). The present review summarises available data on the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cells for solid and haematological CNS malignancies, emphasising known and emerging phenotypes, ongoing challenges, and future perspectives.</p>

	<p>Background: The involvement of the circadian system in the etiology and treatment of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is becoming an increasingly important topic. The prodromal symptoms of PD include insomnia, fatigue, depression and sleep disturbance which herald the onset of the primary symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity while robbing patients of their quality of life. Light treatment (LT) has been implemented for modifying circadian function in PD but few studies have examined its use in a protracted term that characterizes PD itself. Methods: The present exploratory study monitors the effect of LT over a 10 year course of PD in the context of ongoing circadian function. Results: Improvement in circadian based symptoms were seen soon after LT commenced and continued for the duration of the study. Improvement in motor function was more subtle and was not distinguishable until 1.2 years after commencing treatment. Improvement in most motor and prodromal symptoms remained in steady state for the duration of the study as long as patients were compliant with daily use. Conclusions: The sequence of improvement in prodromal symptoms and motor function seen here parallels the slow, incremental repair process mimicking the protracted degenerative sequelae of PD that extends over decades. This process also emulates the slow incremental improvement characterizing the reparative course seen with circadian symptoms in other disorders that improve with LT. Recent findings from epidemiological work suggest that early disruption of circadian rhythmicity is associated with increased risk of PD and the present findings are consistent with that hypothesis. It is concluded that intervening in circadian function with LT presents a minimally invasive method that is compatible with internal timing that slows the degenerative process of PD.</p>

	<p>Objective: Visual processing deficits arising in dementia are associated with particular functional disability. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the built environment on mobility and navigation in people with dementia-related visual loss. Methods: Participants with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA; &amp;amp;ldquo;visual-variant Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s&amp;amp;rdquo;; n = 11), typical Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (tAD; N = 10), and controls (n = 13) repeatedly walked down routes within a simplified real-world setting. Participant groups were of comparable age and gender. Routes were of different complexity (straight, U-shaped, and S-shaped), overhead lighting levels (low and high) and with or without a dynamic LED (light-emitting diode) cue (trial n = 24). Ratios of walking times for each experimental condition (each complex route vs the straight route, high lighting vs low, and LED cue vs no cue) were compared between participant groups. Kinematic measures were produced from a total of 10,813 steps using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs). Results: The walking time ratios relating to route complexity were higher in the PCA group than in controls: 30.3% (95% CI [13.5%, 49.5%] higher for U-shaped vs straight and 31.9% [21.1%, 55.3%] for S-shaped vs straight, averaged over other conditions). The analogous results relating to route complexity for the tAD group were intermediate between those for the PCA and control groups. There was no evidence that walking time ratios differed according to lighting level or the presence of the LED cue. Conclusions: Findings contribute to evidence-based design for dementia-friendly environments, emphasizing consequences of environmental complexity for functional independence and mobility in people with dementia-related visual loss. Findings inform recommendations for environmental design to support the independence of individuals with dementia.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Emotional prosody, the intonation and rhythm of speech that conveys emotions, is vital for speech communication as it provides essential context and nuance to the words being spoken. This study explored how listeners automatically process emotional prosody in speech, focusing on different neural responses for the prosodic categories and potential sex differences. Methods: The pilot data here involved 11 male and 11 female adult participants (age range: 18&amp;amp;ndash;28). A multi-feature oddball paradigm was used, in which participants were exposed to sequences of non-repeating English words with emotional (angry, happy, sad) or neutral prosody while watching a silent movie. Results: Both mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a components were observed, indicating automatic perceptual grouping and neural sensitivity to emotional variations in speech. Women showed stronger MMN to angry than sad prosody, while men showed stronger MMN to angry than happy prosody. Happy prosody elicited the strongest P3a, but only in men. Conclusions: The findings challenge the notion that all facets of emotion processing are biased toward female superiority. However, these results from 22 young adult native English speakers should be interpreted with caution, as data from a more adequate sample size are needed to test the generalizability of the findings. Combined with results from studies on children and elderly adults, these preliminary data underscore the need to explore the complexities of emotional speech processing mechanisms to account for category and sex differences across the lifespan in a longitudinal perspective.</p>

	<p>Background: Among all professions, teaching is significantly affected by psycho-social risks with approximately 33.33% of educators reporting work-related fatigue. Suggestopedia, an effective pedagogical approach developed in Bulgaria, claims to induce positive psychological and cognitive benefits in both teachers and students. In order to gather scientific evidence, given the above statement, we designed a methodology to detect fatigue in Suggestopedia teachers based on neurocognitive analysis and psychological assessment. Methods: An increase in the EEG theta and alpha band powers is considered among the most reliable markers of fatigue. The proposed methodology introduces a robust framework for fatigue analysis. Initially, the changes in EEG band powers using the resting state EEG activity before and after teaching are measured. Subsequently, validated psychological questionnaires are used to gain subjective feedback on fatigue. The study participants include a control group (traditional teachers) and the test group (suggestopedia teachers) to assess whether suggestopedia practice mitigates fatigue among teachers. Observations: In a pilot study, the EEG data was analyzed by evaluating the interrelations between EEG bands and the alpha&amp;amp;ndash;beta ratio. The results of the proposed study are expected to provide comprehensive analysis for the fatigue levels of teachers. In future research, our goal is to position the described methodology as a robust approach for evaluating cognitive and emotional states.</p>

                In Peru, insect consumption, as a nutritional complement or as the main source in the diet, is limited to the regions of our the central jungle where Atta sexdens ants are consumed. An energy bar based on Andean grains with Atta sexdens ant flour was formulated. The ants were obtained from the department of San Martin, district of Rioja, province of Rioja. Four different formulations were prepared with different Atta sexdens ant flour concentrations: 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%. Moisture, total fat, ash, proteins, fiber, carbohydrates, instrumental texture, and organoleptic analysis (taste, texture, and color) were performed. The developed cereal energy bar presented a 10 g protein content in 100 g of the final product. Acceptability was evaluated in adolescents and young adult populations. The developed cereal bars presented a high protein content, adequate organoleptic properties and high acceptability. However, this must be considered in the context of the rising cost of protein-rich foods.

                Background Pathological response of liver metastases (LM) from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) to neoadjuvant therapy is a known prognostic factor associated with recurrence and survival. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of two prognostic scores in patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM), specifically in stage IV disease. Methods We conducted a study on patients with stage IV colorectal cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy (CT) followed by liver metastasis (LM) resection between 2015 and 2021. Among these patients, 57% had synchronous metastases (diagnosed at the same time as the primary tumor), while the remaining cases were metachronous (diagnosed after the primary tumor). Pathological response was evaluated using both the Rubbia-Brandt tumor regression grade (TRG) and the Blazer scoring system. We then assessed the performance of these two prognostic scores based on homogeneity (using the likelihood ratio, LR+), monotonicity, and discriminative ability (using the area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve, AUC). Results 70 cases were included in the study. Mean age was 56 years. The sex ratio (males/females) was 2.2. Forty patients were stage IV (57%) with synchronous all CRCLMs. The overall survival, all stages combined, was 85.5% at 12 months, 41.7% at 24 months and 19.3% at 36 months. The median survival was better in case of major response (TRG1/TRG2) evaluated at 40.1 and 41.1 months after diagnosis. In cases of partial response (TRG3), the median survival was 32.1 months. In cases with no response (TRG4/TRG5), survival was estimated at 29.9 and 18.5 months. The Rubbia-Brandt TRG had the highest LR+ (10.95). The LR+ of the Rubbia-Brandt score was greater than 10, so it was a test with very strong contribution. The LR+ of the Blazer score was between 5 and 10, it was a test with strong contribution. The Rubbia-Brandt TRG had the highest linearity value (10.73). With a higher AUC of the ROC curve (0.8), the Rubbia-Brandt TRG was better at predicting survival than the Blazer score. Conclusion Surgical resection is the gold standard for CRCLM, with improved prognosis from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathological response to CT is a key prognostic factor, and the Rubbia Brandt TRG system enhances survival predictivity when combined with ypTN stage.

                Background Research software is increasingly recognized as critical infrastructure in contemporary science. It spans a broad spectrum, including source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows, and executables, all created for or during research. While research funders have developed programs, initiatives, and policies to bolster research software’s role, there has been no empirical study of how these funders prioritize support for research software. Understanding their priorities is essential to clarify where current support is concentrated and to identify strategic gaps. Methods We conducted an online mixed methods survey of international research funders (n=36) to explore their priorities in supporting research software. The survey gathered data on the specific outcomes funders emphasize in their programs and initiatives for research software. Results The survey revealed that funders place strong emphasis on developing skills, promoting software sustainability, embedding open science practices, building community and collaboration, advancing research software funding mechanisms, increasing software visibility and use, fostering innovation, and ensuring security. Conclusions The findings highlight opportunities to enhance research software’s role through increased funder attention on professional recognition for software contributions and the non-technical, social aspects of research software sustainability. Addressing these areas could lead to more effective support and development of research software, ultimately benefitting the entire research ecosystem.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-188/v2?src=rss">Impacts of illegal trade on socio-emotional and behavioural skills in macaques [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Decades of research have illuminated the consequences of early adverse rearing experiences in laboratory macaque populations. However, knowledge of the impact of traumatic episodes in non-laboratory settings remains limited. This study investigates the socio-emotional and behavioural impacts of illegal trade on five macaque species, all victims of poaching. We studied 53 focal subjects residing at the Lao Conservation Trust for Wildlife (LCTW), a former zoo converted into a rescue and rehabilitation centre. We categorised their past experiences into seven aspects, encompassing maternal care and interactions with conspecifics. We assessed social engagement and cooperation by analysing social behaviours and employing the Social Responsiveness Scale. Emotional resilience was evaluated by measuring anxiety levels and the occurrence of abnormal behaviours, supported by a welfare questionnaire. Additionally, the introduction of Cattell’s 16PF questionnaire in macaques for the first time aimed to reveal the influence of traumatic experiences on their personality traits. Our findings underscore the significance of early social exposure to conspecifics. Macaques deprived of juvenile social contact show reduced social behaviours and a tendency towards social avoidance in adulthood. Human-reared macaques display increased abnormal behaviours in social contexts, which compromises welfare. Social deprivation with conspecifics during infancy negatively affects psychological stimulation and overall welfare, with prolonged time in illegal trade correlating with increased anxiety levels. Personality traits, such as ‘Calmness’ and ‘Unfriendliness’, are shaped by rearing conditions, with macaques deprived of social interaction showing higher levels of introversion. In summary, the more time macaques spend in human care with minimal exposure to conspecifics, the more pronounced the impacts on anxiety, abnormal social behaviours, and personality traits, highlighting the significant long-term effects of early rearing conditions on their socio-emotional development.

                Background Stroke survivors, especially working-age adults, face an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one to five years after the initial occurrence, primarily due to suboptimal risk factor management. This study aims to investigate the contributing factors associated with the risk of recurrent stroke in this demographic. Methods This case-control study matched participants with recurrent stroke to those without recurrent stroke by age and gender. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to identify significant factors associated with recurrent stroke. The study included 100 patients with recurrent stroke and 200 control participants recruited from the hospital database. Results Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke were gender (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.10 to 3.29), high fasting blood sugar (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.10 to 3.29), drinking status (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 3.01 to 6.54), sedentary lifestyle (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.50 to 5.13), and lack of workplace support for health (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.13 to 3.63). The association of female gender, marital status, smoking status, sedentary lifestyle, interpersonal relationships at the workplace, and workplace support for health with recurrent stroke differed by age group. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of addressing lifestyle-related and occupational factors to reduce recurrent stroke risk among working-age adults. Tailoring age-specific stroke prevention strategies, promoting healthier lifestyles, and implementing evidence-based interventions can lead to improved stroke outcomes and enhance the quality of life for this vulnerable population.

                Abstract Backgrounds The retention of the maxillary complete denture may be influenced by adequate recording in the patient’s mouth, marking, and carving of the post-dam on the maxillary cast. Failure to do so may lead to loss of retention. Successful denture construction with patient’s comfort could be achieved by effective methods of recording, marking, and carving of the post-dam. The aim of the study was to assess Iraqi dentists in their knowledge and application of the post-dam in maxillary complete dentures. Methods Questionnaires were distributed randomly through online Google Forms and 118 Iraqi dentists with different academic degree participated in the study. A multinomial logistic regression model was also used to assess the nominal outcome variables. Results A High percentage of 90.7% of Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge about the vibrating lines and their location and 84.7% stated that they mark the post-dam on the master cast, while 15.3% stated that the dental technician marks it. More the half (52.5%) of the participants carved the post-dam, while 47.5% of the participants stated that the dental technician did it. For participants not marking the post-dam, 30.5% of the participants stated they depend on the dental technician in marking and/or carve the post-dam, while the fear of denture failure and loss of retention was observed in 25.4% of the participants, followed by 24.6% of participants forgetting to carve, 10.2% of participants had no information about carving, and 9.3% participants found it was difficult to carve. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study, most Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge on the location of vibrating lines. However, recording and carving the post-dam was influenced by the dentist’s personal preference and their dependency on the dental technician.

<p>This study provides insights into changes in the glymphatic system using the diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) method and choroid plexus volume (CPV) in Japanese older adults with poor sleep quality. Our findings revealed a decrease in the DTI-ALPS index and a significant association between the DTI-ALPS index and CPV among older adults with PSQ.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study included 52 Japanese older adults with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores &gt; 5 and 52 healthy controls (HCs) with PSQI score ≤ 5. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and 3D T1-weighted imaging were acquired using 3T magnetic resonance imaging. The diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index was calculated using preprocessed DWI. The choroid plexus volume (CPV) was calculated using FreeSurfer 6.0. The mean ALPS index and CPV were compared between the older adults with poor sleep quality (PSQ) and HCs using a general linear model, adjusted for covariates including age, sex, years of education, total intracranial volume, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and white matter lesion volume. We also conducted a partial correlation analysis between the mean ALPS index and CPV, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and PSQI scores, adjusting for all the mentioned covariates. The PSQ group had a significantly lower mean ALPS index than HCs. The mean ALPS index in the PSQ group was negatively correlated with CPV and positively correlated with the MoCA score. Therefore, older adults with PSQ may experience dysfunction in the excretory pathway of the perivascular space around the medullary veins. This impairment may be associated with an increase in CPV and cognitive dysfunction.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The interaction between major depressive disorder (MDD) and overweight/obesity has received considerable attention owing to its widespread occurrence and the intricate biopsychological implications involved. Despite extensive research, the neural mechanisms underlying these comorbid conditions, particularly in terms of functional network connectivity (FNC), are still not well understood. This study aimed to clarify these mechanisms by utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to examine both static and dynamic FNC. We analyzed data from 57 patients with both MDD and overweight/obesity (MDD-OW), 57 MDD patients of normal weight (MDD-NW), and 44 healthy controls, using techniques such as independent component analysis, sliding window analysis, K-means clustering, and graph theory. In contrast to static FNC, which showed no significant differences, dynamic FNC analysis identified four consistent states across all participants. Both MDD groups demonstrated reduced flexibility in functional coordination among these states and decreased nodal characteristics within the salience network. Notably, the MDD-OW group displayed enhanced dynamic FNC between the default mode network (DMN) and the executive control network (ECN) during certain states, which was inversely associated with the severity of depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of altered dynamic connectivity patterns in individuals with MDD and concurrent overweight/obesity, especially between the DMN and ECN, suggesting their potential utility as biomarkers for depressive states. This research contributes to our understanding of how comorbid overweight/obesity affects brain network dynamics in depressive disorders and provides a basis for targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10738584241293366?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R">Oxytocin in Human Social Network Cooperation</a></h4>

              
                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Human society is organized in structured social networks upon which large-scale cooperation among genetically unrelated individuals is favored and persists. Such large-scale cooperation is crucial for the success of the human species but also one of the most puzzling challenges. Recent work in social and behavioral neuroscience has linked human cooperation to oxytocin, an evolutionarily ancient and structurally preserved hypothalamic neuropeptide. This review aims to elucidate how oxytocin promotes nonkin cooperation in social networks by reviewing its effects at three distinct levels: individual cooperation, the formation of interpersonal relationships, and the establishment of heterogeneous network structures. We propose oxytocin as a proximate mechanism for fostering large-scale cooperation in human societies. Specifically, oxytocin plays an important role in facilitating network-wide cooperation in human societies by 1) increasing individual cooperation, mitigating noncooperation motives, and facilitating the enforcement of cooperative norms; 2) fostering interpersonal bonding and synchronization; and 3) facilitating the formation of heterogeneous network structures.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Over 90% of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In this system, the ubiquitin protein can bind to a substrate on its own or it can form a chain with multiple ubiquitin molecules in a process called polyubiquitination. There are 8 different sites on ubiquitin at which polyubiquitin chains can be formed, the second most abundant of which, lysine-63 (K63), is independent of the degradation process, though this mark has rarely been studied in the brain or during learning-dependent synaptic plasticity. Recently, we found that knockdown of K63 polyubiquitination in the amygdala selectively impaired contextual fear memory formation in female, but not male, rats. It is unknown, however, whether the sex-specific requirement of K63 polyubiquitination occurs in other brain regions that are required for contextual fear memory formation, including the hippocampus. Here, we found that CRISPR-dCas13-mediated knockdown of K63 polyubiquitination in the hippocampus significantly enhanced contextual fear memory in both male and female rats, a result that is in striking contrast to what we observed in the amygdala for both sex-specificity and directionality. Using unbiased proteomics, we found that following fear conditioning K63 polyubiquitination was primarily decreased at target proteins in the hippocampus of both males and females. Importantly, the target proteins and downstream functional pathways influenced by K63 polyubiquitination changes diverged significantly by sex. Together, these data suggest that unlike what we previously reported in the amygdala, decreases in K63 polyubiquitination in the hippocampus are a critical regulator of memory formation in the hippocampus of both males and females.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83288">Determining the effects of paternal obesity on sperm chromatin at histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation in relation to the placental transcriptome and cellular composition</a></h4>

              
                Paternal obesity has been implicated in adult-onset metabolic disease in offspring. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these paternal effects and the developmental processes involved remain poorly understood. One underexplored possibility is the role of paternally-induced effects on placenta development and function. To address this, we investigated paternal high-fat diet-induced obesity in relation to sperm histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation signatures, the placenta transcriptome and cellular composition. C57BL6/J male mice were fed either a control or high-fat diet for 10 weeks beginning at 6 weeks of age. Males were timed-mated with control-fed C57BL6/J females to generate pregnancies, followed by collection of sperm, and placentas at embryonic day (E)14.5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation targeting histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed on sperm to define obesity-associated changes in enrichment. Paternal obesity corresponded with altered sperm H3K4me3 at promoters of genes involved in metabolism and development. Notably, sperm altered H3K4me3 was also localized at placental enhancers. Bulk RNA-sequencing on placentas revealed paternal obesity-associated sex-specific changes in expression of genes involved in hypoxic processes such as angiogenesis, nutrient transport, and imprinted genes, with a subset of deregulated genes showing changes in H3K4me3 in sperm at corresponding promoters. Paternal obesity was also linked to impaired placenta development; specifically, a deconvolution analysis revealed altered trophoblast cell lineage specification. These findings implicate paternal obesity-effects on placenta development and function as one potential developmental route to offspring metabolic disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101483">The membrane domains of mammalian adenylyl cyclases are lipid receptors</a></h4>

              
                The biosynthesis of cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases (mACs) is predominantly regulated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Up to now the two hexahelical transmembrane domains of mACs were considered to fix the enzyme to membranes. Here, we show that the transmembrane domains serve in addition as signal receptors and transmitters of lipid signals that control Gsα-stimulated mAC activities. We identify aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide as receptor ligands of mAC isoforms 1–7 and 9. The ligands enhance (mAC isoforms 2, 3, 7, and 9) or attenuate (isoforms 1, 4, 5, and 6) Gsα-stimulated mAC activities in vitro and in vivo. Substitution of the stimulatory membrane receptor of mAC3 by the inhibitory receptor of mAC5 results in a ligand inhibited mAC5–mAC3 chimera. Thus, we discovered a new class of membrane receptors in which two signaling modalities are at a crossing, direct tonic lipid and indirect phasic GPCR–Gsα signaling regulating the biosynthesis of cAMP.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) may lead to disabling incontrollable movements known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been applied as non-invasive therapy to ameliorate motor symptoms and dyskinesias in PD treatment. Recent studies have shown that TMS-induced motor effects might be related to dopaminergic system modulation. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of TMS are not fully understood. Objectives: To assess the expression of FosB and c-Fos in dopamine-D1 receptor-containing cells of dyskinetic rats and to analyze the effect of TMS on dyskinetic behavior and its histological marker (FosB). Methods: We investigated the outcome of TMS on cellular activation, using c-Fos immunoreactivity, on D1 receptor-positive (D1R+) cells into the motor cortex and striatum of dyskinetic (n = 14) and intact rats (n = 14). Additionally, we evaluated the effect of TMS on the dyskinesia global score and its molecular marker, FosB, in the striatum (n = 67). Results: TMS reduces c-Fos expression in D1R+cells into the motor cortex and striatum. Moreover, TMS treatment attenuated dyskinesias, along with a low stratal FosB expression. Conclusions: The current study shows that TMS depressed FosB and c-Fos expression in D1R+ cells of the dorsal striatum and motor cortex, in accordance with previous evidence of its capacity to modulate the dopaminergic system, thus suggesting a mechanism by which TMS may mitigate dyskinesias. Additionally, our observations highlight the potential therapeutic effect of TMS on dyskinesias in a PD model.</p>

	<p>Tinnitus is correlated with anomalies of neural plasticity and has been found to be affected by inflammatory status. The current theories on tinnitus, although still somewhat incomplete, are based on maladaptive plasticity mechanisms. Astrocytes play a major role in both neural responses to inflammation and plasticity regulation; moreover, they have recently been discovered to encode &amp;amp;ldquo;context&amp;amp;rdquo; for neuronal circuits, which is similar to the &amp;amp;ldquo;expectation&amp;amp;rdquo; of Bayesian brain models. Therefore, this narrative review explores the possible and likely roles of astrocytes in the neural mechanisms leading to acute and chronic tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased mental health issues, particularly among long-COVID patients, who experience persistent symptoms post-recovery, potentially leading to chronic conditions. The psychological impact of long-COVID is still largely unknown, but it may contribute to mental disorders like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Given the global rise in anxiety and depression, exploring therapies like Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) for long-COVID traumatic disorders is crucial. This study explores the effectiveness of remote EMDR therapy for PTSD-like symptoms in long-COVID conditions (LCC), assessing their emergence, the impact of LCC on mental health, and identifying key commonalities. It also examines the potential advantages of an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform for EMDR treatments for both therapists and patients, evaluating the response differences between remote and in-person treatment. Methods: We enrolled a total of 160 participants divided into two groups of 80, with the experimental group receiving EMDR treatment for PTSD-like symptoms via a remote AI-powered platform, and the control group receiving traditional in-person therapy. We compared the ANOVA for Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUDs) scores, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) scores, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores between our two groups for three cases: pre-treatment, post-treatment, and decrement. Results: Statistical significance analysis showed a consistent absence of significant differences between online AI-powered platforms and traditional in-presence sessions. This effectively confirms our hypothesis and highlights that no significant differences were observed between the two groups. Conclusions: The AI-supported remote platform demonstrates comparable efficacy in delivering EMDR therapy, confirming its potential as an effective alternative to traditional in-person methods while providing added advantages in accessibility and adaptability (e.g., remote areas, hikikomori, natural disasters).</p>

	<p>Background: Emotions significantly influence decision-making, social interactions, and medical outcomes. Leveraging emotion recognition through Electroencephalography (EEG) signals offers potential advancements in personalized medicine, adaptive technologies, and mental health diagnostics. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of three neural network architectures&amp;amp;mdash;ShallowFBCSPNet, Deep4Net, and EEGNetv4&amp;amp;mdash;for emotion classification using the SEED-V dataset. Methods: The SEED-V dataset comprises EEG recordings from 16 individuals exposed to 15 emotion-eliciting video clips per session, targeting happiness, sadness, disgust, neutrality, and fear. EEG data were preprocessed with a bandpass filter, segmented by emotional episodes, and split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Three neural networks were trained and evaluated to classify emotions from the EEG signals. Results: ShallowFBCSPNet achieved the highest accuracy at 39.13%, followed by Deep4Net (38.26%) and EEGNetv4 (25.22%). However, significant misclassification issues were observed, such as EEGNetv4 predicting all instances as &amp;amp;ldquo;Disgust&amp;amp;rdquo; or &amp;amp;ldquo;Neutral&amp;amp;rdquo; depending on the configuration. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, such as ResNet18 combined with differential entropy, which achieved 95.61% accuracy on the same dataset, the tested models demonstrated substantial limitations. Conclusions: Our results highlight the challenges of generalizing across emotional states using raw EEG signals, emphasizing the need for advanced preprocessing and feature-extraction techniques. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into the potential and constraints of neural networks for EEG-based emotion recognition, paving the way for future advancements in the field.</p>

	<p>Background: Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is often difficult for skull base surgeons to address. FD arises due to the abnormal proliferation of fibroblasts, ultimately resulting in immature osseous tissue replacing normal cancellous bone. When the skull base is involved, it can result in cranial nerve compression. FD affecting the optic canal and optic nerve is the most concerning as new onset of vision loss is considered a surgical emergency. The prevalence of FD is approximately 3.6 per 1,000,000. The most severe implications of this disease are neurological deficits due to cranial nerve compression, cosmetic appearance, and high recurrence rates even in the setting of surgical and medical therapy interventions. Methods: A PubMed search of &amp;amp;ldquo;pediatric fibrous dysplasia management&amp;amp;rdquo; using MESH Terms was conducted. Articles were excluded for non-English languages, inaccessibility, and events/erratum/letters to the editor. Included articles were in English, as well as encompassed pediatric FD case reports or comprehensive reviews of FD that discussed pediatric presentations. Results: A total of 109 articles were reviewed, and 44 were included in the final review. Most articles were case reports. There is a clear need for guidelines regarding surgical intervention, especially in the pediatric population, where hormonal fluctuation can influence rates of recurrence and bony deformity. Overall, most surgeons recommend close observation with biomarkers and radiographic imaging for asymptomatic patients until at least the age of 16 years old. Conservative methods, such as RANK-L inhibitors, can be utilized to decrease growth with some success, especially in older adolescents. Conclusion: This review is an update on this disease and its presentations, imaging findings, and treatment options. The current literature lacks clear guidance on management, especially in regard to surgical intervention or recurrence monitoring algorithms.</p>

	<p>This perspective paper explores the untapped potential of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning-based dimension reduction techniques in multimodal neuroimaging analysis of Long COVID fatigue. The complexity and high dimensionality of neuroimaging data from modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pose significant analytical challenges. Deep neural networks and other machine learning approaches offer powerful tools for managing this complexity and extracting meaningful patterns. The paper discusses current challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, reviews state-of-the-art AI approaches for dimension reduction and multimodal integration, and examines their potential applications in Long COVID research. Key areas of focus include the development of AI-based biomarkers, AI-informed treatment strategies, and personalized medicine approaches. The authors argue that AI-driven multimodal neuroimaging analysis represents a paradigm shift in studying complex brain disorders like Long COVID. While acknowledging technical and ethical challenges, the paper emphasizes the potential of these advanced techniques to uncover new insights into the condition, which might lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for those affected by Long COVID fatigue. The broader implications for understanding and treating other complex neurological and psychiatric conditions are also discussed.</p>

	<p>Acoustic noise is known to perturb reading for good readers, including children and adults. This external acoustic noise interfering at the multimodal areas in the brain causes difficulties reducing reading and writing performances. Moreover, it is known that people with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and dyslexia have reading deficits even in the absence of acoustic noise. The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of additional acoustic noise on an adult with DCD and dyslexia. Indeed, as vision is the main source of information for the brain during reading, a noisy internal visual crowding has been observed in many cases of readers with dyslexia, as additional mirror or duplicated images of words are perceived by these observers, simultaneously with the primary images. Here, we show that when the noisy internal visual crowding and an increasing external acoustic noise are superimposed, a reading disruptive threshold at about 50 to 60 dBa of noise is reached, depending on the type of acoustic noise for a young adult with DCD and dyslexia but not for a control. More interestingly, we report that this disruptive noise threshold can be controlled by Hebbian mechanisms linked to a pulse-modulated lighting that erases the confusing internal crowding images. An improvement of 12 dBa in the disruptive threshold is then observed with two types of acoustic noises, showing the potential utility of Hebbian optocontrol in managing reading difficulties in adults with DCD and dyslexia.</p>

                Objectives Good oral hygiene measures are important for successful orthodontic treatment. They involve various types of mouthwashes which have been reported to cause alteration of mechanical properties of archwires. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a new kind of chlorine-dioxide-containing mouthwash on the mechanical properties and surface morphology of stainless steel orthodontic archwires against the already prevalent chlorhexidine mouthwash in the market. Method Group A – Chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% (study), Group B – Chlorine Dioxide mouthwash (study), and Group C – Artificial Saliva (control). 42 specimens of 5 cm long 19x25 inch SS archwires were immersed in each group equally. Post immersion, the frictional force was analyzed in the universal testing machine for each group using custom-made acrylic jigs for 10 specimens. The remaining 4 specimens from each group were sent for surface morphology evaluation using an atomic force microscope. Results Friction resistance evaluation for the archwires revealed a mean friction of 0.011 ± 0.0056 in Group A, 0.015 ± 0.0052 in Group B, and 0.010 ± 0.0067 in Group C. Results suggested that the static friction of Group C (control group) was found to be the least when compared with the experimental groups, although not producing statistically significant values. Surface roughness of archwires compared at a 10μm range revealed a mean roughness of 19.38 ± 0.82 in Group A, 25.39 ± 7.01 in Group B, and 16.65 ± 3.07 in Group C which shows there wasn’t any statistically significant difference in the mean roughness midst the three sets. Conclusion Chlorine dioxide and Chlorhexidine mouthwashes caused an increase in the frictional resistance of the archwires when compared to the control group. This increase was statistically insignificant. When measured at a range of 10μm the mean surface roughness did not statistically differ across the control and the experimental groups.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The 2017 McDonald criteria continued the separation of diagnostic criteria for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) for historical, rather than biological, reasons. We aimed to explore the feasibility of a single, unified set of diagnostic criteria when applied to patients with suspected PPMS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively identified patients evaluated for suspected PPMS at 5 European centers. The 2017 McDonald PPMS criteria was the gold standard against which the 2017 McDonald RRMS dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time criteria were evaluated. We also investigated modified RRMS DIS criteria, including: (i) optic nerve lesions; (ii) ≥2 spinal cord lesions; and (iii) higher fulfilment of DIS criteria alone (lesions in ≥3 regions) without dissemination in time/positive cerebrospinal fluid, for a diagnosis of PPMS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 282 patients were diagnosed with PPMS using the 2017 McDonald criteria, and 40 with alternate disorders. The 2017 McDonald RRMS DIS criteria and the modified DIS criteria including the optic nerve or ≥2 spinal cord lesions performed well in PPMS diagnosis when combined with dissemination in time/positive cerebrospinal fluid (sensitivity 92.9–95.4%, specificity 95%, accuracy 93.2–95.3%). A diagnosis of PPMS based on high fulfillment of modified RRMS DIS criteria had high specificity, but low sensitivity. A diagnostic algorithm applicable to patients evaluated for suspected MS is proposed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The 2017 McDonald RRMS criteria and modifications to DIS criteria, currently under consideration, performed well in PPMS diagnosis. Forthcoming revisions to the McDonald criteria should consider a single, unified set of diagnostic criteria for MS. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intravascular lymphoma is a rare subtype of B-cell lymphoma characterized by a clonal proliferation restricted to the lumen of small vessels. Over 50% of patients exhibit central nervous system (CNS) involvement, but diagnosis is often delayed due to the lack of distinctive features. We aimed to identify key phenotypic features for early diagnosis of intravascular lymphoma with CNS involvement through an in-depth cohort study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We built up a multicenter retrospective cohort of 17 patients recruited in collaboration with the French Expert Network for Oculo-Cerebral Lymphomas (LOC network), and retrospectively analyzed data from medical records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this cohort, 15 of 17 (88%) patients developed focal neurological episodes, often fluctuating and/or recurrent, with a sudden onset in 68% of episodes, suggesting a vascular origin. Rapid cognitive deterioration occurred in 15 of 17 (88%) patients, psychiatric manifestations in 8 of 17 (47%), and “B signs” in 14 of 17 (82%). Brain MRI showed polymorphic FLAIR hyperintensities in 14 of 16 (87%) patients, and DWI-positive lesions in 13 of 16 (81%) of patients, which accumulated over time and had unusual characteristics for ischemic lesions (progressive growth, persistent DWI-hyperintensity over 1 month, surrounded by a wider FLAIR hyperintensity). Early-onset inflammatory syndrome, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were observed in over 90% of cases. Mild and inconsistent meningitis contrasted with a nearly-constant hyperproteinorachia. An increased interleukin 10/6 ratio over 0,7 was found in 4 of 7 (57%) patients, and skin biopsy led to a pathological diagnosis in 3 of 6 (50%) patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results of this study highlight “red flags” that could help accelerate the diagnosis of intravascular lymphoma involving the CNS. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>
