                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Our everyday experiences share many overlapping features, as we often engage in repeated activities and routines. This leads to interference across our experiences, making it difficult to remember specific, unique events. Hippocampal pattern separation enables the discrimination of highly similar experiences to be stored orthogonally, especially in the face of interference. Mnemonic discrimination tasks have been designed to tax hippocampal pattern separation by including perceptually similar “lure” stimuli during memory retrieval. However, we experience vast interference beyond a single instance of overlap. Thus, a key feature of our memory system is to overcome this high interference. Furthermore, some experiences tend to be better remembered by most people than others, a feature known as memorability. However, it is unclear how memorability may impact the effect of interference on memory. To this end, we designed a mnemonic discrimination task with multiple forms of interference, such that target (repeated) and lure (similar) images of a baseline image were shown to participants during a memory test designed to increase interference during memory retrieval. We additionally varied image memorability by including memorable and forgettable images to examine interactions with interference conditions. We found that greater interference during retrieval enhanced lure discrimination for memorable images, but impaired lure discrimination for forgettable images. This suggests that interference does not uniformly impact memory, with greater interference in memory leading to exaggerated memorable and forgettable experiences.</p>

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                Background Previous research has shown that popular names have become less popular over time. Simultaneously, accumulated evidence has indicated that names have become more diverse. However, the association between these two phenomena was unclear. This association should be revealed for a better understanding of names and naming practices. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the popularity and diversity of names. Methods I analyzed the data provided in a previous study in the U.K., which included complete records of all live births between 1996 and 2016 (N = 12,985,140). Results I found that the correlations between diversity and popularity indicators were highly negative, showing that they are conceptually strongly related. This means that when diversity is high, popularity is low. Conclusions Based on this study, we can predict one indicator from the other indicator. Because raw data on names are generally difficult to collect, this prediction is useful for understanding names and naming practices.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1127/v2?src=rss">Parents’ roles in young learners’ motivation and task engagement in Indonesian primary schools: Questionnaire development and validation [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Parental involvement in a child’s second language learning is important because it affects the process and outcomes. Limited research has been conducted in the Indonesian context on what roles parents play in their children’s motivation and task engagement. Therefore, the study aims to develop, pilot, and validate a questionnaire on the roles of parents in motivating and engaging young learners with English tasks assigned by teachers. Methods This study was quantitative in nature. Participants were 270 parents of fifth graders learning English at nine public and private schools in Padang. The instrument was developed by analysing the literature and existing tools and creating new items. After getting expert feedback and piloting the survey, we assessed its validity and reliability. Research questions examined factors affecting its effectiveness. Results The questionnaire was analysed through EFA and CFA via Jamovi. EFA identified five dimensions: (1) parental involvement, (2) expectations, (3) access to resources, (4) enrichment and (5) extracurricular activities. The CFA fit indices (CFI = .945, TLI = .934, SRMR = .045, RMSEA = .059) confirmed the model’s suitability. The questionnaire showed strong validity and reliability, with measures exceeding.70, making it effective for gathering data on parental roles in Indonesian children’s learning of English. Conclusions This validation study offers an effective diagnostic tool for teachers, administrators, and policymakers to pinpoint the particular dimensions of parental involvement that affect children’s motivation and task engagement as they learn English. The findings highlight the critical roles of recognising parents as active collaborators along the language learning journey. The study adds to the theoretical understanding of the impact of parental behaviour in educational psychology and motivation studies. The findings are consistent with self-determination theory, providing a more nuanced perspective to explore how different forms of parental participation influence student motivation and task engagement in learning English.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1440/v1?src=rss">Mapping Psychosocial Determinants of Loss to Follow-Up Among Drug-resistant Tuberculosis Patients in South Africa: A Scoping Review Protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in South Africa continues to threaten TB control, with loss to follow-up (LTFU) at both pretreatment (diagnosed but not initiated) and on-treatment stages undermining program success. Psychosocial determinants such as stigma, depression and anxiety, alcohol and substance use, and social and family support are frequently implicated, yet evidence is scattered across disciplines, uses heterogeneous definitions and tools, and is seldom synthesized for policy and implementation. Materials and Method This scoping review aims to systematically map psychosocial determinants associated with pretreatment and on-treatment LTFU among people with DR-TB in South Africa, describe how these determinants and LTFU are defined and measured, identify contextual modifiers (e.g., HIV status, sex/age, province, urban–rural setting, decentralization, regimen era), and highlight evidence gaps and practical leverage points for intervention. The review will follow established scoping-review methodology and report per PRISMA-ScR following five steps: (1) defining the research question, (2) search strategy, (3) setting inclusion criteria, (4) extracting data, (5) assessing, summarizing, presenting findings and (6) Consultation. A comprehensive peer-reviewed literature search, including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, will be conducted by two independent reviewers. The review will span over eight weeks, focusing on studies in South Africa published in English language between 2010 and 2025. Article eligibility will be determined using a two-stage screening process with disagreements resolved through consensus and consultation of a third reviewer. The results of this review will be presented as tables, including a narrative synthesis of the findings. No meta-analysis is planned. Conclusion The review will deliver a policy-ready map of psychosocial risks and promising support for DR-TB retention in South Africa, informing the design and targeting of patient-support packages and outlining priorities for future evaluation and standardization of LTFU definitions and psychosocial measures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1439/v1?src=rss">Evaluating the use of Getting It right first time GIRFT guidelines in suspected Cauda Equina Syndrome CES at a London District General Hospital DGH [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but serious condition caused by compression of the lower spinal cord. Early recognition and prompt intervention are essential to prevent irreversible neurological damage. Delays in diagnosis or treatment can lead to permanent disability and may result in significant medicolegal consequences. Aim The aim of this quality improvement project (QIP) was to identify areas for improvement in the diagnosis of CES and update local guidelines in line with the Get It Right First Time (GIRFT) recommendations. Methods and Results This retrospective study, conducted according to GIRFT guidelines, examined patients admitted to the District General Hospital Emergency Department with suspected CES. A total of 37 patients—8 males (21.6%) and 29 females (78.4%)—were assessed over a six-month period from January to June 2023. Patients without CES listed as a differential diagnosis were excluded. Data collected included documentation of neurological examinations, post-void residual scans, perianal sensation assessments, MRI request and completion times, and length of stay. Findings were presented at the Trauma and Orthopedics mortality and morbidity meeting. Overall, 89.19% of MRI scans were completed within 24 hours of request, while 10.81% exceeded this timeframe. Notably, 57% of patients did not undergo a comprehensive neurological examination on admission. Following these findings, a CES proforma was introduced to standardize the assessment process. In the subsequent cycle, documentation improved significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the intervention. Conclusion This QIP highlighted key areas requiring improvement, particularly the inconsistent completion of neurological examinations and delays in MRI access for suspected CES cases. Collaboration with the Emergency Department and radiology services led to the implementation of a CES assessment proforma, ensuring timely and consistent evaluation of patients. This structured approach supports earlier diagnosis, aligns with GIRFT standards, and enhances the quality and safety of CES management within our hospital.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20319">Deep Learning Classification of EEG Responses to Multi-Dimensional Transcranial Electrical Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major shortcoming of medical practice is the lack of an objective measure of conscious level. Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG).
  Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses.
  In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy.
  These findings establish a framework for robust consciousness measurement for clinical use. In this spirit, we documented and open-sourced our datasets and codebase in full, to be used freely by the neuroscience and AI research communities, who may replicate our results with free tools like GitHub, Kaggle, and Colab.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20481">Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.20481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10261">Representation learning in cerebellum-like structures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.10261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animals use past experiences to adapt future behavior. To enable this rapid learning, vertebrates and invertebrates have evolved analogous neural structures like the vertebrate cerebellum or insect mushroom body. A defining feature of these circuits is a large expansion layer, which re-codes sensory inputs to improve pattern separation, a prerequisite to learn non-overlapping associations between relevant sensorimotor inputs and adaptive changes in behavior. However, classical models of associative learning treat expansion layers as static, assuming that associations are learned through plasticity at the output synapses. Here, we review emerging evidence that also highlights the importance of plasticity within the expansion layer for associative learning. Because the underlying plasticity mechanisms and principles of this representation learning are only emerging, we systematically compare experimental data from two well-studied circuits for expansion coding -- the cerebellum granule layer and the mushroom body calyx. The data indicate remarkably similar interneuron circuits, dendritic morphology and plasticity mechanisms between both systems that hint at more general principles for representation learning. Moreover, the data show strong overlap with recent theoretical advances that consider interneuron circuits and dendritic computations for representation learning. However, they also hint at an interesting interaction of stimulus-induced, non-associative and reinforced, associative mechanisms of plasticity that is not well understood in current theories of representation learning. Therefore, studying expansion layer plasticity will be important to elucidate the mechanisms and full potential of representation learning for behavioral adaptation.

Abstract: The brain is very often viewed as a network, be it at small scale made of cells, mostly neurons, or at larger scale made of neuronal assemblies. Here we introduce a conjecture, in the spirit of a philosophical though experiment, which proposes that the present cannot be obtained from within such networks, and that this limitation imposes burdens on network efficiency in information processing. We aim to argue this conjecture imposes recurrent contacts from within the brain to outside in the physical world via behavior, which create a flow of time stamps. This though experiment may contribute to make the divide between the foci toward inside versus outside, for example opposing ecological psychology and many frameworks adopted in neurosciences, superfluous. This piece proposes an ambulation triggered by a thought experiment: What if I was a neuron listening to another one and talking to a third? It is a modest attempt to walk in the footsteps of classical thought experiments, like Molyneux problem, the imitation game and the anti-sequel Chinese room, key gedankenexperiments in an elevator in physics, or the cogito in philosophy.

                arXiv:2512.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most computational accounts of cognitive maps assume that stability is achieved primarily through sensory anchoring, with self-motion contributing to incremental positional updates only. However, biological spatial representations often remain coherent even when sensory cues degrade or conflict, suggesting that self-motion may play a deeper organizational role. Here, we show that self-motion can act as a structural prior that actively organizes the geometry of learned cognitive maps. We embed a path-integration-based motion prior in a predictive-coding framework, implemented using a capacity-efficient, brain-inspired recurrent mechanism combining spiking dynamics, analog modulation and adaptive thresholds. Across highly aliased, dynamically changing and naturalistic environments, this structural prior consistently stabilizes map formation, improving local topological fidelity, global positional accuracy and next-step prediction under sensory ambiguity. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the motion prior itself encodes geometrically precise trajectories under tight constraints of internal states and generalizes zero-shot to unseen environments, outperforming simpler motion-based constraints. Finally, deployment on a quadrupedal robot demonstrates that motion-derived structural priors enhance online landmark-based navigation under real-world sensory variability. Together, these results reframe self-motion as an organizing scaffold for coherent spatial representations, showing how brain-inspired principles can systematically strengthen spatial intelligence in embodied artificial agents.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20112">Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search with Dual Contrastive Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.20112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) has gained attention for automatically designing neural network architectures. Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success. This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search. Across NASBench-101 and NASBench-201, DCL-ENAS achieves the highest validation accuracy, surpassing the strongest published baselines by 0.05\% (ImageNet16-120) to 0.39\% (NASBench-101). On a real-world ECG arrhythmia classification task, DCL-ENAS improves performance by approximately 2.5 percentage points over a manually designed, non-NAS model obtained via random search, while requiring only 7.7 GPU-days.

                arXiv:2512.20245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The memory of contemporary Large Language Models is bound by a physical paradox: as they learn, they fill up. The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via "Signal Consensus" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal.

                arXiv:2512.20370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing white matter (WM) connections between adults and neonates using diffusion MRI (dMRI) can advance our understanding of typical brain development and potential biomarkers for neurological disorders. However, existing WM atlases are population-specific (adult or neonatal) and reside in separate spaces, preventing direct cross-population comparisons. A unified WM atlas spanning both neonates and adults is still lacking. In this study, we propose a neonatal/adult brain atlas (NABA), a WM tractography atlas built from dMRI data of both neonates and adults. NABA is constructed using a robust, data-driven fiber clustering pipeline, enabling group-wise WM atlasing across populations despite substantial anatomical variability. The atlas provides a standardized template for WM parcellation, allowing direct comparison of WM tracts between neonates and adults. Using NABA, we conduct four analyses: (1) evaluating the feasibility of joint WM mapping across populations, (2) characterizing WM development across neonatal ages relative to adults, (3) assessing sex-related differences in neonatal WM development, and (4) examining the effects of preterm birth. Our results show that NABA robustly identifies WM tracts in both populations. We observe rapid fractional anisotropy (FA) development in long-range association tracts, including the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus II, whereas intra-cerebellar tracts develop more slowly. Neonatal females exhibit faster overall FA development than males. Although preterm neonates show lower overall FA development rates, they demonstrate relatively higher FA growth in specific tracts, including the corticospinal tract, corona radiata-pontine pathway, and intracerebellar tracts. These findings demonstrate that NABA is a useful tool for investigating WM development across neonates and adults.

                arXiv:2512.19986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms for cardinality-constrained portfolio optimization require repair operators to map infeasible candidates onto the feasible region. Standard Euclidean projection treats assets as independent and can ignore the covariance structure that governs portfolio risk, potentially producing less diversified portfolios. This paper introduces Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection (CASP), a two-stage repair operator that (i) selects a target number of assets using volatility-normalized scores and (ii) projects the candidate weights using a covariance-aware geometry aligned with tracking-error risk. This provides a portfolio-theoretic foundation for using a covariance-induced distance in repair operators. On S&P 500 data (2020-2024), CASP-Basic delivers materially lower portfolio variance than standard Euclidean repair without relying on return estimates, with improvements that are robust across assets and statistically significant. Ablation results indicate that volatility-normalized selection drives most of the variance reduction, while the covariance-aware projection provides an additional, consistent improvement. We further show that optional return-aware extensions can improve Sharpe ratios, and out-of-sample tests confirm that gains transfer to realized performance. CASP integrates as a drop-in replacement for Euclidean projection in metaheuristic portfolio optimizers.

                arXiv:2512.20464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D image display is essential for next-generation volumetric imaging; however, dense depth multiplexing for 3D image projection remains challenging because diffraction-induced cross-talk rapidly increases as the axial image planes get closer. Here, we introduce a 3D display system comprising a digital encoder and a diffractive optical decoder, which simultaneously projects different images onto multiple target axial planes with high axial resolution. By leveraging multi-layer diffractive wavefront decoding and deep learning-based end-to-end optimization, the system achieves high-fidelity depth-resolved 3D image projection in a snapshot, enabling axial plane separations on the order of a wavelength. The digital encoder leverages a Fourier encoder network to capture multi-scale spatial and frequency-domain features from input images, integrates axial position encoding, and generates a unified phase representation that simultaneously encodes all images to be axially projected in a single snapshot through a jointly-optimized diffractive decoder. We characterized the impact of diffractive decoder depth, output diffraction efficiency, spatial light modulator resolution, and axial encoding density, revealing trade-offs that govern axial separation and 3D image projection quality. We further demonstrated the capability to display volumetric images containing 28 axial slices, as well as the ability to dynamically reconfigure the axial locations of the image planes, performed on demand. Finally, we experimentally validated the presented approach, demonstrating close agreement between the measured results and the target images. These results establish the diffractive 3D display system as a compact and scalable framework for depth-resolved snapshot 3D image projection, with potential applications in holographic displays, AR/VR interfaces, and volumetric optical computing.

Abstract: Spiking Transformers have recently emerged as promising architectures for combining the efficiency of spiking neural networks with the representational power of self-attention. However, the lack of standardized implementations, evaluation pipelines, and consistent design choices has hindered fair comparison and principled analysis. In this paper, we introduce STEP a unified benchmark framework for Spiking Transformers that supports a wide range of tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection across static, event-based, and sequential datasets. STEP provides modular support for diverse components such as spiking neurons, input encodings, surrogate gradients, and multiple backends (e.g., SpikingJelly, BrainCog). Using STEP, we reproduce and evaluate several representative models, and conduct systematic ablation studies on attention design, neuron types, encoding schemes, and temporal modeling capabilities. We also propose a unified analytical model for energy estimation, accounting for spike sparsity, bitwidth, and memory access, and show that quantized ANNs may offer comparable or better energy efficiency. Our results suggest that current Spiking Transformers rely heavily on convolutional frontends and lack strong temporal modeling, underscoring the need for spike-native architectural innovations.

                arXiv:2506.00920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition, multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

                What lies beneath is the “silent genocide” of deliberately using starvation to kill, its incidence so dire as it has become an emergency issue in contemporary international criminal law. This paper seeks to define starvation as a method of genocide, explore the various problems which arise from demonstrating the requisite criminal intent under the 1948 Genocide Convention. In many wars, hunger is used as a weapon to destroy targeted groups by depriving them of essential resources. Faced both with pivotal legal challenges which arise from the governing frameworks, from the evidentiary dilemma of establishing intent, and the liability limitations of the international courts, the study sets out key questions that we will address. The paper thus demonstrates major flaws in current mechanisms through a comparative analysis of court proceedings, from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the International Criminal Court’s involvement in crises in Darfur, Gaza, and Yemen. This research calls for immediate legal changes and better-armed judges, allowing for the identification and prosecution of starvation as a form of genocide.

                Background Fractional calculus has gained significant attention due to its applications in modeling complex systems. This paper introduces several fundamental fractional operators, including the Riemann–Liouville, Caputo, and Hadamard operators. From these, a novel α-generalized fractional operator is derived, which plays a crucial role in solving fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs). Methods The α-generalized operator is analytically constructed and its properties are rigorously proven. It is then integrated with the Daftardar–Jafari iterative method (DJM) to solve both linear and nonlinear FPDEs. The convergence of the proposed method is established using the Lipschitz condition. Two benchmark equations—the linear fractional Burger’s equation and the nonlinear fractional Heat-type equation—are used to demonstrate the method’s applicability. MATLAB is employed to implement the numerical schemes and visualize the results. Results The DJM combined with the α-generalized operator yields superior numerical results compared to the Adomian decomposition method. This superiority is evident in both accuracy and convergence, especially for the nonlinear fractional Heat-type equation. Tabulated results and graphical comparisons confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach across different values of α. Conclusions The integration of the α-generalized operator with the Daftardar–Jafari method provides a powerful tool for solving FPDEs. Its numerical advantages make it a promising alternative to existing methods. The study recommends extending this framework to other fractional operators, iterative schemes, and potential transformation techniques, with applications in quantum physics, fluid dynamics, and beyond.

                Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important regulators of cellular processes, including those implicated in autoimmune and endocrine disorders. However, their role in thyroid function, particularly hyperthyroidism, remains insufficiently defined. Growth Arrest-Specific 5 (GAS5) is a lncRNA with established functions in tumor suppression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, and may therefore influence thyroid cell regulation and hormone production. This study aimed to assess the expression of GAS5 in patients with hyperthyroidism and evaluate its potential utility as a biomarker. Thirty whole-blood samples from hyperthyroid patients and 20 samples from healthy controls were analyzed. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol, and complementary DNA (CDNA) was synthesized with oligo(dT) primers. GAS5 expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, and statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA, correlation testing, and visualization in R. GAS5 expression was significantly decreased in hyperthyroid patients compared with controls (mean 0.429 vs. 1.004, p < 0.0001), with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Approximately 77% of patient samples showed expression levels below one. Pairwise comparisons confirmed highly significant differences between groups (p = 0.0001). Spearman correlation revealed an inverse relationship between GAS5 and T3 (r = –0.454, p = 0.001) as well as T4 (r = –0.438, p = 0.001).These findings indicate that GAS5 downregulation is associated with increased thyroid hormone production, suggesting a potential regulatory role in hyperthyroidism. GAS5 expression could therefore represent a promising early biomarker for individuals at risk of thyroid dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1435/v1?src=rss">Employing Fixed-Point Theory for Fuzzy Regression Analysis: Methodology and Empirical Application [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Traditional fuzzy regression approaches, such as Tanaka’s fuzzy minimum method and fuzzy least squares, often lack theoretical guarantees of existence, uniqueness, and numerical stability. These limitations are of paramount importance in engineering applications involving uncertainty, such as predicting the compressive strength of concrete. This study addresses these issues by presenting a mathematically rigorous fuzzy regression model, based on fixed-point theory, formulated within the full metric space of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers using the metric scale d ∞ . Methodology We define a shrinkage coefficient on the trapezoidal fuzzy coefficient vector space and prove, using Banach’s fixed-point theory, the existence and uniqueness of the regression solution. An iterative algorithm is constructed to estimate the coefficients, using alpha computation and Lipschitz continuity to ensure convergence. The University of California, Irvine concrete compressive strength dataset was amplified using ASTM and ACI-based uncertainty coefficients, and the proposed fixed-point model was evaluated against the Tanaka method and least-squares fuzzy regression. Performance was assessed by mean squared error (MSE), coefficient ambiguity, convergence behavior, and toughness under ±5% noise. Results The proposed method demonstrated consistent geometric convergence with an average of 12.3 iterations and zero divergence across all experiments. It also reduced the overall mean squared error by an average of 12.5%, and by up to 25.1% at best, compared to the comparator methods. Coefficient ambiguity—measured by ambiguity width—was reduced by 18.3% compared to the Tanaka method and by 13.3% compared to ambiguity squares. Under noise perturbation, the model exhibits a significantly smaller increase in the mean error (+6.2%) compared to the Tanaka approach (+24.7%) and the LS-based approach (+18.3%), indicating a substantial improvement in robustness. Conclusions Incorporating fuzzy regression within a fixed-point theoretical framework helps resolve the stability, existence, and singularity challenges that have long plagued classical fuzzy regression models. The proposed approach offers a mathematically consistent, computationally stable, uncertainty-aware regression tool suitable for engineering applications involving imprecise measurements. Future work includes extending the model to nonlinear fuzzy structures, Gaussian/LR fuzzy representations, and broader applications in data-driven prediction under uncertainty.

                Background This cross-sectional study assessed the impact of long-term use of skin-whitening products containing corticosteroids on the function of the adrenal glands. Objectives To assess the impact of extended use of corticosteroid-based whitening creams on serum cortisol levels and to examine the prevalence of adrenal suppression among habitual users. Methods This research, executed at the Hawija Technical Institute from January to April 2025, included 57 participants aged 20 to 40. Before enrolling, all participants gave their written consent. Individuals with chronic endocrine disorders or those receiving systemic corticosteroids were excluded. They were split into two groups: 38 regular (14 male and 24 female) users of skin-whitening creams (≥3 months) as the experimental group and 19 (7 male and 12 female) non-users as the control group. The Mindray CL-900i, a fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer, was used to measure the levels of cortisol in the serum. Results In comparison to controls (7.85 ± 3.54 μg/dL; p = 0.0004), users had a significantly lower mean cortisol level (4.25 ± 2.23 μg/dL), with 42% of users exhibiting cortisol <5 μg/dL, indicating adrenal suppression. There were no discernible variations in BMI between the groups or between male and female users. These results show that extended exposure to corticosteroids suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Conclusions Using skin-whitening creams that contain corticosteroids too often can make the adrenal glands work less well. It is suggested that public health measures be used to inform users about endocrine risks and to control these products.

                Abstract* Background Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) represents the most prevalent form of thyroid malignancy worldwide, with increasing incidence rates observed across various populations. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in numerous malignancies, with its encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) playing a crucial role in modulating host gene expression, particularly microRNAs. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) has emerged as a significant oncogenic regulator in various cancers. Objectives This study was designed to investigate the involvement of EBNA1 in the regulation of miRNA-155 in PTC and to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of miR-155 in Iraqi patients. Materials and Methods A case-control study was conducted involving 100 histologically confirmed PTC patients and 100 nodular goiter controls recruited from Baghdad, Iraq, between March 2024 and August 2024. Expression levels of EBNA1 and miR-155 were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Statistical analyses included correlation assessment, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results EBNA1 positivity was higher in PTC cases (82%) compared to controls (41%) (p < 0.001), Both miR-155 and EBNA1 expression levels were significantly elevated in PTC cases, with mean values of 5.38 ± 2.50 and 24.3 ± 11.96, respectively, compared to controls (1.51 ± 1.25 and 15.9 ± 19.20, p < 0.0001). However, correlation analysis revealed a weak negative relationship between miR-155 and EBNA1 expression (r = -0.031, p = 0.758). ROC analysis demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance of miR-155 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.927, sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 87%. Conclusion EBNA1 appears to play a regulatory role in miR-155 expression in PTC, despite the absence of a direct linear correlation. MiR-155 demonstrates strong potential as a diagnostic biomarker for PTC in Iraqi patients, warranting further investigation into its therapeutic implications.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>After fear conditioning, repeated presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS) alone produces a context-dependent extinction of learned fear. The hippocampus has a critical role in this process, but the mechanism by which contextual information encoded by the hippocampus leads to fear suppression is unknown. We hypothesize that contextual information encoded by the dorsal hippocampus supports the recall of extinction memory by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the oscillatory coherence and directional coupling of the hippocampus and mPFC during context-dependent extinction retrieval in a previously published experiment. In this experiment, male and female rats were subjected to auditory fear conditioning followed by fear extinction and extinction retrieval procedures. Previous analyses focused on oscillatory coupling during the CS; here, we performed new analyses to assess hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in the context in which extinction occurred. We found that, after extinction, re-exposing the animals to the extinction context produces a marked increase in dorsal hippocampal theta (6–8 Hz) oscillations. This increase was associated with enhanced coherence between the dHPC and the prelimbic (PL), but not the infralimbic (IL), division of the mPFC. Moreover, Granger causality analyses revealed that hippocampal theta oscillations preceded theta in the PL throughout the extinction retrieval session. This effect emerged during exposure to the extinction context and persisted during the presentation of the CSs and the expression of freezing behavior. Interestingly, this pattern of coherence was not observed between the dHPC and the IL. These results suggest that oscillatory coupling between the dorsal hippocampus and PL facilitates the context-dependent retrieval of the extinguished fear memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-822/v2?src=rss">Women Entrepreneurs and Innovation Strategies: Driving Inclusive Fintech Business Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This review examines how women entrepreneurs can drive financial technology (fintech) business growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. While fintech is expanding rapidly across the region, the unique role of women-led ventures in promoting innovation and inclusive growth has been underexplored. A narrative literature review of studies from 2015 to 2025 was conducted, with qualitative findings analyzed thematically. Results show that women entrepreneurs leverage mobile technology, AI, blockchain, digital payments, and innovation hub collaborations to enhance market access, financial inclusion, and capacity building. Nonetheless, persistent challenges such as limited digital literacy, regulatory barriers, gender biases, and a lack of gender-disaggregated data constrain sustainable growth and adoption of women-led fintech ventures. These findings highlight the need for targeted policy measures to improve women’s access to finance, technology, and networks, strengthening inclusive fintech ecosystems across Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, empowering women entrepreneurs is critical for fostering equitable and sustainable fintech innovation in the region.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104375">Computer prediction and genetic analysis identifies retinoic acid modulation as a driver of conserved longevity pathways in genetically diverse Caenorhabditis nematodes</a></h4>

              
                Discovery of new compounds that ameliorate the negative health impacts of aging promises to be of tremendous benefit across a number of age-based comorbidities. One method to prioritize a testable subset of the nearly infinite universe of potential compounds is to use computational prediction of their likely anti-aging capacity. Here, we present a survey of longevity effects for 16 compounds suggested by a previously published computational prediction set, capitalizing upon the comprehensive, multi-species approach utilized by the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> Intervention Testing Program. While 11 compounds (aldosterone, arecoline, bortezomib, dasatinib, decitabine, dexamethasone, erlotinib, everolimus, gefitinib, temsirolimus, and thalidomide) either had no effect on median lifespan or were toxic, 5 compounds (all-trans retinoic acid, berberine, fisetin, propranolol, and ritonavir) extended lifespan in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. These computer predictions yield a remarkable positive hit rate of 30%. Deeper genetic characterization of the longevity effects of one of the most efficacious compounds, the endogenous signaling ligand all-trans retinoic acid (atRA, designated tretinoin in medical products), demonstrated a requirement for the regulatory kinases AKT-1 and AKT-2. While the canonical Akt-target FOXO/DAF-16 was largely dispensable, other conserved Akt-targets (Nrf2/SKN-1 and HSF1/HSF-1), as well as the conserved catalytic subunit of AMPK AAK-2, were all necessary for longevity extension by atRA. Our results highlight the potential of combining computational prediction of longevity interventions with the power of nematode functional genetics and underscore that the manipulation of a conserved metabolic regulatory circuit by co-opting endogenous signaling molecules is a powerful approach for discovering aging interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106184">Mac-/Lactosylceramide regulates intestinal homeostasis and secretory cell fate commitment by facilitating Notch signaling</a></h4>

              
                Cell-to-cell communication via Delta-Notch signaling is widely used in various tissues and organs to regulate development and patterning; however, the mechanisms regulating Notch signaling for precise cell fate decisions remain poorly understood. Similar to mammals, the intestinal stem cells in the adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut generate both absorptive and secretory cell progeny, guided by differential levels of Notch activation. Here we performed a forward genetic screen in <i>Drosophila</i> and identified glucosylceramide synthase (GlcT), a rate-limiting enzyme for glycosphingolipid (GSL) production, whose mutation causes the development of secretory cell tumors. Genetic analysis of the GSL synthesis pathway, combined with metabolite rescue experiments, revealed that the tumor formation is linked to a deficiency in Mactosylceramide/Lactosylceramide. This deficiency impaired the endocytic recycling of the Delta, subsequently reducing Notch signaling activation. Conditional knockout of <i>Ugcg</i>, the mammalian ortholog of <i>GlcT</i>, in mouse small intestine caused an excessive differentiation of goblet cells, phenotypes similar to these caused by Notch inhibition. Our study suggests an evolutionarily conserved role for a specific GSL metabolite in modulating Notch signaling during stem cell fate decisions and provides a molecular connection between ceramide metabolism and Notch signaling in regulating tissue homeostasis and tumor formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99426">Functional genomics reveals strain-specific genetic requirements conferring hypoxic growth in Mycobacterium intracellulare</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium intracellulare</i> is a major etiological agent of the recently expanding <i>Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare</i> complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD). Therapeutic regimens that include a combination of macrolides and antituberculous drugs have been implemented with limited success. To identify novel targets for drug development that accommodate the genomic diversity of <i>M. avium–intracellulare</i>, we subjected eight clinical MAC-PD isolates and the type strain ATCC13950 to genome-wide profiling to comprehensively identify universally essential functions by transposon sequencing (TnSeq). Among these strains, we identified 131 shared essential or growth-defect-associated genes by TnSeq. Unlike the type strain, the clinical strains showed increased requirements for genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the type VII secretion system under standard growth conditions, the same genes required for hypoxic pellicle-type biofilm formation in ATCC13950. Consistent with the central role of hypoxia in the evolution of <i>M. intracellulare</i>, the clinical MAC-PD strains showed more rapid adaptation to hypoxic growth than the type strain. Importantly, the increased requirements of hypoxic fitness genes were confirmed in a mouse lung infection model. These findings confirm the concordant genetic requirements under hypoxic conditions in vitro and hypoxia-related conditions in vivo and highlight the importance of using clinical strains and host-relevant growth conditions to identify high-value targets for drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102874">GPR30 in spinal cholecystokinin-positive neurons modulates neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain, a major health problem affecting 7–10% of the global population, lacks effective treatment due to its elusive mechanisms. Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal neurons was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Moreover, GPR30 was expressed in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons that received direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons and S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107021">Cryptovaranoides is not a squamate</a></h4>

              
                Accurate reconstruction of the timescale of organismal evolution requires placement of extinct representatives among living branches. In this way, the fossil record has the capacity to revise hypotheses of organismal evolution by producing representatives of clades that far pre-date the age of the clade inferred using phylogenies built from molecular data and previous fossil calibrations. Recently, one fossil with the potential to drastically change current understanding surrounding the timescale of reptile diversification was described from Triassic fissure-fill deposits in the United Kingdom. This taxon, †<i>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</i>, was originally placed deep within the squamate crown clade, suggesting that many lineages of living lizards and snakes must have appeared by the Triassic and implying long ghost lineages that paleontologists and molecular phylogeneticists have failed to detect using all other available data. Our team challenged this identification and instead suggested †<i>Cryptovaranoides</i> had unclear affinities to living reptiles, but a crown-squamate interpretation was later re-iterated by the team that originally described this species. Here, we again challenge the morphological character codings used to support a crown squamate affinity for †<i>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</i> and illustrate several empirical problems with analyses that find this taxon is a crown squamate. Our analyses emphasize the importance of stringency in constructing hypodigms of fossils, particularly when they may be key for proper time calibration of the Tree of Life.

                Trained Immunity is the nonspecific (pathogen agnostic) memory of innate immune cells, characterized by altered responses upon secondary stimulation. This review provides a RoadMap for the discovery and development of therapeutics targeting Trained Immunity, aimed at researchers with strong scientific backgrounds but limited drug development experience. The article outlines five drug development domains – epigenetic, metabolic, differentiation, inflammatory, and memory changes – that guide the identification of molecular targets, model selection, and biomarker development for the discovery and development of Trained Immunity-based therapeutics. It emphasizes the application of preclinical models and artificial intelligence in target discovery and compound screening. Additionally, the review addresses challenges in translating preclinical Trained Immunity findings to clinical trials and highlights relevant disease indications and ongoing clinical trials. This review integrates scientific findings with development strategy and thereby aims to bridge the gap between discovery and clinical application, advancing the field of Trained Immunity-based therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107018">Vascular endothelial-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling as a model for choroidal neovascularization and central nervous system vascular inflammation</a></h4>

              
                In mice, postnatal endothelial cell (EC)-specific knockout of the genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR)1 and/or TGFBR2 eliminates TGF-beta signaling in vascular ECs and leads to distinctive central nervous system (CNS) vascular phenotypes. Knockout mice exhibit (1) reduced intraretinal vascularization, (2) choroidal neovascularization with occasional anastomoses connecting choroidal and intraretinal vasculatures, (3) infiltration of diverse immune cells into the retina, including macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, (4) a close physical association between immune cells and retinal vasculature, (5) a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state in CNS ECs, with increased ICAM1 immunoreactivity, and (6) increased smooth muscle actin immunostaining in CNS pericytes. Comparisons of the retinal phenotype with two other genetic models of retinal hypovascularization – loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling and loss of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling – show that the immune cell infiltrate is greatest with loss of TGF-beta signaling, more modest with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, and undetectable with loss of VEGF signaling. The phenotypes caused by loss of TGF-beta signaling in ECs recapitulate some of the cardinal features of retinal and neurologic diseases associated with vascular inflammation. These observations suggest that therapies that promote TGF-beta-dependent anti-inflammatory responses in ECs could represent a promising strategy for disease modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108748">Are peer reviewers influenced by their work being cited?</a></h4>

              
                Peer reviewers sometimes comment that their own journal articles should be cited by the journal article under review. Comments concerning relevant articles can be justified, but comments can also be unrelated coercive citations. Here, we used a matched observational study design to explore how citations influence the peer review process. We used a sample of more than 37,000 peer reviews from four journals that use open peer review and make all article versions available. We find that reviewers who were cited in versions after version 1 were more likely to make a favourable recommendation (odds ratio = 1.61; adjusted 99.4% CI: 1.16–2.23), whereas being cited in the first version did not improve their recommendation (odds ratio = 0.84; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.69–1.03). For all versions of the articles, the reviewers who commented that their own articles should be cited were less likely to recommend approval compared to the reviewers who did not, with the strongest association after the first version (odds ratio = 0.15; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.08–0.30). Reviewers who included a citation to their own articles were much more likely to approve a revised article that cited their articles compared to a revised article that did not (odds ratio = 3.5; 95% CI: 2.0–6.1). Some reviewers’ recommendations depend on whether they are cited or want to be cited. Reviewer citation requests can turn peer review into a transaction rather than an objective critique of the article.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105782">Predictive modeling of hematoma expansion from non-contrast computed tomography in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients</a></h4>

              
                Hematoma expansion is a consistent predictor of poor neurological outcome and mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An incomplete understanding of its biophysiology has limited early preventative intervention. Transport-based morphometry (TBM) is a mathematical modeling technique that uses a physically meaningful metric to quantify and visualize discriminating image features that are not readily perceptible to the human eye. We hypothesized that TBM could discover relationships between hematoma morphology on initial Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and hematoma expansion. 170 spontaneous ICH patients enrolled in the multi-center international Virtual International Trials of Stroke Archive (VISTA-ICH) with time-series NCCT data were used for model derivation. Its performance was assessed on a test dataset of 170 patients from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study. A unique transport-based representation was produced from each presentation NCCT hematoma image to identify morphological features of expansion. The principal hematoma features identified by TBM were larger size, density heterogeneity, shape irregularity, and peripheral density distribution. These were consistent with clinician-identified features of hematoma expansion, corroborating the hypothesis that morphological characteristics of the hematoma promote future growth. Incorporating these traits into a multivariable model comprising morphological, spatial, and clinical information achieved an AUROC of 0.71 for quantifying 24 hr hematoma expansion risk in the test dataset. This outperformed existing clinician protocols and alternate machine learning methods, suggesting that TBM detected features with improved precision than by visual inspection alone. This pre-clinical study presents a quantitative and interpretable method for discovery and visualization of NCCT biomarkers of hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Because TBM has a direct physical meaning, its modeling of NCCT hematoma features can inform hypotheses for hematoma expansion mechanisms. It has potential future application as a clinical risk stratification tool.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100396">A single-cell atlas of the testicular interstitium defines Leydig progenitor networks sustaining Leydig cell homeostasis across the lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Declining rates of male fertility pose a significant clinical challenge, while the mechanisms underlying testicular interstitial function remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of the murine testicular interstitium across the postnatal lifespan. The investigation unveiled a previously unrecognized population of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells nestled within the interstitium, hinting at their potential as Leydig cell progenitors. With the aging process of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells, we observed a decline in glutathione levels within the testicular interstitium. Remarkably, these Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells exhibited clonogenic self-renewal capacity and a robust propensity to differentiate into Leydig cells. Intriguingly, when transplanted into Leydig cell-disrupted or failure models, Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> cells efficiently colonized the testicular interstitium, resulting in a notable increase in testosterone production. Exploring the epigenetic landscape, we identified critical transcription factors, most notably Sox4, governing the stem cell fate of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells. Overall, this comprehensive lifespan-resolved single-cell atlas of testicular interstitial cells provides fundamental insights into Leydig cell progenitor biology and regenerative capacity during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103324">DendroTweaks, an interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on the interplay between two critical components, dendritic morphology and ion channels, to transform synaptic inputs into a sequence of somatic spikes. Detailed biophysical models with active dendrites have been instrumental in exploring this interaction. However, such models can be challenging to understand and validate due to the large number of parameters involved. In this work, we introduce <i>DendroTweaks</i>, a toolbox designed to make detailed biophysical models with active dendrites more intuitive and more interactive. <i>DendroTweaks</i> features a web-based graphical interface, where users can explore single-cell neuronal models and adjust their morphological and biophysical parameters with real-time visual feedback. In particular, <i>DendroTweaks</i> focuses on subcellular properties, such as kinetics and distribution of ion channels, as well as the dynamics and placement of synaptic inputs. The toolbox supports various experimental protocols designed to illuminate how morpho-electric properties map to dendritic events and how these dendritic events shape neuronal output, thereby enhancing model validation. It helps users build high-level, modular model representations and includes a rich set of tools for parsing, generating, and standardizing commonly used neuronal data formats. Finally, it enables model simplification through a built-in morphology reduction algorithm, allowing users to export models for further use in faster, more interpretable networks. By combining extensive visualization capabilities and comprehensive data management functionality, <i>DendroTweaks</i> introduces a novel interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics. This approach will accelerate research on dendritic computations, their underlying mechanisms, and their fundamental role in brain function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106415">Regional heterogeneities of oligodendrocytes underlie biased Ranvier node spacing along single axons in sound localization circuit</a></h4>

              
                Spacing of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. Using this model, we investigated the potential factors underlying the biased nodal spacing pattern. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function.

">Retinotopy constrains the topology of neural manifolds in macaque visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical population activity often evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, shaped by external activity, task-demands and the underlying neuronal network structure. The structure of population activity has been studied across many brain areas and species. However, the influence of retinotopic organization in the structure of population activity of the primate visual cortex in vivo remains understudied. Here, we show that retinotopy in primary visual cortex (V1) determines the topological structure in neural population activity in the macaque. We analysed large-scale extracellular recordings from two macaques implanted with 896-channel Utah arrays in V1 performing a receptive field mapping task, with high-contrast moving bars. Isometric Mapping (isomap) applied to the neural population activity revealed a loop-like manifold. Persistent homology on 10-dimensional embeddings confirmed a single dominant one-dimensional loop. To test whether retinotopy alone can account for this structure, we constructed a minimal neural response model and simulated activity with the same stimuli as the macaque neural data. The model reproduced the loop-like topology observed in the brain. Taken together, the experimental and simulated data show that retinotopic maps naturally induce loop-like neural manifolds in response to moving stimuli, directly linking travelling waves and rotational dynamics. Our results provide a basis for further analysis on how neuronal populations encode and process visual information at the population level.

">Attention Decoding at the Cocktail Party: Preserved in Hearing Aid Users, Reduced in Cochlear Implant Users</a></h4>

              
                Users of hearing aids (HAs) and cochlear implants (CIs) experience significant difficulty understanding a target speaker in multi-talker environments or when other background noise is present. Segregation of a particular voice from background noise occurs partly through enhanced cortical tracking of amplitude fluctuations in the target signal. Measuring a person's cortical tracking allows decoding their focus of attention and may be used for neurofeedback in hearing devices, potentially aiding their users with speech-in-noise comprehension. Most studies on cortical tracking have employed typical hearing (TH) individuals, whereas studies in people with hearing impairment whose cortical tracking may differ are still scarce. The objective of this study was to compare cortical speech tracking of HA (n=29) and CI users (n=24) to that of age-matched TH individuals (n=29). We recorded EEG data while the participants attended one of two competing talkers (one with a female and one with a male voice), in a free-field acoustic environment. Importantly, HA users as well as CI users used their personal, clinically-fitted devices. Cortical speech tracking was assessed through linear backward and forward models that related the EEG data to the speech envelope. For the CI users, electrical artifacts stemming from the implant were addressed through a bespoke method for artifact rejection. We found that the HA group exhibited cortical tracking and attentional modulation that were largely comparable to those of the TH group. CI users also showed successful cortical tracking. However, they displayed a profound deficit in attentional modulation, seen in the significantly poorer neural segregation of the attended vs. the ignored speech streams. These results shed light on a neurobiological mechanism for speech-in-noise comprehension and have implications for neurofeedback in hearing devices.

                Labile zinc ions (Zn(II)) are stored in glutamatergic vesicles at specific excitatory synapses in the central nervous system and released into synaptic clefts in an activity-dependent manner. Although Zn(II) is suggested to modulate various neuroreceptor functions, its precise roles remain unclear due to a lack of tools capable of quantitatively analyzing Zn(II) with synapse-level spatial resolution. Here, we developed neuroreceptor-based semisynthetic sensors that record synaptic Zn(II) dynamics by covalent chemistry in the living mouse brain. Using a chemical knock-in strategy, we introduced activity-based Zn(II)-probes with distinct affinities into endogenous alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid or gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. These in-brain-constructed Zn(II) sensors enabled, to our knowledge, for the first time, quantitative, region-specific mapping of Zn(II) released into synaptic clefts. Imaging-based analyses revealed differences inZn(II) concentrations at excitatory and inhibitory synapses across hippocampal regions during kainate-induced seizures, providing new insights into the physiological and pathological functions of synaptic Zn(II).

">Attention biases the appearance of rapidly alternating stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Attentional selection not only increases behavioural performance and neural information for attended stimuli but, in some instances, induces changes in stimulus appearance. While reported appearance changes have mostly concerned the effects of attending to a particular spatial location, here we report a shift in appearance that occurs when attention is directed to one component of a rapidly alternating stimulus. Our stimuli included two frames of different colours, which alternated at 3.75Hz or 7.5Hz. Participants reported the perceived dominance of one frame's colour in the target stimulus, by comparison with a reference stimulus. We found that when one stimulus frame was more salient than the other, capturing exogenous attention, there was an illusory perception that the frame was physically present for a greater proportion of time. When the frames were matched in salience, endogenously directing attention to one frame produced a smaller shift in appearance. Our results add to the body of literature demonstrating that attention can change appearance, in this case altering the appearance of attended versus unattended stimuli that are presented at the same spatial location. Furthermore, our results support the notion that in 'temporal transparency', where rapidly alternating stimuli are perceived as two translucent surfaces, attentional selection of one surface can account for the apparent paradox that feature conjunctions are perceived at stimulus alternation rates higher than predicted by the temporal limits of feature binding for other stimuli.

">Dopaminergic Neurons in the Brain Orchestrates Cardiac and Behavioral Threat Responses</a></h4>

              
                Heartbeat and behavior are often modulated in a tightly coupled fashion, which is believed advantageous for survival. For instance, when threatened animals show freezing or escaping, the brain drives cardiac deceleration or acceleration, respectively. In turn, the heart sends ascending feedback to the brain, but whether and how the descending regulation of and the ascending feedback from the heart might drive the heart-behavior coupling remains unknown. Here we show in Drosophila that mechanical threat induces not only locomotion but cardiac deceleration. We further identified two pairs of dopaminergic neurons in the brain, called DA-WED neurons, that are responsible for threat-induced cardiac deceleration. Silencing DA-WED neurons suppresses threat-induced cardiac deceleration, while activation of DA-WED neurons can replace threat to induce cardiac deceleration. Our calcium imaging analysis shows that threat activates DA-WED neurons. Interestingly, silencing DA-WED neurons to block threat-induced cardiac deceleration reduces locomotion. Conversely, direct manipulation of cardiomyocytes to artificially induce cardiac deceleration promotes locomotion. Together, our data reveals a neuronal mechanism in which mechanical threat regulates the heartbeat through dopaminergic neurons in the brain, and suggests how these neurons possibly prompt feedback from the heart to modulate behavior.

">Systematic microcircuit reconfigurations underlie early experience-induced visual cortical plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Experience-dependent reorganization of neuronal connections during a postnatal critical period (CP) is essential for the functional maturation of developing primary visual cortex (V1). However, the systematic reconfigurations across microcircuit synapses underlying this plasticity were poorly defined. Paired recording from excitatory pyramidal cells and other three major interneurons (INs) within layers 2/3 and 4 microcircuits in the developing mouse V1 monocular region, we find that monocular deprivation (MD) for one-day during the CP transiently reconfigures local excitatory synapses on inhibitory INs that specifically express parvalbumin (PV) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), whereas prolonged MD primarily strengthens inhibitory transmission from somatostatin (SST)-expressing INs to PV-INs and VIP-INs in both layers. A physiologically based microcircuit model suggests these coordinated synaptic changes in specific inhibitory neurons mediate differential MD-induced plasticity in visual responses across layer 2/3 neurons in vivo. Together, our findings define a systematic microcircuit basis for cortical critical-period plasticity.

">Restoration of Higher-Order Cortical Processing in Rat V2 by Retinal Sheet Transplants in Degenerated Rats</a></h4>

              
                Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of central vision loss, and effective treatment options are limited once photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are lost. In advanced stages, vision restoration requires strategies that replace or bypass degenerated retinal circuitry. Retinal sheet transplantation using fetal neural retinal tissue has emerged as a promising intervention, demonstrating long-term survival, integration with the host retina, and partial restoration of light-driven responses. We previously showed that such transplants can restore fundamental visual response properties in the primary visual cortex (V1) of rapidly degenerating rats. However, it remains unclear whether restored retinal input can support higher-order cortical computations that depend on the integration of classical and extra-classical receptive field mechanisms. In this study, we extend this investigation by evaluating whether fetal retinal sheet transplants can restore extra-classical surround modulation in neurons of higher visual areas (V2). Fetal retinal sheets (E18-E19) derived from donor rats were transplanted into one eye of Rho-S334ter line-3 rats at ages P41-P78, when rod degeneration is nearly complete and cones are largely nonfunctional. Animals were assessed 2.2-9.3 months post-surgery using in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings from V2, optokinetic testing, OCT imaging, and histology. Control groups included normal-vision rats, age-matched degenerated rats (AMC), and sham-operated line-3 rats. Transplants survived long term, developed laminated and rosetted photoreceptor structures, and integrated with the host retina. Optokinetic testing revealed significant improvement in spatial acuity in transplanted eyes compared with degenerated controls beginning at three months post-surgery. Transplanted rats exhibited a markedly higher proportion of visually responsive V2 neurons than degenerated animals (21.0% vs. 8.2%). They also showed significantly shorter response latencies and larger visually evoked response amplitudes, indicating improved transmission of retinal signals to the cortex. To quantify surround suppression, neurons were tested with sinusoidal gratings confined to the classical receptive field and gratings extended to full-field size. Transplanted rats displayed robust surround suppression properties similar to normal controls, including significantly reduced firing rates and narrower tuning under full-field conditions. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on net responses to CRF and FF stimulus sizes reliably distinguished control and transplanted neurons from degenerated ones but could not separate control from transplant, further indicating similar response properties in these two groups. These findings provide the first demonstration that retinal sheet transplants restore not only basic visual responses but also higher-order cortical mechanisms involving extra-classical surround suppression. This recovery of surround suppression in V2 suggests that transplanted retinal tissue can re-establish functionally meaningful circuits capable of supporting complex visual processing. The results underscore the therapeutic potential of retinal sheet transplantation for advanced retinal degenerative disease and provide the first evidence of surround suppression in the rat V2.

">Direction and orientation preferences in mouse superior colliculus and its retinal inputs exhibit a topography of cardinal biases atop locally mixed tuning</a></h4>

              
                In mouse superior colliculus (SC), neurons are robustly tuned to motion direction and orientation, but it remains controversial whether these preferences form global maps or are arranged in a salt-and-pepper fashion, and how this organization relates to that found in the retina and, specifically, the retinal input to the SC. We addressed these questions by combining two-photon calcium imaging of retinal boutons and SC neurons in superficial SC with Neuropixels recordings across the full depth of SC. We then asked how direction and orientation preferences depend on visual-field location and how tuning similarity among units depend on lateral and vertical distance. Retinal boutons were strongly tuned and closely matched the topographic organization of direction- and orientation-selective ganglion cells, confirming that SC receives a highly ordered, retino-centric code for motion and edges. With increasing depth, SC neurons progressively deviated from this organization. Pairwise and population analyses revealed only weak local clustering, confined to very small spatial scales, and no robust global maps of direction or orientation. These results show that mouse SC inherits a topographic organization of cardinal directions and orientations from the retina and transforms it into a broad coverage of directions and orientations at every visual location, likely supporting readout for diverse visually guided behaviors.

">Tirzepatide Synergizes with Leptin on Weight Loss and Restoring Metabolic Homeostasis in Diet-induced Obesity Model</a></h4>

              
                Leptin resistance limits anti-obesity efficacy. We identified a leptin-sensitizing mechanism through tirzepatide (TZP), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) dual-agonist. Our tirzepatide clinical trial revealed that circulating leptin levels at baseline correlated with weight loss efficacy in patients with obesity, suggesting leptin and tirzepatide could interact to achieve stronger effects on weight loss. Next, we utilized the diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice and demonstrated the synergistic effects of tirzepatide and leptin combination (TZP+Lep) on weight loss. TZP+Lep treatment further improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and upregulated thermogenetic gene expression in brown adipose tissue. Metabolic profiling under thermoneutrality revealed TZP+Lep treatment further reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure. Tirzepatide sensitized leptin signaling in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and GLP-1R expressing neurons. TZP+Lep synergistically increased POMC neuronal firing by decreasing the inhibitory postsynaptic input. Together, our work showed combining tirzepatide and leptin as a potential way for better maintenance of metabolic homeostasis in obesity management.

">Fully Human Stem Cell-Derived BBB Model for Clinical Disease Modeling and Neurotropic AAV selection</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly functionalized vascular interface which regulates the exchange of substances between the neural parenchyma and its periphery. In vitro models of the BBB have rapidly evolved into elaborated structures, but their cellular components are currently highly heterogeneous in origin and maturation state. Here, we have developed novel procedures to establish reproducible and scalable sources of endothelial, mural and astroglial cells generating a fully human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived BBB model, termed thBBBA, which develops mature functional properties with high barrier impermeability. Mature thBBBAs can also be generated by frozen hPSC-derived cell samples, providing a simple and scalable off-the-shelf system. thBBBAs were instrumental in identifying the critical pathological role of an IL-6 autocrine source in disrupting thBBBA integrity, increasing its permeability to NMDAR antibodies from autoimmune encephalitis patients, and revealing the therapeutic effects of tocilizumab in this setting. Additionally, we have shown that thBBBAs are an invaluable system for ranking the clinical readiness of novel engineered AAV neurotropic capsids, previously selected in animal models or in vitro systems.

">The atypical antidepressant and cognitive enhancer tianeptine disinhibits hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by reducing GABAergic neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant and cognitive enhancer whose actions are thought to be dependent on the activation of opioid receptors, including mu-opioid receptors expressed on hippocampal interneurons. Agonists of these receptors can cause a disinhibition of principal neurons by inhibiting GABA release or interneuron firing. However, direct evidence for a similar action of tianeptine has not previously been reported. We therefore studied the effects of tianeptine on in vivo and in vitro measures of inhibitory synaptic transmission. CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and local field potential (LFP) activity were recorded in area CA1 of anaesthetised rats. To obtain a more direct measure of the actions of tianeptine on GABA release, we also conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (sIPSCs and eIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. Intrahippocampal infusion of tianeptine (15 mM; 1 microlitre) caused a marked reduction in paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the population spike (20-ms inter-stimulus interval) elicited in the CA1 cell-body layer. Separate recordings in the stratum radiatum revealed an enhancement of beta and gamma-frequency LFP activity, an effect of tianeptine that we have reported previously. Infusion of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline caused a similar reduction in PPI but did not induce beta/gamma oscillations. In mouse hippocampal slices, tianeptine (50 micromolar) reduced both sIPSC frequency and eIPSC amplitude. These results confirm that tianeptine causes a disinhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells, but suggest that a simple blockade of GABAergic transmission is not alone sufficient to explain its effects on hippocampal network activity.

">Vitreous Inflammation as an Early Indicator of Retinal Ganglion Cell Loss Following Acute Optic Nerve Injury in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration in optic neuropathies is often preceded by neuroinflammatory changes, yet the earliest in vivo indicators of this process remain poorly defined. Here, we identified vitreous hyperreflective foci (VHRFs) by visible-light optical coherence tomography (vis-OCT) as an early inflammatory signature of RGC injury. Longitudinal vis-OCT imaging after optic nerve crush (ONC) revealed that VHRFs emerged as early as 6 hours post-injury and peaked before the significant RGC loss. Confocal analysis showed that these VHRFs corresponded to activated amoeboid microglia undergoing vertical migration from the outer to inner retina and horizontal movement toward the optic nerve head area. Similar amoeboid microglia were also observed in the anterior segment, suggesting a global ocular inflammatory response to the ONC injury. RNAscope in situ hybridization further demonstrated elevated IL-1{beta} expression in vitreous amoeboid microglia. Moreover, pharmacological blockade of IL-1 signaling with an IL-1 receptor antagonist significantly reduced VHRFs, suppressed microglial migration, and delayed RGC loss. Taken together, our findings identify VHRFs as a previously unrecognized early danger signal for RGC degeneration and highlight IL-1-mediated inflammation as a tractable early therapeutic target for preventing RGC degeneration and vision loss.

">Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition for Cross-Bispectral Analysis of EEG Data</a></h4>

              
                Cross-bispectral measures provide a rich description of interactions in EEG signals, but their third-order tensor structure poses substantial challenges for interpretation and dimensionality reduction. We introduce a low-rank tensor decomposition framework specifically designed for cross-bispectral EEG data. The model expresses the bispectrum as a product of a single spatial mixing matrix and a compact source-interaction tensor, yielding a structured and interpretable representation of the data. Unlike classical tensor decompositions such as Tucker and its special case PARAFAC, where either the core tensor is unconstrained or restricted to rank-one terms, our formulation incorporates a source-space interpretation directly through the tensor Qmnp, making the decomposition well suited for identifying dominant coupling components. After obtaining the low-rank representation, spatial demixing is performed using MOCA to derive clear and interpretable source maps. Through simulations, we show that the method consistently retrieves the dominant structure of the bispectrum across a wide range of conditions, including changes in SNR, dipole orientation, amplitude balance, and source complexity. Applied to resting-state EEG, the method produces anatomically plausible parietal generators associated with the strongest alpha-band bispectral interactions. Overall, the framework provides a principled and computationally efficient approach for reducing and interpreting cross-bispectral EEG data, offering source-level insights that are difficult to obtain using standard tensor factorization techniques.

">Disentangling Brain-Psychopathology Associations: A Systematic Evaluation of Transdiagnostic Bifactor Models</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the neurobiological basis of mental health disorders remains a central goal in psychiatry. However, identifying robust brain-psychopathology associations with neuroimaging has proven difficult, in part due to substantial heterogeneity within and comorbidity between diagnostic categories. Transdiagnostic bifactor models aim to characterise this structure by separating shared from unique symptom variance, yielding more reliable and potentially more accurate latent dimensions of psychopathology. However, the extent to which these behavioural models improve brain-psychopathology associations remains largely uncharacterised. Using two large developmental cohorts, we compared 11 previously published bifactor models applied to the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) to traditional CBCL summary scores. For both symptom-scoring approaches, we systematically evaluated their reliability and multivariate associations with whole-brain structure (MRI) and function (resting-state fMRI). We found no consistent evidence that bifactor-derived factor scores strengthened reliability or brain-psychopathology associations, relative to summary scores. Whole-brain predictive models revealed broadly distributed neural signatures that were highly similar between corresponding factor and summary score constructs, with general factors and total problems approaching numerical equivalence. Nevertheless, factor scores displayed more distinct neural signatures between general, internalising, and externalising dimensions than did summary scores. Together, these findings suggest that existing CBCL bifactor models of psychopathology do not systematically strengthen the predictive utility of psychiatric neuroimaging, possibly reflecting fundamental limits on the proportion of CBCL symptom variance captured by brain features. While bifactor models may aid in separating neural correlates across constructs, improving phenotypic assessment depth, rather than alternative phenotypic modelling, may provide more tangible improvements to association strength moving forward.

                Accumulation of phosphorylated -synuclein at serine 129 is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its pathogenic role remains controversial. We conducted longitudinal studies using non-phosphorylatable S129A and phosphomimetic S129D -synuclein global knock-in mice. Unexpectedly, the S129A mice--rather than S129D mice--developed reproducible olfactory, motor, and cognitive deficits, dopaminergic dysfunction and neurodegeneration, -synuclein insolubility, and Lewy-like inclusions by 3 to 9 months, with progressive worsening up to 12 months of age. Spatial transcriptomics and electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial, synaptic, and protein ubiquitination abnormalities in the substantia nigra of S129A -synuclein mice. Viral vector-mediated nigral overexpression of S129D--synuclein or systemic administration of an anti--synuclein-aggregation drug partially alleviated the early neurological phenotypes of S129A mice. These results implicate non-phosphorylatable -synuclein as a direct pathogenic driver for PD.

">NAD+ hydrolase Sarm1 is a key driver of synapse degeneration and memory loss in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Synapse degeneration is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synapse loss has been known for decades as the strongest correlate with cognition and disease progression in AD patients, but the molecular mechanisms that drive synapse degeneration remain elusive. Here, we identify Sarm1, a new class of NAD+ hydrolase required for Wallerian degeneration of periphery nerves after injuries, as the key mediator of synaptic degeneration in AD brains. Sarm1 knockout largely reversed synapse loss, amyloid burden, and cognitive decline in 5XFAD mice. We found that Sarm1 is enriched in synaptic terminals and becomes activated in synaptic dystrophies adjacent to Abeta; plaques, leading to synapse degeneration and subsequent neuroinflammation. Sarm1 deletion in the AD mice prevented synaptic dystrophies and rescued short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity. Further, Sarm1 deletion protected synapses from C1q tagging and phagocytosis, and C1q-MERTK signaling in complement cascades was significantly reduced. The reduced synapse degeneration, in turn, broke the feed-forward loop of "glia activation-neuroinflammation-Abeta deposition". These data suggest that Sarm1 plays a key role in driving synapse degeneration in AD before C1q-tagging and phagocytic clearance, and targeting Sarm1 may offer a novel intervention to attenuate synapse degeneration and memory loss in AD.

">Vector coordinate transformation in the Drosophila navigation system</a></h4>

              
                Animals' navigational behaviors rely on internal representations of space, yet how these representations guide behaviors is poorly understood. Here, we determined how neurons in the brain of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, transform a world-centric (allocentric) reference frame to one that is body-centric (egocentric), which is essential for navigating to a goal. PFL1 neurons in the fly's central complex, the navigation center, have two dendrites; one of these receives input from neurons that encode a head direction vector, while the other receives input from neurons in a neuropil called the fan-shaped body (FB). Therefore, we investigated whether PFL1 neurons transform allocentric vectors to an egocentric reference frame. We developed a computational model that shows how PFL1 can transform an allocentric direction vector encoded by FB neurons to an egocentric reference frame by nonlinearly combining it with the head direction input. In tethered flying flies, we simultaneously recorded the head direction input to as well as the output of PFL1, which we used to constrain and fit our model. This allowed us to infer that PFL1 neurons receive a stored direction that persists across behavioral trials for the same fly but appears to be random across flies, fundamental characteristics of a goal. Our results describe how a population of neurons performs a coordinate transformation that can facilitate the pursuit of a goal, a fundamental computation for any neural system containing representations in multiple reference frames.

">Eukaryotic initiation factor 3d Regulates Context-Dependent Pain Hypersensitivity Through the Integrated Stress Response</a></h4>

              
                Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D (eIF3d) is a noncanonical cap binding protein implicated in selective mRNA translation under stress conditions. Here, we investigate the contribution of eIF3d to pain processing using a heterozygous eIF3d knockout (eIF3d+/-) mouse model. We first validated this model, confirming substantial reductions in eIF3d mRNA and protein levels in dorsal root ganglia. Baseline assessments revealed no differences in mechanical, thermal, cold, or spontaneous pain behaviors between eIF3d+/- (HET) and eIF3d+/+ (WT) mice, indicating intact basal nociceptive function. In pain models involving peripheral inflammation and metabolic stress, including methylglyoxal injection, IL-6 administration and paw incision, HET mice displayed significantly reduced mechanical and cold hypersensitivity. In contrast, HET mice exhibited increased second phase nocifensive behavior in the formalin test, possibly indicating enhanced central sensitization. Hyperalgesic priming was comparable between HET and WT mice following IL-6 exposure. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced mice were unaffected by eIF3d reduction. These findings demonstrate that eIF3d selectively modulates nociceptive plasticity under defined stress conditions and suggests a context dependent role in the regulation of inflammatory and central pain sensitization.

">DIME: Data-driven Importance MEtric Guides Localization of the Seizure Onset Zone from Intracranial EEG Data</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy affects over 50 million individuals, many of whom require surgical treatment that is dependent on accurate localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). Conventional SOZ biomarkers are based on strictly defined intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) phenomena and cannot benefit from increased datasets. The scarcity of SOZ-labeled iEEG data impedes biomarker development. We introduce the Data-driven Importance MEtric (DIME) to guide SOZ localization in an interpretable pipeline that improves with ictal-labeled iEEG data. We apply DIME to an open-source dataset (n=21; 13 successful; 8 failed) for SOZ localization and surgical outcome prediction. The highest DIME-ranked electrode belonged to the clinically annotated SOZ for 69.2% of patients with successful surgery (p<0.001). DIME scores were significantly higher in SOZ electrodes than nonSOZ electrodes in both successful and failed surgeries (p<0.001), though the DIME distribution for successful cases differed from failed cases (p=0.002). DIME predicted surgical outcome with 92.3% recall and 66.7% accuracy.

">Longitudinal Neurocognitive Trajectories in a Large Cohort of Youth Who Use Cannabis: Combining Self-Report and Toxicology</a></h4>

              
                Adolescents experience extensive neurocognitive development, which cannabis use potentially impacting developmental trajectories. Here, we comprehensively assess the influence of adolescent cannabis use onset on neurocognitive trajectories and consider how recent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) may influence neurocognition. We use the large, diverse longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study dataset, combining self-reported substance use with objective toxicological tests (hair, urine, breath, oral fluid). Longitudinal mixed methods of the full cohort (n=11,036, ages 9-17) investigate time-varying cannabis onset on neurocognitive performance. Secondarily, in participants with repeat toxicological hair testing (n=645) at ages 12-16, we consider the influence of THC v. CBD v. Controls. Covariates include sociodemographics, family history of substance use disorder, prenatal substance exposure, early psychopathology, other substance use, and nesting for participant ID, study site, and family ID. Cannabis group interacted with age to show altered neurocognitive trajectories across domains (immediate recall and delayed memory, processing speed, inhibitory control, visuospatial processing, language, and working memory; {beta}s=-0.11 - -0.52). Secondary models indicated hair-identified THC exposure predicted worse episodic memory than in Controls ({beta}=-0.60, p=.007), with no difference between CBD exposed and Controls. Data suggest those who use cannabis show a slight cognitive advantage during late childhood, with demonstrate diminished trajectories over time. These flattened neurocognitive trajectories in youth (ages 9-17) who initiate cannabis use were demonstrated after accounting for within-person change and numerous known confounds and improving accuracy in cannabis groupings through incorporating toxicological measures. Continued monitoring of this cohort will clarify cannabinoid-cognition relationships into young adulthood, including the impact of timing of cannabis use initiation.

">Bayesian Nonparametric Identification of Frequency-Selective Neural Oscillatory States</a></h4>

              
                Identifying neural oscillations is essential for linking fast brain dynamics to underlying cognitive states. However, this is challenging because oscillatory events can be brief, embedded in 1/f-like background activity, and may comprise an unknown number of spectrally distinct states. Conventional approaches often apply narrowband band-pass filters to one or a few predefined frequency bands, followed by fixed power- or amplitude-thresholding to identify oscillatory events. Although recent unsupervised alternatives based on Hidden Markov models (HMM) address these limitations, they still require a priori specification of the number of states and can underfit or overfit when the number of states is misspecified. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric method that identifies distinct oscillatory states while inferring an appropriate number of states directly from the data. This method combines time-delay embedding (TDE) with the Dirichlet-process Gaussian mixture model (DP-GMM). TDE augments the signal with time-shifted copies, enabling the DP-GMM to capture frequency-specific local autocovariance structures, while the Dirichlet-process prior adapts model complexity by pruning inactive components. We benchmarked the approach against a filter-based thresholding method and the time-delay embedded HMM using single-channel synthetic data designed to mimic neural time series (e.g., EEG, MEG, and local field potentials), with multiple frequency components embedded in 1/f-like noise. In this setting, the proposed model reliably recovered multiple distinct frequency components under noisy conditions while also inferring the correct number of oscillatory states. Applied to a resting-state motor-cortex MEG dataset, the model identified multiple frequency-selective, short-lived oscillatory states that exhibited substantial inter-individual heterogeneity in peak frequency, occurrence rate, and power. Overall, this provides a fully unsupervised route to discovering frequency-selective oscillatory states without predefining frequency bands or selecting the number of states in advance.

">Cyfip2 mediates sensorimotor integration of visual input through Rac1-dependent actin remodeling</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor integration of visual input is essential for adaptive behaviors such as navigation, hunting, and escape from danger, yet our understanding of the developmental mechanisms that assemble these visuomotor circuits remains incomplete. Cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 2 (cyfip2) is a key factor in retinotectal axon guidance in zebrafish larvae, and it has conserved roles in regulating actin dynamics and mRNA translation. Variants in human CYFIP2 cause neurodevelopmental disabilities including vision deficits, but how it functions to shape visually-driven behavior is unclear. Here we measured multiple visually-mediated behaviors, brain-wide activity, and conditional rescue of behavioral defects in larval zebrafish to define cyfip2's roles in assembling visual sensorimotor circuits. cyfip2 mutants display severe deficits in prey capture and dark and light flash responses, despite normal optokinetic responses, indicating intact retinal phototransduction but disrupted downstream sensorimotor integration. Both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity are reduced in the optic tectum of cyfip2 mutants, as measured by phospho-ERK immunostaining and pan-neuronal calcium, consistent with impaired functional input from retinal ganglion cells. Finally, using conditional transgenic alleles to temporally control Cyfip2 expression, we identified a critical window from 30-50 hours post-fertilization during which Cyfip2 acts through Rac1-dependent actin polymerization but not FMRP-mediated translation to establish visual behavior circuits. Together, these findings define how and when Cyfip2 acts as a critical organizer of vertebrate visual circuit development, providing mechanistic insight into the visual and motor deficits in human subjects with variants in CYFIP2.

">Parkinsonism Reversal and Dopaminergic Resilience: Lessons from a Rotenone-induced Parkinson's Disease Model</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by profound loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, yet the underlying mechanism remains incompletely defined. Mitochondrial toxins can induce acute degeneration of DA neurons and Parkinsonism-like phenotypes in animal models, and epidemiological studies have linked pesticide exposure to increased PD risk; however, the long-term effects of pesticide exposure remain elusive. Here, we examined both the acute and long-term effects of rotenone exposure in mice to understand PD onset, progression, and recovery. A 21-day regimen of rotenone intraperitoneal injections (2.5 mg/kg/day) induced robust Parkinsonism-like deficits by the 4th week, including impaired locomotion, increased anxiety-like behaviors, and deficits in motor balancing and coordination. These behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by pronounced reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression and selective loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Unexpectedly, these functional impairments fully resolved by 12 months, and rotenone-treated mice behaved equally well as age-matched controls. In parallel, the TH expression and DA neuron density in SNc were restored to control levels. Together, these longitudinal results demonstrate that chronic rotenone injection induces robust but reversible Parkinsonism in the acute phase, with limited long-term consequence on Parkinsonism upon toxin cessation. These findings contrast with the prevailing view that environmental pesticide exposure irreversibly drives PD and instead they reveal a substantial resilience and adaptive capacity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in vivo.

">Incentive valence differentially engages open- and closed-loop basal ganglia circuits during movement initiation</a></h4>

              
                Incentives modulate voluntary movement, yet the circuitry channeling these signals into motor output remains unclear. Classical models emphasize a closed-loop circuit (CLC) linking dorsal putamen (PUTd) with motor cortex, but this pathway is anatomically segregated from affective processing regions. Anatomical and clinical evidence point to an alternative: an open-loop circuit (OLC) from ventral putamen (PUTv) that may route affective signals to motor cortex. Here, we conducted two experiments to test whether a functional OLC exists in humans and whether it is differentially engaged by incentive conditions. First, in 7 T resting-state fMRI (multi-echo), PUTv showed robust functional connectivity with both affective and motor regions, including the cingulate motor area (CMA), even after accounting for PUTd variance. This connectivity pattern supports the plausibility of an independent pathway linking affective basal ganglia regions to the motor cortex. Second, in 3 T task fMRI (incentivized reaching), jackpot (high-reward) and robber (high-loss avoidance) incentive conditions produced distinct behavioral and neural signatures. Jackpot produced a speed-accuracy trade-off, with faster movement initiation but more false starts. Neurally, this coincided with engagement (BOLD responses relevant for initiation speed) being reduced in CLC nodes but not in OLC. Robber, in contrast, eliminated engagement in both OLC and CLC nodes, instead recruiting stopping-related regions (e.g., STN), consistent with an avoidance phenomenology. Together, these findings support a versatile architecture for movement initiation that flexibly engages distinct cortico-subcortical circuits depending on incentive phenomenology, and offer a candidate mechanism through which affective salience and valence modulate voluntary movement.

">Feel the Beat: The Impact of Rhythms on Dynamic Visual Search</a></h4>

              
                Rhythms are everywhere. We encounter them daily within our environment and produce them regularly through our movements, speech and sensory systems. In both cognitive and clinical contexts, external rhythms have been shown to enhance performance when they are aligned with, predict, or entrain stimuli onsets or relevant moments in time. In this study, we aimed to understand the impact of external and internal rhythms on performance in a task devoid of rhythmic temporal structure. We thus investigated the differential impact of auditory beats (1, 2, 5 Hz or no beat) on detection in a non rhythmic, dynamic search task requiring the continuous deployment of attention. We additionally assessed whether the influence of auditory beats on detection was modulated by individual rhythmic preferences as measured by their spontaneous motor tempo. Overall, we found that auditory rhythms enhanced visual task performance, even in the absence of rhythmic structure within the measured task, improving both detection accuracy and response speed. This enhancement was tempo dependent, with the strongest facilitation observed at 2 Hz. The magnitude of the observed benefits varied with individual spontaneous motor tempo, such that participants with slower SMTs exhibited the greatest performance benefits due to the presence of auditory rhythms. We propose that rhythmic stimulation may serve as a powerful scaffold for sustained performance in the context of dynamic and temporally unpredictable environments.

">Diverse Visual Experience Promotes Integrated Representations and Mitigates Bias in Deep Neural Networks for Face Perception</a></h4>

              
                Humans are experts at recognizing faces, yet this expertise is not uniform: people perceive faces from familiar facial groups more accurately than those from unfamiliar ones, a phenomenon known as the Other-Race Effect (ORE). Although the ORE is well established, it remains unclear how exposure diversity reshapes the underlying representations that give rise to it. Here, we combine deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with human behavioral data to investigate how training diversity influences the emergence and mitigation of recognition biases. CNNs trained exclusively on either Asian or White faces reproduced ORE-like biases, showing reduced performance for faces from unfamiliar groups. In contrast, a CNN trained on both Asian and White faces showed minimal bias, balanced performance across groups, and an integrated representational geometry spanning both groups. Critically, this model best captured human face-matching behavior across both Asian and White participants, outperforming single-trained networks on cross-group trials. These findings show how diverse visual experience reorganizes representational geometry to support cross-group generalization in artificial systems and provide computational insight into how diverse experience may shape more integrated face representations in humans.

">An Online Brain-Computer Interface for Detecting Incongruity in Augmented Reality Applications</a></h4>

              
                Objective. Augmented reality can provide digital information about physical entities presented within its real-world context. However, this information might disagree with the user`s expectations due to factual errors in the data or cognitive biases. Such incongruity can impair user experience and undermine trust in the AR system. To address this issue, we propose detecting inconsistencies between physical objects and digital information through hybrid brain-computer interfaces. Approach. We conducted two complementary experiments. First, we implemented a strategy that integrates eye-tracking and brain signals for incongruity detection in an offline study. Subsequently, we assessed our approach in an online study in which participants received immediate feedback on the classification. Main results. The grand average event-related potentials revealed consistent electroencephalographic responses to incongruent augmentations, specifically a centroparietal N400 effect, across both experiments. We could further distinguish between congruent and incongruent information with an average balanced accuracy of 70 % in the online study. Significance. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of detecting incongruity online, allowing for autonomous system adaptation, like presenting information in a more accessible format or providing contextual support.

">Inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) by URB597 counteracts cognitive deficit and alters neuroendocrine stress responses in male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive deficits are hallmark features of several neuropsychiatric disorders, yet therapeutic options remain scarce. Modulation of the endocannabinoid system through inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) represents a promising target that may influence both cognitive functions and the neuroendocrine system. However, mechanisms linking FAAH inhibition to these outcomes remain poorly understood. In this study, we hypothesised that FAAH inhibition by URB597 counteracts scopolamine-induced memory deficits and modulates neuroendocrine reactivity differently in males and females. We tested the effects of URB597 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) in Sprague Dawley rats at baseline and during a scopolamine challenge (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Recognition memory was assessed in the novel object recognition (NOR) task, which also served as a mild stressor. Plasma concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone, vasopressin, aldosterone, and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured. URB597 pretreatment counteracted the cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine, showing greater efficacy in males. FAAH inhibition reduced ACTH, corticosterone, vasopressin, and aldosterone concentrations, while PRA remained unaffected. Correlation analyses revealed sex-specific associations. In males, better recognition performance was associated with lower ACTH, corticosterone, and vasopressin, whereas in females, cognition correlated negatively with aldosterone and positively with PRA. These findings demonstrate that FAAH inhibition elicits cognitive protection, associated with the attenuation of neuroendocrine stress responses, and this effect is distinct in males and females. By linking behavioural and endocrine outcomes, this study identifies dual actions of FAAH inhibition and underscores the importance of sex as a biological variable in endocannabinoid-based therapeutic strategies.

">Theta-Band Temporal Interference Stimulation of the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex Enhances Prediction Error Processing in Individuals With Food Addiction</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Food addiction is characterized by persistently elevated food reward expectations, suggesting impaired prediction error processing. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encodes prediction errors via theta-band activity, but causal evidence in humans remains limited. Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIs) offers a non-invasive approach to modulate deep cortical regions including the dACC. METHODS: Thirty-four individuals with food addiction were randomly assigned to active theta-band tTIs or sham stimulation. Participants completed food and monetary incentive delay tasks in a satiated state while EEG was recorded before and after stimulation. Feedback-related negativity (FRN) and stimulus preceding negativity (SPN) were examined at both mean ERP and trial-by-trial levels using behavioral and model-derived prediction errors. RESULTS: Trial-by-trial analyses showed that tTIs selectively enhanced neural sensitivity to unfavorable food outcomes. Averaged FRN amplitudes for negative behavioral prediction errors increased after stimulation in the active group ({Delta} FRN = -1.91 V, p = .038, d = 0.55), with no change in the sham group. A similar enhancement was observed for negative model-derived prediction errors ({Delta} FRN = -1.71 V, p = .004, d = 0.82). At the mean ERP level, FRN during food feedback became more negative after stimulation (t16 = 2.75, p = .014), whereas SPN was unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Theta-band tTIs targeting the dACC selectively enhances neural sensitivity to prediction errors during food reward processing, highlighting temporal interference stimulation as a tool for modulating deep cortical feedback-evaluation mechanisms in humans.

">Cografting strategies uncover cell type dependent regulation of dopamine neuron specification and functional maturation in a pre clinical model of Parkinson`s Disease</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the progressive loss of A9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum and subsequent motor symptoms. Transplantation of ventral midbrain-patterned DA (vmDA) progenitors derived from human pluripotent stem cells, aimed at restoring DA neurotransmission in the striatum, is being developed and currently explored in ongoing clinical trials. One factor that may improve the maturation and fate determination of DA neurons in vivo is the intercellular communication within the graft environment, ultimately affecting the therapeutic outcome. In this study, we co-transplanted vmDA progenitors with either glial, ventral forebrain or striatal progenitors into a preclinical xenograft PD model to investigate how these interactions shape the development, maturation, and function of therapeutic DA neurons. Our findings show that co-grafts with ventral forebrain progenitors increase the yield of DA neurons and also promote their functional maturation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that co-grafts with striatal neurons promote functional maturation and the acquisition of DA subtype identity. From these data, we identified EBF3 and PBX3 as candidate transcription factors directing DA neuron maturation and subtype specification, and then functionally validated their role in brain organoids. Taken together, our data highlight that the cellular microenvironment, including specific interactions with neighbouring cells, guides in vivo DA neuron specification and maturation. These findings provide a foundation for developing more refined and effective cell preparations for replacement therapy in PD, and define a conceptual framework that could inform stem cell based strategies for other neurodegenerative diseases.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The pharmacological treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a disorder characterized by recurrent seizures and cognitive dysfunction, is limited to symptomatic control. Identifying novel targets to modify disease progression is of great clinical and translational interest. Cellular senescence has been recently implicated in the development and progression of other neurodegenerative diseases, but its role in TLE is unstudied.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We first investigated cellular senescence markers in resected hippocampi from patients with medically intractable TLE through multiplexed immunofluorescence. We next used a mouse model of TLE (pilocarpine induced status epilepticus [SE]) for a combination of immunohistochemistry, behavioral testing, and electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. We implemented 2 strategies for removal of senescent cells (SCs), a genetic mouse model allowing for targeted senolysis, and a pharmacological approach using dasatinib and quercetin.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found a 5-fold elevation of senescent glia in human TLE cases as compared with controls. In mice, we found increases in senescence markers at both the transcript and protein level and predominantly expressed in microglia, which developed within 2 weeks following SE. Senolytic treatment produced a 50% reduction in SCs, rescued long-term potentiation deficits, normalized spatial memory impairments, reduced seizures, and protected a third of animals from epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data demonstrate that SCs accumulate in both human TLE and in a mouse model of TLE and suggest that clearing SCs may be a viable strategy to reduce seizures and associated cognitive comorbidities. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>Mice offer a wealth of opportunities for investigating brain circuits regulating multiple behaviors, largely due to their genetic tractability. Social behaviors are translationally relevant, considering both mice and humans are highly social mammals, and human social behavior disruptions are key symptoms of myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. Stresses related to social experiences are particularly influential in the severity and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders like anxiety disorders and trauma and stressor-related disorders. Yet, induction and study of social stress in mice has disproportionately focused on males, influenced heavily by their inherent territorial nature. Social target-instigated stress (i.e., defeat), while ethologically relevant, is quite variable and predominantly specific to males, making rigorous and sex-inclusive studies challenging. In pursuit of a controllable, consistent, high-throughput, and sex-inclusive method for social stress elicitation, we modified a paradigm to train male and female F1 129S1/SvlmJ <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> C57BL/6J mice to associate (via classical conditioning) same or different sex C57BL/6J targets with a mild, aversive stimulus. While further paradigm optimization is required, social interaction testing 24&nbsp;h after conditioning indicates males socially conditioned better to male targets by exhibiting reduced social interaction, whereas females appeared not to form social stimulus associations. Serum corticosterone levels inversely corresponded to social avoidance after different sex, but not same sex, conditioning, suggesting corticosterone-mediated arousal influences cross-sex interactions. These rigorously controlled null outcomes align with past pursuits&rsquo; limited success in creating a sex-inclusive social stress paradigm.</p>

                Background Lipid deposits on rigid corneal lenses pose significant challenges, impacting visual clarity, lens comfort, and ocular health. Despite advancements in lens materials and cleaning systems, lipid deposition remains a persistent issue, influenced by individual physiological factors and external conditions. This case report explores the composition, influencing factors, and management strategies for lipid deposits through two distinct presentations. Methods Case 1 involved a jelly-like, white, deposits coating the lens surface, whereas, case 2 described localized, irregular, peripheral lipid clusters. Both cases underwent thorough evaluation, including slit-lamp microscopy and spectroscopic analysis, to characterize the deposits’ morphology and composition. These assessments, combined with detailed patient histories, revealed the multifactorial nature of lipid deposition. Results Management strategies were customized for each case, with both approaches successfully reduced lipid deposition, improved lens performance, and enhanced patient satisfaction. This report underscores the importance of a personalized, multifaceted approach to managing lipid deposits on rigid corneal lenses. Conclusions Identifying contributing factors such as tear film abnormalities, material properties, and patient behaviours is critical for effective management. The findings highlight the need for continued innovation in lens material technology and cleaning systems to address this common issue.

                This opinion article examines the convergence between artificial intelligence (AI) and gamification in learning environments, with an emphasis on deep gamification designs aimed at creating interactive and meaningful experiences that transcend extrinsic motivation. The introduction sets the context by presenting AI as a tool that must be critically analyzed within the framework of critical pedagogy, which underscores the importance of adopting technology reflectively, placing the student at the center, and responding to the real needs of the community. The body of the article develops this claim: the integration of artificial intelligence into deep gamification designs can contribute to genuine educational transformation, provided that such integration is guided by critical pedagogical principles and maintains a balance between the potential of technology and the formative power of teaching practices. Arguments related to this claim are provided, including the use of AI in gamified designs to create personalized learning experiences based on students’ needs, rhythms, and learning styles; to transform the way students learn; to offer new educational resources; to adapt elements such as difficulty levels, challenges, and feedback in real time; and to develop engaging learning systems that lead to better academic outcomes. The conclusion emphasizes the significance of instructors utilizing critical pedagogy to direct AI-optimized gamification designs by incorporating culture, creativity, and critical awareness as pillars of educational transformation. This approach enables the surmounting of the obstacles presented by this synergy.

                The fixed-point iteration method is a powerful tool in analysis and its extensions in other branches. It provides a unified structure for proving existence and uniqueness results for various nonlinear problems. This study, conducted within the scope of a real Banach space enriched by uniform convexity, presents an accelerated four-step iterative scheme designed to approximate elements of the fixed-point set corresponding to a mapping called a total asymptotically nonexpansive (briefly, TAN) mapping. The results of weak and strong convergence for the proposed method are established. The results relating to weak convergence require Opial’s condition of the normed space, while the results relating to strong convergence require the addition of the semi-compactness assumption of the mapping under consideration to the previous assumptions. Additionally, numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the algorithm’s effectiveness and compare it with previously established approaches. These findings extend and refine several recent contributions available in the literature. Lastly, the work includes an application to 2- dimensional equations.

                Background Class III malocclusion presents unique challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Bone-anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP) and facemask (FM) therapy are common approaches. Finite element analysis (FEA) helps evaluate their biomechanical effects. The study aims to evaluate and compare the stress distribution and displacement during maxillary protraction on the craniofacial complex using bone-anchored maxillary protraction and a facemask using finite element analysis. Methods A finite element model of the maxillofacial complex was developed using CT scans of a young human skull and analyzed using ANSYS (v18.1). The material properties for facemask therapy and miniplates used in bone-anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP), were gathered to create a 3D finite element analysis (FEA) model. Displacement and stress patterns were assessed in the maxilla, maxillary teeth, mandible, and surrounding structures for both BAMP and facemask therapy, applying a bilateral force of 300 grams. Results Displacement was mainly observed in the maxillary complex for both protocols, with BAMP showing more anterior displacement than the facemask. In contrast, the mandible experienced greater downward and backward displacement with the facemask protocol. Both methods revealed distinct displacement patterns in the dentoalveolar area. The facemask treatment resulted in more forward displacement of the maxillary anterior teeth, while BAMP primarily caused forward displacement in the first and second molar regions. Additionally, BAMP showed higher stress levels in the craniofacial area, particularly at the miniplate attachment site, whereas the Facemask approach had a more even distribution of stress across the craniofacial region. Conclusion This finite element analysis indicates that maxillary protraction can be achieved through both FM and BAMP methods. However, BAMP method showed greater skeletal displacement with fewer dental effects. This implies that skeletal anchorage might provide a better result for treating class III malocclusion.

                Background This socio-economic analysis studies the influence of jasmine production on the economic well-being of farmers in Huvina Hadagali, a region known for its high-quality jasmine flowers. The Vijaya Nagara district’s Havina Hadagali area is well known throughout the country for its jasmine flower farming. In addition to being referred to as Mallige Nadu, this location is also known as Malligeya Tavaru. The cultivation of the jasmine flower is protected by the Geographical Indication (GI) Tag, and this flower has been popular in this region for a substantial amount of time. Methods Data was collected from a sample of 364 jasmine growers using a structured questionnaire in Huvina Hadagali, Vijayanagar district. The data focused on different socio-economic factors such as income levels, employment, market access, and agricultural techniques. The study is analysed using IBM SPSS through frequency analysis and 2-step clustering. Result The results demonstrate that the cultivation of jasmine makes a substantial contribution to the local economy, serving as a main or additional source of income for numerous households. Jasmine farming often contributes 40% of the whole household income, and during peak seasons, it provides significant economic advantages. Nevertheless, the highlighted obstacles were volatile market pricing, pest infestations, and limited access to contemporary farming practices. Due to their decades of experience, it is felt by the farmers. Hadagali Jasmine comes under the GI Tag, hence they are authorised farmers. The study emphasises the crucial significance of cooperative societies and local marketplaces in stabilising income and offering essential resources and training to farmers.

                Background Continuous exposure to sunlight and pollution without adequate protection can damage skin, making it prone to premature aging. One of the natural ingredients for anti-aging is antioxidant. Malang green apple (Malus sylvestris Mill) contains bioactive compounds that can act as antioxidants, but its use is still limited to only as food ingredient. Furthermore, some studies show the potency of fruit fermentation to increase these bioactive compounds. Thus, this study is a preliminary study to examine the anti-aging potency of fermented Malang green apples. Methods Human foreskin fibroblasts were treated with fermented Malang green apple juice extract (FAJ) by Lactobacillus plantarum DAD-13 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fermipan and its unfermented (AJ) for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay and collagen deposition was measured using the Sirius red staining method. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) was measured in fibroblasts after treatment with extracts. Results Cell viability and collagen deposition of fibroblasts tended to be higher after 48 h of extract exposure. Fibroblasts that received FAJ 62.5 μg/mL showed higher cell viability than negative control (p <0.05) and FAJ 31.25 μg/mL showed higher collagen deposition than negative control (p <0.05) at 48 hours of extract exposure. AJ and FAJ also decreased MMP-1 gene expression. They showed a significant decrease in MMP-1 levels (p <0.01) compared to the untreated group, whereas they showed increased expression of COL1A1 at low concentrations. There was no significant difference in the gene expression between FAJ and AJ. Conclusions Our results indicated that Malang green apple juice extract affected fibroblast cell viability, collagen deposition, MMP-1, and COL1A1 gene expression. Exposure of lower concentrations of FAJ to skin fibroblasts for 48 hours showed better results.

                <p>by Marika Constant, Elisa Filevich, Pascal Mamassian</p>

According to the Bayesian framework, both our perceptual decisions and confidence about those decisions are based on the precision-weighted integration of prior expectations and incoming sensory information. While it is generally assumed that priors influence both decisions and confidence in the same way, previous work has found priors to have a stronger impact at the confidence level, challenging this assumption. However, these patterns were found for high-level probabilistic expectations that are flexibly induced in the task context. It remains unclear whether this generalizes to low-level perceptual priors that are naturally formed through long term exposure. Here we investigated human participants’ confidence in decisions made under the influence of a long-term perceptual prior: the slow-motion prior. Participants viewed tilted moving-line stimuli for which the slow-motion prior biases the perceived motion direction. On each trial, they made two consecutive motion direction decisions followed by a confidence decision. We contrasted two conditions – one in which the prior impacted discrimination performance, and one in which it did not. We found a confidence bias favoring the condition in which the prior influenced discrimination decisions, even after accounting for performance differences. Computational modeling revealed this effect to be best explained by confidence using the prior-congruent evidence as an additional cue, beyond the posterior evidence used in the perceptual decision. This is in agreement with a confirmatory confidence bias favoring evidence congruent with low-level perceptual priors, revealing that, in line with high-level expectations, even long-term priors have a greater influence on the metacognitive level than on perceptual decisions.

                <p>by Nishant Joshi, Sven van Der Burg, Tansu Celikel, Fleur Zeldenrust</p>

Neuronal classification based on morphology, electrophysiology, and molecular markers is often considered static. Here, we challenge this view, showing that functional classification depends on input patterns. Using single-cell recordings from layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons in mice, we compared responses to step-and-hold versus dynamic frozen noise inputs that mimic presynaptic activity. Action potential and waveform-based classifications varied significantly, highlighting the dynamic nature of neuronal identity. To assess the contribution of input versus neuronal attributes toward classification, we analyzed four attribute sets, namely action potential, passive biophysical, adaptation currents, and linear input filters derived via spike-triggered averages (STA). Our findings revealed that the STA, which captures a neuron’s selective responsiveness to presynaptic activity, explained the most variance within the population. This highlights input-driven dynamics as key to functional identity, emphasizing the need for physiologically relevant inputs in defining neuronal classes and shifting the focus from static properties to dynamic functional diversity.

                <p>by Romain Enjalbert, Jakub Köry, Timm Krüger, Miguel O. Bernabeu</p>

The tumour microvasculature is abnormal, and as a consequence oxygen and drug transport to the tumour tissue is impaired. The abnormal microvasculature contributes to tumour tissue hypoxia, as well as to varying drug penetration depth in the tumour. Many anti-cancer treatments require the presence of oxygen to be fully efficacious, however the question of how well oxygen concentration overlaps with drug concentration is not elucidated, which could compromise the therapeutic effect of these drugs. In this work we use a computational model of blood flow and oxygen transport, and develop a model for an oxygen-dependent drug, T-DM1, to study the overlap of oxygen and drug concentration in tumour tissue, where we model both compressed and uncompressed vessels in the tumour. Our results show that, due to the compressed vessels present in tumours, areas of sufficient oxygen concentration for a drug to function overlap poorly with areas of sufficient drug concentration, covering 28% of the tumour tissue, compared to 82% in healthy tissue. The reduction in drug and oxygen overlap is due to the altered red blood cell dynamics through the abnormal microvasculature, and indicates that drug transport to tumours should not be considered independently of oxygen transport in cases where the drug requires oxygen to function.

                Background Fluoride-releasing adhesives in orthodontics help protect enamel. The study compared the fluoride release, recharge, and re-release properties of three light-cure orthodontic bonding adhesives: Group A: TransbondTM Plus Color Change, Group B: Waldent Orthobond LC, and Group C: Koden EZ Bond. Methods The study conducted an in-vitro investigation using 24 maxillary first premolar teeth bonded with one of three fluoride-releasing adhesives after etching. Each sample was placed in artificial saliva, and fluoride release was measured over 60 days using a fluoride electrode. After initial release measurement, specimens were soaked in 1000 ppm fluoride solution for 5 minutes, rinsed, and placed in new containers with distilled water before re-release measurements. Statistical Analysis: One-way ANOVA and Repeated Measures ANOVA tests were used to determine significance, with the Bonferroni posthoc test for further analysis. Results The fluoride release rate decreased gradually over time for all three groups. The highest fluoride release occurred on Day 1 for all three bonding agents, with a significantly reduced fluoride release by Day 2. Group A exhibited consistent and highest overall fluoride release throughout the 60 days. Group B gradually declined to release fluoride until Day 7, releasing the least fluoride throughout the study. Group C had a higher fluoride release on Day 1 and Day 2 but slowly declined until Day 14. Group B and Group C sharply declined fluoride release by Day 30 and almost negligible amounts on Day 60. All three agents noted enhanced fluoride release post-recharge, with continuous release until day 14. Greater release on days 7 and 14 compared to the initial release in all three groups. Conclusion Transbond Plus Color Change: Consistent high fluoride was released initially and post-recharge. Waldent Orthobond LC: Lower release throughout the study. Koden EZ Bond: High initial release and post-recharge but continuing to decrease until Day 14.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Memories are stored in a sparse population of neurons active at the time of an event, an engram ensemble, and reactivation of the engram ensemble drives memory recall. Although the amygdala is essential for fear memory encoding and recall, the precise spatial organization of engram neurons within amygdala nuclei remains an outstanding question. We hypothesized that the geometric architecture of an engram ensemble reflects its underlying function, thereby revealing novel organizational principles of memory coding. Using tissue clearing and light-sheet imaging, we mapped Arc-expressing neurons across the entire mouse amygdala in 3D to examine the spatial architecture of engram ensembles for aversive (shock) and valence-neutral (no shock) contextual memories during encoding and recall. At the meso-scale level, we identified distinct spatial “hotspots” of engram neuron density during that were differentially engaged during fear conditioning and fear memory retrieval across multiple amygdala nuclei. Notably, we also found shared spatial features during the retrieval of aversive and non-aversive contextual memories. At the micro-scale level, unsupervised clustering analyses showed that aversive learning and recall was associated with increased clustering of active neurons in the lateral (LA) and basal (BA) nuclei, and selectively in the central capsular nucleus (CeC) during aversive encoding. Network graphs derived from the spatial organization of active neurons revealed highly clustered and assortative local graph structures across conditions. Assortativity increased in the CeC during aversive learning, and hub nodes increased in the LA during aversive learning and recall, and in the CeC during aversive learning. Together, these results suggest that both meso- and micro-scale spatial signatures of neuronal activity differ across amygdala subregions and vary with memory valence and stage. Such structure may shape information flow through amygdala circuits, enhancing signal-to-noise and improving the fidelity of memory encoding and retrieval.</p>

                Background The development of social-cognitive skills is increasingly important in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) learning at the elementary school level. Immersive Metaverse Learning Environments (IMLEs) offer students the opportunity to learn in interactive virtual spaces, but research on their integration into STEAM learning remains limited, particularly in enhancing cognitive, social, and collaborative aspects. Purpose This study aims to test the effectiveness of using IMLE technology in improving social-cognitive skills in STEAM learning in elementary schools. Design/Methodology/Approach This study employed a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data were used to assess the effectiveness of IMLE in improving social-cognitive skills, while qualitative data explored student and teacher experiences through observations, interviews, and analysis of classroom learning activities. The study subjects included 50 elementary school students in Surabaya, Indonesia. Results The study findings showed significant improvements in students’ social-cognitive skills, including collaboration, problem-solving, empathy, communication, and learning motivation. Furthermore, the use of IMLE contributed to improved STEAM learning outcomes and enriched learning interactions. Originality/Value Research on the integration of IMLE into STEAM learning in elementary schools is still rare, both in Indonesia and globally. This study demonstrates that IMLE effectively supports the development of social-cognitive skills while encouraging innovation in immersive technology-based learning practices. These findings provide valuable contributions to teachers in adopting interactive, student-centered learning media.

                Background Enterobacter cloacae is considered an important hospital-acquired pathogen associated with bloodstream, respiratory, and wound infections. Its increasing ability to acquire multidrug-resistant (MDR) traits poses a serious challenge for both infection control and therapeutic management. This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial resistance profiles, prevalence of MDR, and associated clinical risk factors of E. cloacae isolated from hospitalized patients. Methods Four hundred clinical specimens such as blood, pus, and sputum were collected between July 2024 and July 2025 from hospitalized patients suspected to have a bacterial infection. Risk-factor data were obtained through medical record review. Manual and automated identification with antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using the BD Phoenix™ automated microbiology system. Results Most infected patients with E. cloacae were male (64%) and aged 60 years or older (56%). Significant risk factors associated with MDR E. cloacae infections included prior antibiotic exposure (p = 0.008), hospitalization longer than 10 days (p = 0.021), and ICU admission (p = 0.034). All isolates (100%) were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin–clavulanate, cefazolin, and cefuroxime. Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime 70%, cefepime 70%, ceftriaxone 64%), along with ciprofloxacin (44%), levofloxacin (44%), and tigecycline (50%), showed high resistance rates, indicating reduced activity of major antibiotic classes. Imipenem resistance was detected in 34% of isolates, while amikacin (10%), meropenem (10%), and ertapenem (10%) retained good activity. Ceftolozane–tazobactam remained fully effective (100% susceptibility). The overall prevalence of MDR was 86%. Conclusion A high prevalence of MDR E. cloacae was identified among hospitalized patients, with strong associations to ICU stay, prolonged hospitalization, and prior antibiotic use. Despite widespread resistance to β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, ceftolozane–tazobactam, amikacin, meropenem, and ertapenem remain effective therapeutic options. The findings emphasize the importance of strengthening local antimicrobial stewardship programs and establishing region-specific surveillance data to guide empirical treatment and support infection-prevention strategies.

                Background One of the disadvantages of the multilayer perception (MLP), which is a machine learning (ML) algorithm used in various fields, includes the uncontrollable growth of the number of total parameters, which may make MLP redundant in such high dimensions, and the uncontrollable growing stack of layers that ignores spatial information. Optimization algorithms were developed to determine the optimum number of parameters for MLP. Methods In this paper, the performances of the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are compared. The study also sought to determine the impact of sample size variations on these optimization algorithms. A dataset on the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with a sample size of 4 521 was used. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance the binary dependent variables for the training data across various sample sizes. Results Based on the classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F-score, and execution time, the MLP based on CMA-ES (CMA-ES-MLP) was identified as the best classifier overall, as it maintained high rates of these classification metrics and was the second fastest to train. CMA-ES-MLP with a training sample of 5 114 was our ideal classifier, and it competes well with the classifiers that have been built by previous studies that used the same dataset. Conclusions The study found no consistent increase or decrease in the classification performance of the algorithms as the sample size increased, and the metrics fluctuated rapidly across sample sizes. It is recommended that future studies be conducted to compare the best-performing classifiers identified in previous studies with the CMA-ES-MLP in this study under the same experimental conditions.

We evaluated the diagnostic utility of LDH and its correlation with clinical severity in ITP patients. Methods This prospective observational study included 62 patients diagnosed with primary or secondary ITP. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected, and serum LDH along with platelets were analyzed at recruitment. The diagnostic utility of serum LDH in distinguishing severe from non-severe ITP was evaluated. Results A total of 62 patients with ITP were studied, 64.5% had severe thrombocytopenia and 35.4% had non-severe thrombocytopenia. The median serum LDH level was significantly higher in severe ITP (276 [216–307]) compared to non-severe ITP (209 [184–275]), p=0.03. LDH showed a negative correlation with platelet count (ρ = -0.817, p = 0.01) and plateletcrit (p = -0.26, p = 0.03), while no correlation was observed with MPV. The cut-off value of LDH was 234U/L, with a specificity of 62.5% and sensitivity of 63.6%, respectively for diagnosing severe thrombocytopenia. Conclusion There was a significant elevation of serum LDH levels in patients with severe ITP compared to non-severe ITP.

                Background The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) provides a secure cloud-based environment where research and education communities can analyze genomic and biomedical data. The platform supports a wide range of data analysis as well as the ability to safely store and access data in compliance with NIH policies. The purpose of this study is to better understand the current user base of the AnVIL platform. Methods We conducted the AnVIL Community Poll to collect baseline information, identify development opportunities, guide the prioritization of user support strategies, and succinctly but comprehensively describe the current AnVIL Community. The poll was shared through social media and relevant mailing lists. Respondents were categorized as potential or returning users depending on their usage description. Results Our sample of the AnVIL community found opportunities for platform adoption beyond the current user base and identified areas where training should be enhanced, training preferences, and user computational needs. Specifically, while most respondents were involved in human genomics research, there may be potential for growth in adoption of the platform by prioritizing materials to support clinical researchers. All respondents felt availability of specific tools or datasets was a key feature of the platform. The broader community may also benefit from further development or showcasing of resources to facilitate cost management, finding and incorporating analysis tools, and data import. Our sample greatly preferred virtual training opportunities and returning users of the platform foresaw needing large amounts of storage. Conclusion This poll provided an insightful snapshot of the current state of the AnVIL and demonstrated areas where the AnVIL Team can take specific steps to address barriers related to platform adoption and further support the existing and varied AnVIL Community. This work can be built upon through user interviews, community discussion, and coordinating a recurring poll.

                Background A standby system is defined as a system consisting of several components, where only one component operates at a time while the others remain in standby mode. The system fails when the applied stress exceeds the strength of the active component, at which point one of the standby components is activated. It is assumed that the inactive components do not undergo any change in their properties while in standby mode, and the system is considered to have failed when all its components have failed. Methods In this study, a mathematical formula of the standby system was derived for more than one component. Y is subject to independent random variable Ψ with Distribution of stress, which is considered a combination of two exponentials and the stress. It follows the following distributions: one-parameter exponential, two-parameter exponential, one parameter Lindley, and two-parameter generalized exponential. Hence, the dependent functions of the standby system are found { R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) , R ( 4 ) , R 4 } depending on the mathematical formulas derived for each of the four distributions mentioned above. Results In this section, we will obtain the stress-strength of standby Reliability system R 4 , based on four different distributions the above mentioned, the standby Reliability functions R ( 2 ) for distributions are given by adding Marginal Reliability R ( 1 ) and R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) given by adding R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) and R ( 3 ) . Also R 4 given by adding R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) and R ( 4 ) , and parameters estimator by maximum likelihood. Conclusions a simulation study will be conducted to see the behavior of { R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) , R ( 4 ) , R 4 } of a standby system for four different distributions, in this simulation study will be conducted to see the estimator for all distributions and compare the results by using one important statistical criteria mean square error (MSE). Then results will be discussed to see which one of the estimators is the best for each one of the distributions separately.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78117?af=R">The Phenotypic Spectrum of Sporadic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob Disease Cortical Subtype</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of the rare sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cortical subtype (sCJDMM/MV2C) in a large multicentric autopsy cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated clinical histories, biofluid markers, brain diffusion-weighted (DW)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings in 56 patients. The histomolecular assessment included misfolded prion protein (PrP) typing by immunoblotting, histopathology, and PrP immunohistochemistry in several brain areas.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Misfolded PrP typing showed a dominant 19 kDa unglycosylated PrP fragment (type 2) in all brains, focally associated with a 21 kDa (type 1) fragment in 53% of participants (MM/MV2C + 1). Immunohistochemistry revealed coarse/perivacuolar PrP deposits in the neocortices and a patchy/coarse pattern in the cerebellar molecular layer. The mean disease duration was 16.0 months. At onset and early stages, most patients manifested only progressive cognitive decline, consistent with the predominant distribution and relative severity of spongiform change in the cerebral cortex. Brain DW-MRI showed cortical hyperintensities in 94% of cases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay was positive in 70% of cases. Compared with pure MM/MV2C, the mixed MM/MV2C + 1 phenotype showed a shorter disease duration (14 vs 19 months), and a higher frequency of striatal DW-MRI hyperintensity (56% vs 19%), EEG periodic sharp-waves complexes (41% vs 6%), and CSF RT-QuIC positivity (86% vs 53%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The clinicopathologic phenotype of sCJDMM/MV2C diverges from that of typical sCJDMM/MV1. Moreover, the histomolecular heterogeneity within MM/MV2C influences clinical features and results of diagnostic investigations, challenging its identification in vivo. Nonetheless, results suggest that DW-MRI and CSF RT-QuIC allow an accurate clinical diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in most patients. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

ELIXIR, as a pan-European bioinformatics research infrastructure, has strategically embraced e-learning methodologies to meet this challenge. This white paper systematically reviews the current landscape of e-learning initiatives across various ELIXIR Nodes and Communities, detailing both historical developments and contemporary practices. It identifies core attributes and desirable features of effective e-learning, presenting an analysis of diverse educational platforms and the deployment of Learning Management Systems (LMS) within ELIXIR’s framework. Emphasis is placed on the interactive, open-access, and sustainable nature of these resources, exemplified by platforms such as the Training e-Support System (TeSS) and the ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP). The paper highlights critical advancements toward standardization and interoperability through initiatives such as the adoption of SCORM protocols, facilitating resource reuse across Nodes. Additionally, the integration of e-learning into broader educational strategies—such as hybrid learning environments and structured learning paths—is examined. Finally, future directions are discussed, including strategies for integrating e-learning with traditional training methods, enhancing trainer expertise, and further expanding the availability and FAIRification of bioinformatics training resources.

                Abstract* Background Fresh produce is a vital vehicle for the transmission of foodborne pathogens, yet data from low- and middle-income countries on contamination levels and associated health risks remain scarce. Methods This study provided an analysis of Listeria species contamination in 208 fruit and vegetable samples from major geopolitical regions in Nigeria. Conventional microbiological techniques and molecular methods were used for the analysis. Results We reported a high prevalence (38.5%) and substantial bacterial loads (up to 8.33×102 CFU/25g) among the organically grown crops, with produce from Northern states exhibiting the highest contamination. Genetic characterisation revealed significant diversity, including novel strains and others closely related to global clones, confirming a resilient environmental presence. Importantly, antibiotic susceptibility testing uncovered alarming resistance rates to vancomycin (83.1%) and oxacillin (88.1%), with hierarchical clustering identifying distinct multidrug-resistant clusters. The presence of resistance genes (vanA, vanB, tetL, tetM) and the virulence gene hly was confirmed. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), incorporating this empirical data, estimated the annual probability of illness, highlighting high-risk produce-region combinations. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that fresh produce in Nigeria is a significant reservoir of pathogenic, antimicrobial-resistant L. monocytogenes, posing a serious public health threat. This study highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions, including enhanced agricultural water safety and strengthened surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, to mitigate risks and support evidence-based food safety policies in Nigeria and similar regions.

                Background introduction Corruption has emerged to the point where it is underreported but in reality, it haunts many people daily, especially in public offices. In South Africa the corruption take place in most government institutions, government administration at top level, middle and lower level of government. Corruption benefits the few and harm the majority of people living as lower income households. The economic literature has little evidence of the connection between corruption and poverty. Many studies have concentrated on the causal effect of poverty on corruption, not vice versa. Method This study extends the literature on corruption to investigate the impact of corruption on poverty from a South African perspective. Other control variables such as the Gini coefficient and unemployment were considered equally. Secondary data stretching from 2000 to 2021 were selected based on data availability it was then converted to quarterly data (poverty and corruption). The study used the quantile regression model, descriptive statistics table and data trends of the selected variables. Results The results of the quantile regression model indicate that corruption has a positive and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles (25th, 50th, and 75th). Moreover, income inequality has a positive, dominant, and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles, and unemployment equally causes poverty at all quantiles. This imply that socio-economic issues are a threat that exacerbate poverty in South Africa. Conclusion The study argues that policymakers should invest in youth development programs concerning entrepreneurship, education and support women cooperatives and small businesses to reduce the high dependency ratio of people on state services and to reduce high inequality and unemployment rates. The study was limited to investigate the causal effect that run from corruption to poverty only and not on the other way around.

                Background High-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) has gained interest as an adjunctive therapy in cancer care due to its pro-oxidative antioxidative and cytotoxic effects. Despite growing research, a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the efficacy and safety of HDIVC in advanced solid tumors remains limited. Materials and Methods This review will follow the six steps of the Arksey and O’Malley framework, as adapted by Levac et al, namely: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection eligibility, charting the data, collating, summarizing and reporting the results, and consultation. PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases will be used for the search of articles from 2000 – 2025. Grey literature will also be conducted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will be used as a guide for this scoping review protocol. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine the eligibility of articles with two independent reviewers. Discrepancies will be handled by consensus or by consulting an expert in cancer care. The selection of studies for the review is anticipated to be completed within 12 weeks, from 01 October to 31 December 2025. The extracted data will be analyzed and presented in a report. Conclusion This scoping review will consolidate evidence on HDIVC for advanced solid tumors, identifying efficacy outcomes, safety profiles, and patient experiences limited to African adult populations and other global studies applicable to African settings in African populations that will inform clinical practice and guide policy making. Ethics and Dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. However, the results of this search will be disseminated through academic presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

                Ethnomedicine and ethnobotany constitute key fields for understanding how different cultures document, use, and transmit knowledge related to medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications. In recent decades, growing scientific interest has highlighted their potential contributions to healthcare systems, biodiversity conservation, and the preservation of cultural heritage. However, the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into modern medicine faces persistent challenges, particularly the lack of standardized documentation protocols and rigorous scientific validation. In this context, the present systematic review aims to assess the documentation, evaluation, and conservation of medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications across diverse cultural settings. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, using Scopus, EBSCO, and Web of Science databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2007 and 2024. Seventy studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed thematically to identify trends, methodological approaches, and research gaps. The findings reveal a wide diversity of medicinal plants and ethnomedicinal practices, with a strong emphasis on the documentation and conservation of traditional knowledge. Nevertheless, significant gaps persist in terms of phytochemical, pharmacological, and clinical validation, as well as in the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into conservation and public health policies. The thematic analysis underscores the need for standardized methodological frameworks and multidisciplinary approaches to strengthen the scientific validation, conservation, and intergenerational transmission of ethnomedicinal knowledge, ensuring its relevance for modern medicine and sustainable development.

                Background The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among scuba divers in Saudi Arabia towards equipment infection control measures, protective guidelines measures and potential post COVID-19 infection complications. Methods A cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of 35 close-ended questions, which covered the scuba divers’ profile and experience, the KAP of COVID-19 precautionary measures during diving activities as well as the demographic data and background of the scuba divers. KAP scores were subjected to non-parametric tests of statistical significance (Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Most of the 461 participants’ answers were in agreeance on the proper KAP of infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude between all the demographic and professional variables (p<0.05) except for gender and region of residence (p>0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant practice difference among age groups, education levels, and employee status in the diving center (p<0.05). Conclusions Our findings showed that scuba divers presented a good level of KAP of infection control measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease. Local officials and diving organizations need to continue their efforts in combating and control the spread of this pandemic.

<p>(A) Macroscopic connectome gradients were constructed for AD patients. (B) Gradient metrics, including gradient eccentricity and network median distance, were computed. The association between gradient values and rich-club organization was also investigated. Ultimately, we observed that the compression of cortical hierarchies in AD patients impacts cognitive function, potentially serving as a neuroimaging biomarker.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This investigation centered on Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline. Functional connectome gradient analysis was utilized to investigate alterations in the hierarchical architecture of brain networks in AD. The study cohort consisted of 222 subjects, encompassing 111 AD patients and 111 normal controls (NC). Connectome gradients were computed via a dimensionality reduction technique based on diffusion map embedding and analyzed at both the region of interest (ROI) and network levels. Additional connectome gradient metrics, including network median distance and gradient eccentricity, were calculated, and the relationship between connectome gradients and rich-club organization was assessed. These connectome gradient values were subsequently correlated with clinical cognitive scores. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the principal gradient range in AD patients. At the network level, gradient values exhibited an increase in the somatomotor (SMN) and visual networks (VIS), while decreasing in the default mode (DMN) and frontoparietal networks (FPN) relative to controls. Analyzes of network mean distance and gradient eccentricity further revealed compression of the brain cortical hierarchy in AD patients. Furthermore, rich-club analyzes indicated a reduction in the gradient value difference between hub and peripheral nodes in AD patients. Finally, clinical correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the degree of cognitive impairment and the degree of compression of the brain cortical hierarchy. These findings provide a novel perspective on the study of brain network organization in AD patients, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109183">Cerebellar climbing fibers impact experience-dependent plasticity in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the cerebellum, climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals for supervised learning at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses. It has not been tested so far whether CF signaling may also influence plasticity in other brain areas. Here, we show that optogenetic CF activation suppresses potentiation of whisker responses in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex of awake mice that is observed after repeated whisker stimulation. Using two-photon imaging and chemogenetics, we find that CFs control plasticity by modulating SST- and VIP-positive interneurons in S1 cortex. Transsynaptic labeling identifies zona incerta (ZI) to thalamic posterior medial nucleus projections as a pathway for cerebellar output reaching S1 cortex. Chemogenetic inhibition of PV-positive neurons in the ZI prevents CF co-activation effects, identifying the ZI as a critical relay. Our findings demonstrate that CFs impact sensory signal processing and plasticity in S1 cortex and thus may convey instructive signals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98117">Human EEG and artificial neural networks reveal disentangled representations and processing timelines of object real-world size and depth in natural images</a></h4>

              
                Remarkably, human brains have the ability to accurately perceive and process the real-world size of objects, despite vast differences in distance and perspective. While previous studies have delved into this phenomenon, distinguishing the processing of real-world size from other visual properties, like depth, has been challenging. Using the THINGS EEG2 dataset with human EEG recordings and more ecologically valid naturalistic stimuli, our study combines human EEG and representational similarity analysis to disentangle neural representations of object real-world size from retinal size and perceived depth, leveraging recent datasets and modeling approaches to address challenges not fully resolved in previous work. We report a representational timeline of visual object processing: object real-world depth processed first, then retinal size, and finally, real-world size. Additionally, we input both these naturalistic images and object-only images without natural background into artificial neural networks. Consistent with the human EEG findings, we also successfully disentangled representation of object real-world size from retinal size and real-world depth in all three types of artificial neural networks (visual-only ResNet, visual-language CLIP, and language-only Word2Vec). Moreover, our multi-modal representational comparison framework across human EEG and artificial neural networks reveals real-world size as a stable and higher-level dimension in object space incorporating both visual and semantic information. Our research provides a temporally resolved characterization of how certain key object properties – such as object real-world size, depth, and retinal size – are represented in the brain, which offers further advances and insights into our understanding of object space and the construction of more brain-like visual models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105627">Afadin-deficient mouse retinas exhibit severe neuronal lamination defects but preserve visual functions</a></h4>

              
                Neural lamination is a common feature of the CNS, with several subcellular structures, such as adherens junctions (AJs), playing a role in this process. The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, in mice leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses. Our results indicate that retinas with severely altered morphology still retain some capacity to process light stimuli.

Here, we structurally and biochemically characterize the interaction of M3 with human collagens. High-resolution structures of the N-terminal M3 domain in the free state as well as bound to a collagen peptide derived from the Collagen Ligands Collection reveal a novel T-shaped protein fold that presents binding sites complementing the characteristic topology of collagen triple helices. The structure of the M3/collagen peptide complex explains how <i>emm</i>3 GAS and related streptococci, such as <i>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</i> subsp. <i>equisimilis</i>, can target collagens to enable colonization of various tissues. In line with this, we demonstrate that the M3/collagen interaction promotes enhanced biofilm formation of <i>emm</i>3 GAS in an <i>emm</i> type-specific manner, which can be inhibited with the recombinant N-terminal M3 domain. Further, <i>emm</i>3 GAS are shown to colocalize with collagen in tissue biopsies from patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, where GAS biofilms are common. This observation is reproduced in infected organotypic skin models. Together, these data provide detailed molecular insights into an important streptococcal virulence mechanism with implications for the understanding of invasive infections, strategies for treating biofilm and M-protein-based vaccine design.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98817">Cone bipolar cell synapses generate transient versus sustained signals in parallel ON pathways of the mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Parallel processing is a fundamental organizing principle in the nervous system and understanding how parallel neural circuits generate distinct outputs from common inputs is a key goal of neuroscience. In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feedforward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and two-photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha retinal ganglion cells (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (types 5i, 6, and 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate that feedforward bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Modern robots face a challenge shared by biological systems: how to learn and adaptively express multiple sensorimotor skills. A key aspect of this is developing an internal model of expected sensorimotor experiences to detect and react to unexpected events, guiding self-preserving behaviors. Associative skill memories (ASMs) address this by linking movement primitives to sensory feedback, but existing implementations rely on hard-coded libraries of individual skills. A key unresolved problem is how a single neural network can learn a repertoire of skills while enabling integrated fault detection and context-aware execution. Here we introduce neural associative skill memories (neural ASMs), a framework that uses self-supervised temporal predictive coding to integrate skill learning and expression using biologically plausible local learning rules. Unlike traditional ASMs, which require explicit skill selection, neural ASMs implicitly recognize and express skills through contextual inference, enabling fault detection using “predictive surprise” across the entire learned repertoire. Compared to recurrent neural networks trained using backpropagation through time, our model achieves comparable qualitative performance in skill memory expression while using local learning rules and predicts a biologically relevant speed-versus-accuracy trade-off. By integrating fault detection, reactive control, and skill expression into a single energy-based architecture, neural ASMs contribute to safer, self-preserving robotics and provide a computational lens to study biological sensorimotor learning.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This paper offers a road map for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests on enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents’ world models, a problem that falls under structure learning (also known as causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry, and model reduction in structure learning and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. We then outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov’s laws of robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing, or design new, aligned structure learning systems.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This simulation study shows how a set of working memory tasks can be acquired simultaneously through interaction between a stacked recurrent neural network (RNN) and multiple working memories. In these tasks, temporal patterns are provided, followed by linguistically specified task goals. Training is performed in a supervised manner by minimizing the free energy, and goal-directed tasks are performed using the active inference (AIF) framework. Our simulation results show that the best task performance is obtained when two working memory modules are used instead of one or none and when self-directed inner speech is incorporated during task execution. Detailed analysis indicates that a temporal hierarchy develops in the stacked RNN module under these optimal conditions. We argue that the model’s capacity for generalization across novel task configurations is supported by the structured interplay between working memory and the generation of self-directed language outputs during task execution. This interplay promotes internal representations that reflect task structure, which in turn support generalization by enabling a functional separation between content encoding and control dynamics within the memory architecture.</span>

                <p>by Veronika Petrova, Muqing Niu, Thomas S. Vierbuchen, Emily S. Wong</p>

Single-cell RNA-seq data from F1 hybrids provides a unique framework for dissecting complex regulatory phenomena, but allelic measurements are limited by technical noise due to low counts. Here, we present ASPEN, a statistical method for modeling allelic mean and variance in single-cell transcriptomic data from F1 hybrids. ASPEN combines a sensitive mapping pipeline and adaptive shrinkage to distinguish allelic imbalance and allelic variance in single cells. In both simulated and empirical datasets, ASPEN achieves a 30% increase in sensitivity over existing approaches for single cell allelic imbalance detection. Applied to mouse brain organoids and T cells, ASPEN identifies genes with incomplete X inactivation, stochastic monoallelic expression, and significant deviations in allelic variance. These results reveal reduced variance in essential pathways and increased variance at neurodevelopmental and immune genes.

                <p>by Fen Yan, ZhiHua Du, Yu-An Huang</p>

Developing computational methods for single-cell drug response prediction deepens our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and uncovers resistance mechanisms critical to improving cancer therapy. However, current approaches struggle to fully capture intratumoral heterogeneity, as bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) obscures heterogeneity across individual cells, while single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) remains constrained by limited throughput and high cost. Current approaches integrating bulk and scRNA-seq data frequently encounter batch effects, impairing robust knowledge transfer. Moreover, most existing methods overlook the role of intercellular interactions, treating cells as isolated entities. To overcome these limitations, we propose DAGFormer, a Graph-based Domain Adaptation framework that integrates bulk and scRNA-seq data for predicting single-cell drug responses. DAGFormer constructs cellular neighbor graphs using diverse topological strategies and employs Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) to bridge graph-level distribution gaps between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. A dual-domain decoder further disentangles shared and modality-specific representations, preserving both general and unique biological signals. Benchmarking DAGFormer on ten independent scRNA-seq datasets demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in cancer drug response prediction.

Organisations are challenged when meeting the computational requirements of large-scale bioinformatics analyses using their own resources. Cloud computing has democratised large-scale resources, and to reduce the barriers of working with large-scale compute, leading cloud vendors offer serverless computing, a low-maintenance and low-cost model that provides ample resources for highly scalable software applications. While serverless computing has broad use, its adoption in bioinformatics remains poor. Here, we demonstrate the most extensive use of high-performance serverless computing for bioinformatics by applying the available technologies to CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) design. Our adaptation of the established gRNA design tool, named Crackling, implements a novel, cloud-native and serverless-based, high-performance computing environment using technologies made available by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture, compatible with technologies from all leading cloud vendors, and the AWS implementation, contributes to an effort of reducing the barrier to large computational capacity in bioinformatics and for CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA design. Crackling Cloud can be deployed to any AWS account, and is freely available on GitHub under the BSD 3-clause license: https://github.com/bmds-lab/Crackling-AWS

Accurate simulation of the brain’s intrinsic dynamic activity is essential for understanding human cognition and behavior and developing personalized brain disease therapies. Traditional neurodynamics models depend on structural connectivity to explain the emergence of functional connectivity (FC). However, achieving high-fidelity simulations at the individual level remains challenging, as the models fail to fully capture the brain information. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stable Individualized Brain Computing Model (SI-BCM), a data-driven reverse engineering framework designed to infer spatiotemporal co-activity patterns from fMRI data for simulating whole-brain activity. This model captures the dynamic interactions between brain regions by integrating spatiotemporal dimensional information to extract a stable and shared connectivity pattern, representing the intrinsic functional collaboration pattern of the brain. This connectivity pattern is then used as the core connection weight in the dynamical system. Additionally, the model has a new cost function based on the Phase-Space Association matrix (PSA), enhancing its ability to capture brain activity dynamics. This combination enables the SI-BCM to improve simulation accuracy at the individual level compared to existing models, achieving a correlation coefficient between simulated and empirical FC of 0.87. The SI-BCM also showed enhanced robustness and reliability, and effectively captured brain properties. We found the model sensitively reflected changes in cognitive function, thereby providing valuable insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the application of SI-BCM in the brain modeling of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients substantiated the hypothesis that AD pathogenesis may be due to excessive neuronal excitation. This work establishes a new paradigm for brain network modeling by prioritizing the inference of stable dynamics features from activity data, providing a powerful tool for understanding brain function and pathophysiology.

The advent of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding marks a transformative era in large-scale biodiversity monitoring. However, the analysis of eDNA datasets is limited by incomplete reference databases and the increasing volume of data requiring processing from raw sequences to annotated taxonomic lists. To detect unexpected taxa in eDNA analysis, geographic priors are incorporated through expert post-analysis, which may introduce potential biases in assignments. Instead of relying on expert intervention, a combination of taxonomic and geographic co-occurrences could be directly integrated into machine learning to automatize and improve taxonomic annotation. Here, we introduce a deep learning approach to the taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences, which leverages a species reference database, species co-occurrence data, and a phylogeny to enhance annotation directly from raw sequences. The phylogeny provides the structure to the network’s embedding space in which DNA sequences are placed utilizing an artificial neural network (ANN). We train an additional ANN from the phylogenetic embedding and co-occurrence species data to learn coherent species combinations from the whole collection of eDNA sequences, as opposed to single sequences only. When applied directly to the raw sequences, this method correctly predicts unseen species (i.e., those not contained in the reference database), out of more than 31,000 possibilities, in about 24% of the tested cases by relying on phylogenetic embeddings and geographic modulation. The trained ANNs discern species relationships accurately from the raw data, which facilitates the process of associating sequences with taxa—even those absent from reference databases. When we use real eDNA samples, our predictions mostly agree with those from a traditional bioinformatic pipeline, highlighting the potential of our method for the annotation of the increasing number of eDNA sequences.

                <p>by Xiaoxin Guo, Gang Du, Juanyu Zhou, Fang Fu, Yu Yuan, Xingzhu Liu, Haiou Chen, Qianyi Wan, Bo Gong, Haiyang Chen</p>

Aging disrupts intestinal stem cell (ISC) lineage fidelity, impairing epithelial barrier function and then promoting systemic health decline. In this study, we identify peroxisomal dysfunction as a critical driver of age-associated ISC mis-differentiation. Using <i>Drosophila</i> and mouse colonic organoids, we demonstrate that reduced PEX5 expression in aged ISCs impairs peroxisomal matrix protein import, leading to very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) accumulation. In addition, we found that RAB7-dependent late endosome maturation and SOX21A were downstream of the peroxisome in controlling aged ISC differentiation. Aspirin, a classic anti-inflammatory drug, restores ISC lineage fidelity by enhancing PEX5-mediated peroxisomal β-oxidation of VLCFAs. Taken together, these findings highlight peroxisomal dysfunction and VLCFA metabolism as pivotal regulators of ISC aging and suggest new therapeutic strategies for combating age-related intestinal decline.

                Background Biogas production from different types of biodegradable waste is an alternative to fossil fuels for energy consumption and biodegradable waste management. Biogas is a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable energy source that provides a reliable method for handling food waste. Methods This study evaluated the effects of rumen fluid and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F as fermentation activators on biogas production from the co-digestion of cattle manure, fruit and vegetable residues, and cafeteria food waste at Debre Markos University in Ethiopia. Under mesophilic conditions, 12 treatments with different rumen fluid (0–150 ml/100 g) and S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F inoculum (5–10 ml/100 g) dosages were assessed. Biogas was produced from mixed waste using plastic digesters (0.6 L) at mesophilic temperature (30°C) after the 60-day retention period. Standard techniques were used to measure the physicochemical characteristics of the mixed waste, such as pH, total solids, volatile solids, organic carbon, and moisture. This study was conducted experimentally using factorial patterns and a completely randomized 6 × 2 design. The water displacement method was used to estimate the average amount of biogas generated by a 0.6 L digester. Result Rumen fluid with S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F increased biogas generation by more than four times compared to the uninoculated control. The combination of 100 ml rumen fluid and 10 ml S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F per 100 g of mixed waste produced the highest volume of biogas (6900.3 ml). pH monitoring revealed normal acidogenesis followed by a gradual return to methanogenic conditions, while combustibility tests showed the presence of methane in the biogas. Conclusion These results suggest that using rumen fluid and the S. cerevisiae isolate MUTJ0F as inoculants in a biogas digester can enhance methane production and biodegradation efficiency.
