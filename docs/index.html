                Background: Dengue virus (DENV) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) are two viral illnesses that require very distinct management protocols. Missed diagnosis and under reporting of DENV is predicted due to COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnancy is associated with increased fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality due to both illnesses. Co-infection need to be reported and studied to optimize the outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective study on pregnant patients with COVID-19 and DENV co-infection conducted from the medical records from 1st of April 2021 to 1st of September 2021. Results: In this series four patients are described. Patient 1 is a diagnosed patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura who was in remission. She developed DENV infection during recovery of SARS-CoV-2. She received intensive care unit (ICU) care during the leaking phase. Patient 2 had an uncomplicated miscarriage during the co-infection. Patient 3 was a patient with advanced maternal age with multiple co-morbidities. She did not progress into the leaking phase. Diagnosis of DENV was missed in patient 4 and she had a fetal death. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 and DENV co-infection in pregnancy can be life threatening to the mother and can lead to adverse fatal outcomes. Timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary management are essential for better outcomes. Continuous data collection and reporting is advisable till the guidance is formed.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stimulus presentation can enhance spiking irregularity across subcortical and cortical regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Saleh Fayaz, Mohammad Amin Fakharian, Ali Ghazizadeh</p>

Stimulus presentation is believed to quench neural response variability as measured by fano-factor (FF). However, the relative contributions of within-trial spike irregularity and trial-to-trial rate variability to FF fluctuations have remained elusive. Here, we introduce a principled approach for accurate estimation of spiking irregularity and rate variability in time for doubly stochastic point processes. Consistent with previous evidence, analysis showed stimulus-induced reduction in rate variability across multiple cortical and subcortical areas. However, unlike what was previously thought, spiking irregularity, was not constant in time but could be enhanced due to factors such as bursting abating the quench in the post-stimulus FF. Simulations confirmed plausibility of a time varying spiking irregularity arising from within and between pool correlations of excitatory and inhibitory neural inputs. By accurate parsing of neural variability, our approach reveals previously unnoticed changes in neural response variability and constrains candidate mechanisms that give rise to observed rate variability and spiking irregularity within brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">nAdder: A scale-space approach for the 3D analysis of neuronal traces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Minh Son Phan, Katherine Matho, Emmanuel Beaurepaire, Jean Livet, Anatole Chessel</p>

Tridimensional microscopy and algorithms for automated segmentation and tracing are revolutionizing neuroscience through the generation of growing libraries of neuron reconstructions. Innovative computational methods are needed to analyze these neuronal traces. In particular, means to characterize the geometric properties of traced neurites along their trajectory have been lacking. Here, we propose a local tridimensional (3D) scale metric derived from differential geometry, measuring for each point of a curve the characteristic length where it is fully 3D as opposed to being embedded in a 2D plane or 1D line. The larger this metric is and the more complex the local 3D loops and turns of the curve are. Available through the GeNePy3D open-source Python quantitative geometry library (https://genepy3d.gitlab.io), this approach termed nAdder offers new means of describing and comparing axonal and dendritic arbors. We validate this metric on simulated and real traces. By reanalysing a published zebrafish larva whole brain dataset, we show its ability to characterize different population of commissural axons, distinguish afferent connections to a target region and differentiate portions of axons and dendrites according to their behavior, shedding new light on the stereotypical nature of neurites’ local geometry.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ATRPred: A machine learning based tool for clinical decision making of anti-TNF treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bodhayan Prasad, Cathy McGeough, Amanda Eakin, Tan Ahmed, Dawn Small, Philip Gardiner, Adrian Pendleton, Gary Wright, Anthony J. Bjourson, David S. Gibson, Priyank Shukla</p>

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition, characterised by joint pain, damage and disability, which can be addressed in a high proportion of patients by timely use of targeted biologic treatments. However, the patients, non-responsive to the treatments often suffer from refractoriness of the disease, leading to poor quality of life. Additionally, the biologic treatments are expensive. We obtained plasma samples from N = 144 participants with RA, who were about to commence anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy. These samples were sent to Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden, where proximity extension assays of 4 panels, containing 92 proteins each, were performed. A total of n = 89 samples of patients passed the quality control. The preliminary analysis of plasma protein expression values suggested that the RA population could be divided into two distinct molecular sub-groups (endotypes). However, these broad groups did not predict response to anti-TNF treatment, but were significantly different in terms of gender and their disease activity. We then labelled these patients as responders (n = 60) and non-responders (n = 29) based on the change in disease activity score (DAS) after 6 months of anti-TNF treatment and applied machine learning (ML) with a rigorous 5-fold nested cross-validation scheme to filter 17 proteins that were significantly associated with the treatment response. We have developed a ML based classifier ATRPred (anti-TNF treatment response predictor), which can predict anti-TNF treatment response in RA patients with 81% accuracy, 75% sensitivity and 86% specificity. ATRPred may aid clinicians to direct anti-TNF therapy to patients most likely to receive benefit, thus save cost as well as prevent non-responsive patients from refractory consequences. ATRPred is implemented in R.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Critically ill COVID-19 patients with neutralizing autoantibodies against type I interferons have increased risk of herpesvirus disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Idoia Busnadiego, Irene A. Abela, Pascal M. Frey, Daniel A. Hofmaenner, Thomas C. Scheier, Reto A. Schuepbach, Philipp K. Buehler, Silvio D. Brugger, Benjamin G. Hale</p>

Autoantibodies neutralizing the antiviral action of type I interferons (IFNs) have been associated with predisposition to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we screened for such autoantibodies in 103 critically ill COVID-19 patients in a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) in Switzerland. Eleven patients (10.7%), but no healthy donors, had neutralizing anti-IFNα or anti-IFNα/anti-IFNω IgG in plasma/serum, but anti-IFN IgM or IgA was rare. One patient had nonneutralizing anti-IFNα IgG. Strikingly, all patients with plasma anti-IFNα IgG also had anti-IFNα IgG in tracheobronchial secretions, identifying these autoantibodies at anatomical sites relevant for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Longitudinal analyses revealed patient heterogeneity in terms of increasing, decreasing, or stable anti-IFN IgG levels throughout the length of hospitalization. Notably, presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies in this critically ill COVID-19 cohort appeared to predict herpesvirus disease (caused by herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1/-2) and/or cytomegalovirus (CMV)), which has been linked to worse clinical outcomes. Indeed, all 7 tested COVID-19 patients with anti-IFN IgG in our cohort (100%) suffered from one or more herpesviruses, and analysis revealed that these patients were more likely to experience CMV than COVID-19 patients without anti-IFN autoantibodies, even when adjusting for age, gender, and systemic steroid treatment (odds ratio (OR) 7.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 46.31, <i>p</i> = 0.036). As the IFN system deficiency caused by neutralizing anti-IFN autoantibodies likely directly and indirectly exacerbates the likelihood of latent herpesvirus reactivations in critically ill patients, early diagnosis of anti-IFN IgG could be rapidly used to inform risk-group stratification and treatment options.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Selfish centromeres and the wastefulness of human reproduction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laurence D. Hurst</p>

Many human embryos die in utero owing to an excess or deficit of chromosomes, a phenomenon known as aneuploidy; this is largely a consequence of nondisjunction during maternal meiosis I. Asymmetries of this division render it vulnerable to selfish centromeres that promote their own transmission, these being thought to somehow underpin aneuploidy. In this essay, I suggest that these vulnerabilities provide only half the solution to the enigma. In mammals, as in utero and postnatal provisioning is continuous, the costs of early death are mitigated. With such reproductive compensation, selection can favour a centromere <i>because</i> it induces lethal aneuploidy: if, when taken towards the polar body, it instead kills the embryo via aneuploidy, it gains. The model is consistent with the observation that reduced dosage of a murine drive suppressor induces aneuploidy and with the fact that high aneuploidy rates in vertebrates are seen exclusively in mammals. I propose further tests of this idea. The wastefulness of human reproduction may be a price we pay for nurturing our offspring.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neuron-specific ablation of the Krabbe disease gene galactosylceramidase in mice results in neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Conlan Kreher, Jacob Favret, Nadav I. Weinstock, Malabika Maulik, Xinying Hong, Michael H. Gelb, Lawrence Wrabetz, M. Laura Feltri, Daesung Shin</p>

Krabbe disease is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal galactosylceramidase (GALC) enzyme, which results in the accumulation of galactosylceramide (GalCer) and psychosine. In Krabbe disease, the brunt of demyelination and neurodegeneration is believed to result from the dysfunction of myelinating glia. Recent studies have shown that neuronal axons are both structurally and functionally compromised in Krabbe disease, even before demyelination, suggesting a possible neuron-autonomous role of GALC. Using a novel neuron-specific <i>Galc</i> knockout (CKO) model, we show that neuronal <i>Galc</i> deletion is sufficient to cause growth and motor coordination defects and inflammatory gliosis in mice. Furthermore, psychosine accumulates significantly in the nervous system of neuron-specific <i>Galc</i>-CKO. Confocal and electron microscopic analyses show profound neuro-axonal degeneration with a mild effect on myelin structure. Thus, we prove for the first time that neuronal GALC is essential to maintain and protect neuronal function independently of myelin and may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease.

                Background: Overall child health depends on nutrition and its related practices. At the family level, responsibility of child feeding lies with both parents. There is no uniform and systematic way to determine and assess the practices of fathers in infant and young child feeding (IYCF). Also, there is a paucity of evidence related to interventions for fathers in improving their practices and involvement in the feeding of their infant or young child (aged less than two years). Methods: This was a community-based randomized control trial, conducted among 120 fathers with infants and/or young children in Dakshina Kannada District of Karnataka. Fathers with poor level of involvement and practices towards IYCF, during the initial assessment, were included as the study participants. For the intervention, a module in the flipchart format was developed. Simple randomization technique was used to allot the participants into two groups - intervention and control. Participants in the intervention group received module intervention, in addition to the care which they received routinely, and the control group received only routine care. The participants in the intervention group were paid a monthly visit to implement the module, for six months. The post-intervention assessment was done at the end of 6 months. Results: A total of 117 participants provided post-intervention data. The mean age was 34.7 (+/- 5.48) years in the intervention group and 34.36 years (+/- 5.26) in the control group. The intervention group showed significantly higher improvement in knowledge, attitude, and practice components at 6 months (p<0.05), in both unadjusted and adjusted models. Conclusions: The extent of increase in practice and involvement in child feeding was clearly higher among the intervention group. The module developed was successful in improving the practices of fathers in feeding their infants and young children.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Behavioral and psychosocial predictors of depression in Bangladeshi medical students: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Depression, stress, and anxiety were found in a large number of medical undergraduate students, indicating a neglected aspect of their psychology that required immediate attention. The goal of this study was to find out the prevalence of depression among medical students, as well as potential psychosocial and behavioral predictors for depression.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study was conducted from July to November 2021 among 840 randomly selected medical students from four medical colleges using stratified random sampling. Data were collected using a semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire and were analyzed through the SPSS v.23 software. Multiple regression was performed to assess the effect of several behavioral and psychosocial factors on depression.   Results: Among the 840 study participants, 55.7% (n= 468) were female and 44.3% (n= 372) were male. According to the data, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, perceived stress among medical students was found to be 28.8%, 65% and 85% respectively. A strong link was found between depression and anxiety, stress, poor sleep quality, poor academic performance, and a negative social and romantic relationship status.   Conclusions: A significant number of medical students are depressed. In order to prevent and treat depression, medical students should be screened for depression and its associated factors.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by polysomnography-confirmed REM sleep without atonia and dream-enacting behaviors. This disorder is considered a prodromal syndrome of alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease (PD), where it affects more than 50% of PD patients. The underlying pathology of RBD has been generally understood to involve the pontine nuclei within the brainstem. However, the complete pathophysiology beyond the brainstem remains unclear as does its relationship with PD pathology. Therefore, this review aims to survey the neuroimaging literature involving PET, SPECT, and MR imaging techniques to provide an updated understanding of the neuro-chemical, structural, and functional changes in both RBD and PD patients comorbid with RBD. This review found neuroimaging evidence that indicate alterations to the dopaminergic and cholinergic system, blood perfusion, and glucose metabolism in both RBD patients and PD patients with RBD. Beyond the brainstem, structural and functional changes were found to involve the nigrostriatal system, limbic system, and the cortex—suggesting that RBD is a multi-systemic neurodegenerative process. Future investigations are encouraged to follow RBD patients longitudinally using multimodal imaging techniques to enhance our understanding of this parasomnia disorder. Uncovering which individuals are most likely to develop an alpha-synuclein disorder in the prodromal phase will improve patient outcomes and potentially aid in the development of novel treatments for patients affected by RBD.</p>

                Baimel et al. examine the afferent control of cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) in the nucleus accumbens medial shell (NAcMS). Inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus have opposing influence on ChI firing. vHPC-evoked inhibition reflects activation of parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons, which robustly inhibit ChIs in NAcMS.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Bacteriophage protein PEIP is a potent Bacillus subtilis enolase inhibitor</a></h4>

              
                Zhang and Li et al. show that bacteriophage SPO1 encodes a xenogeneic enolase inhibitor PEIP, which impedes host glycolysis and cell wall synthesis by disrupting the basic dimer unit of enolase. PEIP has a strong cross-species inhibitory effect on bacterial enolase and a much weaker effect on human ENO1.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">mTORC1 signaling in antigen-presenting cells of the skin restrains CD8+ T cell priming</a></h4>

              
                How mTORC1 regulates dendritic cell (DC) biology in vivo is unclear. Pelgrom et al. demonstrate that DC-specific mTORC1 deficiency potentiates immunization-induced CD8+ T cell responses. This is linked to alterations in DC metabolism and increased immunogenicity of an EpCAM+ cDC1 subpopulation. Thus, targeting mTORC1 may help to boost vaccination responses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Controlling SARS-CoV-2 in schools using repetitive testing strategies</a></h4>

              
                SARS-CoV-2 remains a worldwide emergency. While vaccines have been approved and are widely administered, there is an ongoing debate whether children should be vaccinated or prioritized for vaccination. Therefore, in order to mitigate the spread of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants among children, the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still warranted. We investigate the impact of different testing strategies on the SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in a primary school environment, using an individual-based modelling approach. Specifically, we consider three testing strategies: (1) <i>symptomatic isolation</i>, where we test symptomatic individuals and isolate them when they test positive, (2) <i>reactive screening</i>, where a class is screened once one symptomatic individual was identified, and (3) <i>repetitive screening</i>, where the school in its entirety is screened on regular time intervals. Through this analysis, we demonstrate that repetitive testing strategies can significantly reduce the attack rate in schools, contrary to a reactive screening or a symptomatic isolation approach. However, when a repetitive testing strategy is in place, more cases will be detected and class and school closures are more easily triggered, leading to a higher number of school days lost per child. While maintaining the epidemic under control with a repetitive testing strategy, we show that absenteeism can be reduced by relaxing class and school closure thresholds.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Developmental changes in story-evoked responses in the neocortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                How does the representation of naturalistic life events change with age? Here we analyzed fMRI data from 414 children and adolescents (5 - 19 years) as they watched a narrative movie. In addition to changes in the degree of inter-subject correlation (ISC) with age in sensory and medial parietal regions, we used a novel measure (between-group ISC) to reveal age-related shifts in the responses across the majority of the neocortex. Over the course of development, brain responses became more discretized into stable and coherent events and shifted earlier in time to anticipate upcoming perceived event transitions, measured behaviorally in an age-matched sample. However, hippocampal responses to event boundaries actually decreased with age, suggesting a shifting division of labor between episodic encoding processes and schematic event representations between the ages of 5 and 19.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Self-assembly of pericentriolar material in interphase cells lacking centrioles</a></h4>

              
                The major microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells, the centrosome, comprises a pair of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM), which nucleates and anchors microtubules. Centrosome assembly depends on PCM binding to centrioles, PCM self-association and dynein-mediated PCM transport, but the self-assembly properties of PCM components in interphase cells are poorly understood. Here, we used experiments and modeling to study centriole-independent features of interphase PCM assembly. We showed that when centrioles are lost due to PLK4 depletion or inhibition, dynein-based transport and self-clustering of PCM proteins are sufficient to form a single compact MTOC, which generates a dense radial microtubule array. Interphase self-assembly of PCM components depends on γ-tubulin, pericentrin, CDK5RAP2 and ninein, but not NEDD1, CEP152 or CEP192. Formation of a compact acentriolar MTOC is inhibited by AKAP450-dependent PCM recruitment to the Golgi or by randomly organized CAMSAP2-stabilized microtubules, which keep PCM mobile and prevent its coalescence. Linking of CAMSAP2 to a minus-end-directed motor leads to the formation of an MTOC, but MTOC compaction requires cooperation with pericentrin-containing self-clustering PCM. Our data reveal that interphase PCM contains a set of components that can self-assemble into a compact structure and organize microtubules, but PCM self-organization is sensitive to motor- and microtubule-based rearrangement.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell glycomics analysis by CyTOF-Lec reveals glycan features defining cells differentially susceptible to HIV</a></h4>

              
                High-parameter single-cell phenotyping has enabled in-depth classification and interrogation of immune cells, but to date has not allowed for glycan characterization. Here, we develop CyTOF-Lec as an approach to simultaneously characterize many protein and glycan features of human immune cells at the single-cell level. We implemented CyTOF-Lec to compare glycan features between different immune subsets from blood and multiple tissue compartments, and to characterize HIV-infected cell cultures. Using bioinformatics approaches to distinguish preferential infection of cellular subsets from viral-induced remodeling, we demonstrate that HIV upregulates the levels of cell-surface fucose and sialic acid in a cell-intrinsic manner, and that memory CD4+ T cells co-expressing high levels of fucose and sialic acid are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Sialic acid levels were found to distinguish memory CD4+ T cell subsets expressing different amounts of viral entry receptors, pro-survival factors, homing receptors, and activation markers, and to play a direct role in memory CD4+ T cells’ susceptibility to HIV infection. The ability of sialic acid to distinguish memory CD4+ T cells with different susceptibilities to HIV infection was experimentally validated through sorting experiments. Together, these results suggest that HIV remodels not only cellular proteins but also glycans, and that glycan expression can differentiate memory CD4+ T cells with vastly different susceptibility to HIV infection.

                <i>Trypanosoma congolense</i> causes a syndrome of variable severity in animals in Africa. Cerebral trypanosomiasis is a severe form, but the mechanism underlying this severity remains unknown. We developed a mouse model of acute cerebral trypanosomiasis and characterized the cellular, behavioral and physiological consequences of this infection. We show large parasite sequestration in the brain vasculature for long periods of time (up to 8 hours) and extensive neuropathology that associate with ICAM1-mediated recruitment and accumulation of T cells in the brain parenchyma. Antibody-mediated ICAM1 blocking and lymphocyte absence reduce parasite sequestration in the brain and prevent the onset of cerebral trypanosomiasis. Here, we establish a mouse model of acute cerebral trypanosomiasis and we propose a mechanism whereby parasite sequestration, host ICAM1, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells play a pivotal role.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reconstitution of kinetochore motility and microtubule dynamics reveals a role for a kinesin-8 in establishing end-on attachments</a></h4>

              
                During mitosis, individual microtubules make attachments to chromosomes via a specialized protein complex called the kinetochore to faithfully segregate the chromosomes to daughter cells. Translocation of kinetochores on the lateral surface of the microtubule has been proposed to contribute to high fidelity chromosome capture and alignment at the mitotic midzone, but has been difficult to observe in vivo because of spatial and temporal constraints. To overcome these barriers, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to track the interactions between microtubules, kinetochore proteins, and other microtubule-associated proteins in lysates from metaphase-arrested <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. TIRF microscopy and cryo-correlative light microscopy and electron tomography indicated that we successfully reconstituted interactions between intact kinetochores and microtubules. These kinetochores translocate on the lateral microtubule surface toward the microtubule plus end and transition to end-on attachment, whereupon microtubule depolymerization commences. The directional kinetochore movement is dependent on the highly processive kinesin-8, Kip3. We propose that Kip3 facilitates stable kinetochore attachment to microtubule plus ends through its abilities to move the kinetochore laterally on the surface of the microtubule and to regulate microtubule plus end dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genome-wide detection of imprinted differentially methylated regions using nanopore sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Imprinting is a critical part of normal embryonic development in mammals, controlled by defined parent-of-origin (PofO) differentially methylated regions (DMRs) known as imprinting control regions. Direct nanopore sequencing of DNA provides a means to detect allelic methylation and to overcome the drawbacks of methylation array and short-read technologies. Here, we used publicly available nanopore sequencing data for 12 standard B-lymphocyte cell lines to acquire the genome-wide mapping of imprinted intervals in humans. Using the sequencing data, we were able to phase 95% of the human methylome and detect 94% of the previously well-characterized, imprinted DMRs. In addition, we found 42 novel imprinted DMRs (16 germline and 26 somatic), which were confirmed using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. Analysis of WGBS data in mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>), rhesus monkey (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), and chimpanzee (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>) suggested that 17 of these imprinted DMRs are conserved. Some of the novel imprinted intervals are within or close to imprinted genes without a known DMR. We also detected subtle parental methylation bias, spanning several kilobases at seven known imprinted clusters. At these blocks, hypermethylation occurs at the gene body of expressed allele(s) with mutually exclusive H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 allelic histone marks. These results expand upon our current knowledge of imprinting and the potential of nanopore sequencing to identify imprinting regions using only parent-offspring trios, as opposed to the large multi-generational pedigrees that have previously been required.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural underpinnings of action adaptation in the subthalamic nucleus.</a></h4>

              
                Adapting our actions to changing goals and environments is central to intelligent behavior. There is substantial evidence that the basal ganglia play a crucial role in reinforcing actions that have led to favorable outcomes. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying action adaptation following unfavorable outcomes when change is warranted. Here, we recorded electrophysiological activity and applied bursts of electrical stimulation to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a core area of the basal ganglia, in patients with Parkinsons disease using deep brain stimulation electrodes. During a task where patients continuously had to adapt their force depending on changing action-value associations, decreases in STN beta (13-30 Hz) activity in two critical time windows were associated with poorer outcomes and stronger action adaptation. STN stimulation reduced beta activity and led to stronger action adaptation if applied within the time windows when STN activity reflected action evaluation and adaptation. These results suggest that dynamic modulation of STN activity facilitates adaptive behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A small molecule ligand for the novel pain target GPR171 produces minimal reward in mice</a></h4>

              
                ProSAAS is one of the most abundant proteins in the brain and is processed into several smaller peptides. One of which, BigLEN, is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor, GPR171. Recent work in rodent models has shown that a small-molecule ligand for GPR171, MS15203, increases morphine antinociception and is effective in lessening chronic pain. While these studies provide evidence for GPR171 as a possible pain target, its abuse liability has not yet been assessed which we evaluate in the current study. We first mapped the distribution of GPR171 and ProSAAS throughout the reward circuit of the brain using immunohistochemistry and showed that GPR171 and ProSAAS are localized in the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex. In the major dopaminergic structure, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), GPR171 appeared to be primarily localized in dopamine neurons while ProSAAS is outside of dopamine neurons. Next, MS15203 was administered to mice with or without morphine, and VTA slices were stained for the immediate early gene c-Fos as a marker of neuronal activation. Quantification of c-Fos-positive cells revealed no statistical difference between MS15203 and saline, suggesting that MS15203 does not increase VTA activation and dopamine release. Similarly, the results of a conditioned place preference experiment showed that treatment with MS15203 or MS15203 + Morphine produced no place preference compared to Saline indicating a lack of reward-related behavior. Taken together this data provides evidence that the novel pain therapeutic, MS15203, has minimal reward liability. Therefore, GPR171 deserves further exploration as a pain target.

                Neurological manifestations are common in COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Despite reports of SARS-CoV-2 detection in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of COVID-19 patients, it's still unclear whether the virus can infect the central nervous system, and which neuropathological alterations can be ascribed to viral tropism, rather than immune mediated mechanisms. Here, we assess neuropathology alterations in 24 COVID-19 patients and 18 matched controls who died due to pneumonia / respiratory failure. Aside from a wide spectrum of neuropathological alterations, SARS-CoV-2-immunoreactive neurons were detected in specific brainstem nuclei of 5 COVID-19 subjects. Viral RNA was also detected by real-time RT-PCR. Quantification of reactive microglia revealed an anatomically segregated pattern of inflammation within affected brainstem regions, and was higher when compared to controls. While the results of this study support the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, the role of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism in COVID-19 and its long-term sequelae require further investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Causal role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in modulating the balance between Pavlovian and instrumental systems in the punishment domain</a></h4>

              
                Previous literature suggests that a balance between Pavlovian and instrumental decision-making systems is critical for optimal decision-making. Pavlovian bias (i.e., approach toward reward-predictive stimuli and avoid punishment-predictive stimuli) often contrasts with the instrumental response. Although recent neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions that may be related to Pavlovian bias, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), it is unclear whether a causal relationship exists. Therefore, we investigated whether upregulation of the dlPFC using transcranial current direct stimulation (tDCS) would reduce Pavlovian bias. In this double-blind study, participants were assigned to the anodal or the sham group; they received stimulation over the right dlPFC for 3 successive days. On the last day, participants performed a reinforcement learning task known as the orthogonalized go/no-go task; this was used to assess each participants degree of Pavlovian bias in reward and punishment domains. We used computational modeling and hierarchical Bayesian analysis to estimate model parameters reflecting latent cognitive processes, including Pavlovian bias, go bias, and choice randomness. Several computational models were compared; the model with separate Pavlovian bias parameters for reward and punishment domains demonstrated the best model fit. When using a behavioral index of Pavlovian bias, the anodal group showed significantly lower Pavlovian bias in the punishment domain, but not in the reward domain, compared with the sham group. In addition, computational modeling showed that Pavlovian bias parameter in the punishment domain was lower in the anodal group than in the sham group, which is consistent with the behavioral findings. The anodal group also showed a lower go bias and choice randomness, compared with the sham group. These findings suggest that anodal tDCS may lead to behavioral suppression or change in Pavlovian bias in the punishment domain, which will help to improve comprehension of the causal neural mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The curse of optimism: a persistent distraction by novelty</a></h4>

              
                Human curiosity has been interpreted as a drive for exploration and modeled by intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning algorithms. An unresolved challenge in machine learning is that these algorithms are prone to distraction by reward-independent stochastic stimuli. We ask whether humans exhibit the same distraction pattern in their behavior as the algorithms. To answer this question, we design a multi-step decision-making paradigm containing an unknown number of states in a stochastic part of the environment, combined with a reward-manipulation that varies optimism of participants regarding the availability of rewards. We show that (i) participants exhibit a persistent distraction by novelty in the stochastic part; (ii) reward optimism increases this distraction; and (iii) the persistent distraction is consistent with the predictions of algorithms driven by novelty but not with 'optimal' algorithms driven by information-gain. Our results suggest that humans use sup-optimal but computationally cheap curiosity-driven policies for exploration in complex environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep alterations in a mouse model of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder showing progressive neuronal loss in several brain areas and a broad spectrum of motor and non-motor symptoms, including ataxia and altered sleep. While sleep disturbances are known to play pathophysiologic roles in other neurodegenerative disorders, their impact on SCA3 is unknown. Objectives: Using state-of-the art spectrographic measurements, we sought to quantitatively characterize sleep electroencephalography (EEG) in a SCA3 transgenic mouse model with confirmed disease phenotype. Methods: We first measured motor phenotypes in 18-31-week-old homozygous and hemizygous SCA3 YACMJD84.2 mice and non-transgenic wild-type littermate mice during lights-on and lights-off periods. We next implanted electrodes to obtain 12-hour (zeitgeber time 0-12) EEG recordings for three consecutive days when the mice were 26-36 weeks old. We then analyzed EEG-based sleep structure data to quantify differences between homozygous, hemizygous, and wild-type mice. Results: Compared to wild-type littermates, SCA3 homozygous mice display: i) increased duration of rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) and fragmentation in all sleep and wake states; ii) higher beta power oscillations during REM and non-REM (NREM); and iii) additional spectral power band alterations during REM and wake. Conclusions: Our data show that sleep architecture and EEG spectral power are dysregulated in homozygous SCA3 mice, indicating that common sleep-related etiologic factors may underlie mouse and human SCA3 phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic neuronal responses to probabilistic outcome-predicting stimuli follow a weighed, unsigned prediction error model and anticipate behavioral responses</a></h4>

              
                Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) play an important role in associative learning, suggesting that BFCNs may participate in processing sensory stimuli that predict future outcomes. However, little is known about how BFCNs respond to outcome-predictive sensory cues and the impact of outcome probabilities on BFCN responses has not been explored. Therefore, we performed bulk calcium imaging and recorded spiking output of identified cholinergic neurons from the basal forebrain of mice performing a probabilistic Pavlovian cued outcome task that allowed us to control the predictive strength of cue stimuli. BFCNs responded strongly to sensory cues predicting likely reward, while little response was observed for cues that were rarely paired with reward. Reward delivery led to the activation of BFCNs, with less expected rewards eliciting a stronger response, while air puff punishments also evoked positive-going responses from BFCNs. We propose that BFCNs differentially weigh predictions of positive and negative reinforcement, reflecting divergent relative salience of forecasting appetitive and aversive outcomes, in accordance with a simple reinforcement learning model of a weighed, unsigned prediction error. Finally, the extent of cholinergic activation after cue stimuli predicted subsequent decision speed, suggesting that the expectation-gated cholinergic firing is instructive to reward-seeking behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Manipulation of neuronal activity in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit affects intraneuronal amyloid-β levels</a></h4>

              
                One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimers disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) plaques, which is preceded by intraneuronal build-up of toxic, aggregated A{beta} during disease progression. A{beta} plaques are first deposited in the neocortex before appearing in the medial temporal lobe, and tau pathology with subsequent neurodegeneration in the latter anatomical region causes early memory impairments in patients. Current research suggests that early intraneuronal A{beta} build-up may begin in superficial layers of lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). To examine whether manipulation of neuronal activity of LEC layer II neurons affected intraneuronal A{beta} levels in LEC and in downstream perforant path terminals in the hippocampus (HPC), we used a chemogenetic approach to selectively and chronically silence superficial LEC neurons in young and aged 3xTg AD mice and monitored its effect on intraneuronal A{beta} levels in LEC and HPC. Chronic chemogenetic silencing of LEC neurons led to reduced early intraneuronal A{beta} in LEC and in projection terminals in the HPC, compared with controls. Early intraneuronal A{beta} levels in the downstream HPC correlated with activity levels in superficial layers of LEC, with the subiculum being the earliest subregion involved, and our findings give evidence to early AD neuropathology originating in select neuronal populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maternal immune activation alters social affective behavior and sensitivity to corticotropin releasing factor in male but not female rats</a></h4>

              
                Prenatal infection increases risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism in offspring. In the rodents, prenatal administration of the viral mimic Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) allows for investigation of developmental consequences of gestational sickness on offspring social behavior and neural circuit function. Because maternal immune activation (MIA) disrupts cortical development and sociability, we examined social decision-making in a rat social affective preference (SAP) task. Following Poly I:C (0.5 mg/kg) on gestational day 12.5, male adult offspring (PN 50) exhibited atypical social interactions with stressed conspecifics whereas female SAP behavior was unaffected by maternal Poly I:C. Social responses to stressed conspecifics depend upon the insular cortex where corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) modulates synaptic transmission and SAP behavior. We characterized insular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in adult offspring of MIA or control treated dams. Male MIA offspring showed decreased sensitivity to CRF (300 nM) while female MIA offspring showed greater sensitivity to CRF compared to sham offspring. These sex specific effects appear to be behaviorally relevant as CRF injected into the insula of male and female rats prior to social exploration testing had no effect in MIA male offspring but increased social interaction in female MIA offspring. We examined the cellular distribution of CRF receptor mRNA but found no effect of maternal Poly I:C in the insula. Together these experiments reveal sex specific effects of prenatal infection on offspring social decision making and identify insular CRF signaling as a novel neurobiological substrate for autism risk.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cerebral perfusion in post-stroke aphasia and its relation to residual language abilities</a></h4>

              
                Stroke alters blood flow to the brain resulting in tissue loss. However, the disruption of cerebral blood flow (perfusion) can also be observed in surrounding tissue as well as distal areas. These structurally preserved but sub-optimally perfused regions may contribute less to recovery; thus, to better understand aphasia recovery the relationship between cerebral perfusion and language needs to be systematically examined. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate 1) how stroke affects perfusion outside of lesioned areas in chronic post-stroke aphasia, and 2) how perfusion in specific cortical areas and perilesional tissue relates to language outcomes in aphasia. We analyzed perfusion data from 43 participants with chronic aphasia due to left hemisphere stroke and 25 age-matched healthy controls. We used anatomically defined regions of interest that covered the frontal, parietal, and temporal areas of the perisylvian cortex in both hemispheres, along with several control regions, not implicated in language processing. For the aphasia group we also looked at three bands of perilesional tissue around the lesion. We compared perfusion levels between the two groups and investigated the relationship with between perfusion levels and language subtest scores while controlling for age, gender, time post-onset, scanning site, lesion volume, and lesion site. First, we observed that perfusion levels were significantly reduced in frontal and parietal areas in the left hemisphere in aphasia compared to the control group, while no differences were observed for right hemisphere regions. Second, we found that perfusion in the left temporal lobe (and most strongly in the posterior part of both superior and middle temporal gyri) and inferior parietal areas (supramarginal gyrus) was significantly related to residual language abilities. In contrast, perfusion in the frontal regions did not show such a relationship; no relationship with language was also observed for perfusion levels in control areas and all right hemisphere regions. Levels of perilesional perfusion were only marginally related to language production abilities. Cumulatively, the current findings demonstrate that blood flow is reduced beyond the lesion site in chronic post-stroke aphasia and hypoperfused neural tissue in critical temporo-parietal language areas may not be fully able to support recovery. These results underscore the critical and general role that left hemisphere posterior temporal regions play in various expressive and receptive language abilities. Overall, the study shows that slowed or reduced blood distribution can affect the functionality of regions beyond the lesion site and have a direct impact on behavioral outcomes.

                The low reliability of the preclinical study's findings is of critical concern. The possible sources include poor experimental design and a lack of measures to reduce the risk of bias. In this study, we focused on anti-migraine drug discovery and a particular animal model with the aim to contribute to the elimination of these sources in future research. We performed a systematic search of controlled studies testing established migraine treatments in the model of trigeminovascular nociception (EMTVN) and meta-analysis for the main outcomes to estimate the overall effect sizes. In 13 studies reporting on 21 experiments, anti-migraine drugs significantly decreased trigeminovascular nociceptive traffic compared with a control intervention. Considering these effects biologically relevant, we used them in sample size calculation for future experiments. To refine the EMTVN and inform its users, we explored the impact of methodological features on the outcome and revealed several factors potentially impacting the results obtained in this model. We also assessed the internal validity of the included studies and found that the selection bias, particularly, the lack of randomisation, is likely a main source of bias. Based on our findings, we discuss the translational potential of the EMTVN and suggest what should be addressed for its improvement. We believe that this work highlights the importance of systematic reviews and meta-analyses as tools for design optimisation in animal research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Salient sounds distort time perception and production</a></h4>

              
                The auditory world is often cacophonous, with some sounds capturing attention and distracting us from our goals. Despite the universality of this experience, many questions remain about how and why sound captures attention, how rapidly behavior is disrupted, and how long this interference lasts. Here we use a novel measure of behavioral disruption to test two predictions made by models of auditory salience. First, models predict that goal-directed behavior is disrupted at points in time that feature a high degree of spectrotemporal change. We find that behavioral disruption is precisely time-locked to the onset of distracting sound events: participants tapping to a metronome speed up immediately after the onset of distractors. Moreover, this response is greater for more salient sounds (larger amplitude) and sound changes (greater pitch shift). Second, models predict that different auditory features are combined into an overarching salience map. We find that the time course of behavioral disruption is highly similar after acoustically disparate sound events, suggesting overlapping mechanisms of attentional capture: both sound onsets and pitch shifts of continuous background sounds speed responses at 750 ms, with these effects dying out by 1750 ms. These temporal distortions can be observed using only data from the first trial across participants. A potential mechanism underlying these results is that arousal increases after distracting sound events, leading to an expansion of time perception, and causing participants to misjudge when their next movement should begin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of hippocampal CaMKII in resilience to trauma-related psychopathology</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic stress exposure can form persistent trauma-related memories. However, only a minority of individuals develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms upon exposure. We employed a rat model of PTSD, which enables differentiating between exposed-affected and exposed-unaffected individuals. Two weeks after the end of exposure, animals were tested behaviorally, following an exposure to a trauma reminder, identifying them as trauma 'affected' or 'unaffected'. In light of the established role of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in stress and the essential role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in hippocampal based synaptic plasticity, in two separate experiments, we pharmacologically inhibited CaMKII or knocked-down CaMKII in the dorsal dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (dDG) following exposure to the same trauma paradigm. Both manipulations brought down the prevalence of 'affected' individuals in the trauma-exposed population. A day after the last behavioral test, long-term potentiation (LTP) was examined in the dDG as a measure of synaptic plasticity. Trauma exposure reduced the ability to induce LTP, whereas, contrary to expectation, CaMKII-kd reversed this effect. Further examination revealed that reducing CaMKII expression, enables the formation of CaMKII-independent LTP, which may enable increased resilience in the face of a traumatic experience. The current findings further emphasize the pivotal role dDG has in stress resilience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ontogeny of Vagal Sensory Cell Types and Trophic Factor Sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Vagal sensory neurons located in the nodose ganglion provide a direct line of communication from gut to the brain. Information such as stomach stretch or the presence of ingested nutrients in the intestine is conveyed by specialized cell types that express unique marker genes. Here we leverage these vagal cell type marker genes identified in adults to further understand when specialized vagal subtypes arise developmentally and the factors that shape their growth and target innervation. Initial sequencing and pathway analysis identified an enrichment of differentially expressed genes related to axon growth and guidance, synaptic strengthening, and expression changes downstream of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in samples from early postnatal nodose ganglia. Subsequent experiments using cultured nodose ganglion explants revealed that both BDNF and GDNF robustly stimulate neurite outgrowth from early postnatal nodose ganglion explants. Through anatomical examination of whole body trophic factor expression, BDNF was shown to be expressed by neurons of the nodose ganglion itself, while GDNF was expressed by the muscular layers of the developing intestine. These data suggest that BDNF may act to support vagal neurons as a locally derived trophic factor, while GDNF is more likely to act as a target derived trophic factor supporting vagal afferent neuron growth at distal innervation sites in the gut. Consistent with a role as a target derived neurotrophic factor, expression of the GDNF receptor, Gfra1, was enriched in vagal afferent cell types that project to the gastrointestinal tract. Lastly, vagal cell type markers were used to demonstrate that vagal cell type specification begins to emerge as early as E13 even as sensory neurons continue to grow to reach gastrointestinal targets. Expression patterns of individual cell type markers appear largely immature in prenatal life and mature considerably by the end of the first postnatal week. Together the data support a role for GDNF in supporting vagal sensory innervation of gastrointestinal targets and establish a prolonged timeline for vagal sensory cell type maturation.

                The laminae of the neocortex are fundamental processing layers of the mammalian brain. Notably, such laminae are believed to be relatively stereotyped across short spatial scales, such that shared laminae between nearby brain regions exhibit similar constituent cells. Here, we considered a potential exception to this rule by studying the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a brain region known for sharp cytoarchitectonic differences across its granular-dysgranular border. Using a variety of transcriptomics techniques, we identified, spatially mapped, and interpreted the excitatory cell-type landscape of the mouse RSC. In doing so, we surprisingly uncovered that RSC gene expression and cell types change sharply at the granular-dysgranular border. Additionally, supposedly homologous laminae between the RSC and neocortex are effectively wholly distinct in their cell-type composition. In collection, the RSC exhibits a variety of intrinsic cell-type specializations, and embodies a new neocortical organizational principle wherein cell-type identities vary sharply within and between brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Multivariate Comparison of EEG and fMRI to ECoG Using Visual Object Representations in Humans</a></h4>

              
                Today most neurocognitive studies in humans employ the non-invasive neuroimaging techniques fMRI and EEG. However, how the data provided by fMRI and EEG relate exactly to the underlying neural activity remains incompletely understood. Here, we pursued this open question by relating EEG and fMRI data at the level of neural population codes using multivariate pattern analysis. For this, we recorded EEG and fMRI data while participants viewed everyday objects in different viewing conditions, and then related the data to ECoG data recorded for the same stimulus set. The comparison of EEG and ECoG data showed that object category signals emerge swiftly in the visual system and can be detected by both EEG and ECoG at similar temporal delays after stimulus onset. The correlation between EEG and ECoG reduces and onset latencies increase when object representations tolerant to changes in scale and orientation are considered. The comparison of fMRI and ECoG overall revealed a tighter relationship in occipital than in temporal regions, related to differences in fMRI signal-to-noise ratio. Together, our results reveal a complex relationship between fMRI, EEG and ECoG signals at the level of population codes that critically depends on the time point after stimulus onset, the region investigated, and the visual contents used.

                Although it has been reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) can transdifferentiate into neural cells, the findings are considered unlikely. Cell changes induced by cytotoxicity and cell fusion events are alternative explanations for these observations in culture and transplantation studies, respectively. Here, we showed that BM-MSC neural transdifferentiation involves the formation of dedifferentiated cells which can then redifferentiate into neural-like cells, redifferentiate back to the mesenchymal fate or even repeatedly switch lineages without cell division. Furthermore, we have discovered that nuclei from dedifferentiated cells rapidly move within the cell, adopting different morphologies and even forming binucleated cells. We also noted that dedifferentiated cells position their nucleus at the front of the cell during migration. Our results demonstrated that BM-MSCs can rapidly transdifferentiate into neural-like cells and binucleated BM-MSCs can form with independence of any cell fusion events, suggesting that BM-MSC neural transdifferentiation is a fact, not an artifact.

                The purpose of this study was to pilot an anaesthetic regime with the potential to be used for blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) of the visual system. We used electrophysiology to explore the effect of an anaesthesia regime, combining dexmedetomidine and isoflurane, on the visual system of female Sprague-Dawley rats. This paradigm is hypothesised to affect neural signalling less than other paradigms, and thus may be suitable for studies using BOLD fMRI. Electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the visual cortex (VC) and superior colliculus (SC) of 16 rats. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and steady-state VEPs (SSVEPs) were recorded during 1 Hz and 14 Hz light stimulation, respectively. As a control experiment an exploration of the wash-out of isoflurane was performed. The combined anaesthetic regime showed, that the visually evoked responses were almost completely abolished at the initiation of anaesthesia, but gradually recovered to baseline levels over time in the SC. In contrast, the evoked response in the VC only partially recovered, staying significantly below baseline condition. BOLD fMRI results from a previously published study supports this finding.

                Evidence for sleep-dependent changes in micro-structural neuroplasticity remains scarce, despite the fact that it is a mandatory correlate of the reorganization of learning-related functional networks. We investigated the effects of post-training sleep on structural neuroplasticity markers measuring standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) mean diffusivity (MD) and the revised biophysical neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) free water fraction (FWF) and neurite density (NDI) parameters that enable disentangling whether MD changes result from modifications in neurites or in other cellular components (e.g., glial cells). Thirty-four healthy young adults were scanned using diffusion weighted imaging [DWI] on Day1 before and after 40-minutes route learning (navigation) in a virtual environment, then were sleep deprived (SD) or slept normally (RS) for the night. After recovery sleep for 2 nights, they were scanned again (Day4) before and after 40-minutes route learning (navigation) in an extended environment. Sleep-related microstructural changes were computed on DTI (MD) and NODDI (NDI and FWF) parameters in the cortical ribbon and subcortical hippocampal and striatal regions of interest (ROIs). Results disclosed navigation learning-related decreased DWI parameters in the cortical ribbon (MD, FWF) and subcortical (MD, FWF, NDI) areas. Post-learning sleep-related changes were found at Day4 in the extended learning session (pre- to post-relearning percentage changes), suggesting a rapid sleep-related remodelling of neurites and glial cells subtending learning and memory processes in basal ganglia and hippocampal structures.

                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a lifetime risk of 1:400, primarily affecting upper and lower motor neurons. Unfortunately, there are only two drugs approved to treat ALS, which increase patient survival only by a few months. This highlights the urgent need for developments of new ALS modifying therapies, which have been hampered by high failure rate of new drug candidates during clinical trials. Stem cell therapy is one of the promising approaches that is in development for treating ALS. The beneficial effects of stem cell therapy rely on their paracrine signaling, suggesting extracellular vesicles (EVs) as possible non-cell based therapy. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) contribute to reparative process. To better translate and assess therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs, we combined state of the art induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies to obtain patient-derived spinal low motor neurons and a comprehensive proteomic analysis to decipher the proteomic signature. To investigate the key molecular perturbations underlying disease pathology of ALS, a comprehensive proteomic analysis was performed showing mutation-specific and common ALS-specific changes. Mutation-specific effects in ALS motor neurons with hexanucleotide expansion in C9ORF72 exhibit dysregulation in proteins targeting to ER and cytoplasmic translation. In FUS-ALS motor neurons, iron ion homeostasis and cellular response to stress processes are affected. In ALS-TDP-43 motor neurons protein transport and localization are affected. Common ALS mechanisms such as mRNA splicing, proteasomal ubiquitin and mitochondrial associated processes are dysregulated. Furthermore, we demonstrated these underlying dysregulated mechanisms after treatment with MSC-EVs. More importantly, MSC-EV treatment can restore the protein expression levels impaired in ALS suggesting for future therapeutic potential for ALS.

                Tissue injury creates a delicate balance between latent pain sensitization (LS) and compensatory endogenous analgesia. Inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) interactions that oppose LS, including -opioid receptor (MOR) and neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor (Y1R) activity, persist in the spinal cord dorsal horn (DH) for months, even after the resolution of normal pain thresholds. Here, we demonstrate that following recovery from surgical incision, a potent endogenous analgesic synergy between MOR and Y1R activity persists within DH interneurons to reduce the intensity and duration of latent postoperative hyperalgesia and ongoing pain. Failure of such endogenous GPCR signaling to maintain LS in remission may underlie the transition from acute to chronic pain states.

                The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) is a key subcortical structure that is important in arousal, cognition, brain network modulation, and has been explored as a deep brain stimulation target. It has also been implicated in several disease states, including Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Given the small size of NBM and variability between patients, NBM is difficult to study; thus, accurate, patient-specific segmentation is needed. We investigated whether a deep learning network could produce accurate, patient-specific segmentations of NBM on commonly utilized 3T MRI. It is difficult to accurately segment NBM on 3T MRI, with 7T being preferred. Paired 3T and 7T MRI datasets of 21 healthy subjects were obtained, with 6 completely withheld for testing. NBM was expertly segmented on 7T MRI, providing accurate labels for the paired 3T MRI. An external dataset of 14 patients with TLE was used to test the model on brains with neurological disorders. A 3D-Unet convolutional neural network was constructed, and a 5-fold cross-validation was performed. The model was evaluated on healthy subjects using the held-out test dataset and the external dataset of TLE patients. The model demonstrated significantly improved dice coefficient over the standard probabilistic atlas for both healthy subjects (0.68MEAN{+/-}0.08SD vs. 0.47{+/-}0.06, p=0.0089, t-test) and TLE patients (0.63{+/-}0.08 vs. 0.38{+/-}0.19, p=0.0001). Additionally, the centroid distance was significantly decreased when using the model in patients with TLE (1.22{+/-}0.33mm, 3.25{+/-}2.57mm, p=0.0110). We developed the first model, to our knowledge, for automatic and accurate patient-specific segmentation of the NBM.

                When a muscle is stretched it not only responds with a reflex, but the sensory afferent feedback also depolarizes many afferents throughout the spinal cord (termed primary afferent depolarization, PAD), readying the whole limb for further disturbances. This sensory-evoked PAD is thought to be caused by a trisynaptic circuit, where sensory input activates first order excitatory neurons that activate GABAergic neurons that in turn activate GABAA receptors on afferents to cause PAD, though the identity of these first order neurons is unclear. Here we show that these first order neurons are propriospinal V3 neurons, since they receive extensive sensory input and in turn innervate GABAergic neurons that cause PAD, because optogenetic activation or inhibition of V3 neurons in mice mimics or inhibits sensory-evoked PAD, respectively. Furthermore, persistent inward sodium currents (Na PICs) intrinsic to V3 neurons enable them to respond to transient inputs with long-lasting responses, explaining the long time-course of PAD. Also, local optogenetic activation of V3 neurons at one segment causes PAD in other segments, due to the long propriospinal tracts of these neurons, explaining the widespread radiation of PAD across the spinal cord. This in turn facilitates monosynaptic reflex transmission to motoneurons across the spinal cord. Additionally, we find that V3 neurons directly innervate proprioceptive afferents, causing a glutamate receptor mediated PAD (glutamate PAD). Finally, we show that increasing the spinal cord excitability with either GABAA receptor blockers or chronic spinal cord injury causes an increase in the glutamate PAD, perhaps contributing to spasms after SCI. Overall, we show the V3 neuron has a prominent role in modulating sensory transmission, in addition to its previously described role in locomotion.

Imaging physically sectioned nervous tissues using electron microscopy (EM) has been the only method to acquire such information. However, EM is inefficient for imaging and reconstructing large neural networks due to the low throughput and inability to target neural circuits of interest by labeling specific neuron populations genetically. Here, we present a method to image large nervous tissues from the cellular to synaptic level with high throughput using tiling light sheet microscopy combined with tissue clearing and tissue expansion techniques. We describe the method, demonstrate its capability and explore its utility for decoding large biological neural networks by studying the spinal cord locomotor neural network in genetically labeled fluorescent mice. We show our method could advance the decoding of large neural networks significantly.

                The modulation of instrumental action by conditioned Pavlovian cues is hypothesized to play a role in the emergence and maintenance of maladaptive behavior. The Pavlovian-to- instrumental transfer (PIT) task is designed to examine the magnitude of the influence of cues on behavior and we aim to manipulate the motivational value of Pavlovian cues to reduce their effect on instrumental responding. To this end, we utilized a joystick-based modification of approach and avoidance propensities that has shown success in clinical populations. In 35 healthy subjects, we examined changes in PIT after completion of either avoidance training or sham training. We found no effect of training on approach avoidance propensities but higher response rate towards negative stimuli during PIT after systematic avoidance training compared to sham training. On the other hand, we saw an increased PIT effect after sham training. These results imply that training can alter the strength of the influence of cues on instrumental behavior and suggest training to be beneficial in reducing environmental triggers of maladaptive behavior.

                Vascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The relation between vascular dysfunction and the characteristic neuropathological amyloid-{beta} plaques in AD is however unclear. The limited resolution of in vivo imaging techniques, the intricate 3D structure of the microvasculature and the different co-occurring types of amyloid-{beta} accumulation in patients hamper studying this relation in patients. Here, we therefore employed the APP/PS1 mouse model, which develops parenchymal amyloid-{beta} plaques, to study the effect of parenchymal amyloid-{beta} plaques on the structure and function of the vasculature. Blood vessels and amyloid-{beta} plaques were fluorescently labeled in vivo with lectin-DyLight594 and methoxy XO4, respectively, in APP/PS1 mice at old age. The brain tissue was cleared post-mortem with the CUBIC clearing protocol, which allowed structural imaging at microscopic resolution of the vessels and plaques in a large 3D volume. Segmentation of the vasculature enabled mapping of the microvascular Cerebral Blood Volume (mCBV), which ranged from 2 % to 5 % in the white matter and the thalamus, respectively. No mCBV differences were observed between APP/PS1 mice and wild type (WT) control mice. The effect of the amyloid-{beta} plaques on vascular function was studied in vivo by measuring Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and Arterial Transit Time (ATT) with Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL)-MRI. Similar to the mCBV findings, no differences were observed in CBF or ATT between APP/PS1 and control mice, indicating that brain vascular morphology and function in this mouse model are preserved in the presence of amyloid-{beta} plaques.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perception is Rich and Probabilistic</a></h4>

              
                When we see a stimulus, e.g. a star-shaped object, our intuition is that we should perceive a single, coherent percept (even if it is inaccurate). But the neural processes that support perception are complex and probabilistic. Simple lines cause orientation-selective neurons across a population to fire in a probabilistic-like manner. Does probabilistic neural firing lead to non-probabilistic perception, or are the representations behind perception richer and more complex than intuition would suggest? To test this, we briefly presented a complex shape and had participants report the correct shape from a set of options. Rather than reporting a single value, we used a paradigm designed to encourage to directly report a representation over shape space; participants placed a series of Gaussian bets. We found that participants could report more than point-estimates of shape. The spread of responses was correlated with accuracy, suggesting that participants can convey a notion of relative imprecision. Critically, as participants placed more bets, the mean of responses show increased precision. The later bets were systematically biased towards the target rather than haphazardly placed around bet 1. These findings strongly indicate that participants were aware of more than just a point-estimate; Perceptual representations are rich and likely probabilistic.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adapting to visuomotor rotations in stepped increments increases implicit motor learning</a></h4>

              
                Human motor adaptation relies on both explicit conscious strategies and implicit unconscious updating of internal models to correct motor errors. Implicit adaptation is powerful, requiring less preparation time before executing adapted movements, but recent work suggests it is limited to some absolute magnitude regardless of the size of a visuomotor perturbation when the perturbation is introduced abruptly. It is commonly assumed that gradually introducing a perturbation should lead to improved implicit learning beyond this limit, but outcomes are conflicting. We tested whether introducing a perturbation in two distinct gradual methods can overcome the apparent limit and explain past conflicting findings. We found that gradually introducing a perturbation in a stepped manner, where participants were given time to adapt to each partial step before being introduced to a larger partial step, led to ~80% higher implicit aftereffects of learning, but introducing it in a ramped manner, where participants adapted larger rotations on each subsequent reach, did not. Our results clearly show that gradual introduction of a perturbation can lead to substantially larger implicit adaptation, as well as identify the type of introduction that is necessary to do so.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HLA-II-dependent neuroimmune changes in Group A Streptococcal Necrotizing Fasciitis</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) bacteria cause a spectrum of human diseases ranging from self-limiting pharyngitis and mild uncomplicated skin infections (impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis) to highly morbid and rapidly invasive life-threatening infections such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis (NF). HLA-Class II allelic polymorphisms are linked with differential outcomes and severity of GAS infections. The dysregulated immune response and peripheral cytokine storm elicited due to invasive GAS infections increase the risk for toxic shock and multiple organ failure in genetically susceptible individuals. We hypothesized that while the host immune mediators regulate the immune responses against peripheral GAS infections, these interactions may simultaneously trigger neuropathology and, in some cases, induce persistent alterations in the glial phenotypes. Here we studied the consequences of peripheral GAS skin infection on the brain in an HLA-II transgenic mouse model of GAS NF with and without treatment with an antibiotic, clindamycin (CLN). Methods: Mice expressing the human HLA-II DR3 (DR3) or the HLA-II DR4 (DR4) allele were divided into three groups: i) uninfected controls, ii) subcutaneously infected with a clinical GAS strain isolated from a patient with GAS NF, and iii) GAS infected with CLN treatment (10mg/kg/5 days, intraperitoneal). The groups were monitored for 15 days post-infection. Skin GAS burden and lesion area, splenic and hippocampal mRNA levels of inflammatory markers, and immunohistochemical changes in hippocampal GFAP and Iba-1 immunoreactivity were assessed. Results: Skin GAS burden and hippocampal mRNA levels of inflammatory markers S100A8/A9, IL-1{beta}, IL-33, inflammasome-related caspase-1 (Casp1), and NLRP6 were elevated in infected DR3 but not DR4 mice. The levels of these markers were significantly reduced following CLN treatment in DR3 mice. Although GAS was not detectable in the brain, astrocyte and microglia activation were evident from increased GFAP and Iba-1 mRNA levels respectively, in DR3 and DR4 mice. However, CLN treatment significantly reduced GFAP immunoreactivity in DR3 mice and not DR4 mice. Conclusion: Our data suggest a skin-brain axis during GAS NF demonstrating that peripherally induced pathological conditions regulate neuroimmune and gliotic events, and CLN may attenuate peripheral infection and subsequent neuroimmune changes in an HLA-II-dependent manner.

	<p>Migraine is a common clinical primary headache with unclear aetiology. In recent years, studies have shown that migraine is related to right-to-left shunts (RLS), and some patients with migraine have white matter lesions. However, the relationship among the three is unclear. To explore the characteristics of white matter lesions (WMLs) in migraine patients with right-to-left shunts and to predict the presence of right-to-left shunts through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics in patients with migraine, we conducted a retrospective study. We enrolled 214 patients who were diagnosed with migraines in an outpatient clinic from January 2019 to December 2021. All of them had completed contrast transcranial Doppler ultrasound (cTCD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Through the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 201 patients were finally included. The patients were grouped according to the presence of WMLs and were compared by age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, RLS, and other characteristic data. We observed the MRI fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequence (FLAIR) image and compared the differences in WMLs between the RLS-positive group and the RLS-negative group. There were 71 cases and 130 cases of migraine with and without WMLs, respectively. A statistically significant difference in near-cortical WMLs with RLS in migraine patients was observed (p = 0.007). Logistic regression analysis was adjusted by age, sex, duration of migraine, and severity. Migraine with aura and family history identified the RLS status as the sole determinant for the presence of near-cortical WMLs (OR = 2.69; 95%CI 1.386&amp;amp;ndash;5.219; p = 0.003). Near-cortical white matter lesions in migraine patients are related to RLS, especially in the blood supply area of the anterior cerebral artery. This small demyelination of the near-cortical WMLs may be a potential marker for the right-to-left shunt of the heart. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography may help finding more RLS in migraineurs with near-cortical WMLs.</p>

	<p>Accumulated studies have determined the changes in functional connectivity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and spurred the application of machine learning for classifying ASD. Graph Neural Network provides a new method for network analysis in brain disorders to identify the underlying network features associated with functional deficits. Here, we proposed an improved model of Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) that implements the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test to learn the graph features while taking into account the importance of each node in the classification to improve the interpretability of the algorithm. We applied the proposed method on multisite datasets of resting-state functional connectome from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) after stringent quality control. The proposed method outperformed other commonly used classification methods on five different evaluation metrics. We also identified salient ROIs in visual and frontoparietal control networks, which could provide potential neuroimaging biomarkers for ASD identification.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase serves as an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that is involved in reproductive regulation, learning, sensory processing, and other forms of neural plasticity. Here, we map the distribution of <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells in the brain and retina of the cichlid fish <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> using in situ hybridization. In the brain, <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells are found from the olfactory bulbs to the hindbrain, including within specific nuclei involved in decision-making, sensory processing, neuroendocrine regulation, and the expression of social behaviors. In the retina, <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells are found in the inner nuclear layer, presumably in amacrine cells. We also used quantitative PCR to test for differences in <i>nnos</i> expression within the eye and olfactory bulbs of males and females of different reproductive states and social statuses. In the eye, males express more <i>nnos</i> than females, and socially dominant males express more <i>nnos</i> than subordinate males, but expression did not differ among female reproductive states. In the olfactory bulbs, dominant males had greater <i>nnos</i> expression than subordinate males. These results suggest a status-specific function for NO signaling in the visual and olfactory systems that may be important for sensory perception related to mating or territorial interactions to maintain the social hierarchy. The widespread distribution of <i>nnos</i>-expressing cells throughout the cichlid brain is similar to that in other teleosts, with some conserved localization patterns across vertebrates, suggesting diverse functions for this important neurotransmitter system.</p>

                Sufficiency measures are potentially decisive for the decarbonisation of energy systems but rarely considered in energy policy and modelling. Just as efficiency and renewable energies, the diffusion of demand-side solutions to climate change also relies on policy-making. Our extensive literature review of European and national sufficiency policies fills a gap in existing databases. We present almost 300 policy instruments clustered into relevant categories and publish them as "Energy Sufficiency Policy Database". This paper provides a description of the data clustering, the set-up of the database and an analysis of the policy instruments. A key insight is that sufficiency policy includes much more than bans of products or information tools leaving the responsibility to individuals. It is a comprehensive instrument mix of all policy types, not only enabling sufficiency action, but also reducing currently existing barriers. A policy database can serve as a good starting point for policy recommendations and modelling, further research is needed on barriers and demand-reduction potentials of sufficiency policy instruments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Robustness of the aging effect of smiling against vertical facial orientation [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Previous studies have shown that the association between smiling and youth is a misconception; smiling faces have been estimated to be older than neutral faces. Previous studies have indicated that this aging effect of smiling (AES) is due to eye wrinkles caused by the facial action of smiling. However, whether holistic processing for facial expressions is involved in AES has not been investigated. The present study aimed to clarify these issues. Methods: Participants were recruited to participate in an online experiment that had a 3 (facial expression: smiling/neutral/surprised) × 2 (facial orientation: upright/inverted) mixed design. Participants were presented with an upright or inverted face for each expression (neutral, smiling, and surprised) and were asked to estimate the individual’s age. Results: In total, 104 participants were included in the analysis. The results show that smiling faces were estimated to be older than neutral faces, whereas there was no significant difference between upright and inverted faces. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AES is not dependent on holistic processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Temporomandibular joint disorders prevalence and awareness of appropriate clinical practices, among Al-Madinah community: A prospective cross sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Painful temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) are of musculoskeletal origin and are considered the most common cause of non-odontogenic pain in the orofacial region.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and awareness of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders in Almadinah Almunawwarah community. Methods: A prospective observational cross-sectional study with convenience sampling was conducted. A translated Arabic version of Fonseca's questionnaire was employed. The questionnaire asked about the participant's personal information, if they thought they had TMDs, and who to visit for therapy if necessary. These were followed by 10 items from Fonseca's questionnaire, each with a three-point scale. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 598 people. Females made up 57.1% of the participants. TMDs were present in 61% of the population, with varying degrees of severity. Males (44.3%) were less affected than females (55.7%). The difference, however, was not statistically significant (P = 0.354). Out of the 61% TMDs Positive patients, 74.1% had mild TMDs symptoms, while 20.8% and 5.1%, respectively, had moderate and severe TMDs symptoms (P = 0.05). The severity of the symptoms was unaffected by demographic data (P > 0.05). Only 40% seek care, with 64.6% selecting for a dentist and 24.6% preferring for an orthopaedic specialist (P= 0.008). Conclusions: Participants from Al-Madinah had a greater prevalence of mild TMDs. The majority of the participants had no idea who to go to for treatment. The findings of this study highlight the importance of educational activities to enhance public awareness

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between dermatoglyphic patterns and growth patterns of subjects with skeletal class I relation: A cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To assess the relationship between dermatoglyphic patterns and various growth patterns of the mandible. Methods: Patients with Class I Skeletal relation were selected after clinical diagnosis followed by digitally tracing the cephalogram. The patients were subdivided into three groups of mandibular divergence patterns ie Average, Horizontal and Vertical. 90 samples ie 30 in each group were selected for the study. The fingerprints of all the selected subjects were then extracted digitally and analysed for the most dominant pattern in each hand. Results: For the left hand, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) association between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern when Horizontal growers were compared to Average and Vertical Growers. For the right hand, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) association between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern when Horizontal growers were compared to Average Growers. A significant association (P<0.05) between fingerprint pattern and growth pattern was also found when average growers were compared to vertical growers. Conclusions: Horizontal growers had 80% frequency of appearance of whorls in their left hand and 67% in their right hand. Horizontal growers could easily be differentiated from the average and vertical growers because of the dominance of whorl pattern in their hands. Composite and arch pattern were more frequent in vertical growers when compared to horizontal and average growers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evidence for yeast artificial synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 genomic sequences [version 5; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should also be considered.    Results: Here we show that the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 significantly diverge from other SARS-like coronaviruses through short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for host cell invasion, virus replication, and host immune response. For SARS-CoV-1, we identify two sites: one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain; for SARS-CoV-2, one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other toward the end of the spike gene past its domain junction. At this junction, we detect a highly specific stretch of yeast origin covering the critical furin cleavage site insert PRRA, which has not been seen in other lineage b betacoronaviruses. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose an artificial synthesis model for viral constructs in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential yeast sequence patterns congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support yeast artificial synthesis. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that the genomes of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 contain sequence information that points to their artificial synthesis in genetically modified yeast cells. Our data specifically allow the identification of the yeast S. cerevisiae as a potential recombination donor for the critical furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Neural crest cell-placodal neuron interactions are mediated by Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin during early chick trigeminal ganglion assembly [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Arising at distinct positions in the head, the cranial ganglia are crucial for integrating various sensory inputs. The largest of these ganglia is the trigeminal ganglion, which relays pain, touch and temperature information through its three primary nerve branches to the central nervous system. The trigeminal ganglion and its nerves are composed of derivatives of two critical embryonic cell types, neural crest cells and placode cells, that migrate from different anatomical locations, coalesce together, and differentiate to form trigeminal sensory neurons and supporting glia. While the dual cellular origin of the trigeminal ganglion has been known for over 60 years, molecules expressed by neural crest cells and placode cells that regulate initial ganglion assembly remain obscure. Prior studies revealed the importance of cell surface cadherin proteins during early trigeminal gangliogenesis, with Cadherin-7 and neural cadherin (N-cadherin) expressed in neural crest cells and placode cells, respectively. Although cadherins typically interact in a homophilic (i.e., like) fashion, the presence of different cadherins on these intermingling cell populations raises the question as to whether heterophilic cadherin interactions may also be occurring during initial trigeminal ganglion formation, which was the aim of this study. Methods: To assess potential interactions between Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin, we used biochemistry and innovative imaging assays conducted in vitro and in vivo, including in the forming chick trigeminal ganglion. Results: Our data revealed a physical interaction between Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin. Conclusions: These studies identify a new molecular basis by which neural crest cells and placode cells can aggregate in vivo to build the trigeminal ganglion during embryogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Methylene blue sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer learning curve in the COVID-19 era: How many cases are enough? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is now the gold standard procedure for early breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes (N0). According to the Indonesian Board-Certified oncologist surgeon, the learning curve for evaluating fellow breast surgeons to achieve this competency could have been shorter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to see if the learning curve for sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification can be shortened and if imprint cytology (IC) can replace frozen sections (FS) for intraoperative analysis. Methods: Fellow breast surgeons were taught to perform SLNB on breast cancer patients. Intraoperative assessment and completion of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were performed in the first setting for standardization with the attending surgeon. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification was plotted on cumulative sum chart (CUSUM) limitations for evaluating the variability competency between attending surgeon and fellow surgeon based on a target identification rate of 85%. In addition, the accuracy of imprint cytology versus frozen section for identifying lymph node metastases was compared. Results: Consecutive 50 SLNBs were conducted during this period with attending and trainees split into two groups. After 13 consecutive tests, the CUSUM plot positively identified SLN as a significant achievement level of competency. Imprint cytology was shown to be inferior to frozen section cytology. The accuracy of imprint cytology is 91.8%, while the accuracy of frozen sections is 95.9%. Conclusion: According to a CUSUM chart based on a reasonable set of parameters, the learning curve for SLNB using methylene blue dye is reached after 13 consecutive positively detected SLN. Meanwhile, the frozen section is still the gold standard for determining the disorder of axillary lymph nodes, but the accuracy between the two methods can be comparable.

                The position weight matrix, also called the position-specific scoring matrix, is the commonly accepted model to quantify the specificity of transcription factor binding to DNA. Position weight matrices are used in thousands of projects and software tools in regulatory genomics, including computational prediction of the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide variants. Yet, recently Yan et al. reported that "the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power" if applied to the analysis of regulatory variants studied with a newly developed experimental method, SNP-SELEX. Here, we re-analyze the rich experimental dataset obtained by Yan et al. and show that appropriately selected position weight matrices in fact can adequately quantify transcription factor binding to alternative alleles.

                Background: The Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) proposed by the World Health Organization recognises the importance for health systems to understand the reasons underpinning the death of a pregnant woman or her newborn as an essential first step in preventing future similar deaths. Data for the surveillance component of the MPDSR process are typically collected from health facility sources and post-mortem interviews with affected families, though it may be traumatising to them. This brief report aimed to assess the potential utility of an augmented data collection method for mapping journeys of maternal and perinatal deaths, which does not require sourcing additional information from grieving family members. Methods: A descriptive analysis of maternal and perinatal deaths that occurred across all 24 public hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria, between 1st November 2018 and 30th October 2019 was conducted. Data on their demographic, obstetric history and complication at presentation, travel to the hospital, and mode of birth were extracted from their hospital records. The extracted travel data was exported to Google Maps, where driving distance and travel time to the hospital for the period of the day of travel were also extracted. Results: Of the 182 maternal deaths, most presented during the week (80.8%), travelled 5-10 km (30.6%) and 10-29 minutes (46.9%), and travelled to the nearest hospital to their places of residence (70.9%). Of the 442 pregnant women who had perinatal deaths, most presented during the week (78.5%), travelled <5 km (26.9%) and 10-29 minutes (38.0%). For both, the least reported travel data was the mode of travel used to care (>90.0%) and the period of the day they travelled (approximately 30.0%). Conclusion: An augmented data collection approach that includes accurate and complete travel data and closer-to-reality estimates of travel time and distance can be beneficial for MPDSR purposes.

                Background: This study was done to describe the pattern of personal protective equipment (PPE) use, associated factors, and adverse events among obstetricians and obstetric nurses in obstetrics & gynecology departments.  Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in Obstetrics & Gynecology departments in three hospitals (physician & nurses n=252) using an online Google form including demographic and occupational health data, type of available personal protective equipment during usual care, CS and emergency labor, infection control measures and hazards of full PPE use. Results Full PPE use was 37.7% during CS and 34.9% during emergency labor. The significant predictors of wearing full PPE during CS were daily work hours > 8 hours and receiving formal training about PPE use. During CS & emergency labor most of HCws used sterile gloves and sterile fluid resistant gowns and surgical mask.to less extent used face shields or tight fitting googles and one tenth (11.8%) only used N95. The most common health effects of full PPE use was sense of heat (79.5%). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic more vigorous respiratory (N95 mask) and eye protection is required during aerosol-generating procedures. Formal training is an evident predictor for full PPE use.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">“Exclusivity” and quantifier float in bakari [version 2; peer review: 4 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This paper presents a descriptive study that analyzes the semantic meaning of toritate focus particle bakari. It has been pointed out that while bakari expresses exclusivity, it seemingly possesses the characteristic of allowing non-applicable cases. This phenomenon may be examined when one argues against the position that bakari expresses exclusivity. Contrary to this view, the current study shows that when bakari co-occurs with floating quantifiers, non-applicable cases cannot be included in the quantity of the item indicated by the quantifier in question, thereby arguing that the meaning of bakari should be taken as exclusivity. Based on the previous studies, we clarify the following two points. First, when bakari is used, apart from a pre-established objective set reflecting the world, a subjective set rooted in the speaker's experience is established, and when a floating quantifier co-occurs with bakari, the quantifier in question expresses the quantity of the subjective set. Second, toritate focus particle bakari represents exclusivity, and the non-applicable cases can exist only outside of the set that bakari is concerned with.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Contributions by metaplasticity to solving the Catastrophic Forgetting Problem</a></h4>

              
                Catastrophic forgetting (CF) refers to the sudden and severe loss of prior information in learning systems when acquiring new information. CF has been an Achilles heel of standard artificial neural networks (ANNs) when learning multiple tasks sequentially. The brain, by contrast, has solved this problem during evolution. Modellers now use a variety of strategies to overcome CF, many of which have parallels to cellular and circuit functions in the brain. One common strategy, based on metaplasticity phenomena, controls the future rate of change at key connections to help retain previously learned information.

                T cells play a critical role in the adaptive immune response, recognizing peptide antigens presented on the cell surface by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins. While assessing peptides for MHC binding is an important component of probing these interactions, traditional assays for testing peptides of interest for MHC binding are limited in throughput. Here we present a yeast display-based platform for assessing the binding of tens of thousands of user-defined peptides in a high throughput manner. We apply this approach to assess a tiled library covering the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and four dengue virus serotypes for binding to human class II MHCs, including HLA-DR401, -DR402, and -DR404. While the peptide datasets show broad agreement with previously described MHC-binding motifs, they additionally reveal experimentally validated computational false positives and false negatives. We therefore present this approach as able to complement current experimental datasets and computational predictions. Further, our yeast display approach underlines design considerations for epitope identification experiments and serves as a framework for examining relationships between viral conservation and MHC binding, which can be used to identify potentially high-interest peptide binders from viral proteins. These results demonstrate the utility of our approach to determine peptide-MHC binding interactions in a manner that can supplement and potentially enhance current algorithm-based approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visualizing synaptic dopamine efflux with a 2D composite nanofilm</a></h4>

              
                Chemical neurotransmission constitutes one of the fundamental modalities of communication between neurons. Monitoring release of these chemicals has traditionally been difficult to carry out at spatial and temporal scales relevant to neuron function. To understand chemical neurotransmission more fully, we need to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of measurements for neurotransmitter release. To address this, we engineered a chemi-sensitive, two-dimensional composite nanofilm that facilitates visualization of the release and diffusion of the neurochemical dopamine with synaptic resolution, quantal sensitivity, and simultaneously from hundreds of release sites. Using this technology, we were able to monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of dopamine release in dendritic processes, a poorly understood phenomenon. We found that dopamine release is broadcast from a subset of dendritic processes as hotspots that have a mean spatial spread of 3.2 µm (full width at half maximum) and are observed with a mean spatial frequency of 1 hotspot per 7.5 µm of dendritic length. Major dendrites of dopamine neurons and fine dendritic processes, as well as dendritic arbors and dendrites with no apparent varicose morphology participated in dopamine release. Remarkably, these release hotspots colocalized with Bassoon, suggesting that Bassoon may contribute to organizing active zones in dendrites, similar to its role in axon terminals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancestral acetylcholine receptor β-subunit forms homopentamers that prime before opening spontaneously</a></h4>

              
                Human adult muscle-type acetylcholine receptors are heteropentameric ion channels formed from two α-subunits, and one each of the β-, d-, and e-subunits. To form functional channels, the subunits must assemble with one another in a precise stoichiometry and arrangement. Despite being different, the four subunits share a common ancestor that is presumed to have formed homopentamers. The extent to which the properties of the modern-day receptor result from its subunit complexity is unknown. Here we discover that a reconstructed ancestral muscle-type β-subunit can form homopentameric ion channels. These homopentamers open spontaneously and display single-channel hallmarks of muscle-type acetylcholine receptor activity. Our findings attest to the homopentameric origin of the muscle-type acetylcholine receptor, and demonstrate that signature features of its function are both independent of agonist and do not necessitate the complex heteropentameric architecture of the modern-day protein.

                ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and Ad26.COV2.S are approved vaccines inducing protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans by expressing the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed protein content and protein composition of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and Ad26.COV2.S by biochemical methods and by mass-spectrometry. Four out of four tested lots of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 contained significantly higher than expected levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) and of free viral proteins. The most abundant contaminating HCPs belonged to the heat-shock protein (HSP) and cytoskeletal protein families. The HCP content exceeded the 400 ng specification limit per vaccine dose, as set by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for this vaccine, by at least 25-fold and the manufacturer's batch-release data in some of the lots by several hundred-fold. In contrast, three tested lots of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine contained only very low amounts of HCPs. As shown for Ad26.COV2.S production of clinical grade adenovirus vaccines of high purity is feasible at an industrial scale. Correspondingly, purification procedures of the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine should be modified to remove protein impurities as good as possible. Our data also indicate that standard quality assays, as they are used in the manufacturing of proteins, have to be adapted for vectored vaccines.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Therapeutic deep brain stimulation disrupts movement-related subthalamic nucleus activity in Parkinsonian mice</a></h4>

              
                Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) relieves many motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD), but its underlying therapeutic mechanisms remain unclear. Since its advent, three major theories have been proposed: (1) DBS inhibits the STN and basal ganglia output; (2) DBS antidromically activates motor cortex; and (3) DBS disrupts firing dynamics within the STN. Previously, stimulation-related electrical artifacts limited mechanistic investigations using electrophysiology. We used electrical artifact-free GCaMP fiber photometry to investigate activity in basal ganglia nuclei during STN DBS in parkinsonian mice. To test whether the observed changes in activity were sufficient to relieve motor symptoms, we then combined electrophysiological recording with targeted optical DBS protocols. Our findings suggest that STN DBS exerts its therapeutic effect through the disruption of movement-related STN activity, rather than inhibition or antidromic activation. These results provide insight into optimizing PD treatments and establish an approach for investigating DBS in other neuropsychiatric conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emotional Vocalizations Alter Behaviors and Neurochemical Release into the Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain center of emotional expression, contributes to acoustic communication by first interpreting the meaning of social sounds in the context of the listener s internal state, then organizing the appropriate behavioral responses. We propose that modulatory neurochemicals such as acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) provide internal-state signals to the BLA while an animal listens to social vocalizations. We tested this in a vocal playback experiment wherein we sampled fluids within the BLA and observed behavioral responses of male and female mice while presenting highly affective vocal sequences associated with either mating or restraint behaviors. In male mice, playback of restraint vocalizations increased ACh release and decreased DA release, while playback of mating sequences evoked the opposite neurochemical release patterns. In non-estrus female mice, the ACh and DA release patterns to mating playback were similar to males. Estrous females, however, showed increased ACh, associated with vigilance, as well as increased DA, associated with reward-seeking. Across these groups, increased ACh concentration was correlated with an increase in defensive behavior. These neurochemical release patterns and several behavioral responses depended on prior experience with the mating and restraint behaviors. Our results support a model in which ACh and DA provide contextual information to sound-analyzing BLA neurons that modulates their output to downstream brain regions responsible for appropriate behavioral outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Executed and imagined grasping movements can be decoded from lower dimensional representation of distributed non-motor brain areas.</a></h4>

              
                Using brain activity directly as input for assistive tool control can circumvent muscular dysfunction and increase functional independence for physically impaired people. Most invasive motor decoding studies focus on decoding neural signals from the primary motor cortex, which provides a rich but superficial and spatially local signal. Initial non-primary motor cortex decoding endeavors have used distributed recordings to demonstrate decoding of motor activity by grouping electrodes in mesoscale brain regions. While these studies show that there is relevant and decodable movement related information outside the primary motor cortex, these methods are still exclusionary to other mesoscale areas, and do not capture the full informational content of the motor system. In this work, we recorded intracranial EEG of 8 epilepsy patients, including all electrode contacts except those contacts in or adjacent to the central sulcus. We show that executed and imagined movements can be decoded from non-motor areas; combining all non-motor contacts into a lower dimensional representation provides enough information for a Riemannian decoder to reach an area under the curve of 0.83 {+/-} 0.11. Additionally, by training our decoder on executed and testing on imagined movements, we demonstrate that between these two conditions there exists shared distributed information in the beta frequency range. By combining relevant information from all areas into a lower dimensional representation, the decoder was able to achieve high decoding results without information from the primary motor cortex. This representation makes the decoder more robust to perturbations, signal non-stationarities and neural tissue degradation. Our results indicate to look beyond the motor cortex and open up the way towards more robust and more versatile brain-computer interfaces.

                Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) is the most common nosocomial pathogen in preterm infants and associated with increased risk of cognitive delay, however, underlying mechanisms are unknown. We employed morphological, transcriptomic and physiological methods to extensively characterize microglia in the immature hippocampus following S. epidermidis infection. 3D morphological analysis revealed activation of microglia after S. epidermidis. Differential expression combined with network analysis identified NOD-receptor signalling and trans-endothelial leukocyte trafficking as major mechanisms in microglia. In support, active caspase-1 was increased in the hippocampus and using the LysM-eGFP knock-in transgenic mouse, we demonstrate infiltration of leukocytes to the brain together with disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Our findings identify activation of microglia inflammasome as a major mechanism underlying neuroinflammation following infection. The results demonstrate that neonatal S. epidermidis infection share analogies with S. aureus and neurological diseases, suggesting a previously unrecognized important role in neurodevelopmental disorders in preterm born children.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A quantitative rule to explain multi-spine plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neurons receive thousands of inputs onto their dendritic arbour, where individual synapses undergo activity-dependent changes in strength. The durable forms of synaptic strength change, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), require calcium entry through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) that triggers downstream protein signalling cascades in the dendrite. Intriguingly, sLTP and sLTD are not necessarily restricted to the active, targeted synapses (homosynapses), and the changes in synaptic strength can spread and affect the strengths of inactive or non-stimulated synapses (heterosynapses) on the same cell. Precisely how neurons allocate resources for implementing the changes in strength at individual synapses depending on their proximity to activity across space and time remains an open question. In order to gain insights into the elementary processes underlying heterosynaptic plasticity and their interplay with homosynaptic plasticity, we have combined experimental and mathematical modelling approaches. On the one hand, we used glutamate uncaging to precisely and systematically stimulate variable numbers of homosynapses sharing the same dendritic branch whilst monitoring tens of other heterosynapses on the same dendrite. Homosynaptic potentiation of clusters of dendritic spines leads to heterosynaptic changes that are NMDAR-dependent, requiring CaMKII and calcineurin activity. On the other hand, inspired by the calcium levels hypothesis where different amounts of calcium lead to either growth or shrinkage of spines, we have built a model based on a dual-role calcium-dependent protein that induces spine shrinkage or potentiation dynamics. Comparing our experimental results with model predictions, we find that (i) both collaboration and competition among spines for protein resources are key drivers of heterosynaptic plasticity and (ii) the temporal and spatial distance between simultaneously stimulated spines impact the resulting spine dynamics. Moreover, our model can reconcile a number of disparate and sometimes contradictory experimental reports of heterosynaptic sLTP or sLTD at homo and heterosynaptic spines. Our results provide a quantitative description of the heterosynaptic footprint unfolding across minutes and hours post-stimulation across tens of microns of dendritic space. This broadens our knowledge about the operation of non-linear dendritic summation rules and how they impact spiking decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Power spectrum and critical exponents in the 2D stochastic Wilson Cowan model</a></h4>

              
                The power spectrum of brain activity is composed by peaks at characteristic frequencies superimposed to a background that decays as a power law of the frequency, f-{beta} with an exponent {beta} close to 1 (pink noise). This exponent is predicted to be connected with the exponent {gamma} related to the scaling of the average size with the duration of avalanches of activity. "Mean field" models of neural dynamics predict exponents {beta} and {gamma} equal or near 2 at criticality (brown noise), including the simple branching model and the fully connected stochastic Wilson Cowan model. We here show that a 2D version of the stochastic Wilson Cowan model, where neuron connections decay exponentially with the distance, is characterized by exponents {beta} and {gamma} markedly different from those of mean field, respectively around 1 and 1.3. The exponents  and {tau} of avalanche size and duration distributions, equal to 1.5 and 2 in mean field, decrease respectively to 1.29 {+/-} 0.01 and 1.37 {+/-} 0.01. This seems to suggest the possibility of a different universality class for the model in finite dimension.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Saltatory axonal conduction in the avian retina</a></h4>

              
                In contrast to most parts of the vertebrate nervous system, the ganglion cell axons in the retina typically lack any myelination. Ganglion cell axons of most species only become myelinated once they leave the retina to form the optic nerve. The avian retina is a well known exception in that ganglion cell axons are partly myelinated in the retinal nerve fiber layer. However, the functional and structural properties of myelination in the nerve fiber layer remain elusive. Here, we used large-scale multi-electrode array recordings in combination with immunohisto-chemistry and fluorescence microscopy of European quail and pigeon retinas to investigate myelination of retinal ganglion cell axons. Intraretinal myelination was accompanied by the formation of nodes of Ranvier. The internode length was positively correlated with the axon diameter. The variability of internode lengths along each axon was significantly smaller than across axons. Saltatory conduction of action potentials was observed in a large population of recorded cells. On average, myelinated axons had higher conduction velocities than unmyelinated axons. However, both groups showed a significant overlap at low velocities. The number of simultaneously active nodes was positively correlated with the conduction velocity. In contrast, the internode length and the time it took a node to activate were weak predictors for the conduction velocity. However, the conduction velocity was well described by the number of activated nodes, the internode length, and the activation time in concert.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Upregulation of TLR4/MyD88 pathway in alcohol-induced Wernicke's encephalopathy: findings in preclinical models and in a postmortem human case</a></h4>

              
                Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a neurologic disease caused by vitamin B1 or thiamine deficiency (TD), being the alcohol use disorder (AUD) its main risk factor. WE patients present limiting motor, cognitive and emotional alterations related to a selective cerebral vulnerability. Neuroinflammation has been proposed as one of the phenomena contributing to brain damage. Our previous studies provide evidence for the involvement of the innate immune receptor Toll-like (TLR) 4 in the inflammatory response induced in the frontal cortex and cerebellum in TD animal models (animals fed with TD diet and receiving pyrithiamine). However, the effects of the combination of chronic alcohol consumption and TD on TLR4 and their specific contribution to the pathogenesis of WE are currently unknown. Additionally, no studies on TLR4 have been conducted on WE patients since brains from these patients are difficult to achieve. Here, we used rat models of chronic alcohol (CA; 9 months of forced consumption of 20% (w/v) alcohol), TD hit (TDD; TD diet + daily 0.25 mg/kg i.p. pyrithiamine during 12 days), or a combined treatment (CA+TDD) to check the activation of the proinflammatory TLR4/MyD88 pathway and related markers in the frontal cortex and the cerebellum. In addition, we characterized for the first time the TLR4 and its co-receptor MyD88 signature, along with other markers of this proinflammatory signaling such as phospo-NFkappaB; p65 and IkappaB, in the post-mortem human frontal cortex and cerebellum (gray and white matter) of an alcohol-induced WE patient, comparing it with negative (no disease) and positive (aged brain with Alzheimer disease) control subjects for neuroinflammation. We found an increase in the cortical TLR4 and its adaptor molecule MyD88, together with an upregulation of the proinflammatory signaling molecules p-NFkappaB and IkappaB in the CA+TDD animal model. In the patient diagnosed with alcohol-induced WE we observed cortical and cerebellar upregulation of the TLR4/MyD88 pathway. Thus, our findings provide evidence, both in the animal model and the human postmortem brain, of the upregulation of the TLR4/MyD88 proinflammatory pathway in WE related to alcohol consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Signatures of contextual interference in implicit sensorimotor adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Contextual interference refers to the phenomenon whereby a blocked practice schedule results in faster acquisition but poorer retention of new motor skills compared to a random practice schedule. While contextual interference has been observed under a broad range of tasks, it remains unclear if this effect generalizes to the implicit and automatic recalibration of an overlearned motor skill. To address this question, we compared blocked and random practice schedules on a reaching task in which we used a feedback perturbation method that isolates implicit adaptation. The degree of implicit adaptation was quantified as the change in hand angle in the opposite direction of the perturbation, and retention was quantified as the percent of adaptation remaining after visual feedback was extinguished. In two experiments, participants tested under a random practice schedule exhibited slower implicit adaptation, but better retention compared to participants tested under a blocked practice schedule, the signature of contextual interference. These results indicate that contextual interference is not limited to the acquisition of new motor skills but also applies to the implicit adaptation of established motor skills.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local neuroplasticity in adult glaucomatous visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                The degree to which the adult human visual cortex retains the ability to functionally adapt to damage at the level of the eye remains ill-understood. Previous studies on cortical neuroplasticity primarily focused on the consequences of foveal visual field defects (VFD), yet these findings may not generalize to peripheral defects such as occur in glaucoma. Moreover, recent findings on neuroplasticity are often based on population receptive field (pRF) mapping, but interpreting these results is complicated in the absence of appropriate control conditions. Here, we used fMRI-based neural modeling to assess putative changes in pRFs associated with glaucomatous VFD. We compared the fMRI-signals and pRF estimates in participants with glaucoma to those of controls with case-matched simulated VFD. We found that the amplitude of the fMRI-signal is reduced in glaucoma compared to control participants and correlated with disease severity. Furthermore, while coarse retinotopic structure is maintained in all participants with glaucoma, we observed local pRF shifts and enlargements in early visual areas, relative to control participants. These differences imply that the adult brain retains local neuroplasticity. This finding has translational relevance, as it is consistent with VFD masking, which prevents glaucoma patients from noticing their VFD and seeking timely treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Specialized neuronal modules for economic and single-attribute choice in the orbitofrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                An important aspect of biological intelligence is the ability of quick task switching. Such ability may be realized through a neural system equipped with functionally specialized modules subserving each task. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) harbors a persistent circuit supporting economic decisions under different contexts. To examine the specialization of this circuit, we contrasted the coding of the same neurons in the OFC of rhesus monkeys under economic choice (EC) and single-attribute choice (SC). In EC, OFC neurons largely encoded offer value, chosen value and choice outcome in goods space. Strikingly, these neurons were tuned out in SC while a complementary set of neurons encoded SC-related variables in a spatial reference frame. Moreover, in EC, neurons encoding the same value-related variable are anatomically clustered and the noise correlation among these neurons dropped significantly when the animal switched from EC to SC, suggesting altered functional organization. Thus, dedicated modules in the OFC may support cognitive flexibility in choice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration and evaluation of magnetic stimulation in physiology setups</a></h4>

              
                A large number of behavioral experiments have demonstrated the existence of a magnetic sense in many animal species. Further, studies with immediate gene expression markers have identified putative brain regions involved in magnetic information processing. In contrast, very little is known about the physiology of the magnetic sense and how the magnetic field is neuronally encoded. In vivo electrophysiological studies reporting neuronal correlates of the magnetic sense either have turned out to be irreproducible for lack of appropriate artifact controls or still await independent replication. Thus far, the research field of magnetoreception has little exploited the power of ex vivo physiological studies, which hold great promise for enabling stringent controls. However, tight space constraints in a recording setup and the presence of magnetizable materials in setup components and microscope objectives make it demanding to generate well-defined magnetic stimuli at the location of the biological specimen. Here, we present a solution based on a miniature vector magnetometer, a coil driver, and a calibration routine for the coil system to compensate for magnetic distortions in the setup. The magnetometer fits in common physiology recording chambers and has a sufficiently small spatial integration area to allow for probing spatial inhomogeneities. The coil-driver allows for the generation of defined non-stationary fast changing magnetic stimuli. Our ex vivo multielectrode array recordings from avian retinal ganglion cells show that artifacts induced by rapid magnetic stimulus changes can mimic the waveform of biological spikes on single electrodes. However, induction artifacts can be separated clearly from biological responses if the spatio-temporal characteristics of the artifact on multiple electrodes is taken into account. We provide the complete hardware design data and software resources for the integrated magnetic stimulation system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dual-tasking reveals the attentional cost of resolving sensory conflict induced by perturbed optic flow during treadmill walking</a></h4>

              
                The precise role of cognitive control in the processing of optic flow has been rarely investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether coping with unreliable visual inputs during walking requires cognitive resources. Twenty-four healthy young adults walked on an instrumented treadmill in a virtual environment under two optic flow conditions: normal (congruent) and perturbed (continuous mediolateral pseudo-random oscillations). Each condition was performed under single-task and dual-task conditions of increasing difficulty (1-, 2-, 3-back). Foot placement kinematics (200 Hz) and surface electromyography (EMG) of soleus and gluteus medius (1000 Hz) were recorded. Means, standard deviations (variability), statistical persistence and step-to-step error correction were computed from gait time series in lateral and anteroposterior directions. For EMG variables, duration and variability of muscle activation were calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the variance ratio, respectively. N-back task performance was expressed by the d prime and response time. Cognitive performance decreased as cognitive load increased (p<.001) but remained preserved under dual-task walking. Kinematics variability and EMG variance ratio increased under optic flow perturbation (p<.001). However, dual-tasking reduced the impact of the optic flow disturbance on the kinematics variability. Persistence of step width and antipersistence of step velocity decreased as cognitive load increased. Lastly, FWHM of soleus muscle increased with dual-task (p=.01). The results indicated that cognitive dual-tasking decreased the optic flow effect, demonstrating that resolving conflicting visual cues was attentionally costly. Also, in dual-task conditions, individuals adopted a rigid and controlled walking pattern in order to succeed N-back task.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Atypical intrinsic neural timescales in temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common drug-resistant epilepsy in adults. Here, we aimed to profile local neural function in TLE in vivo, building on prior evidence that has identified widespread structural alterations. Using multimodal MRI, we mapped intrinsic neural timescales (INT) at rest, examined associations to TLE-related structural compromise, and evaluated the clinical utility of INT. Methods: We studied 46 TLE patients and 44 healthy controls from two independent sites, and mapped INT changes in patients relative to controls across hippocampal, subcortical, and neocortical regions. We examined region-specific associations to structural alterations and explored effects of age and epilepsy duration. A supervised machine learning paradigm assessed utility of INT for classifying patients-vs-controls and seizure focus lateralization. Results: Relative to controls, TLE showed marked INT reductions across multiple regions bilaterally, indexing faster changing resting activity, with strongest effects in ipsilateral medial and lateral temporal regions, and sensorimotor cortices. Findings were consistent in each site and robust, albeit with reduced effect sizes, when correcting for structural alterations. TLE-related INT reductions increased with advancing disease duration, yet findings differed from aging effects seen in controls. Classifiers based on INT distinguished patients-vs-controls (balanced accuracy, 5-fold: 76+-2.65%, cross-site, 72-83%) and lateralized the focus in TLE (balanced accuracy, 5-fold: 96+-2.10%; cross-site, 95-97%) with high accuracies and generalization. Conclusions: Our findings robustly demonstrate atypical macroscale function in TLE in a topography that extends beyond mesiotemporal epicenters. INT measurements can assist in TLE diagnosis, seizure focus lateralization, and monitoring of disease progression, which suggests clinical utility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural population dynamics in dorsal premotor cortex underlying a reach decision</a></h4>

              
                We investigated if a dynamical systems approach could help understand the link between decision-related neural activity and decision-making behavior, a fundamentally unresolved problem. The dynamical systems approach posits that neural dynamics can be parameterized by a state equation that has different initial conditions and evolves in time by combining at each time step, recurrent dynamics and inputs. For decisions, the two key predictions of the dynamical systems approach are that 1) initial conditions substantially predict subsequent dynamics and behavior and 2) inputs should combine with initial conditions to lead to different choice-related dynamics. We tested these predictions by investigating neural population dynamics in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of monkeys performing a red-green reaction time (RT) checkerboard discrimination task where we varied the sensory evidence (i.e., the inputs). Prestimulus neural state, a proxy for the initial condition, predicted poststimulus neural trajectories and showed organized covariation with RT. Furthermore, faster RTs were associated with faster pre- and poststimulus dynamics as compared to slower RTs, with these effects observed within a stimulus difficulty. Poststimulus dynamics depended on both the sensory evidence and initial condition, with easier stimuli and "fast" initial conditions leading to the fastest choice-related dynamics whereas harder stimuli and "slow" initial conditions led to the slowest dynamics. Finally, changes in initial condition were related to the outcome of the previous trial, with slower pre- and poststimulus population dynamics and RTs on trials following an error as compared to trials following a correct response. Together these results suggest that decision-related activity in PMd is well described by a dynamical system where inputs combine with initial conditions that covary with eventual RT and previous outcome, to induce decision-related dynamics.

                As the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) in the brain, the locus coeruleus (LC) regulates both arousal and stress responses. However, how local neuromodulatory inputs contribute to LC function remains unresolved. Here we identify a network of transcriptionally and functionally diverse GABAergic neurons in the LC dendritic field that integrate distant inputs and modulate modes of LC firing to control arousal. We define peri-LC anatomy using viral tracing and combine single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to molecularly define both LC and peri-LC cell types. We identify several cell types which underlie peri-LC functional diversity using a series of complementary approaches in behaving mice. Our findings indicate that LC and peri-LC neurons comprise transcriptionally and functionally heterogenous neuronal populations, alongside anatomically segregated features which coordinate specific influences on behavioral arousal and avoidance states. Defining the molecular, cellular and functional diversity in the LC provides a road map for understanding the neurobiological basis of arousal alongside hyperarousal-related neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain dynamics predictive of response to psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin therapy for depression has started to show promise, yet the underlying causal mechanisms are not currently known. Here we leveraged the differential outcome in responders and non-responders to psilocybin (10mg and 25mg, 7 days apart) therapy for depression - to gain new insights into regions and networks implicated in the restoration of healthy brain dynamics. We used whole-brain modelling to fit the spatiotemporal brain dynamics at rest in both responders and non-responders before treatment. Dynamic sensitivity analysis of systematic perturbation of these models enabled us to identify specific brain regions implicated in a transition from a depressive brain state to a heathy one. Binarizing the sample into treatment responders (>50% reduction in depressive symptoms) versus non-responders enabled us to identify a subset of regions implicated in this change. Interestingly, these regions correlate with in vivo density maps of serotonin receptors 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A, which psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, has an appreciable affinity for, and where it acts as a full-to-partial agonist. Serotonergic transmission has long been associated with depression and our findings provide causal mechanistic evidence for the role of brain regions in the recovery from depression via psilocybin.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Assessment of Human Expertise in First-Person Shooter Games</a></h4>

              
                Contrary to traditional professional sports, there are few standardized metrics in professional esports (competitive multiplayer video games) for assessing a player's skill and ability. To begin to address this, we assessed the performance of professional-level players in Aim Lab, a first-person shooter training and assessment game, within two separate target-shooting tasks. These tasks differed primarily in the relative incentive for fast and imprecise shots versus slow and precise shots. Each player's motor acuity was measured by characterizing the speed-accuracy trade-off in shot behavior: shot frequency and shot spatial error (distance from center of a target). We also characterized the fine-grained kinematics of players' mouse movements. Our findings demonstrate that: 1) movement kinematics depended on task demands; and 2) individual differences in motor acuity were significantly correlated with both kinematics and the number of movements needed to hit a target. We demonstrate the importance of transforming from orientation in the virtual environment to centimeters on the mouse pad, as well as accounting for differences in mouse sensitivity across players, for characterizing human performance in first-person shooter games. This approach to measuring motor acuity has widespread application not only in esports assessment and training, but also in basic (motor psychophysics) and clinical (gamified rehabilitation) research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context and Domain Matter: The Error-Related Negativity in Peer Presence Predicts Fear of Negative Evaluation, not Global Social Anxiety, in Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Social anxiety symptoms are most likely to emerge during adolescence, a developmental window marked by heightened concern over peer evaluation. However, the neurocognitive mechanism(s) underlying adolescent social anxiety remain unclear. Emerging work points to the error-related negativity (ERN/{Delta}ERN) as a potential neural marker of exaggerated self/error-monitoring in social anxiety, particularly for errors committed in front of peers. However, social anxiety symptoms are marked by heterogeneity and it remains unclear exactly what domain(s) of social anxiety symptoms are associated with ERN/{Delta}ERN variation in peer presence, particularly within the adolescent period. Methods: To advance and deepen the mechanistic understanding of the ERN/{Delta}ERN's putative role as a neural marker for social anxiety in adolescence, we leveraged a social manipulation procedure and assessed a developmentally-salient domain of social anxiety during adolescence-Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE). Adolescents residing in Hanzhong, a small city in the southwestern region of mainland China, had EEG recorded while performing a flanker task, twice (peer presence/absence); FNE, as well as global social anxiety symptoms were assessed. Results: Overall ERN increases in peer presence. FNE specifically, but not global levels of social anxiety symptoms, predicted {Delta}ERN in peer presence. Conclusions: These data are the first demonstration that the {Delta}ERN relates to a specific domain of social anxiety in adolescents, as well as the first evidence of such relations within a non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) sample. Results have important implications for theory and research into adolescent social anxiety.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synchronous high-amplitude co-fluctuations of functional brain networks during movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have shown that functional connectivity can be decomposed into its exact framewise contributions, revealing short-lived, infrequent, and high-amplitude time points referred to as "events." Although events contribute disproportionately to the time-averaged connectivity pattern, improve identifiability and brain-behavior associations, and differences in their expression have been linked to endogenous hormonal fluctuations and autism, their origins remain unclear. Here, we address this question using two independently-acquired imaging datasets in which participants passively watched movies. We find that events synchronize across individuals and based on the level of synchronization, can be categorized into three distinct classes: those that synchronize at the boundaries between movies, those that synchronize during movies, and those that do not synchronize at all. We find that boundary events, compared to the other categories, exhibit greater amplitude, distinct co-fluctuation patterns, and temporal propagation. We show that underlying boundary events is a specific mode of co-fluctuation involving the activation of control and salience systems alongside the deactivation of visual systems. Finally, we find a strong positive relationship between the similarity of time-locked co-fluctuation patterns and the propensity for those time-locked frames to involve synchronous events. In other words, the inter-subject similarity of brain networks during passive movie-watching is strongly related both to the moment in the movie when they occur, and the likelihood that this moment evoked an event. Collectively, our results suggest that the spatiotemporal properties of events during passive movie-watching are non-random and locked to time-varying stimuli.

                While some state-of-the-art artificial neural network systems in computer vision are strikingly accurate models of the corresponding primate visual processing, there are still many discrepancies between these models and the behavior of primates on object recognition tasks. Many current models suffer from extreme sensitivity to adversarial attacks and often do not align well with the image-by-image behavioral error patterns observed in humans. Previous research has provided strong evidence that primate object recognition behavior can be very accurately predicted by neural population activity in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a brain area in the late stages of the visual processing hierarchy. Therefore, here we directly test whether making the late stage representations of models more similar to that of macaque IT produces new models that exhibit more robust, primate-like behavior. We conducted chronic, large-scale multi-electrode recordings across the IT cortex in six non-human primates (rhesus macaques). We then use these data to fine-tune (end-to-end) the model "IT" representations such that they are more aligned with the biological IT representations, while preserving accuracy on object recognition tasks. We generate a cohort of models with a range of IT similarity scores validated on held-out animals across two image sets with distinct statistics. Across a battery of optimization conditions, we observed a strong correlation between the models' IT-likeness and alignment with human behavior, as well as an increase in its adversarial robustness. We further assessed the limitations of this approach and find that the improvements in behavioral alignment and adversarial robustness generalize across different image statistics, but not to object categories outside of those covered in our IT training set. Taken together, our results demonstrate that building models that are more aligned with the primate brain leads to more robust and human-like behavior, and call for larger neural data-sets to further augment these gains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing the efficacy of data-driven denoising methods for a multi-echo fMRI acquisition at 7T</a></h4>

              
                In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain the signal is dominated by (physiological) noise. Imaging at ultrahigh field strength is becoming increasingly popular as it offers increased spatial accuracy. The latter is of particular benefit in brainstem neuroimaging given the small cross-sectional area of most nuclei. Physiological noise scales with field strength in fMRI acquisitions, however. Although this problem is in part solved by decreasing voxel size, it is clear that adequate physiological denoising is of utmost importance in brainstem-focused fMRI experiments. Multi-echo sequences have been reported to facilitate highly effective denoising through TE-dependence of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signals, in a denoising method referred to as multi-echo independent component analysis (ME-ICA). It has not been explored previously how ME-ICA compares to other data-driven denoising approaches at ultrahigh field strength. In the current study, we compared the efficacy of several denoising methods, including anatomical component based correction (aCompCor), Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts (ICA-AROMA), ME-ICA, and a combination of ME-ICA and aCompCor. We assessed several data quality metrics, including temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), delta variation signal (DVARS) and spectral density of the global signal. Moreover, we looked at the ability of each method to uncouple the global signal and respiration. In line with previous reports at lower field strengths, we demonstrate that after applying ME-ICA, the data is best post-processed in order to remove spatially diffuse noise with a method such as aCompCor. Our findings indicate that ME-ICA combined with aCompCor and ICA-AROMA are highly effective denoising approaches for multi-echo data acquired at 7T. ME-ICA combined with aCompCor potentially preserves more signal-of-interest as compared to ICA-AROMA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network predictions sharpen the representation of visual features for categorization</a></h4>

              
                Models of visual cognition assume that brain networks predict the contents of a stimulus to facilitate its subsequent categorization. However, the specific network mechanisms of this facilitation remain unclear. Here, we studied them in 11 individual participants cued to the spatial location (left vs. right) and contents (Low vs. High Spatial Frequency, LSF vs. HSF) of an upcoming Gabor stimulus that they categorized. Using concurrent MEG recordings, we reconstructed in each participant the network that communicates the predicted contents and the network that represents these contents from the stimulus for categorization. We show that predictions of LSF vs. HSF propagate top-down from temporal to contra-lateral occipital cortex, with modulatory supervision from frontal cortex. In occipital cortex, predictions sharpen bottom-up stimulus LSF vs. HSF representations, leading to faster categorizations. Our results therefore reveal functional networks that predict visual contents to sharpen their representations from the stimulus to facilitate categorization behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Packetization improves communication efficiency in brain networks with rapid and cost-effective propagation strategies</a></h4>

              
                Methodological developments in neuroscience and neuroimaging have allowed mapping large-scale networks of white matter structural connections across the whole brain. Many computational studies have built dynamic models of cortical communication processes in these networks to gain insights into generative mechanisms of complex brain functions. When modeling the communication dynamics in brain networks, various approximations have been applied to the manner of cortical signal propagation. For example, existing communication models assume that cortical signals propagate over the network by following, e.g., random walk and shortest path strategies. Recent studies argue that propagation strategies that enable rapid communication but only need a small information cost for reaching the destination are physiologically plausible. Another approximation lies in the assumption of whether cortical signals are packetized or not during propagation (in analogy to packet switching or message switching, respectively, in the context of telecommunications). Most previous models rely on the approximation that message switching is used; however, the plausibility of both switching architectures has not been as extensively studied as that of propagation strategies. To address this issue, we evaluate the plausibility of switching architectures by examining in simulations which of them achieves faster (more efficient) communication in brain networks with the plausible propagation strategies. We performed discrete-event simulations on a macaque brain network and compared the communication efficiency between message switching and packet switching for several propagation strategies. We find that packet switching leads to better communication efficiency when the signals propagate over brain networks under rapid and cost-effective strategies, such as informed and biased versions of random walks. This result suggests that packet switching is more plausible for building brain network communication models. Our study provides novel insights into how to approximate the communication dynamics in large-scale brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Habitual weekly exercise affects gait adaptation in healthy young adults</a></h4>

              
                Changing movement patterns in response to environmental perturbations is a critical aspect of gait and is related to reducing the energetic cost of the movement. Aerobic exercise improves energetic capacity for submaximal exercise and may affect how people adapt movement to reach an energetic minimum. The purpose of this study was to determine whether differences in recreational aerobic exercise training influence gait adaptation in healthy young adults. Active (n=19) and Inactive (n=13) young adults walked on a split-belt treadmill with one belt moving twice the speed of the other belt for 10 minutes. Step length asymmetry (SLA) and mechanical work done by each leg were measured over each stride. Nonlinear mixed effects models compared the timecourse of adaptation between Active and Inactive young adults, and t-tests compared net work at the end of adaptation between Active and Inactive young adults. Compared to Inactive young adults, Active young adults initially adapted SLA and positive work by the fast leg quickly, and continued to gradually adapt them over the duration of split-belt treadmill walking. There was no effect of exercise on adaptation of negative work by the fast leg or on net mechanical work. Young adults who regularly participate in aerobic exercise respond more quickly to the onset of a perturbation, and throughout the perturbation they continue to explore movement strategies to reduce energetic cost.

                Cryogenic electron microscopy has revealed unprecedented molecular insight into the conformation of {beta}-sheet-rich protein amyloids linked to neurodegenerative diseases. It remains unknown how a protein can adopt a diversity of folds and form multiple distinct fibrillar structures. Here we develop an in silico alanine scan method to estimate the relative energetic contribution of each amino acid in an amyloid assembly. We apply our method to twenty-seven ex vivo and in vitro fibril structural polymorphs of the microtubule-associated protein tau. We uncover networks of energetically important interactions involving amyloid-forming motifs that stabilize the different fibril folds. We test our predictions in cellular and in vitro aggregation assays. Using a machine learning approach, we classify the structures based on residue energetics to identify distinguishing and unifying features. Our energetic profiling suggests that minimal sequence elements that control the stability of tau fibrils, allowing future design of protein sequences that fold into unique structures.

	<p>Background: A variety of functional disorders can be caused after stroke, among which impairment of respiratory function is a frequent and serious complication of stroke patients. The aim of this study was to examine diaphragmatic function after stroke by diaphragm ultrasonography and then to apply to explore its correlation with extremity motor function and balance function of the hemiplegia patients. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study recruited 48 hemiplegic patients after stroke and 20 matched healthy participants. The data of demographic and ultrasonographic assessment of all healthy subjects were recorded, and 45 patients successfully underwent baseline data assessment in the first 48 h following admission, including post-stroke duration, stroke type, hemiplegia side, pipeline feeding, pulmonary infection, ultrasonographic assessment for diaphragm, Fugl&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer Motor Function Assessment Scale (FMA Scale), and Berg Balance Scale assessment. Ultrasonographic assessment parameters included diaphragm mobility under quiet and deep breathing, diaphragm thickness at end-inspiratory and end-expiratory, and calculated thickening fraction of the diaphragm. The aim was to analyze the diaphragm function of hemiplegic patients after stroke and to explore its correlation with extremity motor function and balance function. Results: The incidence of diaphragmatic dysfunction under deep breath was 46.67% in 45 hemiplegia patients after stroke at the convalescent phase. The paralyzed hemidiaphragm had major impairments, and the mobility of the hemiplegic diaphragm was significantly reduced during deep breathing (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, the thickness fraction of hemiplegic side was extremely diminished when contrasted with the healthy control and non-hemiplegic side (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). We respectively compared the diaphragm mobility under deep breath on the hemiplegic and non-hemiplegic side of patients with left and right hemiplegia and found there was no significant difference between the hemiplegic side of right and left hemiplegia (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05), but the non-hemiplegic side of right hemiplegia was significantly weaker than that of left hemiplegia patients (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The diaphragm mobility of stroke patients under quiet breath was positively correlated with age and FMA Scale score (R2 = 0.296, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and significant positive correlations were found between the diaphragm mobility under deep breath and Berg Balance Scale score (R2= 0.11, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), diaphragm thickness at end-inspiratory and FMA Scale score (R2 = 0.152, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and end-expiratory thickness and FMA Scale score (R2 = 0.204, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The mobility and thickness fraction of the hemiplegic diaphragm after stroke by diaphragm ultrasonography were significantly reduced during deep breathing. Diaphragm mobility on bilateral sides of the right hemiplegia patients were reduced during deep breathing. Moreover, the hemiplegic diaphragmatic function was positively correlated with extremity motor and balance function of the hemiplegia patients.</p>

	<p>The surgical methods for treating spasmodic torticollis include the denervation and myotomy (DAM) of the affected muscles and deep brain stimulation (DBS). This study reports on the long-term efficacy, prognostic factors, safety, and hospitalization costs following these two procedures. We collected data from 94 patients with spasmodic torticollis, of whom 41 and 53 were treated with DAM and DBS, respectively, from June 2008 to December 2020 at the Chinese People&amp;amp;rsquo;s Liberation Army General Hospital. We used the Tsui scale and the global outcome score of the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) to evaluate the preoperative and postoperative clinical conditions in all patients. We also determined the costs of hospitalization, prognostic factors, and serious adverse events following the two surgical procedures. The mean follow-up time was 68.83 months (range = 13&amp;amp;ndash;116). Both resection surgery and DBS showed good results in terms of Tsui (Z = &amp;amp;minus;5.103, p = 0.000; Z = &amp;amp;minus;6.210, p = 0.000) and TWSTRS scores (t = 8.762, p = 0.000; Z = &amp;amp;minus;6.308, p = 0.000). Compared with the DAM group, the preoperative (47.71, range 24&amp;amp;ndash;67.25) and postoperative (18.57, range 0&amp;amp;ndash;53) TWSTRS scores in the DBS group were significantly higher (Z = &amp;amp;minus;3.161, p = 0.002). We found no correlation between prognostic factors and patient age, gender, or disease duration for either surgical procedure. However, prognostic factors were related to the length of the postoperative follow-up period in the DBS surgery group (Z = &amp;amp;minus;2.068, p = 0.039; Z = &amp;amp;minus;3.287, p = 0.001). The mean hospitalization cost in the DBS group was 6.85 times that found in the resection group (Z = &amp;amp;minus;8.284, p = 0.000). The total complication rate was 4.26%. We found both resection surgery and DBS showed good results in the patients with spasmodic torticollis. Compared with DAM, DBS had a greater improvement in TWSTRS score; however, it was more expensive. Prognostic factors were related to the length of the postoperative follow-up period in patients who underwent DBS surgery.</p>

	<p>Background: Tic disorders (TDs), including Tourette syndrome, are childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by motor and/or vocal tics that commonly affect children&amp;amp;rsquo;s physical and mental health. The pathogenesis of TDs may be related to abnormal neurotransmitters in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry, especially dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and serotonergic neurotransmitters. The purpose of this study was to preliminarily investigate the differences in the three types of neurotransmitters in plasma and urine between children with TD and healthy children. Methods: We collected 94 samples of plasma and 69 samples of urine from 3&amp;amp;ndash;12-year-old Chinese Han children with TD before treatment. The plasma and urine of the same number of healthy Chinese Han children, matched for age and sex, participating in a physical examination, were collected. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to detect the three types of neurotransmitters in the above samples. Results: The plasma levels of norepinephrine, glutamic acid, and &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid, and the urine levels of normetanephrine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were higher in the TD children than in healthy children. The area under the curve (AUC) values of the above neurotransmitters in plasma and urine analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were all higher than 0.6, with significant differences. Among them, the combined AUC of dopamine, norepinephrine, normetanephrine, glutamic acid, and &amp;amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid in the 8&amp;amp;ndash;12-year-old subgroup was 0.930, and the sensitivity and specificity for TD were 0.821 and 0.974, respectively (p = 0.000). Conclusions: There are differences in plasma and urine neurotransmitters between TD children and healthy children, which lays a foundation for further research on the pathogenesis of TD.</p>

	<p>Hippocampal-sparing radiotherapy (HSR) is a promising approach to alleviate cognitive side effects following cranial radiotherapy. Microstructural brain changes after irradiation have been demonstrated using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). However, evidence is conflicting for certain parameters and anatomic structures. This study examines the effects of radiation on white matter and hippocampal microstructure using DTI and evaluates whether these may be mitigated using HSR. A total of 35 tumor patients undergoing a prospective randomized controlled trial receiving either conventional or HSR underwent DTI before as well as 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 (&amp;amp;plusmn;3) months after radiotherapy. Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Axial Diffusivity (AD), and Radial Diffusivity (RD) were measured in the hippocampus (CA), temporal, and frontal lobe white matter (TL, FL), and corpus callosum (CC). Longitudinal analysis was performed using linear mixed models. Analysis of the entire patient collective demonstrated an overall FACC decrease and RDCC increase compared to baseline in all follow-ups; ADCC decreased after 6 months, and MDCC increased after 12 months (p &amp;amp;le; 0.001, 0.001, 0.007, 0.018). ADTL decreased after 24 and 30 months (p &amp;amp;le; 0.004, 0.009). Hippocampal FA increased after 6 and 12 months, driven by a distinct increase in ADCA and MDCA, with RDCA not increasing until 30 months after radiotherapy (p &amp;amp;le; 0.011, 0.039, 0.005, 0.040, 0.019). Mean radiation dose correlated positively with hippocampal FA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). These findings may indicate complex pathophysiological changes in cerebral microstructures after radiation, insufficiently explained by conventional DTI models. Hippocampal microstructure differed between patients undergoing HSR and conventional cranial radiotherapy after 6 months with a higher ADCA in the HSR subgroup (p &amp;amp;le; 0.034).</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The comb-shaped pectines in scorpions are intriguing chemo- and mechanosensory organs. By using neuronal tracer and immunohistochemistry, we focused on the projection areas of mechanosensory pecten hair sensillae afferents in two species, <i>Mesobuthus eupeus</i> and <i>Euscorpius italicus</i>. We identified an extensive neuronal pathway, which includes distinct ventral neuropils, multisegmental ascending tracts, contralateral branches, and direct innervation of the third and fourth walking leg neuromeres. These results support the hypothesis that pecten hair sensillae function as sensors to elicit reflexive adjustment of body height and obstacle avoidance.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Scorpions’ sensory abilities are intriguing, especially the rather enigmatic ventral comb-like chemo- and mechanosensory organs, the so-called pectines. Attached ventrally to the second mesosomal segment just posterior to the coxae of the fourth walking leg pair, the pectines consist of the lamellae, the fulcra, and a variable number of pecten teeth. The latter contain the bimodal peg sensillae, used for probing the substrate with regard to chemo- and mechanosensory cues simultaneously. In addition, the lamellae, the fulcra and the pecten teeth are equipped with pecten hair sensillae (PHS) to gather mechanosensory information. Previously, we have analyzed the neuronal pathway associated with the peg sensillae unraveling their somatotopic projection pattern in dedicated pecten neuropils. Little is known, however, regarding the projections of PHS within the scorpion nervous system. Behavioral and electrophysiological assays showed involvement of PHS in reflexive responses but how the information is integrated remains unresolved. Here, we unravel the innervation pattern of the mechanosensory pecten hair afferents in <i>Mesobuthus eupeus</i> and <i>Euscorpius italicus</i>. By using immunofluorescent labeling and injection of Neurobiotin tracer, we identify extensive arborizations of afferents, including (i) ventral neuropils, (ii) somatotopically organized multisegmental sensory tracts, (iii) contralateral branches via commissures, and (iv) direct ipsilateral innervation of walking leg neuromeres 3 and 4. Our results suggest that PHS function as sensors to elicit reflexive adjustment of body height and obstacle avoidance, mediating accurate pecten teeth alignment to guarantee functionality of pectines, which are involved in fundamental capacities like mating or navigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FMRI complexity correlates with tau-PET in Late-Onset and Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Neurofibrillary tangle pathology detected with tau-PET correlates closely with neuronal injury and cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Complexity of rs-fMRI time-series, measured by entropy values, have recently been reported to decrease with aging, APOE {varepsilon}4 genotype and cognitive decline in AD. Here we hypothesize that the complexity of BOLD signals provides an index for tau-related neuronal injury and cognitive decline in the AD process. Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative phase 3 (ADNI3) and the Estudio de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer en Jalisciences (EEAJ) study, including cognitively normal elderly controls, persons with late onset AD (LOAD) and early onset autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) patients and their relatives. Our cohort consisted of a sample of 147 subjects from ADNI3 and 41 subjects from EEAJ with T1 structural, tau-PET (tracer: 18F-AV1451) and fMRI scans. Correlations between SUVR tau-PET and multi-scale entropy (MSE) were calculated voxel-wise as well as for standard automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas regions while accounting for age, gender, and regional gray matter volume. Potential pathways relating MSE to cognitive function mediated through tau-PET were assessed by path analysis. We found significant negative correlations between low frequency MSE and tau-PET measures in medial temporal lobe, in both ADNI3 and EEAJ cohorts. Furthermore, low frequency MSE showed significant associations with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and the Mini-Mental State Status Exam (MMSE) scores in both ADNI3 and EEAJ cohorts, which were largely mediated through the tau-PET signal. Correlations of MSE with tau-PET in temporal lobes support our hypothesis that the complexity of rs-fMRI is associated with regional tau protein accumulation. Furthermore, the association of MSE with CDR and MMSE, mediated by tau-PET, in disease relevant areas suggests that a reduction in MSE is indicative of decreased information processing capacity and cognitive decline in AD processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">WiChR, a highly potassium selective channelrhodopsin for low-light two-photon neuronal inhibition</a></h4>

              
                The electric excitability of muscle, heart and brain tissue relies on the precise interplay of Na+- and K+-selective ion channels. The involved ion fluxes are controlled in optogenetic studies using light-gated channelrhodopsins (ChRs). While non-selective cation-conducting ChRs are well-established for excitation, K+-selective ChRs (KCRs) for efficient inhibition have only recently come into reach. Here, we report the molecular analysis of recently discovered KCRs from the stramenopile Hyphochytrium catenoides and identify a novel type of hydrophobic K+-selectivity filter. Next, we demonstrate that the KCR signature motif is conserved in related stramenopile ChRs. Among them, WiChR from Wobblia lunata features an unmatched 80-fold preference for K+ over Na+, stable photocurrents under continuous illumination and a prolonged open state lifetime. Well expressed in neurons, WiChR allows two-photon inhibition at low irradiance and reduced tissue heating, recommending WiChR as the long-awaited efficient and versatile optogenetic inhibitor.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Action inhibition revisited: Stopping is not faster than going</a></h4>

              
                We often need to swiftly abort a prepared response at the last moment before it is initiated. Our ability to abort a planned response is thought to be a fundamental facet of action control that is distinguished by its rapid speed, and is enabled by a specialized neural mechanism. This narrative has, however, largely been established based on experiments in which there is much greater urgency to abort an action than there is to generate an action. Here, we demonstrate that, under conditions of matched urgency, the speed at which participants are able to abort an action is comparable to the speed at which they can initiate an action. Our results challenge the prevailing view that stopping behaviors have a privileged status. We suggest, instead, that action initiation may often be systematically delayed to allow time to abort an action if needed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oligodendrocyte-mediated Myelin Plasticity and its role in Neural Synchronization</a></h4>

              
                Temporal synchrony of signals arriving from different neurons or brain regions is essential for proper neural processing. Nevertheless, it is not well understood how such synchrony is achieved and maintained in a complex network of time-delayed neural interactions. Myelin plasticity has been suggested as an efficient mechanism for controlling timing in brain communications through adaptive changes of axonal conduction velocity and consequently conduction time delays, or latencies; however, local rules and feedback mechanisms that oligodendrocytes (OL) use to achieve synchronization are not known. We propose a mathematical model of oligodendrocyte-mediated myelin plasticity (OMP) in which OL play an active role in providing such feedback. This is achieved without using arrival times at the synapse or modulatory signaling from astrocytes; instead, it relies on the presence of global and transient OL responses to local action potentials in the axons they myelinate. While inspired by OL morphology, we provide the theoretical underpinnings that motivated the model and explore its performance for a wide range of its parameters. Our results indicate that when the characteristic time of OL's spike responses is between 10 and 40 ms and the firing rates in individual axons are relatively low (< 10 Hz), the OMP model efficiently synchronizes correlated and time-locked signals while latencies in axons carrying independent signals are unaffected. This suggests a novel form of selective synchronization in the CNS in which oligodendrocytes play an active role by modulating the conduction delays of correlated spike trains as they traverse to their targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter for Neuronal State and Parameter Estimation</a></h4>

              
                Data assimilation techniques for state and parameter estimation are frequently applied in the context of computational neuroscience. In this work, we show how an adaptive variant of the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) performs on the tracking of a conductance-based neuron model. Unlike standard recursive filter implementations, the robust adaptive unscented Kalman filter (RAUKF) jointly estimates the states and parameters of the neuronal model while adjusting noise covariance matrices online based on innovation and residual information. We benchmark the adaptive filter's performance against existing nonlinear Kalman filters and explore the sensitivity of the filter parameters to the system being modelled. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed solution, we simulate practical settings that challenge tracking performance, such as a model mismatch and measurement faults. Compared to standard variants of the Kalman filter the adaptive variant implemented here is more accurate and robust to faults.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synapses, predictions, and prediction errors: a neocortical computational study of MDD using the temporal memory algorithm of HTM.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Synapses and spines are central in major depressive disorder (MDD) pathophysiology, recently highlighted by ketamine's and psilocybin's rapid antidepressant effects. The Bayesian brain and interoception perspectives formalize MDD as being "stuck" in affective states constantly predicting negative energy balance. We examined how synaptic atrophy relates to the predictive function of the neocortex and thus to symptoms, using temporal memory (TM), an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm. TM represents a single neocortical layer, learns in real-time using local Hebbian-learning rules, and extracts and predicts temporal sequences. Methods: We trained a TM model on random sequences of upper-case alphabetical letters, representing sequences of affective states. To model depression, we progressively destroyed synapses in the TM model and examined how that affected the predictive capacity of the network. Results: Destroying 50% of the synapses slightly reduced the number of predictions, followed by a marked drop with further destruction. However, reducing the synapses by 25% distinctly dropped the confidence in the predictions. So even though the network was making accurate predictions, the network was no longer confident about these predictions. Conclusions: These findings explain how interoceptive cortices could be stuck in limited affective states with high prediction error. Growth of new synapses, e.g., with ketamine and psilocybin, would allow representing more futuristic predictions with higher confidence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the TM model to connect changes happening at synaptic levels to the Bayesian formulation of psychiatric symptomatology, making it possible to understand treatment mechanisms and possibly, develop new treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoupling of interacting neuronal populations by time-shifted stimulation through spike-timing-dependent plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The synaptic organization of the brain is constantly modified by activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. In several neurological disorders, abnormal neuronal activity and pathological synaptic connectivity may significantly impair normal brain function. Reorganization of neuronal circuits by therapeutic stimulation has the potential to restore normal brain dynamics. Increasing evidence suggests that the temporal stimulation pattern crucially determines the long-lasting therapeutic effects of stimulation. Here, we tested whether a specific pattern of brain stimulations can enable the suppression of pathologically strong inter-population synaptic connectivity through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). More specifically, we tested how introducing a time shift between stimuli delivered to two interacting populations of neurons can effectively decouple them. To that end, we first used a tractable model, i.e., two bidirectionally coupled leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, to theoretically analyze the optimal range of stimulation frequency and time shift for decoupling. We then extended our results to two reciprocally connected neuronal populations (modules) where inter-population delayed connections were modified by STDP. As predicted by the theoretical results, appropriately time-shifted stimulation causes a decoupling of the two-module system through STDP, i.e., by unlearning pathologically strong synaptic interactions between the two populations. Based on the overall topology of the connections, the decoupling of the two modules, in turn, causes a desynchronization of the populations that outlasts the cessation of stimulation. Decoupling effects of the time-shifted stimulation can be realized by time-shifted burst stimulation as well as time-shifted continuous simulation. Our results provide insight into the further optimization of a variety of multichannel stimulation protocols aiming at a therapeutic reshaping of diseased brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech-In-Noise Comprehension is Improved When Viewing a Deep-Neural-Network-Generated Talking Face</a></h4>

              
                Listening in a noisy environment is challenging, but many previous studies have demonstrated that comprehension of speech can be substantially improved by looking at the talker's face. We recently developed a deep neural network (DNN) based system that generates movies of a talking face from speech audio and a single face image. In this study, we aimed to quantify the benefits that such a system can bring to speech comprehension, especially in noise. The target speech audio was masked with signal to noise ratios of -9, -6, -3, and 0 dB and was presented to subjects in three audio-visual (AV) stimulus conditions: 1) synthesized AV: audio with the synthesized talking face movie; 2) natural AV: audio with the original movie from the corpus; and 3) audio-only: audio with a static image of the talker. Subjects were asked to type the sentences they heard in each trial and keyword recognition was quantified for each condition. Overall, performance in the synthesized AV condition fell approximately halfway between the other two conditions, showing a marked improvement over the audio-only control but still falling short of the natural AV condition. Every subject showed some benefit from the synthetic AV stimulus. The results of this study support the idea that a DNN-based model that generates a talking face from speech audio can meaningfully enhance comprehension in noisy environments, and has the potential to be used as a "visual hearing aid."

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-dependent decline and recovery of synaptic transmission in central parts of surviving primary afferents after their peripheral cut.</a></h4>

              
                Whereas axons deprived of their nucleus degenerate within a few days in Mammals, they survive for several months in Crustacean. However, it is not known if central synapses from sensory axons may preserve their molecular machinery in the absence of spiking activity, after peripheral axotomy, which suppress their nucleus. Using electrophysiology techniques and electron microscopy imaging we report that 1) Electron microscopy analysis confirms previous observations that glial cell nucleus present in sensory nerve, proliferate an migrate to axon tubes, in which they form close contact with surviving axons; 2) after peripheral axotomy performed in vivo on Coxo-Basipodite chordotonal organ (CBCO) sensory nerve does not convey any sensory message, but antidromic volleys are observed; 3) Central synaptic transmission to motoneurons (MNs) progressively declines over #200 days (90% of monosynaptic excitatory transmission is lost after 3 weeks, whereas 60% of polysynaptic inhibitory transmission persist up to 6 months). After #200 days no transmission is observed anymore; 4) However, this total loss is only apparent, because repetitive electrical stimulation of the sensory nerve in vitro progressively restores first inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) then excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs); 5) The loss of synaptic transmission can be prevented by in vivo chronic sensory nerve stimulation; 6) Using simulations based on the geometric arrangements of synapses of the monosynaptic excitatory transmission and disynaptic inhibitory pathways, we have shown that antidromic activity in CBCO nerve could play a role in maintenance of synaptic function of inhibitory pathways to MNs, but not on monosynaptic excitatory transmission to MNs. Taken together, our study confirms the key role of glial nucleus in axon survival, that machinery for spike conduction and synaptic release even if no activity is present for several months. After long silence periods (>6 months) spike conduction and synaptic function can still be restored by electrical activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Helping can be driven by non-affective cues in rat</a></h4>

              
                Helping another in distress can be motivated by either affective or cognitive empathy, with the latter commonly believed to be restricted to humans and possibly other apes. Here, we found evidence for rodent helping that occurs in the absence of affective cues. We employed a paradigm in which a free rat can open the door to a restrainer containing a trapped rat. When the trapped rat was treated with the anxiolytic midazolam, the helping behavior exhibited by the free rat was diminished but did not extinguish. Correspondingly, midazolam-treated trapped rats still released themselves when given the opportunity, albeit at longer latencies than controls, evidence that midazolam only partially reduced the distress experienced by trapped rats. To test whether helping could occur for a rat who exhibited no affect, trapped rats were immobilized by general anesthesia or heavy sedation. Surprisingly, rats opened the door to restrainers containing these immobilized rats and pulled the incapacitated rats out of the restrainer, pushing them away from the arena center. The same solicitous behavior was observed when an anesthetized rat was simply placed in the center of the arena, without being confined within a restrainer. We speculate that the cognitive dissonance of immobile rats, at odds with predictive expectations of rat behavior built up over a lifetime, motivated solicitous behavior including helping. To block affective behavioral displays without associated dissonant cues of immobility, metyrapone, a drug that selectively blocks corticosterone synthesis, was administered to trapped rats. Under such circumstances, little helping behavior occurred. In sum, rats may be motivated either by affect or by cognitive dissonance, the latter comprising a rudimentary form of cognitive empathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decision-making processes in perceptual learning depend on effectors</a></h4>

              
                Visual perceptual learning is traditionally thought to arise in visual cortex. However, typical perceptual learning tasks also involve systematic mapping of visual information onto motor actions. Because the motor system contains both effector-specific and effector-unspecific representations, the question arises whether visual perceptual learning is effector-specific itself, or not. Here, we study this question in an orientation discrimination task. Subjects learn to indicate their choices either with joystick movements or with manual reaches. After training, we challenge them to perform the same task with eye movements. We dissect the decision-making process using the drift diffusion model. We find that learning effects on the rate of evidence accumulation and the decision criteria depend on effectors, albeit not fully. This suggests that during perceptual learning, visual information is mapped onto effector-specific integrators. Overlap of the populations of neurons encoding motor plans for these effectors may explain partial generalization. Taken together, visual perceptual learning is not limited to visual cortex, but also affects sensorimotor mapping at the interface of visual processing and decision making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating the efficacy of multi-echo ICA denoising on model-based fMRI</a></h4>

              
                fMRI is an indispensable tool for neuroscience investigation, but this technique is limited by multiple sources of physiological and measurement noise. These noise sources are particularly problematic for analysis techniques that require high signal-to-noise ratio for stable model fitting, such as voxel-wise modeling. Multi-echo data acquisition in combination with echo-time dependent ICA denoising (ME-ICA) represents one promising strategy to mitigate physiological and hardware-related noise sources as well as motion-related artifacts. However, most studies employing ME-ICA to date are resting-state fMRI studies, and therefore we have a limited understanding of the impact of ME-ICA on task or model-based fMRI paradigms. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap by comparing data quality and model fitting performance on data acquired during a visual population receptive field (pRF) mapping paradigm (N=13 participants) after using one of three preprocessing procedures: ME-ICA, optimally combined multi-echo data without ICA-denoising, and typical single echo processing. As expected, multi-echo fMRI improved temporal signal-to-noise compared to single echo fMRI, with ME-ICA amplifying the improvement compared to optimal combination alone. However, unexpectedly, this boost in temporal signal-to-noise did not directly translate to improved model fitting performance: compared to single echo acquisition, model fitting was only improved after ICA-denoising. Specifically, compared to single echo acquisition, ME-ICA resulted in improved variance explained by our pRF model throughout the visual system, including anterior regions of the temporal and parietal lobes where SNR is typically low, while optimal combination without ICA did not. ME-ICA also improved reliability of parameter estimates compared to single echo and optimally combined multi-echo data without ICA-denoising. Collectively, these results suggest that ME-ICA is effective for denoising task-based fMRI data for modeling analyses and maintains the integrity of the original data. Therefore, ME-ICA may be beneficial for complex fMRI experiments, including task fMRI studies, voxel-wise modeling, and naturalistic paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mean-field approximations with adaptive coupling for networks with spike-timing-dependent plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the effect of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is key to elucidate how neural networks change over long timescales and to design interventions aimed at modulating such networks in neurological disorders. However, progress is restricted by the significant computational cost associated with simulating neural network models with STDP, and by the lack of low-dimensional description that could provide analytical insights. To approximate STDP in phase oscillator networks, simpler phase-difference-dependent plasticity (PDDP) rules have been developed, which prescribe synaptic changes based on phase differences of neuron pairs rather than differences in spike timing. Here we construct mean-field approximations for phase oscillator networks with STDP to describe the dynamics of large networks of adaptive oscillators. We first show that single-harmonic PDDP rules can approximate a simple form of symmetric STDP, while multi-harmonic rules are required to accurately approximate causal STDP. We then derive exact expressions for the evolution of the average PDDP coupling weight in terms of network synchrony. For adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators that form clusters, we formulate a low-dimensional description based on mean field dynamics and average coupling weight. Finally, we show that such a two-cluster mean-field model can be fitted to provide a low-dimensional approximation of a full adaptive network with symmetric STDP. Our framework represents a step towards a low-dimensional description of adaptive networks with STDP, and could for example inform the development of new therapies aimed at maximizing the long-lasting effects of brain stimulation.
