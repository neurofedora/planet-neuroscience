<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To define a distinct, dominantly inherited, mild skeletal myopathy associated with prominent and consistent tremor in two unrelated, three‐generation families.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical evaluations as well as exome and panel sequencing analyses were performed in affected and nonaffected members of two families to identify genetic variants segregating with the phenotype. Histological assessment of a muscle biopsy specimen was performed in 1 patient, and quantitative tremor analysis was carried out in 2 patients. Molecular modeling studies and biochemical assays were performed for both mutations.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two novel missense mutations in <i>MYBPC1</i> (p.E248K in family 1 and p.Y247H in family 2) were identified and shown to segregate perfectly with the myopathy/tremor phenotype in the respective families. <i>MYBPC1</i> encodes slow myosin binding protein‐C (sMyBP‐C), a modular sarcomeric protein playing structural and regulatory roles through its dynamic interaction with actin and myosin filaments. The Y247H and E248K mutations are located in the NH<sub>2</sub>‐terminal M‐motif of sMyBP‐C. Both mutations result in markedly increased binding of the NH<sub>2</sub> terminus to myosin, possibly interfering with normal cross‐bridge cycling as the first muscle‐based step in tremor genesis. The clinical tremor features observed in all mutation carriers, together with the tremor physiology studies performed in family 2, suggest amplification by an additional central loop modulating the clinical tremor phenomenology.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here, we link two novel missense mutations in <i>MYBPC1</i> with a dominant, mild skeletal myopathy invariably associated with a distinctive tremor. The molecular, genetic, and clinical studies are consistent with a unique sarcomeric origin of the tremor, which we classify as “myogenic tremor.” ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Abstract
<p>Functional brain networks self-assemble during development, although the molecular basis of network assembly is poorly understood. Protocadherin-19 (<i>pcdh19</i>) is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and influences multiple cellular and developmental events in zebrafish. Although loss of <i>PCDH19</i> in humans and model organisms leads to functional deficits, the underlying network defects remain unknown. Here, we employ multiplane, resonant-scanning <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging of developing zebrafish, and use graph theory to characterize the development of resting state functional networks in both wild-type and <i>pcdh19</i> mutant larvae. We find that the brain networks of <i>pcdh19</i> mutants display enhanced clustering and an altered developmental trajectory of network assembly. Our results show that functional imaging and network analysis in zebrafish larvae is an effective approach for characterizing the developmental impact of lesions in genes of clinical interest.</p>

In particular, evolutionary rearrangements of transcription factor binding site placements together with potential species-dependent developmental stage- and/or cell type-specific epigenetic and other <em>trans</em>-acting mechanisms are most likely at least in part accountable for between-species diversity in activity-regulated transcription.

Responses of neuronal populations play an important role in the encoding of stimulus related information. However, the inherent multidimensionality required to describe population activity has imposed significant challenges and has limited the applicability of classical spike train analysis techniques. Here, we show that these limitations can be overcome. We first quantify the collective activity of neurons as multidimensional vectors (patterns). Then we characterize the behavior of these patterns by applying classical spike train analysis techniques: peri-stimulus time histograms, tuning curves and auto- and cross- correlation histograms. We find that patterns can exhibit a broad spectrum of properties, some ressembling and others substantially differing from those of their component neurons. We show that in some cases pattern behavior cannot be intuitively inferred from the activity of component neurons. Importantly, silent neurons play a critical role in shaping pattern expression. By correlating pattern timing with local-field potentials, we show that the method can reveal fine temporal coordination of cortical circuits at the mesoscale. Because of its simplicity and reliance on well understood classical analysis methods the proposed approach is valuable for the study of neuronal population dynamics.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00499">Unbalanced Occlusion Modifies the Pattern of Brain Activity During Execution of a Finger to Thumb Motor Task</a></h4>

In order to assess possible influences of occlusion on motor performance, we studied by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the changes in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal induced at brain level by a finger to thumb motor task in a population of subjects characterized by an asymmetric activation of jaw muscles during clenching (malocclusion). In these subjects, appropriate occlusal correction by an oral orthotic (bite) reduced the masticatory asymmetry. The finger to thumb task was performed while the subject’s dental arches were touching, in two conditions: a) with the teeth in direct contact (Bite OFF) and b) with the bite interposed between the arches (Bite ON). Both conditions required only a very slight activation of masticatory muscles. Maps of the BOLD signal recorded during the movement were contrasted with the resting condition (activation maps). Areas of increased BOLD signal in the activation maps were observed bilaterally, being larger in Bite OFF than Bite ON. These areas included the sensorimotor cortex, the supplementary-premotor cortex, the cerebellum and the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area). Between conditions comparison of the activation maps (Bite OFF/Bite ON) showed that, in Bite OFF, the BOLD signal was significantly higher at the level of the trigeminal sensorimotor region, the premotor cortex, the cerebellum, the parietal, temporal, occipital and limbic regions (bilaterally) as well as within the left Broca’s area. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that malocclusion makes movement performance more difficult, requiring a stronger activation of the Broca’s area, which participate in planning of the motor sequence, and of the cerebellum, which is essential in motor coordination. Moreover, malocclusion leads to a higher spread of activation in motor regions not directly involved in the control of the moving body parts and generates an higher engagement of regions involved in visuo-spatial and temporal processing, as well as in the control of cognitive activities and alertness levels.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00461">A Nutraceutical Strategy to Slowing Down the Progression of Cone Death in an Animal Model of Retinitis Pigmentosa</a></h4>

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive degeneration of the visual cells and abnormalities in retinal pigment epithelium, the vision is lost slowly and the final outcome is total blindness. The primary mutation responsible for RP is in rod but subsequently cone photoreceptors are also affected. The main modality of photoreceptor cell death is activation of apoptosis pathway but the biological mechanism linking the primary degeneration of rod to the secondary death of cone is still poorly understood. Possible causes of the secondary cone death are oxidative stress and/ or release of toxic factors from dying rods. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of nutraceutical molecules with antioxidant properties on the progression of the disease in an established animal model of RP, rd10 mice. We show that chronic treatment per os with a flavanone (naringenin) or a flavonol (quercetin) present in citrus fruits, grapes and apples, preserves retinal morphology and ameliorate functionality. These actions are associated with a significant reduction of stress-oxidative markers, such as the detoxifying enzymes Sod1 and Sod2. In addition, naringenin and quercetin treatment reduces the levels of acrolein staining associated with a reduction of ROS in the cellular environment. The study demonstrates the beneficial effects of naringenin and quercetin, two molecules that possess antioxidant properties, limiting neurodegeneration and thus preventing cone damage.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00447">Test–Retest Reliability of the Effects of Continuous Theta-Burst Stimulation</a></h4>

Objectives: The utility of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) as index of cortical plasticity is limited by inadequate characterization of its test-retest reliability. Thus, we evaluated the reliability of cTBS aftereffects, and explored the roles of age, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms.

Methods: 28 healthy adults (age range 21–65) underwent two identical cTBS sessions (median interval = 9.5 days) targeting the motor cortex. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of the log-transformed, baseline-corrected amplitude of motor evoked potentials (ΔMEP) at 5–60 minutes post-cTBS (T5–T60) were calculated. 

Results: ΔMEP at T50 was the most-reliable cTBS measure in the whole sample (ICC = 0.53). Area under-the-curve (AUC) of ΔMEPs was most reliable when calculated over the full 60 minutes post-cTBS (ICC = 0.40). cTBS measures were substantially more reliable in younger participants (&lt; 35 yr) and those with BDNF Val66Val and APOE ε4– genotypes.

Conclusions: cTBS aftereffects are most reliable when assessed 50 minutes post-cTBS, or when cumulative ΔMEP measures are calculated over 30–60 minutes post-cTBS. Reliability of cTBS aftereffects is influenced by age, and BDNF and APOE polymorphisms. Reliability coefficients are used to adjust effect-size calculations for interpretation and planning of cTBS studies.

Cerebral micro-bleedings (CMBs) as a type of small chronic brain bleeding could have many side effects to patients who suffer from it, such as inducing stroke, loss of brain functions or side effects from other medications and treatment. Therefore, it is important and essential to detect CMBs timely and better to be in an early stage for prompt treatment. In this research, we proposed employing DenseNet 201 as the basic method, and transfer learning for CMBs detection. In order to generate the samples for training, we used sliding window to cover the whole image from left to right and from up to bottom, and based on the central pixel, we can decide target value. Considering the data imbalance, the cost matrix was used in this research. Then, based on the new model, we tested the classification accuracy, and it achieved 97.71%, which provides better performance than the state of art methods.

Vesicular storage of neurotransmitters, which allows their subsequent exocytotic release, is essential for chemical transmission in the central nervous system. Neurotransmitter uptake into secretory vesicles is carried out by vesicular transporters, which use the electrochemical proton gradient generated by a vacuolar H+-ATPase to drive neurotransmitter vesicular accumulation. ATP and other nucleotides are relevant extracellular signaling molecules that participate in a variety of biological processes. Although the active transport of nucleotides into secretory vesicles has been characterized from the pharmacological and biochemical point of view, the protein responsible for such vesicular accumulation remained unidentified for some time. In 2008, the human SLC17A9 gene, the last identified member of the SLC17 transporters, was found to encode the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT). VNUT is expressed in various ATP-secreting cells and is able to transport a wide variety of nucleotides in a vesicular membrane potential-dependent manner. VNUT knockout mice lack vesicular storage and release of ATP, resulting in blockage of the purinergic transmission. This review summarizes the current studies on VNUT and analyzes the physiological relevance of the vesicular nucleotide transport in the central nervous system. The possible role of VNUT in the development of some pathological processes, such as chronic neuropathic pain or glaucoma is also discussed. The putative involvement of VNUT in these pathologies raises the possibility of the use of VNUT inhibitors for therapeutic purposes.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00221">Modulation of Ion Channels in the Axon: Mechanisms and Function</a></h4>

The axon is responsible for integrating synaptic signals, generating action potentials (APs), propagating those APs to downstream synapses and converting them into patterns of neurotransmitter vesicle release. This process is mediated by a rich assortment of voltage-gated ion channels and vesicle exocytosis machinery. Moreover, neuromodulators control the activity of these proteins through G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades. Here, we review cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in axonal ion channel neuromodulation and examine how changes to ion channel function affect AP initiation, AP propagation, and the release of neurotransmitter. We then examine how these mechanisms could modulate synaptic function by focusing on three key features of synaptic information transmission: synaptic strength, synaptic variability, and short-term plasticity.  Viewing these cellular mechanisms of neuromodulation from a functional perspective may assist in extending these findings to theories of neural circuit function and its neuromodulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45146">Synapse-specific Opioid Modulation of Thalamo-cortico-striatal Circuits</a></h4>

The medial thalamus (MThal), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum play important roles in affective-motivational pain processing and reward learning. Opioids affect both pain and reward through uncharacterized modulation of this circuitry. This study examined opioid actions on glutamate transmission between these brain regions in mouse. Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists potently inhibited MThal inputs without affecting ACC inputs to individual striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). MOR activation also inhibited MThal inputs to the pyramidal neurons in the ACC. In contrast, delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonists disinhibited ACC pyramidal neuron responses to MThal inputs by suppressing local feed-forward GABA signaling from parvalbumin-positive interneurons. As a result, DOR activation in the ACC facilitated poly-synaptic (thalamo-cortico-striatal) excitation of MSNs by MThal inputs. These results suggest that opioid effects on pain and reward may be shaped by the relative selectivity of opioid drugs to the specific circuit components.

Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) acts primarily on endothelial cells, but also on non-vascular targets, e.g. in the CNS and immune system. Here we describe a novel, unique VEGF-C form in the human reproductive system produced via cleavage by kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), aka prostate-specific antigen (PSA). KLK3 activated VEGF-C specifically and efficiently through cleavage at a novel N-terminal site. We detected VEGF-C in seminal plasma, and sperm liquefaction occurred concurrently with VEGF-C activation, which was enhanced by collagen and calcium binding EGF domains 1 (CCBE1). After plasmin and ADAMTS3, KLK3 is the third protease shown to activate VEGF-C. Since differently activated VEGF-Cs are characterized by successively shorter N-terminal helices, we created an even shorter hypothetical form, which showed preferential binding to VEGFR-3. Using mass spectrometric analysis of the isolated VEGF-C-cleaving activity from human saliva, we identified cathepsin D as a protease that can activate VEGF-C as well as VEGF-D.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43194">Accelerated redevelopment of vocal skills is preceded by lasting reorganization of the song motor circuitry</a></h4>

Complex motor skills take considerable time and practice to learn. Without continued practice the level of skill performance quickly degrades, posing a problem for the timely utilization of skilled motor behaviors. Here we quantified the recurring development of vocal motor skills and the accompanying changes in synaptic connectivity in the brain of a songbird, while manipulating skill performance by consecutively administrating and withdrawing testosterone. We demonstrate that a songbird with prior singing experience can significantly accelerate the re-acquisition of vocal performance. We further demonstrate that an increase in vocal performance is accompanied by a pronounced synaptic pruning in the forebrain vocal motor area HVC, a reduction that is not reversed when birds stop singing. These results provide evidence that lasting synaptic changes in the motor circuitry are associated with the savings of motor skills, enabling a rapid recovery of motor performance under environmental time constraints.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42012">FOXP2 exhibits neuron class specific expression, but is not required for multiple aspects of cortical histogenesis</a></h4>

The expression patterns of the transcription factor FOXP2 in the developing mammalian forebrain have been described, and some studies have tested the role of this protein in the development and function of specific forebrain circuits by diverse methods and in multiple species. Clinically, mutations in <i>FOXP2 </i>are associated with severe developmental speech disturbances, and molecular studies indicate that impairment of <i>Foxp2</i> may lead to dysregulation of genes involved in forebrain histogenesis. Here, anatomical and molecular phenotypes of the cortical neuron populations that express FOXP2 were characterized in mice. Additionally, <i>Foxp2 </i>was removed from the developing mouse cortex at different prenatal ages using two Cre-recombinase driver lines. Detailed molecular and circuit analyses were undertaken to identify potential disruptions of development. Surprisingly, the results demonstrate that <i>Foxp2</i> function is not required for many functions that it has been proposed to regulate, and therefore plays a more limited role in cortical development than previously thought.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41711">Fusion pore regulation by cAMP/Epac2 controls cargo release during insulin exocytosis</a></h4>

Regulated exocytosis establishes a narrow fusion pore as initial aqueous connection to the extracellular space, through which small transmitter molecules such as ATP can exit. Co-release of polypeptides and hormones like insulin requires further expansion of the pore. There is evidence that pore expansion is regulated and can fail in diabetes and neurodegenerative disease. Here we report that the cAMP-sensor Epac2 (Rap-GEF4) controls fusion pore behavior by acutely recruiting two pore-restricting proteins, amisyn and dynamin-1, to the exocytosis site in insulin-secreting beta-cells. cAMP elevation restricts and slows fusion pore expansion and peptide release, but not when Epac2 is inactivated pharmacologically or in Epac2<sup>-/-</sup> (<i>Rapgef4</i><sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Consistently, overexpression of Epac2 impedes pore expansion. Widely used antidiabetic drugs (GLP-1 receptor agonists and sulfonylureas) activate this pathway and thereby paradoxically restrict hormone release. We conclude that Epac2/cAMP controls fusion pore expansion and thus the balance of hormone and transmitter release during insulin granule exocytosis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41356">Chemical modulation of transcriptionally enriched signaling pathways to optimize the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons</a></h4>

Direct conversion of human somatic fibroblasts into induced neurons (iNs) allows for the generation of functional neurons while bypassing any stem cell intermediary stages. Although iN technology has an enormous potential for modeling age-related diseases, as well as therapeutic approaches, the technology faces limitations due to variable conversion efficiencies and a lack of thorough understanding of the signaling pathways directing iN conversion. Here, we introduce a new all-in-one inducible lentiviral system that simplifies fibroblast transgenesis for the two pioneer transcription factors, Ngn2 and Ascl1, and markedly improves iN yields. Further, our timeline RNA-Seq data across the course of conversion has identified signaling pathways that become transcriptionally enriched during iN conversion. Small molecular modulators were identified for four signaling pathways that reliably increase the yield of iNs. Taken together, these advances provide an improved toolkit for iN technology and new insight into the mechanisms influencing direct iN conversion.

Understanding endogenous regulation of stress resistance and homeostasis maintenance is critical to developing neuroprotective therapies. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) is a conserved essential enzyme that confers extraordinary protection and stress resistance in many neurodegenerative disease models. Drosophila Nmnat is alternatively spliced to two mRNA variants, RA and RB. RB translates to protein isoform PD with robust protective activity and is upregulated upon stress to confer enhanced neuroprotection. The mechanisms regulating alternative splicing and stress response of NMNAT remain unclear. We have discovered a Drosophila microRNA, dme-miR-1002, which promotes the splicing of NMNAT pre-mRNA to RB by disrupting a pre-mRNA stem-loop structure. While NMNAT pre-mRNA is preferentially spliced to RA in basal conditions, miR-1002 enhances NMNAT PD-mediated stress protection by binding via RISC component Argonaute1 to the pre-mRNA, facilitating the splicing switch to RB. These results outline a new process for microRNAs in regulating alternative splicing and modulating stress resistance.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/641902v1?rss=1">Temporal signal-to-noise changes in combined multiband- and slice-accelerated echo-planar imaging with a 20- and 64-channel coil</a></h4>

Echo planar imaging (EPI) is the most common method of functional magnetic resonance imaging for acquiring the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. One of the primary benefits of using EPI is that an entire volume of the brain can be acquired on the order of two seconds. However, this speed benefit comes with a cost. Because imaging protocols are limited by hardware (e.g., fast gradient switching), researchers are forced to compromise between spatial resolution, temporal resolution, or whole-brain coverage. Earlier attempts to circumvent this problem included developing protocols in which slices of a volume were acquired faster (i.e., slice (S) acceleration), while more recent protocols allow for multiple slices to be acquired simultaneously (i.e., multiband (MB) acceleration). However, applying such acceleration methods can lead to a reduction in the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), which is a critical measure of the stability of the signal over time. Here we show, in five healthy subjects, using a 20- and 64-channel receiver coil, that enabling S-acceleration consistently yielded, as expected, a substantial decrease in tSNR, regardless of the receiver coil employed, whereas tSNR decrease resulting from MB acceleration was less pronounced. Specifically, with the 20-channel coil, tSNR of upto 4-fold MB-acceleration is comparable to that of no acceleration, while up to 6-fold MB-acceleration with the 64-channel coil yields comparable tSNR to that of no acceleration. Moreover, observed tSNR losses tended to be localized to temporal, insular, and medial brain regions and were more noticeable in the 20- than in the 64-channel coil. Conversely, with the 64-channel coil, the tSNR in lateral frontoparietal regions remained relatively stable with increasing MB factors. Such methodological explorations can inform researchers and clinicians as to how they can optimize imaging protocols depending on the available hardware and the brain regions they want to investigate.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/641498v1?rss=1">Effects of mid-frontal brain stimulation on sustained attention</a></h4>

Vigilant attention is defined as the ability to sustain attention over longer periods of time in a non-stimulating environment. Previous studies have suggested an important role for the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in vigilant attention. In this manuscript, we describe two experiments in which we aimed to enhance vigilant attention by applying transcranial electrical current stimulation over the mPFC. Specifically, we were interested in reducing the often observed decline in performance with time-on-task, the so-called vigilance decrement. In the first experiment, we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in a between-subject design (n=97): participants received either anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation. In contrast to our prediction, we found no effect of stimulation on the vigilance decrement. In the second experiment, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). Participants received alpha and theta stimulation in two separate sessions (n=47, within-subject design). Here, we found a frequency-dependent effect on the vigilance decrement, such that contrary to our expectation, participants performance over time became worse after theta stimulation, compared to alpha stimulation. However, this result needs to be interpreted with caution given that at least part of this effect seems to be driven by the intensity of side effects experienced during the two stimulation frequencies. To conclude, across the two studies we were not able to reduce the vigilant decrement using tDCS or theta tACS.

The question whether and how we are able to monitor our own cognitive states (metacognition) has been a matter of debate for decades. Do we have direct access to our cognitive processes or can we only infer them indirectly based on their consequences? In the current study, we wanted to investigate the brain circuits that underlie the metacognitive experience of fluency in action selection. To manipulate action-selection fluency we used a subliminal response priming paradigm. On each trial, participants additionally engaged in the metacognitive process of rating how hard they felt it was to respond to the target stimulus. Despite having no conscious awareness of the prime, results showed that participants rated incompatible trials (during which subliminal primes interfered with the required response) to be more difficult than compatible trials (where primes facilitated the required response) reflecting metacognitive awareness of difficulty. This increased sense of subjective difficulty was mirrored by increased activity in the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) and the anterior insula, two regions that are functionally closely connected. Importantly, these reflected unique activations and were not explained by reaction times or prime-response compatibility. We interpret these findings in light of a possible grounding of the metacognitive judgement of fluency in action selection in interoceptive signals resulting from increased effort.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/641159v1?rss=1">Rotational Dynamics Reduce Interference Between Sensory and Memory Representations</a></h4>

Sensory stimuli arrive in a continuous stream. By learning statistical regularities in the sequence of stimuli, the brain can predict future stimuli (Xu et al. 2012; Gavornik and Bear 2014; Maniscalco et al. 2018; J. Fiser and Aslin 2002). Such learning requires associating immediate sensory information with the memory of recently encountered stimuli (Ostojic and Fusi 2013; Kiyonaga et al. 2017). However, new sensory information can also interfere with short-term memories (Parthasarathy et al. 2017). How the brain prevents such interference is unknown. Here, we show that sensory representations rotate in neural space over time, to form an independent memory representation, thus reducing interference with future sensory inputs. We used an implicit learning paradigm in mice to study how statistical regularities in a sequence of stimuli are learned and represented in primary auditory cortex. Mice experienced both common sequences of stimuli (e.g. ABCD) and uncommon sequences (e.g. XYCD). Over four days of learning, the neural population representation of commonly associated stimuli (e.g. A and C) converged. This facilitated the prediction of upcoming stimuli, but also led unexpected sensory inputs to overwrite the sensory representation of previous stimuli (postdiction). Surprisingly, we found the memory of previous stimuli persisted in a second, orthogonal dimension. Unsupervised clustering of functional cell types revealed that the emergence of this second memory dimension is supported by two separate types of neurons; a 'stable' population that maintained its selectivity throughout the sequence and a 'switching' population that dynamically inverted its selectivity. This combination of sustained and dynamic representations produces a rotation of the encoding dimension in the neural population. This rotational dynamic may be a general principle, by which the cortex protects memories of prior events from interference by incoming stimuli.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/641126v1?rss=1">Optogenetically-Induced Population Discharge Threshold as a Sensitive Measure of Network Excitability</a></h4>

Network excitability is governed by synaptic efficacy, intrinsic excitability, and the circuitry in which these factors are expressed. The complex interplay between these factors determines how circuits function, and at the extreme, their susceptibility to seizure. We have developed a novel optogenetic intensity response procedure that provides a sensitive, quantitative estimate of network excitability. By combining optogenetic stimulation of the hippocampus with chronic multi-site recordings in peri-hippocampal structures of awake behaving mice, we induced abnormal network-wide epileptiform population discharges (PD) that were nearly indistinguishable from spontaneously occurring interictal spikes. By systematically varying light intensity, and therefore the magnitude of the optogenetically-mediated current, we generated intensity-response curves using the probability of PD as the dependent variable. This probability curve was well fit by a Boltzmann function, from which we calculated the intensity that produces a half-maximal probability of discharge (I50). This novel metric, the I50, is correlated with the optogenetic after-discharge threshold (oADT) in the same mice. Manipulations known to increase excitability, such as sub-convulsive doses (20 mg/kg) of the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), produced a leftward shift in the curve compared to baseline. The anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (40 mk/kg), in combination with PTZ, produced a rightward shift. Optogenetically-induced population discharge threshold (oPDT) baselines were stable over time, suggesting the metric is appropriate for within-subject experimental designs with multiple pharmacological manipulations. The oPDT is a sensitive measure of subconvulsive network excitability, with broad applicability to a number of areas of investigation.

Motor stereotypies occurring in early-onset neuropsychiatric diseases are associated with dysregulated basal ganglia direct-pathway activity. Disruptions in network connectivity through impaired neuronal structure have been implicated in both rodents and humans. However, the neurobiological mechanisms leading to direct-pathway neuron disconnectivity in stereotypy remain poorly understood. We have a mouse line with Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor deletion from D1-expressing cells (D1-Cre-flTrkB) in which a subset of animals shows repetitive rotations and head tics with juvenile onset. Here we demonstrate these behaviors may be associated with abnormal direct-pathway activity by reducing rotations using chemogenetic inhibition of dorsal striatum D1-medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) in both juvenile and young adult mice. Taking advantage of phenotypical differences in animals with similar genotype, we then interrogated the D1-MSN specific translatome associated with repetitive behavior by using RNA-sequencing of ribosome-associated mRNA. Detailed translatome analysis followed by multiplexed gene expression assessment revealed profound alterations in neuronal projection and synaptic structure related genes in stereotypy mice. Examination of neuronal morphology demonstrated dendritic atrophy and dendritic spine loss in dorsal striatum D1-MSNs from mice with repetitive behavior. Together, our results uncover phenotype-specific molecular alterations in D1-MSNs that relate to morphological adaptations in mice displaying stereotypy behavior.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a 20-30% reduction in cerebral blood flow. In the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, inhibiting neutrophil adhesion using an antibody against the neutrophil specific protein Ly6G was recently shown to drive rapid improvements in cerebral blood flow that was accompanied by an improvement in performance on short-term memory tasks. Here, in a longitudinal aging study, we assessed how far into disease development a single injection of anti-Ly6G can acutely improve memory function. We found that APP/PS1 mice as old as 15-16 months had improved performance on the object replacement and Y-maze tests of short-term memory, measured at one day after anti-Ly6G treatment. APP/PS1 mice 17-18 months of age or older did not show acute improvements in cognitive performance, although we did find that cerebral blood flow was still increased by 17% in 21-22 months old APP/PS1 mice given anti-Ly6G. These data add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that cerebral blood flow reductions are an important contributing factor to the cognitive dysfunction associated with neurodegenerative disease.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/640797v1?rss=1">Non-replication of functional connectivity differences in ASD: a multi-site study</a></h4>

A large and rapidly growing number of studies on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have used resting-state fMRI to identify various alterations of functional connectivity (FC), with the hope of identifying clinically useful biomarkers or neural mechanisms underlying ASD. However, results have been largely inconsistent across studies, and there is therefore a pressing need to determine the primary factors influencing this lack of replicability. Here, we used resting-state (rs-fMRI) data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I and II) to investigate two factors thought to strongly influence replicability: the use of different denoising methods (i.e., data preprocessing) and data site (which differ in terms of sample, data acquisition parameters, etc.). Using four independently acquired datasets and 31 different denoising strategies, we examined the replicability of patterns of both group-averaged functional connectomes and group-level differences (i.e., ASD vs. control). Within datasets, both group-averages and group-comparisons of functional connectomes were highly consistent (r = 0.92{+/-}0.06 / r = 0.80{+/-}0.09) across different pipelines, with the largest differences across pipelines reflecting whether global signal regression (GSR) was used. However, across datasets, while group-averages were still highly consistent (r = 0.86{+/-}0.02), group differences did not replicate, regardless of denoising strategy: indeed, consistency of group differences was so low (r = 0.09{+/-}0.05) that differences identified in one dataset had essentially no relationship with those in other datasets. Across-site similarity remained low even when considering the data at the network (as opposed to edge) level. Because there are a number of additional methodological factors that can influence the reliable detection of group differences (e.g., scanner-related differences, subject differences, post-processing analysis, effect sizes of ASD alterations, amount and quality of data), these results cannot completely rule out the existence of replicable resting-state FC differences in ASD. However, they do highlight the importance of examining replicability in future studies of ASD, and, more generally, call for extra caution when describing and interpreting alterations in functional connectivity across groups of individuals.

Some animals have evolved task differentiation of individual structures within the same sensory modality (e.g. olfaction or vision). A particular example is spiders, where most species have eight eyes, of which two (the principle eyes) are used for object discrimination, whereas the other three pairs (secondary eyes) detect movement. In the model spider species Cupiennius salei (Keyserling, 1877) these two eye types correspond to two distinct visual pathways in the brain. Each eye is associated with its own first and second order visual neuropil. The second order neuropils of the principle eyes are connected to the arcuate body, whereas the second order neuropils of the secondary eyes are linked to the mushroom body. However, the secondary eye size and visual fields of C. salei differs considerably from that of the likewise visually hunting jumping spiders. We explored the secondary eye visual pathway of the jumping spider Marpissa muscosa, and found that the connectivity of neuropils differs from that in C. salei. In M. muscosa, all secondary eyes are connected to their own first order visual neuropils. The first order visual neuropils of the anterior lateral and posterior lateral eyes are further connected with two second order visual neuropils, the array of microglomeruli and the 2nd order visual neuropil of the lateral eyes, whereas the posterior median eyes lack associated second order neuropils and axons project only to the arcuate body. These differences between C. salei and M. muscosa suggest substantial differences in information processing and function of their visual neuropils.

Social behaviors recruit multiple cognitive processes requiring coordinated interactions among brain regions. Oscillatory coupling provides one mechanism for cortical and subcortical neurons to synchronize their activity. However, it remains unknown how neurons from different nodes in the social brain network interact when making social decisions. We investigated neuronal coupling between the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg) of the medial prefrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) while monkeys expressed context-dependent prosocial or antisocial decisions impacting the reward of another monkey. We found an enhanced synchronization for prosocial decision preference between the two nodes, but a suppressed synchronization for antisocial decision preference. In support of a unique communication for prosocial decision-making, these interactions occurred in dedicated frequency channels depending on the area contributing spikes and had the opposite information flow directionalities for the two frequency channels. These findings support that specialized coordination in the medial prefrontal-amygdala network underlies social decision-making.

Volitional limb motor control involves dynamic and static muscle actions. It remains elusive how such distinct actions controlled in the central nervous system through separated or shared neural circuits. Here we explored the potential separation of neural circuitry for dynamic and static controls in the primate hand actions. We investigated the neuronal interactions between the spinal cord and forelimb muscles, and the motor cortex and the muscles, with an emphasis on their modulation during dynamic and static phase of grasping. While macaque monkeys were performing a precision grip comprising dynamic and static phases, we recorded spinal or cortical local field potentials simultaneously with electromyographic activity, thereafter examined neural coherence between the signals. We observed the emergence of beta-range neural coherence with muscle activity at spinal cord and motor cortex in the separated phases; spinal coherence during the grip phase and cortical coherence during the hold phase. Further, both of the coherence were influenced by bidirectional interactions with reasonable latencies as beta oscillatory cycles. These results indicate that dedicated feedback circuits comprising spinal and cortical structures underlie dynamic and static control of dexterous hand actions.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/640078v1?rss=1">Diffuse TBI-induced expression of anxiety-like behavior coincides with altered glutamatergic function, TrkB protein levels and region-dependent pathophysiology in amygdala circuitry</a></h4>

Up to 50% of traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors demonstrate persisting affective symptoms indicative of limbic system dysregulation, yet the pathophysiology underlying the symptoms is unclear. We hypothesize that TBI-induced pathophysiologic changes within distinct amygdala nuclei contribute to the expression of late-onset anxiety-like behavior. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent midline fluid percussion injury or sham surgery. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed at 7 and 28 days post-injury (DPI) followed by assessment of real-time glutamate neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) using glutamate-selective microelectrode arrays. In separate animal cohorts, the presence of neuropathology, astrocytosis, and microglial activation were assessed at 1, 7, and 28DPI. Protein levels of glutamatergic transporters (Glt-1, GLAST) and presynaptic modulators of glutamate release (mGluR2, TrkB, BDNF, and glucocorticoid receptors) were quantified using automated capillary western techniques at 28DPI. The expression of anxiety-like behavior at 28DPI coincided with decreased glutamate release and slower glutamate clearance in the CeA, not BLA. Changes in glutamate neurotransmission were independent of protein levels of glutamate transporters and mGluR2 receptors, neuropathology, and astrocytosis. At 1DPI, microglia in the CeA demonstrated a neuroinflammatory response. BDNF and TrkB were decreased at 28DPI in the amygdala. These data indicate that diffuse axonal injury instigates sequences of molecular, structural and functional changes in the amygdala that contribute to circuit dysregulation relevant to the expression of affective disorders. Translationally, diffuse axonal injury can influence severity and incidence of affective symptoms and should be addressed in the history of patients with affective disorders.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/639930v1?rss=1">Loss of interplay: Frontoparietal dynamics underlie working memory deficits in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that provokes motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Cognitive symptoms are a core feature of the disease, affecting everyday life functioning in 40 to 70% of patients. Working Memory impairment is one of the most common cognitive deficits, crucially affecting goal-directed behavior. However, evidence of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these impairments is scarce. To address this issue, we investigated a working memory task concomitantly with electroencephalographic records in twenty patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who had minimal clinical cognitive alteration, and in twenty healthy control subjects. Participants first watched a memory set of two, four, or six consonants that had to be memorized and, after a black screen that was shown for two seconds, a target stimulus was displayed. We correlated both time-frequency and functional brain connectivity with memory load and behavioral performance. We found that patients and healthy controls presented similar accuracy rates. For high memory loads, patients demonstrated longer reaction times for incorrect responses when the probe was part of the memory set, revealing an increase in cognitive effort. We then evaluated the single trial correlation between the power of the oscillatory activity and the memory load. The healthy control group showed an increase of left frontal and parietal theta activity, while the patient group did not show this increase. The analysis of the successful memory performances demonstrated that controls presented a greater medial theta activity during the maintenance stage; whereas, the patient group showed a decrease in this activity. Interestingly, cortical connectivity analyses using Granger Causality revealed that healthy controls presented a load-modulated progression of the frontal-to-parietal connectivity that indicated successful memory performance, while the patients did not show this pattern. Consistently, phase-amplitude coupling analyses showed that this connectivity was carried out by frontal delta/theta phase to parietal gamma amplitude modulation. Frontal-to-parietal connectivity correlated with working memory capacity in patients measure by Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. These results indicate that patients with multiple sclerosis present alterations in their capacity to sustain oscillatory dynamics that maintain information in working memory. Thus, differences in brain oscillations and connectivity could be useful for early detection and to study working memory alterations in multiple sclerosis, as well as to implement new therapeutic interventions using non-invasive brain stimulation.

The advent of whole brain clearing and imaging methods have extended the breadth and depth at which neural populations can be studied. However, these methods have yet to be applied to larger tissues, such as the brains of the common laboratory rat, despite the importance of these models in behavioral neuroscience research. Here we introduce an optimized iDISCO+ based immunolabeling and clearing methodology for application to adult rat brain hemispheres. We validate this methodology through the testing of common antibodies. In order to extend the accessibility of this methodology for general use, we have developed an open source platform for the registration of rat brain volumes to standard brain atlases for high throughput analysis.

Microglia, the brain resident macrophages, critically shape forebrain neuronal circuits. However, their precise function in the cerebellum is unknown. Here we show that human and mouse cerebellar microglia express a unique molecular program distinct from forebrain microglia. Cerebellar microglial identity was driven by the CSF-1R ligand CSF-1, independently of the alternate CSF-1R ligand, IL-34. Accordingly, CSF-1 depletion from Nestin+ cells led to severe depletion and transcriptional alterations of cerebellar microglia, while microglia in the forebrain remained intact. Strikingly, CSF-1 deficiency and alteration of cerebellar microglia were associated with reduced Purkinje cells, altered neuronal function, and defects in motor learning and social novelty interactions. These findings reveal a novel CSF-1-CSF-1R signaling-mediated mechanism that contributes to motor function and social behavior.

Our ability to recognise objects in peripheral vision is fundamentally limited by crowding [1-3], the deleterious effect of clutter that disrupts features ranging from orientation [4] and colour [5, 6] to motion [7] and depth [8, 9]. Prior research is equivocal on whether this reflects a singular process that disrupts all features simultaneously or multiple processes that affect each independently [5, 10-12]. We examined crowding for colour and motion, two features that allow a strong test of feature independence. 'Cowhide' stimuli were presented 15 degrees in peripheral vision, either in isolation or surrounded by flankers to give crowding. Observers reported either the target hue (blue/purple) or its direction (clockwise/counter-clockwise from upwards). We first established that both dimensions show systematic crowded errors (predominantly biased towards the flanker identities) and selectivity for target-flanker similarity (with reduced crowding for dissimilar elements). The multiplicity of crowding was then tested with observers identifying both features: a singular object-selective mechanism predicts that when crowding is weak in one dimension and strong for the other that crowding should be all-or-none for both. In contrast, when crowding was weak for colour and strong for motion, errors were reduced for colour but remained for motion, and vice versa with weak motion and strong colour crowding. This double dissociation follows the predictions of independent crowding processes, suggesting that crowding disrupts vision in a feature-specific manner. The ability to recognise one aspect of a cluttered scene (like colour) thus offers no guarantees for the correct recognition of other aspects (like motion).

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/639310v1?rss=1">Neural oscillations while remembering traumatic memories in PTSD</a></h4>

Background: In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the traumatic event is often re-experienced through vivid sensory fragments of the traumatic experience. Though the sensory phenomenology of traumatic memories is well established, neural indications for this qualitative experience are lacking. The current study aimed at monitoring the oscillatory brain activity of PTSD patients during directed and imaginal exposure to the traumatic memory using magnetoencephalography (MEG), in a paradigm resembling exposure therapy. Methods: Brain activity of healthy trauma-exposed controls and PTSD participants was measured with MEG as they listened to individualized trauma narratives as well as to a neutral narrative and as they imagined the narrative in detail. Source localization analysis on varied frequency bands was conducted in order to map neural generators of altered oscillatory activity. Results: PTSD patients exhibited increased power of high-frequency bands over visual areas and increased delta and theta power over auditory areas in response to trauma recollection compared to neutral recollection, while controls did not show such differential activation. PTSD participants also showed abnormal modulation of lower frequencies in the medial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: Elicitation of traumatic memories results in a distinct neural pattern in PTSD patients compared to healthy trauma-exposed individuals. Investigating the oscillatory neural dynamics of PTSD patients can help us better understand the processes underlying trauma re-experiencing.

In the human sensorimotor cortex, some long-range corticocortical connections appear to preserve a fine-scale topology, in which physically close locations in the cortical region are functionally connected to physically close locations in other cortical regions. However, little is known about whether such topography preservation is unique to the sensorimotor areas or is general across other cortical areas. To investigate this question, we measured voxel-level functional connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and visualized the fine-scale spatial organization of the connectivity patterns across the cortical surface. We found topographical preservation across regions, including the default mode network. Our results suggest that the topographical preservation of functional connectivity is not restricted to the sensorimotor cortex but also occurs in the association cortex.

Non-invasive brain stimulation reliably modulates brain activity and symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, stimulation effects substantially vary across individuals and brain regions. We combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neuronal basis of inter-individual and inter-areal differences after TMS. We found that stimulating sensory and cognitive areas yielded fundamentally heterogeneous effects. Stimulation of occipital cortex enhanced brain-wide functional connectivity and generative modeling of endogenous activity identified increased local inhibition and forward-signaling after TMS. Conversely, frontal stimulation decreased functional connectivity, associated with local disinhibition and disruptions of both feedforward and feedback connections. Finally, we identified brain-wide functional integration as a predictive marker for these heterogeneous stimulation effects in individual subjects. Together, our study suggests that modeling of local and global signaling parameters of a target area will improve the specificity of non-invasive brain stimulation for research and clinical applications.

<p>by Piotr Bentkowski, Jacek Radwan</p>

MHC genes, which code for proteins responsible for presenting pathogen-derived antigens to the host immune system, show remarkable copy-number variation both between and within species. However, the evolutionary forces driving this variation are poorly understood. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate whether evolution of the number of MHC variants in the genome can be shaped by the number of pathogen species the host population encounters (pathogen richness). Our model assumed that while increasing a range of pathogens recognised, expressing additional MHC variants also incurs costs such as an increased risk of autoimmunity. We found that pathogen richness selected for high MHC copy number only when the costs were low. Furthermore, the shape of the association was modified by the rate of pathogen evolution, with faster pathogen mutation rates selecting for increased host MHC copy number, but only when pathogen richness was low to moderate. Thus, taking into account factors other than pathogen richness may help explain wide variation between vertebrate species in the number of MHC genes. Within population, variation in the number of unique MHC variants carried by individuals (INV) was observed under most parameter combinations, except at low pathogen richness. This variance gave rise to positive correlations between INV and host immunocompetence (proportion of pathogens recognised). However, within-population variation in host immunocompetence declined with pathogen richness. Thus, counterintuitively, pathogens can contribute more to genetic variance for host fitness in species exposed to fewer pathogen species, with consequences to predictions from “Hamilton-Zuk” theory of sexual selection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WrYdAi7ec8M" width="1" />

<p>by Loreen Hertäg, Henning Sprekeler</p>

GABAergic interneurons play an important role in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs). How the various inhibitory cell types contribute to neuronal information processing, however, is not resolved. Here, we propose a functional role for a widespread network motif consisting of parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. Following the idea that PV and SOM interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, we suggest that mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM cells translates weak inputs to VIP interneurons into large changes of somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, we show that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or canceled.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cHeR4X37sog" width="1" />

Author summary: Improvements in technology often drive scientific discovery. Therefore, research requires sustained investment in the latest equipment and training for the researchers who are going to use it. Prioritising and administering infrastructure investment is challenging because future needs are difficult to predict. In the past, highly computationally demanding research was associated primarily with particle physics and astronomy experiments. However, as biology becomes more quantitative and bioscientists generate more and more data, their computational requirements may ultimately exceed those of physical scientists. Computation has always been central to bioinformatics, but now imaging experiments have rapidly growing data processing and storage requirements. There is also an urgent need for new modelling and simulation tools to provide insight and understanding of these biophysical experiments. Bioscience communities must work together to provide the software and skills training needed in their areas. Research-active institutions need to recognise that computation is now vital in many more areas of discovery and create an environment where it can be embraced. The public must also become aware of both the power and limitations of computing, particularly with respect to their health and personal data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/juDy-TmxPJM" width="1" />

Somatosensory thalamocortical (TC) neurons from the ventrobasal (VB) thalamus are central components in the flow of sensory information between the periphery and the cerebral cortex, and participate in the dynamic regulation of thalamocortical states including wakefulness and sleep. This property is reflected at the cellular level by the ability to generate action potentials in two distinct firing modes, called tonic firing and low-threshold bursting. Although the general properties of TC neurons are known, we still lack a detailed characterization of their morphological and electrical properties in the VB thalamus. The aim of this study was to build biophysically-detailed models of VB TC neurons explicitly constrained with experimental data from rats. We recorded the electrical activity of VB neurons (N = 49) and reconstructed morphologies in 3D (N = 50) by applying standardized protocols. After identifying distinct electrical types, we used a multi-objective optimization to fit single neuron electrical models (e-models), which yielded multiple solutions consistent with the experimental data. The models were tested for generalization using electrical stimuli and neuron morphologies not used during fitting. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that the e-models are robust to small parameter changes and that all the parameters were constrained by one or more features. The e-models, when tested in combination with different morphologies, showed that the electrical behavior is substantially preserved when changing dendritic structure and that the e-models were not overfit to a specific morphology. The models and their analysis show that automatic parameter search can be applied to capture complex firing behavior, such as co-existence of tonic firing and low-threshold bursting over a wide range of parameter sets and in combination with different neuron morphologies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_9xs4TQa7N4" width="1" />

Abstract<p>External thermosensation is crucial to regulate animal behavior and homeostasis, but the development of the mammalian thermosensory system is not well known. We investigated if temperature could play a role in the control of movements in a mammalian model born very immature, the opossum (<i>Monodelphis domestica</i>). Like other marsupials, at birth the opossum performs alternate and rhythmic movements with its forelimbs to reach a teat where it attaches in order to continue its development. It was shown that forelimb movements can be induced by mechanical stimulation of the snout in <i>in vitro</i> preparations of newborns consisting of the neuraxis with skin and forelimbs intact. In the present study, we used puff ejections of cold, neutral (bath temperature) and hot liquid directed towards the snout to induce forelimb responses in such preparations. Either the responses were visually observed under a microscope or triceps muscle activity was recorded. Cold liquid systematically induced forelimb movements and triceps contractions, but neutral and hot temperatures were less potent to do so. Sections of the trigeminal nerves and removal of the facial skin diminished responses to cold and nearly abolished those to hot and neutral stimulations. TRPM8 being the major cold receptor cation channel in adult mammals, we employed immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR to test for its expression, but found that it is not expressed before 13 postnatal days. Overall our results indicate that cold thermosensation exerts a strong influence on motor behaviors in newborn opossums.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> External thermosensation is crucial for survival, but its development in mammals is not well understood, particularly at the systemic level. Herein, we tested if temperature perceived by the face influences motor behaviors in newborn opossums, a marsupial with a gestation period one week shorter than rodents of comparable size, thus offering access to early developmental stages. We found that cold temperatures systematically induced forelimb motor responses, but neutral and hot temperatures rarely did so. Moreover, in newborn opossums, cold thermosensation does not involve the major cold receptor in adult mammals, TRPM8. Cold avoidance may be important to sustain motor behaviors of newborn marsupials, when they must find a teat and attach to it in order to pursue their development.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The striatum is a key hub in the basal ganglia for processing neural information from the sensory, motor and limbic cortices. The massive and diverse cortical inputs entering the striatum allow the basal ganglia to perform a repertoire of neurological functions ranging from basic level of motor control to high level of cognition. The heterogeneity of the corticostriatal circuits, however, also renders the system susceptible to a repertoire of neurological diseases. Clinical and animal model studies have indicated that defective development of the corticostriatal circuits is linked to various neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Importantly, many neuropsychiatric disease-risk genes have been found to form the molecular building blocks of the circuit wiring at the synaptic level. It is therefore imperative to understand how corticostriatal connectivity is established during development. Here, we review the construction during development of these corticostriatal circuits at the synaptic level, which should provide important insights into the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders related to the basal ganglia and help the development of appropriate therapies for these diseases.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cortico-basal ganglia circuits control a range of neurobiological functions, ranging from motor control and reward to cognition. The functional diversity of cortico-basal ganglia circuits rests on their diverse inputs from the cerebral cortex. It is likely that the highly heterogeneous nature of corticostriatal inputs makes the corticostriatal circuits vulnerable to a broad range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here, we highlight the developmental progression and maturation of the morphology and physiology of corticostriatal pathways using neonatal and postnatal rodent brains. We also review the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental disorders that are related to dysfunctions of corticostriatal circuits. Exploring synaptic wiring of corticostriatal circuits should create a research window for the development of therapeutic approaches for treating basal ganglia-related neurological disorders.</p>

Abstract<p>Reward-related behavior is complex and its dysfunction correlated with neuropsychiatric illness. Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have long been associated with different aspects of reward function, but it remains to be disentangled how distinct VTA dopamine neurons contribute to the full range of behaviors ascribed to the VTA. Here, a recently identified subtype of VTA neurons molecularly defined by NeuroD6 (NEX1M) was addressed. Among all VTA dopamine neurons, less than 15% were identified as positive for NeuroD6. In addition to dopaminergic markers, sparse NeuroD6 neurons expressed the <i>Vesicular glutamate transporter 2</i> gene. To achieve manipulation of NeuroD6 VTA neurons, NeuroD6(NEX)-Cre-driven mouse genetics and optogenetics were implemented. First, expression of <i>Vesicular monoamine transporter 2</i> was ablated to disrupt dopaminergic function in NeuroD6 VTA neurons. Comparing <i>Vmat2<sup>lox/lox;NEX-Cre</sup></i> conditional knockout (cKO) mice with littermate controls, it was evident that baseline locomotion, preference for sugar and ethanol, and place preference upon amphetamine- and cocaine-induced conditioning were similar between genotypes. However, locomotion upon repeated psychostimulant administration was significantly elevated above control level in cKO mice. Second, optogenetic activation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons was shown to induce dopamine release and glutamatergic post-synaptic currents within the nucleus accumbens. Third, optogenetic stimulation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons <i>in vivo</i> induced significant place preference behavior, while stimulation of VTA neurons defined by Calretinin failed to cause a similar response. The results show that NeuroD6 VTA neurons exert distinct regulation over specific aspects of reward-related behavior, findings that contribute to the current understanding of VTA neurocircuitry.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Reward-related behavior is complex and its dysfunction is implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders, including drug addiction. Midbrain dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are crucial for reward behavior, but due to recently uncovered heterogeneity, it remains to be fully resolved how they regulate reward responsiveness and how their dysfunction might contribute to disease. Here we show that the recently described NeuroD6 (NEX) subtype of VTA dopamine neurons is involved in psychostimulant sensitization and that optogenetic stimulation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons induces dopamine release, glutamatergic post-synaptic currents and real time place preference behavior. NeuroD6 VTA neurons thus exert distinct regulation over specific aspects of reward-related behavior, findings that contribute to the current understanding of VTA neurocircuitry.</p>

<p>Mapping all the neurons in the brain requires automatic reconstruction of
entire cells from volume electron microscopy data. The flood-filling networks
(FFN) architecture can achieve leading performance. However, the training of
the network is computationally very expensive. In order to reduce the training
time, we implemented synchronous and data-parallel distributed training using
the Horovod framework on top of the published FFN code. We demonstrated the
scaling of FFN training up to 1024 Intel Knights Landing (KNL) nodes at Argonne
Leadership Computing Facility. We investigated the training accuracy with
different optimizers, learning rates, and optional warm-up periods. We
discovered that square root scaling for learning rate works best beyond 16
nodes, which is contrary to the case of smaller number of nodes, where linear
learning rate scaling with warm-up performs the best. Our distributed training
reaches 95% accuracy in approximately 4.5 hours on 1024 KNL nodes using Adam
optimizer.

<p>Information processing in the brain is conducted by a concerted action of
multiple neural populations. Gaining insights in the organization and dynamics
of such populations can best be studied with broadband intracranial recordings
of so-called extracellular field potential, reflecting neuronal spiking as well
as mesoscopic activities, such as waves, oscillations, intrinsic large
deflections, and multiunit spiking activity. Such signals are critical for our
understanding of how neuronal ensembles encode sensory information and how such
information is integrated in the large networks underlying cognition. The
aforementioned principles are now well accepted, yet the efficacy of extracting
information out of the complex neural data, and their employment for improving
our understanding of neural networks, critically depends on the mathematical
processing steps ranging from simple detection of action potentials in noisy
traces - to fitting advanced mathematical models to distinct patterns of the
neural signal potentially underlying intra-processing of information, e.g.
interneuronal interactions. Here, we present a robust strategy for detecting
signals in broadband and noisy time series such as spikes, sharp waves and
multi-unit activity data that is solely based on the intrinsic statistical
distribution of the recorded data. By using so-called higher criticism - a
second-level significance testing procedure comparing the fraction of observed
significances to an expected fraction under the global null - we are able to
detect small signals in correlated noisy time-series without prior filtering,
denoising or data regression. Results demonstrate the efficiency and
reliability of the method and versatility over a wide range of experimental
conditions and suggest the appropriateness of higher criticism to characterize
neuronal dynamics without prior manipulation of the data.

<p>The theory of communication through coherence (CTC) proposes that brain
oscillations reflect changes in the excitability of neurons, and therefore the
successful communication between two oscillating neural populations depends not
only on the strength of the signal emitted but also on the relative phases
between them. More precisely, effective communication occurs when the emitting
and receiving populations are properly phase locked so the inputs sent by the
emitting population arrive at the phases of maximal excitability of the
receiving population. To study this setting, we consider a population rate
model consisting of excitatory and inhibitory cells modelling the receiving
population, and we perturb it with a time-dependent periodic function modelling
the input from the emitting population. We consider the stroboscopic map for
this system and compute numerically the fixed and periodic points of this map
and their bifurcations as the amplitude and the frequency of the perturbation
are varied. From the bifurcation diagram, we identify the phase-locked states
as well as different regions of bistability. We explore carefully the dynamics
emphasizing its implications for the CTC theory. In particular, we study how
the input gain depends on the timing between the input and the inhibitory
action of the receiving population. Our results show that naturally an optimal
phase locking for CTC emerges, and provide a mechanism by which the receiving
population can implement selective communication. Moreover, the presence of
bistable regions, suggests a mechanism by which different communication regimes
between brain areas can be established without changing the structure of the
network

<p>Sleep change is commonly reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and
their brain wave studies show decrease in dreaming and non-dreaming stages.
Although sleep disturbance is generally considered as a consequence of AD, it
might also be a risk factor of AD as new biological evidence shows. Leveraging
National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR), we built a unique cohort of 83 cases
and 331 controls with clinical variables and EEG signals. Supervised tensor
factorization method was applied for this temporal dataset to extract
discriminative sleep patterns. Among the 30 patterns extracted, we identified 5
significant patterns (4 patterns for AD likely and 1 pattern for normal ones)
and their visual patterns provide interesting linkage to sleep with repeated
wakefulness, insomnia, epileptic seizure, and etc. This study is preliminary
but findings are interesting, which is a first step to provide quantifiable
evidences to measure sleep as a risk factor of AD.

Although we know a great deal about monosynaptic connectivity, transmission and integration in the mammalian nervous system from in vitro studies, very little is known in vivo. This is partly because it is technically difficult to evoke action potentials and simultaneously record small amplitude subthreshold responses in closely (&lt; 150 µm) located pairs of neurons. To address this, we have developed in vivo two-photon targeted multiple (2 – 4) whole-cell patch clamp recordings of nearby neurons in superficial cortical layers 1 to 3. Here we describe a step-by-step guide to this approach in the anesthetised mouse primary somatosensory cortex, including: the design of the setup, surgery, preparation of pipettes, targeting and acquisition of multiple whole-cell recordings, as well as in vivo and post-hoc histology. The procedure takes ~ 4 hours from start of surgery to end of recording and allows examinations both into the electrophysiological features of unitary excitatory and inhibitory monosynaptic inputs during different brain states as well as the synaptic mechanisms of correlated neuronal activity.

Background: Syndecan-1 is an important component of endothelial cell glycocalyx, and has been reported to be a negative regulator of various inflammatory processes. The clinical implication of circulating and CSF syndecan-1 (sCD138) in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis remains unclear.
Objective: We aimed to investigate the association of serum and CSF syndecan-1 levels in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients.
Methods: A total of 27 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, 11 viral meningoencephalitis and 22 controls were enrolled in this study. At the time of admission and 3-6-month follow-up, all patients, were measured sCD138, TNF-α, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in serum and CSF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
Results: Serum and CSF levels of sCD138 were significantly increased in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Furthermore, at 3-6 months follow-up, CSF levels of sCD138 were significantly decreased in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients. Changes of sCD138 levels also significantly correlated to ameliorate of mRS scores in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
Conclusions: In anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients, high circulating and CSF sCD138 is associated with inflammation and poor clinical prognosis. In this study, we present data supporting the sCD138 as a new biomarker for inflammation of anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00113">Comprehensive Modeling of Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects motor neurons, primarily in young children. SMA is caused by mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. SMN functions in the assembly of spliceosomal RNPs and is well conserved in many model systems including mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, nematode, and fission yeast. Work in Drosophila has primarily focused on loss of SMN function during larval stages, primarily using null alleles or strong hypomorphs. A systematic analysis of SMA-related phenotypes in the context of moderate alleles that more closely mimic the genetics of SMA has not been performed in the fly, leading to debate over the validity and translational value of this model. We therefore examined fourteen Drosophila lines expressing SMA patient-derived missense mutations in Smn, with a focus on neuromuscular phenotypes in the adult stage. Animals were evaluated on the basis of organismal viability and longevity, locomotor function, neuromuscular junction structure, and muscle health. In all cases, we observed phenotypes similar to those of SMA patients, including progressive loss of adult motor function. The severity of these defects is variable, and forms a broad spectrum across the fourteen lines examined, recapitulating the full range of phenotypic severity observed in human SMA. This includes late-onset models of SMA, which have been difficult to produce in other model systems. The results provide direct evidence that SMA-related locomotor decline can be reproduced in the fly and support the use of patient-derived SMN missense mutations as a comprehensive system for modeling SMA.

Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) is a focal neurodegenerative disease with a strong genetic background, that causes early onset dementia. The present knowledge about the risk loci and causative mutations of FTD mainly derives from genetic linkage analysis, studies of candidate genes, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) applications. In this review we report recent insights into the genetics of FTD, and, specifically, the results achieved thanks to GWAS and NGS approaches. Linkage studies of large FTD pedigrees have prompted the identification of causal mutations in different genes: mutations in C9orf72, MAPT and GRN genes explain the large majority of cases with a high family history of the disease. In cases with a less clear inheritance, GWAS and NGS have contributed to further understand the genetic picture of FTD. GWAS identified several common genetic variants with a modest risk effect. Of interest, many of these variants are in genes belonging to the endo-lysosomal pathway, the immune response and neuronal survival. On the opposite, the NGS approach allowed the identification of rare variants with a strong risk effect. These variants were identified in known FTD-associated genes and again in genes, involved in the endo-lysosomal pathway and in the immune response. Interestingly, both approaches demonstrated that several genes are associated to multiple neurodegenerative disorders including FTD. Thanks to these complementary approaches, the genetic picture of FTD is becoming more clear and novel key molecular processes are emerging. This will foster opportunities to move toward prevention and therapy for this incurable disease.

Embelin is well known in ethnomedicine and reported to have central nervous system activities. However, there is no report on blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of embelin. Here the BBB permeability of embelin was evaluated using in vitro primary porcine brain endothelial cell (PBEC) model of the BBB. Embelin was also evaluated for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and docking prediction for interaction with AChE and amyloid beta (Aβ) binding sites. Embelin was found to be non-toxic to the PBECs and did not disturb the PBEC barrier function. The PBECs showed restrictive tight junctions with average transendothelial electrical resistance of 365.37 ± 113.00 Ω.cm2, for monolayers used for permeability assays. Permeability assays were conducted from apical-to-basolateral direction (blood-to-brain side). Embelin showed apparent permeability (Papp) value of 35.46 + 20.33 × 10-6 cm/s with 85.53% recovery. In vitro AChE inhibitory assay demonstrated that embelin could inhibit the enzyme. Molecular docking study showed that embelin binds well to active site of AChE with CDOCKER interaction energy of -65.75 kcal/mol which correlates with the in vitro results. Docking of embelin with Aβ peptides also revealed the promising binding with low CDOCKER interaction energy. Thus, findings from this study indicate that embelin could be a suitable molecule to be further developed as therapeutic molecule to treat neurological disorders particularly Alzheimer's disease.

S100 proteins are calcium-binding proteins that regulate several processes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but whose contribution and direct involvement in disease pathophysiology remains to be fully established. Due to neuroinflammation in AD patients, the levels of several S100 proteins are increased in the brain and some S100s play roles related to the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), regulation of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) levels and Tau phosphorylation. S100 proteins are found associated with protein inclusions, either within plaques or as isolated S100-positive puncta, which suggests an active role in the formation of amyloid aggregates. Indeed, interactions between S100 proteins and aggregating Aβ indicate regulatory roles over the aggregation process, which may either delay or aggravate aggregation, depending on disease stage and relative S100 and Aβ levels. Additionally, S100s are also known to influence AD-related signaling pathways and levels of other cytokines. Recent evidence also suggests that metal-ligation by S100 proteins influences trace metal homeostasis in the brain, particularly of zinc, which is also a major deregulated process in AD. Altogether, this evidence strongly suggests a role of S100 proteins as key players in several AD-linked physiopathological processes, which we discuss in this review.

IMPORTANCE Accumulating evidence suggests that serum levels of S100B may play a role in epilepsy.
OBJECTIVE We performed a meta-analysis to quantitatively summarize the serum S100B data available for patients with epilepsy. 
DATA SOURCE Two independent researchers conducted a systematic s investigation of Harvard Hollis+, Open Grey, Clinicaltrials, Wanfangdata and CNKI databases through February 8, 2018, for all studies published in English and Chinese. The search terms included S100B, Calcium-binding protein B in combination with Epilepsy. 
STUDY SELECTION Original studies and reported data from these search terms are included. Studies that data were overlapped with other studies were excluded. 
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Investigators extracted, pooled and analysed data from the included studies using a Fixed-effects model in the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis3.3 and R software. 
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Peripheral blood levels of S100B in patients with epilepsy compared with controls. Aberrations in Peripheral blood levels of S100B were hypothesized to be related to epilepsy.
RESULTS A fixed -effects meta-analysis of all 18 studies, including 1057 unique participants, indicated that patients with Epilepsy had significantly increased peripheral blood levels of S100B compared to controls (Hedges g = 1.568, 95% CI =1.431-1.706, P 0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed that no single study significantly influenced the overall association of peripheral blood levels of S100B and the Epilepsy. Most of the subgroup analyses, including those of Country, assay type and publication language, demonstrated a statistically significant association between peripheral blood levels of S100B and the Epilepsy. Meta-regression analyses indicated that suggesting that more Gender and  Mean age might present serum S100B reductions, but samples size, years, assay type, publication language and country did not show moderating effects on the effect sizes. Furthermore, the trim-and-fill method used to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry in our meta-analysis confirmed that a positive outcome is unlikely to be due to publication bias.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE The results of this meta-analysis provide evidence for a significant increase in serum S100B levels in patients with Epilepsy. Serum S100B is the most worthwhile biomarker of Epilepsy, which is helpful for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of epilepsy.

Much evidence suggests a protective role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and its major apolipoprotein apoA-I, in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The biogenesis of nascent HDL derived from a first lipidation of apoA-I, which is synthesized by the liver and intestine but not in the brain, in a process mediated by ABCA1. The maturation of nascent HDL in mature spherical HDL is due to a subsequent lipidation step, LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification and the change of apoA-I conformation. Therefore, different subclasses of apoA-I-HDL simultaneously exist in the blood circulation. Here, we investigated if and how the lipidation state affects the ability of apoA-I-HDL to target and modulate the cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) content from the periphery, that is thus far unclear. In particular, different subclasses of HDL, each with different apoA-I lipidation state, were purified from human plasma and their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), to interact with Abeta aggregates, and to affect Abeta efflux across the BBB was assessed in vitro using a transwell system. The results showed that discoidal HDL displayed a superior capability to promote Abeta efflux in vitro (9 x 10-5 cm/min), when compared to apoA-I in other lipidation states. In particular, no effect on Abeta efflux was detected when apoA-I was in mature spherical HDL, suggesting that apoA-I conformation and lipidation could play a role in Abeta clearance from the brain. Finally, when apoA-I folded its structure in discoidal HDL, rather than in spherical ones, it was able to cross the BBB in vitro and strongly destabilize the conformation of Aβ fibrils by decreasing the order of the fibril structure (-24%) and the beta-sheet content (-14%).
These data suggest that the extent of apoA-I lipidation, and consequently its conformation, may represent crucial features that could exert their protective role in AD pathogenesis.

IIn myelinated fibers, the voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1 are concentrated at the nodal gap to ensure the saltatory propagation of action potentials. The voltage-gated potassium channels Kv1 are segregated at the juxtaparanodes under the compact myelin sheath and may stabilize axonal conduction. It has been recently reported that hippocampal GABAergic neurons display high density of Nav1 channels remarkably in clusters along the axon before myelination (Freeman et al., 2015). In inhibitory neurons, the Nav1 channels are trapped by the ankyrinG scaffold at the axon initial segment (AIS) as observed in pyramidal and granule neurons, but are also forming “pre-nodes”, which may accelerate conduction velocity in pre-myelinated axons. However, the distribution of the Kv1 channels along the pre-myelinated inhibitory axons is still unknown. In the present study, we show that two subtypes of hippocampal GABAergic neurons, namely the somatostatin and parvalbumin positive cells, display a selective high expression of Kv1 channels at the AIS and all along the unmyelinated axons. These inhibitory axons are also highly enriched in molecules belonging to the juxtaparanodal Kv1 complex, including the cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) TAG-1, Caspr2 and ADAM22 and the scaffolding protein 4.1B. Here, taking advantage of hippocampal cultures from 4.1B and TAG-1 knock-out mice, we observed that 4.1B is required for the proper positioning of Caspr2 and TAG-1 along the distal axon, and that TAG-1 deficiency induces alterations in the axonal distribution of Caspr2. However, the axonal expression of Kv1 channels and clustering of ankyrinG were not modified. In conclusion, this study allowed the analysis of the hierarchy between channels, CAMs and scaffolding proteins for their expression along hippocampal inhibitory axons before myelination. The early steps of channel compartmentalization preceding myelination may be crucial for stabilizing nerve impulses switching from a continuous to saltatory conduction during network development.

Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene. The onset of symptoms is preceded by synaptic dysfunction. Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) refers to processes that maintain the stability of networks of neurons, thought to be required to enable new learning and cognitive flexibility. One type of HSP is synaptic scaling, in which the strength of all of the synapses onto a cell increases or decreases following changes in the cell’s level of activity. Several pathways implicated in synaptic scaling are dysregulated in HD, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and calcium signaling. Here, we investigated whether HSP is disrupted in cortical neurons from an HD mouse model. We treated cultured cortical neurons from wild-type (WT) FVB/N or YAC128 HD mice with tetrodotoxin (TTX) for 48 hours to silence action potentials and then recorded miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). In WT cultures, these increased in both amplitude and frequency after TTX treatment, and further experiments showed that this was a result of insertion of AMPA receptors and formation of new synapses, respectively. Manipulation of BDNF concentration in the culture medium revealed that BDNF signaling contributed to these changes. In contrast to WT cortical neurons, YAC128 cultures showed no response to action potential silencing. Strikingly, we were able to restore the TTX-induced changes in YAC128 cultures by treating them with pridopidine, a drug which enhances BDNF signaling through stimulation of the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), and with the S1R agonist 3-PPP. These data provide evidence for disruption of HSP in cortical neurons from an HD mouse model that is restored by stimulation of S1R. Our results suggest a potential new direction for developing therapy to mitigate cognitive deficits in HD.

Radiotherapy is a highly effective tool for the treatment of brain cancer. However, radiation also causes detrimental effects in the healthy tissue, leading to neurocognitive sequelae that compromise the quality of life of brain cancer patients. Despite the recognition of this serious complication, no satisfactory solutions exist at present. Here we investigated the effects of intranasal administration of human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSCs) as a neuroprotective strategy for cranial radiation in mice. Our results demonstrated that intranasally delivered hMSCs promote radiation-induced brain injury repair, improving neurological function. This intervention confers protection against inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal loss. hMSC administration reduces persistent activation of damage-induced c-AMP response element-binding signaling in irradiated brains. Furthermore, hMSC treatment did not compromise the survival of glioma-bearing mice. Our findings encourage the therapeutic use of hMSCs as a non-invasive approach to prevent neurological complications of radiotherapy, improving the quality of life of brain tumor patients.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00203">The Slow Depolarization Following Individual Spikes in Thin, Unmyelinated Axons in Mammalian Cortex</a></h4>

An important goal in neuroscience is to understand how neuronal excitability is controlled. Therefore, Gardner-Medwin’s 1972 discovery, that cerebellar parallel fibers were more excitable up to 100 ms after individual action potentials, could have had great impact. If this long-lasting effect were due to intrinsic membrane mechanisms causing a depolarizing after-potential (DAP) this was an important finding. However, that hypothesis met resistance because the use of K+ sensitive electrodes showed that synchronous activation, as commonly used in excitability tests, increased extracellular K+ concentration sufficiently to explain much of the hyperexcitability. It is still controversial because intra-axonal recordings, which could have settled the debate, have not been made from parallel fibers or other axons of similar calibers. If it had not been for the fact that such thin axons are, by far, the most common axon type in cortical areas and control almost all glutamate release, it would be tempting to ignore them until an appropriate intra-axonal recording technique is invented. 
I will go through the literature that, taken together, supports the hypothesis that a DAP is an intrinsic membrane mechanism due to a well-controlled process that stops the fast repolarization at a membrane potential positive to resting membrane potential, leaving the membrane more excitable for ~100 ms during a slow, passive discharge of the membrane capacitance. The DAP helps reduce failures but can also cause uncontrolled bursting if it is not properly controlled. The voltage at which the fast repolarization stops, and the DAP starts, is close the activation range of both Na+ and Ca2+ voltage activated channels and is therefore essential for neuronal function.

For adults age 65 and older, the brain shows acute functional connectivity decreases after total knee arthroplasty with the severity of change predicted by preoperative cognitive function and brain disease burden. The extent of acute structural microstructural brain changes acutely after surgery remains unknown within the literature. For the current study, we report on the severity of acute post-surgery microstructural brain changes as measured by diffusion imaging and free-water analysis. Participants who underwent total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia and non-surgery peers were part of a federally funded prospective cohort investigation involving participants. Recruitment occurred between 2013 – 2017. Data were collected in outpatient and inpatient settings within a university-affiliated medical center. A total of 232 TKA patients were referred by the study surgeon and contacted for study inclusion. Of these, 78 met inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed assessment. Five participants were excluded due to anesthetic protocol changes (spinal instead of general) with an additional 12 excluded for imaging-related complications. The total included sample size was 61. A total of 127 non-surgery participants were screened with 66 enrolled. One non-surgery participant was excluded for an imaging-related complication. Total knee arthroplasty and general anesthetic protocols were standardized. Participants received preoperative neurocognitive assessment and brain magnetic resonance imaging, with repeat imaging 48 hours after surgery or pseudosurgery. Free-water analyses were performed using diffusion weighted images and tract-based spatial statistics with baseline cognitive data used to predict free-water changes. Surgery participants had widespread increases in white matter free-water. Surgery participants with higher cognitive functions as measured by immediate memory and less evidence of brain atrophy and disease (i.e., brain integrity) had greater free-water increase. Non-surgery peers had no free-water change. We interpret the surgery group’s free-water change as indicating widespread brain white matter glial response, with greater change indicative of better brain response to the acute surgery/anesthesia experience.

Decline in information processing with age is well-documented in the scientific literature. However, some discrepancy remains in relation to which cognitive domains are most susceptible to the aging process and which may remain intact. Furthermore, information processing has not been investigated nor considered as a function of affect, familiarity and complexity of tasks in a single experimental study. Thus, the current study investigated rate of visual information processing in 67 young university students (Mage=19.64 years) and 33 educated healthy older adults (Mage=70.33 years), while accounting for depression, anxiety and stress symptoms using the DASS. Rates of visual processing were measured as minimum time of stimulus exposure duration required for correct object recognition on a simple visual task (Inspection Time [IT]), and on a more complex visual cognitive task known as Change Detection [CD]) as well as words per minute on a text reading task (FastaReada). Results demonstrated significantly slower performance by older adults on the IT and CD, but comparable rates of text reading on a semantically more complex, but ecologically valid and familiar visual task that requires organized sequential shifts in attention via eye movements, continuous visual processing, access to working memory and semantic comprehension. The results also demonstrated that affective influences did not play a role in the older adults task performance, and that changes in cognitive domains may begin with older adults being slower to attend to and identify newly appearing familiar objects, as well as slower to encode and embed new information in memory during tasks that require a less practiced/familiar task strategy.

Gestational infection causes various neurological deficits in offspring, such as age-related spatial learning and memory (SLM) decline. How inflammation causes age-related SLM dysfunction remains unknown. Previous research has indicated that histone modifications, such as phosphorylation of H3S10 (H3S10p) and trimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me3) may be involved. In our study, pregnant mice received an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 or 25 μg/kg) or normal saline during gestational days 15–17. After normal parturition, the offspring were randomly separated into 1-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 22-month-old groups. SLM performance was assessed using a radial six-arm water maze. The hippocampal levels of H3S10p and H3K9me3 were detected using an immunohistochemical method. The results indicated that the offspring had significantly impaired SLM, with decreased H3S10p and increased H3K9me3 levels from 12 months onward. Maternal LPS exposure during late gestation significantly and dose-dependently exacerbated the age-related impairment of SLM, with the decrease in H3S10p and increase in H3K9me3 beginning at 12 months in the offspring. The histone modifications (H3S10p and H3K9me3) were significantly correlated with impairment of SLM. Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to inflammation could exacerbate age-related impairments of SLM and changes in histone modifications in CD-1 mice from 12 months onward, and SLM impairment might be linked to decreased H3S10p and increased H3K9me3.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46740">Misfolded GPI-anchored proteins are escorted through the secretory pathway by ER-derived factors</a></h4>

We have used misfolded prion protein (PrP*) as a model to investigate how mammalian cells recognize and degrade misfolded GPI-anchored proteins. While most misfolded membrane proteins are degraded by proteasomes, misfolded GPI-anchored proteins are primarily degraded in lysosomes. Quantitative flow cytometry analysis showed that at least 85% of PrP* molecules transiently access the plasma membrane <i>en route</i> to lysosomes. Unexpectedly, time-resolved quantitative proteomics revealed a remarkably invariant PrP* interactome during its trafficking from the ER to lysosomes. Hence, PrP* arrives at the plasma membrane in complex with ER-derived chaperones and cargo receptors. These interaction partners were critical for rapid endocytosis because a GPI-anchored protein induced to misfold at the cell surface was not recognized effectively for degradation. Thus, resident ER factors have post-ER itineraries that not only shield misfolded GPI-anchored proteins during their trafficking, but also provide a quality control cue at the cell surface for endocytic routing to lysosomes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45961">PI3K-Yap activity drives cortical gyrification and hydrocephalus in mice</a></h4>

Mechanisms driving the initiation of brain folding are incompletely understood. We have previously characterized mouse models recapitulating human <i>PIK3CA</i>-related brain overgrowth, epilepsy, dysplastic gyrification and hydrocephalus (Roy et al., 2015). Using the same, highly regulatable brain-specific model, here we report PI3K-dependent mechanisms underlying gyrification of the normally smooth mouse cortex, and hydrocephalus. We demonstrate that a brief embryonic Pik3ca activation was sufficient to drive subtle changes in apical cell adhesion and subcellular Yap translocation, causing focal proliferation and subsequent initiation of the stereotypic 'gyrification sequence', seen in naturally gyrencephalic mammals. Treatment with verteporfin, a nuclear Yap inhibitor, restored apical surface integrity, normalized proliferation, attenuated gyrification and rescued the associated hydrocephalus, highlighting the interrelated role of regulated PI3K-Yap signaling in normal neural-ependymal development. Our data defines apical cell-adhesion as the earliest known substrate for cortical gyrification. In addition, our preclinical results support the testing of Yap-related small-molecule therapeutics for developmental hydrocephalus.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45472">Asymmetry between the two acidic patches dictates the direction of nucleosome sliding by the ISWI chromatin remodeler</a></h4>

The acidic patch is a functionally important epitope on each face of the nucleosome that affects chromatin remodeling. Although related by 2-fold symmetry of the nucleosome, each acidic patch is uniquely positioned relative to a bound remodeler. An open question is whether remodelers are distinctly responsive to each acidic patch. Previously we reported a method for homogeneously producing asymmetric nucleosomes with distinct H2A/H2B dimers (Levendosky et al., 2016). Here, we use this methodology to show that the Chd1 remodeler from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and ISWI remodelers from human and Drosophila have distinct spatial requirements for the acidic patch. Unlike Chd1, which is equally affected by entry- and exit-side mutations, ISWI remodelers strongly depend on the entry-side acidic patch. Remarkably, asymmetry in the two acidic patches stimulates ISWI to slide mononucleosomes off DNA ends, overriding the remodeler's preference to shift the histone core toward longer flanking DNA.

<i>Plasmodium vivax</i> hypnozoites persist in the liver, cause malaria relapse and represent a major challenge to malaria elimination. Our previous transcriptomic study provided a novel molecular framework to enhance our understanding of the hypnozoite biology (Voorberg-van der Wel A, et al., 2017). In this dataset, we identified and characterized the Liver-Specific Protein 2 (LISP2) protein as an early molecular marker of liver stage development. Immunofluorescence analysis of hepatocytes infected with relapsing malaria parasites, <i>in vitro </i>(<i>P. cynomolgi</i>) and <i>in vivo</i> (<i>P. vivax</i>), reveals that LISP2 expression discriminates between dormant hypnozoites and early developing parasites. We further demonstrate that prophylactic drugs selectively kill all LISP2 positive parasites, while LISP2 negative hypnozoites are only sensitive to anti-relapse drug tafenoquine. Our results provide novel biological insights in the initiation of liver stage schizogony and an early marker suitable for the development of drug discovery assays predictive of anti-relapse activity.

<p>by Jeongkyun Kim, Jung-jae Kim, Hyunju Lee</p>

Chemicals interact with genes in the process of disease development and treatment. Although much biomedical research has been performed to understand relationships among genes, chemicals, and diseases, which have been reported in biomedical articles in Medline, there are few studies that extract disease–gene–chemical relationships from biomedical literature at a PubMed scale. In this study, we propose a deep learning model based on bidirectional long short-term memory to identify the evidence sentences of relationships among genes, chemicals, and diseases from Medline abstracts. Then, we develop the search engine DigChem to enable disease–gene–chemical relationship searches for 35,124 genes, 56,382 chemicals, and 5,675 diseases. We show that the identified relationships are reliable by comparing them with manual curation and existing databases.

<p>by Karim Rajaei, Yalda Mohsenzadeh, Reza Ebrahimpour, Seyed-Mahdi Khaligh-Razavi</p>

Core object recognition, the ability to rapidly recognize objects despite variations in their appearance, is largely solved through the feedforward processing of visual information. Deep neural networks are shown to achieve human-level performance in these tasks, and explain the primate brain representation. On the other hand, object recognition under more challenging conditions (i.e. beyond the core recognition problem) is less characterized. One such example is object recognition under occlusion. It is unclear to what extent feedforward and recurrent processes contribute in object recognition under occlusion. Furthermore, we do not know whether the conventional deep neural networks, such as AlexNet, which were shown to be successful in solving core object recognition, can perform similarly well in problems that go beyond the core recognition. Here, we characterize neural dynamics of object recognition under occlusion, using magnetoencephalography (MEG), while participants were presented with images of objects with various levels of occlusion. We provide evidence from multivariate analysis of MEG data, behavioral data, and computational modelling, demonstrating an essential role for recurrent processes in object recognition under occlusion. Furthermore, the computational model with local recurrent connections, used here, suggests a mechanistic explanation of how the human brain might be solving this problem.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oJA8ILumRvM" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Type III taste cells in mammalian taste buds are implicated in the detection and communication of sour and some salty stimuli, as well as carbonation and water. With this variety of proposed roles, it is unclear what information activated type III cells are communicating to the CNS. To better elucidate the role of type III cells in the taste bud, we use a type III cell-specific protein (polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1) to drive Cre-dependent expression of light-sensitive channelrhodopsin (Ai32) in mouse type III taste cells. Activation of these cells with light produces a taste nerve response in both the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves, and elicits a slight but significant aversion in two-bottle preference tests in both male and female mice. Unlike previous reports (Zocchi et al., 2017), our mice did not react to blue light stimulation with sustained drinking responses. These data suggest that type III cells are capable of communicating the presence of aversive stimuli in the oral cavity, which is in line with their responsiveness to sour and high concentrations of salt stimuli.</p>

Abstract
<p>Currently there is no effective therapy available for cognitive impairments in Down syndrome (DS), one of the most prevalent forms of intellectual disability in humans associated with the chromosomes 21 trisomy. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that maintains glucose homeostasis by stimulating insulin secretion. Its natural cleavage product GLP-1 (9-36) lacks insulinotropic effects and has a low binding affinity for GLP-1 receptors; thus, GLP-1 (9-36) has historically been identified as an inactive metabolite. Conversely, recent work has demonstrated interesting physiological properties of GLP-1 (9-36) such as cardioprotection and neuroprotection. We have previously shown that GLP-1 (9-36) administration enhances neuronal plasticity in young WT mice and ameliorates cognitive deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we report that systemic administration of GLP-1 (9-36) in Ts65Dn DS model mice of either sex resulted in decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress in hippocampus and improved dendritic spine morphology, increase of mature spines and reduction of immature spines. Importantly, these molecular alterations translated into functional changes in that long-term potentiation failure and cognitive impairments in TsDn65 DS model mice were rescued with GLP-1 (9-36) treatment. We also show that chronic GLP-1 (9-36) treatment did not alter glucose tolerance in either WT or DS model mice. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 (9-36) treatment may have therapeutic potential for DS and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with increased neuronal oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Disruption in calcium homeostasis is linked to several pathologies and is suggested to play a pivotal role in the cascade of events leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Synaptopodin (SP) residing in dendritic spines has been associated with ryanodine receptor (RyR), such that spines lacking SP release less calcium from stores. In this work, we mated SPKO with 3xTg mice (3xTg/SPKO) to test the effect of SP deficiency in the AD mouse. We found that 6-month-old male 3xTg/SPKO mice restored normal spatial learning in the Barns maze, LTP in hippocampal slices, and expression levels of RyR in the hippocampus that were altered in the 3xTg mice. In addition, there was a marked reduction in 3xTg-associated phosphorylated tau, amyloid β plaques, and activated microglia in 3xTg/SPKO male and female mice. These experiments indicate that a reduction in the expression of SP ameliorates AD-associated phenotype in 3xTg mice.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study strengthens the proposed role of calcium stores in the development of AD-associated phenotype in the 3xTg mouse model, in that a genetic reduction of the functioning of ryanodine receptors using synaptopodin-knock-out mice ameliorates AD symptoms at the behavioral, electrophysiological, and morphological levels of analysis.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/20/3970?rss=1">Single Synapse Indicators of Impaired Glutamate Clearance Derived from Fast iGluu Imaging of Cortical Afferents in the Striatum of Normal and Huntington (Q175) Mice</a></h4>

<p>Changes in the balance between glutamate (Glu) release and uptake may stimulate synaptic reorganization and even synapse loss. In the case of neurodegeneration, a mismatch between astroglial Glu uptake and presynaptic Glu release could be detected if both parameters were assessed independently and at a single-synapse level. This has now become possible due to a new imaging assay with the genetically encoded ultrafast Glu sensor iGlu<i><sub>u</sub></i>. We report findings from individual corticostriatal synapses in acute slices prepared from mice of either sex that were &gt;1 year of age. Contrasting patterns of short-term plasticity and a size criterion identified two classes of terminals, presumably corresponding to the previously defined IT (intratelencephalic) and PT (pyramidal tract) synapses. The latter exhibited a higher degree of frequency potentiation/residual Glu accumulation and were selected for our first iGlu<i><sub>u</sub></i> single-synapse study in Q175 mice, a model of Huntington's disease (HD). In HD mice, the decay time constant of the perisynaptic Glu concentration (TauD), as an indicator of uptake, and the peak iGlu<i><sub>u</sub></i> amplitude, as an indicator of release, were prolonged and reduced, respectively. Treatment of WT preparations with the astrocytic Glu uptake blocker TFB-TBOA (100 nm) mimicked the TauD changes in homozygotes. Considering the largest TauD values encountered in WT, ~40% of PT synapses tested in Q175 heterozygotes can be classified as dysfunctional. Moreover, HD but not WT synapses exhibited a positive correlation between TauD and the peak amplitude of iGlu<i><sub>u</sub></i>. Finally, EAAT2 (excitatory amino acid transport protein 2) immunoreactivity was reduced next to corticostriatal terminals. Thus, astrocytic Glu transport remains a promising target for therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Alterations in astrocytic Glu uptake can play a role in synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Until now, the sensitivity of synaptic responses to pharmacological transport block and the resulting activation of NMDA receptors were regarded as reliable evidence for a mismatch between synaptic uptake and release. But the latter parameters are interdependent. Using a new genetically encoded sensor to monitor extracellular glutamate concentration ([Glu]) at individual corticostriatal synapses, we can now quantify the time constant of perisynaptic [Glu] decay (as an indicator of uptake) and the maximal [Glu] elevation next to the active zone (as an indicator of Glu release). The results provide a positive answer to the hitherto unresolved question of whether neurodegeneration (e.g., Huntington's disease) associates with a glutamate uptake deficit at tripartite excitatory synapses.</p>

<p>Purkinje cells (PCs) are primarily affected in neurodegenerative spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). For generating animal models for SCAs, genetic regulatory elements specifically targeting PCs are required, thereby linking pathological molecular effects with impaired function and organismic behavior. Because cerebellar anatomy and function are evolutionary conserved, zebrafish represent an excellent model to study SCAs <i>in vivo</i>. We have isolated a 258 bp cross-species PC-specific enhancer element that can be used in a bidirectional manner for bioimaging of transgene-expressing PCs in zebrafish (both sexes) with variable copy numbers for tuning expression strength. Emerging ectopic expression at high copy numbers can be further eliminated by repurposing microRNA-mediated posttranslational mRNA regulation.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we generated a transgenic SCA type 13 (SCA13) model, using a zebrafish-variant mimicking a human pathological SCA13<sup>R420H</sup> mutation, resulting in cell-autonomous progressive PC degeneration linked to cerebellum-driven eye-movement deficits as observed in SCA patients. This underscores that investigating PC-specific cerebellar neuropathologies in zebrafish allows for interconnecting bioimaging of disease mechanisms with behavioral analysis suitable for therapeutic compound testing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> SCA13 patients carrying a <i>KCNC3<sup>R420H</sup></i> allele have been shown to display mid-onset progressive cerebellar atrophy, but genetic modeling of SCA13 by expressing this pathogenic mutant in different animal models has not resulted in neuronal degeneration so far; likely because the transgene was expressed in heterologous cell types. We developed a genetic system for tunable PC-specific coexpression of several transgenes to manipulate and simultaneously monitor cerebellar PCs. We modeled a SCA13 zebrafish accessible for bioimaging to investigate disease progression, revealing robust PC degeneration, resulting in impaired eye movement. Our transgenic zebrafish mimicking both neuropathological and behavioral changes manifested in SCA-affected patients will be suitable for investigating causes of cerebellar diseases <i>in vivo</i> from the molecular to the behavioral level.</p>

<p>Cognitive control is necessary for goal-directed behavior, yet people treat cognitive control demand as a cost, which discounts the value of rewards in a similar manner as other costs, such as delay or risk. It is unclear, however, whether the subjective value (SV) of cognitive effort is encoded in the same putatively domain-general brain valuation network implicated in other cost domains, or instead engages a distinct frontoparietal network, as implied by recent studies. Here, we provide rigorous evidence that the valuation network, with core foci in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, also encodes SV during cognitive effort-based decision-making in healthy, male and female adult humans. We doubly dissociate this network from frontoparietal regions that are instead recruited as a function of decision difficulty. We show that the domain-general valuation network jointly and independently encodes both reward benefits and cognitive effort costs. We also demonstrate that cognitive effort SV signals predict choice and are influenced by state and trait motivation, including sensitivity to reward and anticipated task performance. These findings unify cognitive effort with other cost domains, and suggest candidate neural mechanisms underlying state and trait variation in willingness to expend cognitive effort.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Subjective effort costs are increasingly understood to diminish cognitive control over task performance and can thus undermine functioning across health and disease. Yet, we are only beginning to understand how decisions about cognitive effort are made. A key question is how subjective values are computed. Recent work suggests that the value of cognitive effort might be computed by networks that are distinct from those involved in other domains like intertemporal and risky decision-making, implying distinct mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that the domain-general network also encodes effort-discounted value, linking cognitive effort closely with other domains. Our results thus elucidate key mechanisms supporting decisions about cognitive effort, and point to candidate neural targets for intervention in disorders involving impaired cognitive motivation.</p>

<p>Perceptual decision making is an active process where animals move their sense organs to extract task-relevant information. To investigate how the brain translates sensory input into decisions during active sensation, we developed a mouse active touch task where the mechanosensory input can be precisely measured and that challenges animals to use multiple mechanosensory cues. Male mice were trained to localize a pole using a single whisker and to report their decision by selecting one of three choices. Using high-speed imaging and machine vision, we estimated whisker–object mechanical forces at millisecond resolution. Mice solved the task by a sensory-motor strategy where both the strength and direction of whisker bending were informative cues to pole location. We found competing influences of immediate sensory input and choice memory on mouse choice. On correct trials, choice could be predicted from the direction and strength of whisker bending, but not from previous choice. In contrast, on error trials, choice could be predicted from previous choice but not from whisker bending. This study shows that animal choices during active tactile decision making can be predicted from mechanosensory and choice-memory signals, and provides a new task well suited for the future study of the neural basis of active perceptual decisions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Due to the difficulty of measuring the sensory input to moving sense organs, active perceptual decision making remains poorly understood. The whisker system provides a way forward since it is now possible to measure the mechanical forces due to whisker–object contact during behavior. Here we train mice in a novel behavioral task that challenges them to use rich mechanosensory cues but can be performed using one whisker and enables task-relevant mechanical forces to be precisely estimated. This approach enables rigorous study of how sensory cues translate into action during active, perceptual decision making. Our findings provide new insight into active touch and how sensory/internal signals interact to determine behavioral choices.</p>

<p>Cognitive decision-making is known to be sensitive to the values of potential options, which are the probability and size of rewards associated with different choices. Here, we examine whether rapid motor responses to perturbations of visual feedback about movement, which mediate low-level and involuntary feedback control loops, reflect computations associated with high-level value-based decision-making. In three experiments involving human participants, we varied the value associated with different potential targets for reaching movements by controlling the distributions of rewards across the targets (Experiment 1), the probability with which each target could be specified (Experiment 2), or both (Experiment 3). We found that the size of rapid and involuntary feedback responses to movement perturbations was strongly influenced by the relative value between targets. A statistical model of relative value that includes a term for risk sensitivity provided the best fit to the visuomotor response data, illustrating that feedback control policies are biased to favor more frequent task success at the expense of the overall extrinsic reward accumulated through movement. Importantly however, the regulation of rapid feedback responses was associated with successful pursuit of high-value task outcomes. This implies that when we move, the brain specifies a set of feedback control gains that enable low-level motor areas not only to generate efficient and accurate movement, but also to rapidly and adaptively respond to evolving sensory information in a manner consistent with value-based decision-making.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Current theories of sensorimotor control suggest that, rather than selecting and planning the details of movements in advance, the role of the brain is to set time-varying feedback gains that continuously transform sensory information into motor commands by feedback control. Here, we examine whether the fastest motor responses to perturbations of movement, which mediate low-level and involuntary feedback control loops (i.e., reflexes), reflect computations associated with high-level, value-based decision-making. We find that rapid feedback responses during reaching reflect the relative probabilities and rewards associated with target options. This suggests that low-order components of the sensorimotor control hierarchy, which generate rapid and automatic responses, can continuously evaluate evolving sensory evidence and initiate responses according to the prospect of reward.</p>

<p>It is well established across many species that neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) display preference for visual input from one eye or the other, which is termed ocular dominance (OD). In rodents, V1 neurons exhibit a strong bias toward the contralateral eye. Molecular mechanisms of how OD is established and later maintained by plastic changes are largely unknown. Here we report a novel role of an activity-dependent immediate early gene Homer1a (H1a) in these processes. Using both sexes of H1a knock-out (KO) mice, we found that there is basal reduction in the OD index of V1 neurons measured using intrinsic signal imaging. This was because of a reduction in the strength of inputs from the contralateral eye, which is normally dominant in mice. The abnormal basal OD index was not dependent on visual experience and is driven by postnatal expression of H1a. Despite this, H1a KOs still exhibited normal shifts in OD index following a short-term (2–3 d) monocular deprivation (MD) of the contralateral eye with lid suture. However, unlike wild-type counterparts, H1a KOs continued to shift OD index with a longer duration (5–6 d) of MD. The same phenotype was recapitulated in a mouse model that has reduced Homer1 binding to metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Our results suggest a novel role of H1a and its interaction with mGluR5 in strengthening contralateral eye inputs during postnatal development to establish normal contralateral bias in mouse V1 without much impact on OD shift with brief MD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual cortical neurons display varying degree of responsiveness to visual stimuli through each eye, which determines their ocular dominance (OD). Molecular mechanisms responsible for establishing normal OD are largely unknown. Development of OD has been shown to be largely independent of visual experience, but guided by molecular cues and spontaneous activity. We found that activity-dependent immediate early gene H1a is critical for establishing normal OD in V1 of mice, which show contralateral eye dominance. Despite the weaker contralateral bias, H1aKOs undergo largely normal OD plasticity. The basic phenotype of H1aKO was recapitulated by mGluR5 mutation that severely reduces H1a interaction. Our results suggest a novel role of mGluR5-H1a interaction in strengthening contralateral eye inputs to V1 during postnatal development.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/20/3882?rss=1">Neural Maps of Interaural Time Difference in the American Alligator: A Stable Feature in Modern Archosaurs</a></h4>

<p>Detection of interaural time differences (ITDs) is crucial for sound localization in most vertebrates. The current view is that optimal computational strategies of ITD detection depend mainly on head size and available frequencies, although evolutionary history should also be taken into consideration. In archosaurs, which include birds and crocodiles, the brainstem nucleus laminaris (NL) developed into the critical structure for ITD detection. In birds, ITDs are mapped in an orderly array or place code, whereas in the mammalian medial superior olive, the analog of NL, maps are not found. As yet, in crocodilians, topographical representations have not been identified. However, nontopographic representations of ITD cannot be excluded due to different anatomical and ethological features of birds and crocodiles. Therefore, we measured ITD-dependent responses in the NL of anesthetized American alligators of either sex and identified the location of the recording sites by lesions made after recording. The measured extracellular field potentials, or neurophonics, were strongly ITD tuned, and their preferred ITDs correlated with the position in NL. As in birds, delay lines, which compensate for external time differences, formed maps of ITD. The broad distributions of best ITDs within narrow frequency bands were not consistent with an optimal coding model. We conclude that the available acoustic cues and the architecture of the acoustic system in early archosaurs led to a stable and similar organization in today's birds and crocodiles, although physical features, such as internally coupled ears, head size, or shape, and audible frequency range, vary among the two groups.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Interaural time difference (ITD) is an important cue for sound localization, and the optimal strategies for encoding ITD in neuronal populations are the subject of ongoing debate. We show that alligators form maps of ITD very similar to birds, suggesting that their common archosaur ancestor reached a stable coding solution different from mammals. Mammals and diapsids evolved tympanic hearing independently, and local optima can be reached in evolution that are not considered by global optimal coding models. Thus, the presence of ITD maps in the brainstem may reflect a local optimum in evolutionary development. Our results underline the importance of comparative animal studies and show that optimal models must be viewed in the light of evolutionary processes.</p>

<p>Sensory information is encoded by populations of cortical neurons. Yet, it is unknown how this information is used for even simple perceptual choices such as discriminating orientation. To determine the computation underlying this perceptual choice, we took advantage of the robust visual adaptation in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We first designed a stimulus paradigm in which we could vary the degree of neuronal adaptation measured in V1 during an orientation discrimination task. We then determined how adaptation affects task performance for mice of both sexes and tested which neuronal computations are most consistent with the behavioral results given the adapted population responses in V1. Despite increasing the reliability of the population representation of orientation among neurons, and improving the ability of a variety of optimal decoders to discriminate target from distractor orientations, adaptation increases animals' behavioral thresholds. Decoding the animals' choice from neuronal activity revealed that this unexpected effect on behavior could be explained by an overreliance of the perceptual choice circuit on target preferring neurons and a failure to appropriately discount the activity of neurons that prefer the distractor. Consistent with this all-positive computation, we find that animals' task performance is susceptible to subtle perturbations of distractor orientation and optogenetic suppression of neuronal activity in V1. This suggests that to solve this task the circuit has adopted a suboptimal and task-specific computation that discards important task-related information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A major goal in systems neuroscience is to understand how sensory signals are used to guide behavior. This requires determining what information in sensory cortical areas is used, and how it is combined, by downstream perceptual choice circuits. Here we demonstrate that when performing a go/no-go orientation discrimination task, mice suboptimally integrate signals from orientation tuned visual cortical neurons. While they appropriately positively weight target-preferring neurons, they fail to negatively weight distractor-preferring neurons. We propose that this all-positive computation may be adopted because of its simple learning rules and faster processing, and may be a common approach to perceptual decision-making when task conditions allow.</p>

<p>The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the mouse is a model system to study the development of thalamic circuitry. Most studies focus on relay neurons of dLGN, yet little is known about the development of the other principal cell type, intrinsic interneurons. Here we examined whether the structure and function of interneurons relies on retinal signaling. We took a loss-of-function approach and crossed GAD67-GFP mice, which express GFP in dLGN interneurons, with <i>math5</i> nulls (math5<sup>–/–</sup>), mutants that lack retinal ganglion cells and retinofugal projections. <i>In vitro</i> recordings and 3-D reconstructions of biocytin-filled interneurons at different postnatal ages showed their development is a multistaged process involving migration, arbor remodeling, and synapse formation. Arbor remodeling begins during the second postnatal week, after migration to and dispersion within dLGN is complete. This phase includes a period of exuberant branching where arbors grow in number, complexity, and field size. Such growth is followed by branch pruning and stabilization, as interneurons adopt a bipolar architecture. The absence of retinal signaling disrupts this process. The math5<sup>–/–</sup> interneurons fail to branch and prune, and instead maintain a simple, sparse architecture. To test how such defects influence connectivity with dLGN relay neurons, we used DHPG [(RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine], the mGluR<sub>1,5</sub> agonist that targets F2 terminals. This led to substantial increases in IPSC activity among WT relay neurons but had little impact in math5<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Together, these data suggest that retinal signaling is needed to support the arbor elaboration and synaptic connectivity of dLGN interneurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Presently, our understanding about the development of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is limited to circuits involving excitatory thalamocortical relay neurons. Here we show that the other principal cell type, intrinsic interneurons, has a multistaged developmental plan that relies on retinal innervation. These findings indicate that signaling from the periphery guides the maturation of interneurons and the establishment of inhibitory thalamic circuits.</p>

<p>The cation channel transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) plays an important role in sensing potentially hazardous substances. However, TRPA1 species differences are substantial and limit translational research. TRPA1 agonists tested previously in humans also have other targets. Therefore, the sensation generated by isolated TRPA1 activation in humans is unknown. The availability of 2-chloro<i>-N-</i>(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)thiazol-2-yl)<i>-N-</i>(3-methoxypropyl)-acetamide (JT010), a potent and specific TRPA1 agonist, allowed us to explore this issue. To corroborate the specificity of JT010, it was investigated whether the TRPA1 antagonist (1E,3E)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-methyl-1-penten-3-one oxime (A-967079) abolishes JT010-elicited pain. Sixteen healthy volunteers of both sexes rated pain due to intraepidermal injections of different concentrations and combinations of the substances. The study design was a double-blind crossover study. All subjects received all types of injections, including a placebo without substances. Injections of the TRPA1 agonist dose-dependently caused pain with a half-maximal effective concentration of 0.31 μm. Coinjection of A-967079 dose-dependently reduced and at a high concentration abolished JT010-induced pain. Quantification of JT010 by HPLC showed that a substantial part is adsorbed when in contact with polypropylene surfaces, but that this was overcome by handling in glass vials and injection using glass syringes. Isolated TRPA1 activation in humans causes pain. Thus, intradermal JT010 injection can serve as a tool to validate new TRPA1 antagonists concerning target engagement. More importantly, TRPA1-specific tools allow quantification of the TRPA1-dependent component in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study showed that activation of the ion channel transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) alone indeed suffices to elicit pain in humans, independent of other receptors previously found to be involved in pain generation. The newly established TRPA1-specific pain model allows different applications. First, it can be tested whether diseases are associated with compromised or exaggerated TRPA1-dependent painful sensations in the skin. Second, it can be investigated whether a new, possibly systemically applied drug directed against TRPA1 engages its target in humans. Further, the general possibility of quantitative inhibition of TRPA1 allows identification of the TRPA1-dependent disease component, given that the substance reaches its target. This contributes to a better understanding of pathophysiology, can lay the basis for new therapeutic approaches, and can bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinical trials.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/20/3832?rss=1">Axonal Degeneration Is Mediated by Necroptosis Activation</a></h4>

<p>Axonal degeneration, which contributes to functional impairment in several disorders of the nervous system, is an important target for neuroprotection. Several individual factors and subcellular events have been implicated in axonal degeneration, but researchers have so far been unable to identify an integrative signaling pathway activating this self-destructive process. Through pharmacological and genetic approaches, we tested whether necroptosis, a regulated cell-death mechanism implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, is involved in axonal degeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of the necroptotic kinase RIPK1 using necrostatin-1 strongly delayed axonal degeneration in the peripheral nervous system and CNS of wild-type mice of either sex and protected <i>in vitro</i> sensory axons from degeneration after mechanical and toxic insults. These effects were also observed after genetic knock-down of <i>RIPK3</i>, a second key regulator of necroptosis, and the downstream effector <i>MLKL</i> (<i>Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like</i>). RIPK1 inhibition prevented mitochondrial fragmentation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, a typical feature of necrotic death, and inhibition of mitochondrial fission by Mdivi also resulted in reduced axonal loss in damaged nerves. Furthermore, electrophysiological analysis demonstrated that inhibition of necroptosis delays not only the morphological degeneration of axons, but also the loss of their electrophysiological function after nerve injury. Activation of the necroptotic pathway early during injury-induced axonal degeneration was made evident by increased phosphorylation of the downstream effector MLKL. Our results demonstrate that axonal degeneration proceeds by necroptosis, thus defining a novel mechanistic framework in the axonal degenerative cascade for therapeutic interventions in a wide variety of conditions that lead to neuronal loss and functional impairment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that axonal degeneration triggered by diverse stimuli is mediated by the activation of the necroptotic programmed cell-death program by a cell-autonomous mechanism. This work represents a critical advance for the field since it identifies a defined degenerative pathway involved in axonal degeneration in both the peripheral nervous system and the CNS, a process that has been proposed as an early event in several neurodegenerative conditions and a major contributor to neuronal death. The identification of necroptosis as a key mechanism for axonal degeneration is an important step toward the development of novel therapeutic strategies for nervous-system disorders, particularly those related to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies or CNS diseases in which axonal degeneration is a common factor.</p>

<p>Repetitive action potentials (APs) in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) backpropagate to distal apical dendrites, and induce calcium and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)-dependent downregulation of Kv1.2, resulting in long-term potentiation of direct cortical inputs and intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE). When APs were elicited by direct somatic stimulation of CA3-PCs from rodents of either sex, only a narrow window of distal dendritic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] allowed LTP-IE because of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent coactivation of PTK and protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), which renders non-mossy fiber (MF) inputs incompetent in LTP-IE induction. High-frequency MF inputs, however, could induce LTP-IE at high dendritic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of the window. We show that MF input-induced Zn<sup>2+</sup> signaling inhibits postsynaptic PTP, and thus enables MF inputs to induce LTP-IE at a wide range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> values. Extracellular chelation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> or genetic deletion of vesicular zinc transporter abrogated the privilege of MF inputs for LTP-IE induction. Moreover, the incompetence of somatic stimulation was rescued by the inhibition of PTP or a supplement of extracellular zinc, indicating that MF input-induced increase in dendritic [Zn<sup>2+</sup>] facilitates the induction of LTP-IE by inhibiting PTP. Consistently, high-frequency MF stimulation induced immediate and delayed elevations of [Zn<sup>2+</sup>] at proximal and distal dendrites, respectively. These results indicate that MF inputs are uniquely linked to the regulation of direct cortical inputs owing to synaptic Zn<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Zn<sup>2+</sup> has been mostly implicated in pathological processes, and the physiological roles of synaptically released Zn<sup>2+</sup> in intracellular signaling are little known. We show here that Zn<sup>2+</sup> released from hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) terminals enters postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal cells, and plays a facilitating role in MF input-induced heterosynaptic potentiation of perforant path (PP) synaptic inputs through long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE). We show that the window of cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] that induces LTP-IE is normally very narrow because of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent coactivation of antagonistic signaling pairs, whereby non-MF inputs become ineffective in inducing excitability change. The MF-induced Zn<sup>2+</sup> signaling, however, biases toward facilitating the induction of LTP-IE. The present study elucidates why MF inputs are more privileged for the regulation of PP synapses.</p>

<p>KIFC1 (also called HSET or kinesin-14a) is best known as a multifunctional motor protein essential for mitosis. The present studies are the first to explore KIFC1 in terminally postmitotic neurons. Using RNA interference to partially deplete KIFC1 from rat neurons (from animals of either gender) in culture, pharmacologic agents that inhibit KIFC1, and expression of mutant KIFC1 constructs, we demonstrate critical roles for KIFC1 in regulating axonal growth and retraction as well as growth cone morphology. Experimental manipulations of KIFC1 elicit morphological changes in the axon as well as changes in the organization, distribution, and polarity orientation of its microtubules. Together, the results indicate a mechanism by which KIFC1 binds to microtubules in the axon and slides them into alignment in an ATP-dependent fashion and then cross-links them in an ATP-independent fashion to oppose their subsequent sliding by other motors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here, we establish that KIFC1, a molecular motor well characterized in mitosis, is robustly expressed in neurons, where it has profound influence on the organization of microtubules in a number of different functional contexts. KIFC1 may help answer long-standing questions in cellular neuroscience such as, mechanistically, how growth cones stall and how axonal microtubules resist forces that would otherwise cause the axon to retract. Knowledge about KIFC1 may help researchers to devise strategies for treating disorders of the nervous system involving axonal retraction given that KIFC1 is expressed in adult neurons as well as developing neurons.</p>

<p>Spike timing is an important factor in the modification of synaptic strength. Various forms of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) occur in the brains of diverse species, from insects to humans. In unimodal STDP, only LTP or LTD occurs at the synapse, regardless of which neuron spikes first; the magnitude of potentiation or depression increases as the time between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes decreases. This from of STDP may promote developmental strengthening or weakening of early projections. In bidirectional Hebbian STDP, the magnitude and the sign (potentiation or depression) of plasticity depend, respectively, on the timing and the order of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. In the rodent barrel cortex, multiple forms of STDP appear sequentially during development, and they contribute to network formation, retraction, or fine-scale functional reorganization. Hebbian STDP appears at L4-L2/3 synapses starting at postnatal day (P) 15; the synapses exhibit unimodal "all-LTP STDP" before that age. The appearance of Hebbian STDP at L4-L2/3 synapses coincides with the maturation of parvalbumin-containing GABA interneurons in L4, which contributes to the generation of L4-before-L2/3 spiking in response to thalamic input by producing fast feedforward suppression of both L4 and L2/3 cells. After P15, L4-L2/3 STDP mediates fine-scale circuit refinement, essential for the critical period in the barrel cortex. In this review, we first briefly describe the relevance of STDP to map plasticity in the barrel cortex, then look over roles of distinct forms of STDP during development. Finally, we propose a hypothesis that explains the transition from network formation to the initiation of the critical period in the barrel cortex.</p>

<p>This paper predicts the ability to externally control the firing times of a
cortical neuron whose behavior follows the Izhikevich neuron model. The
Izhikevich neuron model provides an efficient and biologically plausible method
to track a cortical neuron's membrane potential and its firing times. The
external control is a simple optogenetic model represented by a constant
current source that can be turned on or off. This paper considers firing
frequencies that are sufficiently low for the membrane potential to return to
its resting potential after it fires. The time required for the neuron to
charge and for the neuron to recover to the resting potential are numerically
fitted to functions of the Izhikevich neuron model parameters and the input
current. Results show that simple functions of the model parameters and input
current can be used to predict the charging and recovery times, even when there
are deviations in the actual parameter values. Furthermore, the predictions
lead to lower bounds on the firing frequency that can be achieved without
significant distortion.

<p>In the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) models inspired by the brain
have made unprecedented progress in performing real-world perceptual tasks like
object classification and speech recognition. Recently, researchers of natural
intelligence have begun using those AI models to explore how the brain performs
such tasks. These developments suggest that future progress will benefit from
increased interaction between disciplines. Here we introduce the Algonauts
Project as a structured and quantitative communication channel for
interdisciplinary interaction between natural and artificial intelligence
researchers. The project's core is an open challenge with a quantitative
benchmark whose goal is to account for brain data through computational models.
This project has the potential to provide better models of natural intelligence
and to gather findings that advance AI. The 2019 Algonauts Project focuses on
benchmarking computational models predicting human brain activity when people
look at pictures of objects. The 2019 edition of the Algonauts Project is

<p>Robotic research is often built on approaches that are motivated by insights
from self-examination of how we interface with the world. However, given
current theories about human cognition and sensory processing, it is reasonable
to assume that the internal workings of the brain are separate from how we
interface with the world and ourselves. To amend some of these misconceptions
arising from self-examination this article reviews human visual understanding
for cognition and action, specifically manipulation. Our focus is on
identifying overarching principles such as the separation into visual
processing for action and cognition, hierarchical processing of visual input,
and the contextual and anticipatory nature of visual processing for action. We
also provide a rudimentary exposition of previous theories about visual
understanding that shows how self-examination can lead down the wrong path. Our
hope is that the article will provide insights for the robotic researcher that
can help them navigate the path of self-examination, give them an overview of
current theories about human visual processing, as well as provide a source for
further relevant reading.

Brain-Computer Interface inspired by the famous vintage video game Space
Invaders (Taito, Tokyo, Japan). The visual P300 is an event-related potential
elicited by a visual stimulation, peaking 240-600 ms after stimulus onset. EEG
data were recorded by 16 electrodes in an experiment that took place in the
GIPSA-lab, Grenoble, France, in 2012 (Van Veen, 2013 and Congedo, 2013). Python
code for manipulating the data is available at

<p>Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro
level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this
reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of
intrinsic cause-effect power - integrated information ({\Phi}), and showing
that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to "beat" the
micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for {\Phi} across different spatial
and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible black boxes.
These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or
more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and
outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support
their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more
common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the
emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent
at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher
{\Phi} than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher
composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show
that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of {\Phi} across
several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple
biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle,
for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated
biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of
organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come
into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.

Recent studies have shown that neurologic inflammation may both precipitate and sustain seizures, suggesting that inflammation may be involved not only in epileptogenesis but also in the development of the drug-resistant profile. Extensive literature data, during these last years, have identified a number of inflammatory markers involved in these processes of "neuroimmunoinflammation" in epilepsy, underlying a key role for other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as: IL-6, IL-17 and IL-17 Receptor (IL-17R) axis, Tumor-Necrosis-Factor Alpha (TNF-α) and Transforming-Growth-Factor Beta (TGF-β), all responsible for the induction of processes of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and inflammation of the Central Nervous System (CNS) itself. Nevertheless, many of these inflammatory biomarkers have been also implicated in other neurologic pathologies, and future perspectives have to address the disease-individuality in order to identify panels of biomarkers that discriminate epilepsies from other diseases and among different epileptic semiology. 
In this context, markers of blood-brain barrier integrity and disruption are useful tools to determine the sequelae in a variety of neurologic diseases, but how these markers may predict the prognosis and the diagnosis of epileptic disorders is being currently investigated. 
Herein authors present a review of extensive literature data on the involvement of both systemic and neuronal immune system in the early onset of epileptic encephalopathy.

When faced with a novel object, we explore it to understand its shape. This way we combine information coming from different senses, as touch, proprioception and vision, together with the motor information embedded in our motor execution plan. The exploration process provides a structure and constrains this rich flow of inputs, supporting the formation of a unified percept and the memorization of the object features. However, how the exploration strategies are planned is still an open question. In particular, is the exploration strategy used to memorize an object different from the exploration strategy adopted in a recall task? To address this question we used iCube, a sensorized cube which measures its orientation in space and the location of the contacts on its faces. Participants were required to explore the cube faces where little pins were positioned in varying number. Participants had to explore the cube twice and individuate potential differences between the two presentations, which could be performed either haptically alone, or with also vision available. The haptic and visuo-haptic exploratory strategies changed significantly when finalized to memorize the structure of the object with respect to when the same object was explored to recall and compare it with its memorized instance. These findings indicate that exploratory strategies are finely tuned not only to the property of the object to be analyzed, but also to the prospective use of the resulting representation, be it memorization or recall. The results are discussed in light of the possibility of a systematic modeling of natural visuo-haptic exploration strategies.

Neuroimaging research is growing rapidly, providing expansive resources for synthesizing data. However, navigating these dense resources is complicated by the volume of research articles and variety of experimental designs implemented across studies. The advent of machine learning algorithms and text-mining techniques has advanced automated labeling of published articles in biomedical research to alleviate such obstacles. As of yet, a comprehensive examination of document features and classifier techniques for annotating neuroimaging articles has yet to be undertaken. Here, we evaluated which combination of corpus (abstract-only or full-article text), features (bag-of-words or Cognitive Atlas terms), and classifier (Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, or support vector classifier) resulted in the highest predictive performance in annotating a selection of 2,633 manually annotated neuroimaging articles. We found that, when utilizing full article text, data-driven features derived from the text performed the best, whereas if article abstracts were used for annotation, features derived from the Cognitive Atlas performed better. Additionally, we observed that when features were derived from article text, anatomical terms appeared to be the most frequently utilized for classification purposes and that cognitive concepts can be identified based on similar representations of these anatomical terms. Optimizing parameters for the automated classification of neuroimaging articles may result in a larger proportion of the neuroimaging literature being annotated with labels supporting the meta-analysis of psychological constructs.

Given the complicated pathological process, peripheral nerve injury has not yet been well resolved. SB216763 is a small molecular compound that can enhance remyelination of peripheral nerves by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). A previous study showed that GSK-3β inhibitor stimulated myelin gene expression and restored the myelin structure. Herein, we present the effect of small gap tubulization integrated with SB216763-loaded microspheres by using chitosan conduit. In vitro, SB216763 could promote DRGs axons growth. In vivo studies showed that SB216763 increased the number of myelinated axons and thickness of myelin sheaths. The electrophysiological examination and sciatic functional index results also indirectly indicated the role of SB216763 in repairing peripheral nerve injury. Meanwhile, SB216763 promoted the recovery of muscle function. In conclusion, combining SB216763-loaded PLGA microspheres with conduit small gap tubulization has promising potential applications in repairing peripheral nerve injury.

Tau-related dementias appear to involve specific to each disease aggregation pathways and morphologies of filamentous tau assemblies. Here we elucidate molecular mechanism of tau aggregation based on the PMO theory of protein secondary and tertiary structure (Cieplak, A. S. (2017). PLoS ONE 12: e0180905) and the recent structural evidence, aiming to account for the reported differences in fibril-core structure, cross-seeding of isoforms, response to non-reducing conditions, and homologs’ aggregation properties. The proposed model suggests that in contrast to Alzheimer’s disease, the assembly of tau prions in Pick’s disease would be facilitated by a moderate drop in pH that accompanies e.g. transit in the endosomal system, neuroinflammation or ischemic injury.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases with a complex, but often overlapping, genetic and pathobiological background and thus they are considered to form a disease spectrum. Although neurons are the principal cells affected in FTLD and ALS, increasing amount of evidence has recently proposed that other central nervous system-resident cells, including microglia and astrocytes, may also play roles in neurodegeneration in these diseases. Therefore, deciphering the mechanisms underlying the disease pathogenesis in different types of brain cells is fundamental in order to understand the etiology of these disorders. The major genetic cause of FTLD and ALS is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the intronic region of the C9orf72 gene. In neurons, specific pathological hallmarks, including decreased expression of the C9orf72 RNA and proteins and generation of toxic RNA and protein species, and their downstream effects have been linked to C9orf72 HRE-associated FTLD and ALS. In contrast, it is still poorly known to which extent these pathological changes are presented in other brain cells. Here, we summarize the current literature on the potential role of astrocytes and microglia in C9orf72 HRE-linked FTLD and ALS and discuss their possible phenotypic alterations and neurotoxic mechanisms that may contribute to neurodegeneration in these diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00479">A Novel Role of VEGFC in Cerebral Ischemia With Lung Injury</a></h4>

Cerebral ischemia (CI) is a severe brain injury resulting in a variety of motor impairments combined with secondary injury in remote organs, especially the lung. This condition occurs due to insufficient blood supply to the brain during infancy. However, it has a molecular linkage that needs to be thoroughly covered. Here, we report on the role of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) in lung injury induced by CI. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was depended to establish the animal model of CI. Rats were used and brain ischemia was confirmed through TTC staining. Serum was used for protein chip analysis to study the proteomic interaction. Immunohistochemistry analyses were used to quantify and locate the VEGFC in the lung and brain. The role of VEGFC was detected by siVEGFC technology in SY5Y, HUCEV and A549 cell lines, under normal and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions in vitro. As a result, the TTC staining demonstrated that the model of brain ischemia was successfully established, and MPO experiments reported that lung damage was induced in MCAO rats. VEGFC levels were up-regulated in serum. On the other hand, immunohistochemistry showed that VEGFC increased significantly in the cytoplasm of neurons, the endothelium of small trachea and the lung cells of CI animals. On a functional level, siVEGFC effectively inhibited the proliferation of SY5Y cells and decreased the viability of HUVEC cells in normal cell lines. But under OGD conditions, siVEGFC decreased the growth of HUVEC and increased the viability of A549 cells, while no effect was noticed on SYSY cells. Therefore, we confirmed the different role of VEGFC played in neurons and lung cells in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. These findings may contribute to the understanding the molecular linkage of brain ischemia and lung injury, which therefore provides a new idea for the therapeutic approach to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.

To study the impact of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine on cognitive, functional, behavioral, global changes and adverse effects in patients with mild, moderate and severe Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we screened the literature published before September 2017 in the Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of Science Electronic databases according to the inclusion criteria. Thirty-six studies were finally determined from 1560 preliminary screened articles. The AD Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input scale (CIBIC+) were used as valid endpoints. Of the 36 trials included, meta-analyses of these placebo-control trials showed that there were significant differences between the donepezil, rivastigmine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and CIBIC+. Meta-analyses of these placebo-controlled trials showed that there were significant differences between the galantamine and placebo groups using ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, NPI, and CIBIC+. These observations suggest that memantine is beneficial for stabilizing or slowing the decline in ADAS-cog and ADCS-ADL19 changes in AD patients. However, there was no significant effect according to the ADCS-ADL23, NPI, and CIBIC+ tests, which indicated that memantine treatment has no significant effect on these cognitive aspects of AD patients. Different effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, or memantine on AD were found in this study. According to the results, we conclude that galantamine is effective in treating all aspects of AD and is the first choice for the treatment of AD. However, due to limited data, we should consider additional data to obtain more stable results.

Learning a new language requires the use of extensive neural networks and can represent a potent tool to reorganize brain neuroplasticity. In this study, we analyze how 4-month long second language learning program (16, 2-h sessions) can lead to functional changes in the brain of healthy elderly individuals. A large number of studies point out a declining of brain-skills with age; here we analyze how cognition together with functional brain organization can be improved late in life. Twenty-six older adults (59 to 79 years old) were enrolled in the present study. A complete neuropsychological examination was administered pre- and post-intervention to measure global cognition level, short- and long-term memory, attention, language access, and executive functions. After the program, in the intervention group, we observed a significant improvement in global cognition together with increased functional connectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus and left superior parietal lobule. These findings can be added to the current neurobiological breakthroughs of reshaping brain networks with a short language learning practice in healthy elderly subjects. We, therefore, suggest that learning a foreign-language may represent a potentially helpful cognitive intervention for promoting healthy aging.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00037">Reconstruction and Simulation of a Scaffold Model of the Cerebellar Network</a></h4>

Reconstructing neuronal microcircuits through computational models is fundamental to simulate local neuronal dynamics. Here a scaffold model of the cerebellum has been developed in order to flexibly place neurons in space, connect them synaptically and endow neurons and synapses with biologically-grounded mechanisms. The scaffold model can keep neuronal morphology separated from network connectivity, which can in turn be obtained from convergence/divergence ratios and axonal/dendritic field 3D geometries. We first tested the scaffold on the cerebellar microcircuit, which presents a challenging 3D organization, at the same time providing appropriate datasets to validate emerging network behaviors. The scaffold was designed to integrate the cerebellar cortex with deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), including different neuronal types: Golgi cells, granule cells, Purkinje cells, stellate cells, basket cells and DCN principal cells. Mossy fiber inputs were conveyed through the glomeruli. An anisotropic volume (0.077 mm3) of mouse cerebellum was reconstructed, in which point-neuron models were tuned toward the specific discharge properties of neurons and were connected by exponentially decaying excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Simulations using both pyNEST and pyNEURON showed the emergence of organized spatio-temporal patterns of neuronal activity similar to those revealed experimentally in response to background noise and burst stimulation of mossy fiber bundles. Different configurations of granular and molecular layer connectivity consistently modified neuronal activation patterns, revealing the importance of structural constraints for cerebellar network functioning. The scaffold provided thus an effective workflow accounting for the complex architecture of the cerebellar network. In principle, the scaffold can incorporate cellular mechanisms at multiple levels of detail and be tuned to test different structural and functional hypotheses. A future implementation using detailed 3D multi-compartment neuron models and dynamic synapses will be needed to investigate the impact of single neuron properties on network computation.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is frequently used in rehabilitation therapy to improve motor recovery. To optimize the stimulatory effect of NMES, the parameters of NMES, including stimulation mode, location, current intensity, and duration, among others have been investigated; however, these studies mainly focused on the effects of changing parameters on the current plateau stage of the NMES cycle, while the impacts on other stages, such as the current rising stage, have yet to be investigated. In this paper, we studied the electroencephalograph (EEG) effects during NMES, with different rates of current change in the rising stage, and stable current intensity in the plateau stage. EEG signals (64-channel) were collected from 28 healthy subjects, who were administered with high, medium, or low current change rate (CCR) NMES through a right-hand wrist extensor. Time-frequency analysis and brain source analysis, using the LORETA method, were used to investigate neural activity in sensorimotor cortical areas. The strengths of cortical activity induced by different CCR conditions were compared. NMES with a high CCR activated the sensorimotor cortex, despite the NMES current intensity in the plateau stage lower than the motor threshold. Reduction of the Alpha 2 band (10–13 Hz) event related spectral power (ERSP) during NMES stimulation was significantly enhanced by increasing CCR (p &lt; 0.05). LORETA-based source analysis demonstrated that, in addition to typical sensory areas, such as primary somatosensory cortex (S1), sensorimotor areas including primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PMC), and somatosensory association cortex (SAC) were all activated by within threshold NMES. Furthermore, compared with the low CCR condition, cortical activity was significantly enhanced in the S1, M1, and PMC areas under high CCR conditions. This study shows CCR in the NMES rising stage can affect EEG responses in the sensorimotor cortex, and suggests that CCR is an important parameter applicable to the optimization of NMES treatment.

Consumer psychology research have found that individuals of different social status have different purchase intentions for different products. Individuals of high social status will simultaneously measure the status symbolic meaning and utilitarian value of the product, but they won’t show strong preferences for certain attributes; however, individuals of low social status show a strong purchasing tendency for hedonic products which contain status symbolic meanings and which satisfy their spiritual needs. This phenomenon may be due to their self-threat, which is caused by hedonic products. Based on the above, this study is the first to explore the cognitive process difference of hedonic and utilitarian label products in high- and low-social-status groups by recording event related potentials (ERPs). The result showed that under the P2, P3 and LPP components, low-social-status group elicited more negative deﬂections in hedonic label stimuli than in utilitarian label stimuli, while high-social-status group did not have significant difference in these components. These suggested that humans with low social status are more sensitive to hedonic products information, because high-status information contained in the hedonic label brings a sense of threat to them and generates their certain negative emotions, which make them preferentially process such information in the information processing.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00029">Coding Capacity of Purkinje Cells With Different Schemes of Morphological Reduction</a></h4>

The brain as a neuronal system has very complex structure with large diversity of neuronal types. The most basic complexity is seen from the structure of neuronal morphology, which usually has a complex tree-like structure with dendritic spines distributed in branches. For simulating a large-scale network with spiking neurons, the simple point neuron, such as integrate-and-fire neuron, is often used. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that the computational ability of a single neuron is largely enhanced
by its morphological structure, in particular, by various types of dendritic dynamics. As morphology reduction of detailed biophysical models is one of classic questions for systems neuroscience, much effort has been taken to simulate a neuron with a few compartments to include the interaction between soma and dendritic spines. 
Yet, novel reduction methods are still needed to deal with complex dendritic tree.
Here by using ten individual Purkinje cells of the cerebellum from three species of guinea-pig, mouse and rat, we consider four types of reduction methods and study their effects on the coding capacity of Purkinje cells in terms of firing rate, timing coding, spiking pattern, and modulated firing under different stimulation protocols. We find that there is a variation of reduction performance depending on individual cells and species, however, all reduction methods can preserve, to some degree, firing activity of the full model of Purkinje cell. Therefore, when stimulating large-scale network of neurons, one has to choose a proper type of reduced neuronal model depending on the questions addressed.
Among these reduction schemes, Branch method, that preserves the geometrical volume of neurons, can achieve the best balance among different performance measures of accuracy, simplification, and computational efficiency, and reproduce various phenomena shown in the full morphology model of Purkinje cells. Taken together, these results suggest that Branch reduction scheme seems to provide a general guideline for reducing complex morphology into a few compartments without loss of basic characteristics of firing property of neurons.

The human cerebral cortex is highly convoluted as convex gyri and concave sulci. In the past decades, extensive studies have consistently revealed substantial differences between gyri and sulci in terms of genetics, anatomy, morphology, axonal fiber connections, and function. Although interesting findings have been reported to date to elucidate the functional difference between gyri and sulci, the temporal variability of functional activity, which could explain individual differences in learning and higher-order cognitive functions, and as well as differences in gyri and sulci, remains to be explored. The present study explored the temporal variability of cortical gyral-sulcal resting state functional activity and its association with fluid intelligence measures on the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that the temporal variance of resting state fMRI BOLD signal was significantly larger in gyri than in sulci. We also found that the temporal variability of certain regions including middle frontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe and visual cortex was positively associated with fluid intelligence. Moreover, those regions were predominately located in gyri rather than in sulci. This study reports initial evidence for temporal variability difference of functional activity between gyri and sulci, and its association with fluid intelligence measures, and thus provides novel insights to understand the mechanism and functional relevance of gyri and sulci.

Necrostatin-1 is an inhibitor of necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death that has been reported to be involved in various neurological diseases. Presently, the role of necroptosis in neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury is still unclear. This study was focused on investigating the potential effects of necroptosis in the development and progression of neuropathic pain in a rat model and the possible neuroprotective effects of necrostatin-1 in neuropathic pain. The results indicated that the necroptosis-related proteins RIP1 and RIP3 significantly increased postoperation in the spinal cord in a neuropathic pain model and peaked 7 days postoperation, which was consistent with the time-dependent changes of hyperalgesia. Additionally, we found that peripheral nerve injury-related behavioral and biochemical changes were significantly reduced by necrostatin-1. In particular, hyperalgesia was attenuated, and the levels of RIP1 and RIP3 were decreased. Furthermore, the ultrastructure of necrotic cell death and neuroinflammation were alleviated by necrostatin-1. Collectively, these results suggest that necroptosis is an important mechanism of cell death in neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury and that necrostatin-1 may be a promising neuroprotective treatment for neuropathic pain.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00208">Thinking About the Nerve Impulse: The Prospects for the Development of a Comprehensive Account of Nerve Impulse Propagation</a></h4>

Currently, a scientific debate is ongoing about modelling nerve impulse propagation. One of the models discussed is the celebrated Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential, which is central to the electricity-centered conception of the nerve impulse that dominates contemporary neuroscience. However, this model cannot represent the nerve impulse completely, since it does not take into account non-electrical manifestations of the nerve impulse for which there is ample experimental evidence. As a result, alternative models of nerve impulse propagation have been proposed in contemporary (neuro)scientific literature. One of these models is the Heimburg-Jackson model, according to which the nerve impulse is an electromechanical density pulse in the neural membrane. This model is usually contrasted with the Hodgkin-Huxley model and is supposed to potentially be able to replace the latter. However, instead of contrasting these models of nerve impulse propagation, another approach integrates these models in a general unifying model. This general unifying model, the Engelbrecht model, is developed to unify all relevant manifestations of the nerve impulse and their interaction(s). Here, we want to contribute to the debate about modelling nerve impulse propagation by conceptually analyzing the Engelbrecht model. Combining the results of this conceptual analysis with insights from philosophy of science, we make recommendations for (future) approaches to studying nerve impulse propagation. The first conclusion of this analysis is that attempts to develop models that represent the nerve impulse accurately and completely appear unfeasible. Instead, models are and should be used as tools to study nerve impulse propagation for varying purposes, representing the nerve impulse accurately and completely enough to achieve the specified goals. The second conclusion is that integrating distinct models into a general unifying model that provides a consistent picture of nerve impulse propagation is impossible due to the distinct purposes for which they are developed and the conflicting assumptions these purposes often require. Instead of explaining nerve impulse propagation with a single general unifying model, it appears advisable to explain this complex phenomenon using a ‘mosaic’ framework of models in which each model contributes to an overall explanation by providing a partial explanation of nerve impulse propagation.

Purinergic signalling regulates important physiological processes and the homeostatic response to stress in the cochlea via extracellular nucleosides (adenosine) and nucleotides (ATP, UTP). Using a previously established organotypic culture model, the current study investigated the effect of purinergic P1 (adenosine) and P2 (ATP) receptor activation on the survival of the sensory hair cell population in the cochlea exposed to the ototoxic aminoglycoside neomycin. Organ of Corti explants were obtained from C57BL/6 mice at postnatal day 3 (P3) and maintained in normal culture medium (with or without purine receptor agonists or analogues) for 19.5 hours prior to neomycin exposure (1 mM, 3 hours) followed by a further incubation for 19.5 hours in culture medium. The cochlear explants were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and sensory hair cells labelled with Alexa 488-phalloidin. Neomycin induced a substantial loss of the sensory hair cells, mostly in the middle segment of the cochlea. This neomycin-induced ototoxicity was unaffected by the addition of P2 receptor agonists (ATP and UTP) in the culture medium, whilst the addition of their slowly-hydrolysable analogues (ATPγS, UTPγS) aggravated neomycin-induced sensory hair cell loss. In contrast, the activation of P1 receptors by adenosine or adenosine amine congener (ADAC) conferred partial protection from neomycin ototoxicity. This study demonstrates a pro-survival effect of P1 receptor stimulation, whilst prolonged P2 receptors activation has an opposite effect. Based on these findings, we postulate that P1 and P2 receptors orchestrate differential responses to cochlear injury and that the balance of these receptors is important for maintaining cochlear homeostasis following ototoxic injury.

Drosophila Ringmaker (Ringer) is homologous to the human Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Proteins (TPPPs) that are implicated in the stabilization and bundling of microtubules (MTs) that are particularly important for neurons and are also implicated in synaptic organization and plasticity. No in vivo functional data exist that have addressed the role of TPPP in synapse organization in any system.  Here, we present the phenotypic and functional characterization of ringer mutants during Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synaptic development. ringer mutants show reduced synaptic growth and transmission and display phenotypic similarities and genetic interactions with the Drosophila homolog of vertebrate Microtubule Associated Protein (MAP)1B, futsch. Immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses show that individual and combined loss of Ringer and Futsch cause a significant reduction in MT loops at the NMJs and reduced acetylated-tubulin levels. Presynaptic over-expression of Ringer and Futsch causes elevated levels of acetylated-tubulin and significant increase in NMJ MT loops. These results indicate that Ringer and Futsch regulate synaptic MT organization in addition to synaptic growth. Together our findings may inform studies on the close mammalian homolog, TPPP, and provide insights into the role of MTs and associated proteins in synapse growth and organization.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46339">HSV-1 single cell analysis reveals anti-viral and developmental programs activation in distinct sub-populations</a></h4>

Viral infection is usually studied at the population level by averaging over millions of cells. However, infection at the single-cell level is highly heterogeneous, where most infected cells give rise to none or few viral progeny while some cells produce thousands. Analysis of HSV-1 infection by population averaged measurements has taught us a lot about the course of viral infection, but has also produced contradictory results, such as the concurrent activation and inhibition of type I interferon signaling during infection. Here, we combine live-cell imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize viral and host transcriptional heterogeneity during HSV-1 infection of primary human cells. We find extreme variability in the level of viral gene expression among individually infected cells and show that they cluster into transcriptionally distinct sub-populations. We find that anti-viral signaling is initiated in a rare group of abortively infected cells, while highly infected cells undergo cellular reprogramming to an embryonic-like transcriptional state. This reprogramming involves the recruitment of b-catenin to the host nucleus and viral replication compartments and is required for late viral gene expression and progeny production. These findings uncover the transcriptional differences in cells with variable infection outcomes and shed new light on the manipulation of host pathways by HSV-1.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45881">Silicone oil-induced ocular hypertension and glaucomatous neurodegeneration in mouse</a></h4>

Understanding the molecular mechanism of glaucoma and development of neuroprotectants are significantly hindered by the lack of a reliable animal model that accurately recapitulates human glaucoma. Here we sought to develop a mouse model for the secondary glaucoma that is often observed in humans after silicone oil (SO) blocks the pupil or migrates into the anterior chamber following vitreoretinal surgery. We observed significant intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation after intracameral injection of SO, and that SO removal allows IOP to return quickly to normal. This simple, inducible and reversible mouse ocular hypertension model shows dynamic changes of visual function that correlate with progressive RGC loss and axon degeneration. It may be applicable with only minor modifications to a range of animal species in which it will generate stable, robust IOP elevation and significant neurodegeneration that will facilitate selection of neuroprotectants and investigating the pathogenesis of ocular hypertension-induced glaucoma.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45779">Symmetry transitions during gating of the TRPV2 ion channel in lipid membranes</a></h4>

The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channel is a member of the temperature-sensing thermoTRPV family. Recent advances in cryo-electronmicroscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography have provided many important insights into the gating mechanisms of thermoTRPV channels. Interestingly, crystallographic studies of ligand-dependent TRPV2 gating have shown that the TRPV2 channel adopts two-fold symmetric arrangements during the gating cycle. However, it was unclear if crystal packing forces played a role in stabilizing the two-fold symmetric arrangement of the channel. Here we employ cryo-EM to elucidate the structure of full-length rabbit TRPV2 in complex with the agonist resiniferatoxin (RTx) in nanodiscs and amphipol. We show that RTx induces two-fold symmetric conformations of TRPV2 in both environments. However, the two-fold symmetry is more pronounced in the native-like lipid environment of the nanodiscs. Our data offers insights into a gating pathway in TRPV2 involving symmetry transitions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45107">Reciprocal action of Casein Kinase Iε on core planar polarity proteins regulates clustering and asymmetric localisation</a></h4>

The conserved core planar polarity pathway is essential for coordinating polarised cell behaviours and the formation of polarised structures such as cilia and hairs. Core planar polarity proteins localise asymmetrically to opposite cell ends and form intercellular complexes that link the polarity of neighbouring cells. This asymmetric segregation is regulated by phosphorylation through poorly understood mechanisms. We show that loss of phosphorylation of the core protein Strabismus in the <i>Drosophila </i>pupal wing increases its stability and promotes its clustering at intercellular junctions, and that Prickle negatively regulates Strabismus phosphorylation. Additionally, loss of phosphorylation of Dishevelled - which normally localises to opposite cell edges to Strabismus - reduces its stability at junctions. Moreover, both phosphorylation events are independently mediated by Casein Kinase Iε. We conclude that Casein Kinase Iε phosphorylation acts as a switch, promoting Strabismus mobility and Dishevelled immobility, thus enhancing sorting of these proteins to opposite cell edges.

Using RNAseq of threespine stickleback fish gill tissue from four independent marine-freshwater ecotype pairs and their F1 hybrids, we show that <i>cis</i>-acting (allele-specific) regulation consistently predominates gene expression divergence. Genes showing parallel marine-freshwater expression divergence are found near to adaptive genomic regions, show signatures of natural selection around their transcription start sites and are enriched for <i>cis-</i>regulatory control. For genes with parallel increased expression among freshwater fish, the quantitative degree of <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans-</i>regulation is also highly correlated across populations, suggesting a shared genetic basis. Compared to other forms of regulation, <i>cis-</i>regulation tends to show greater additivity and stability across different genetic and environmental contexts, making it a fertile substrate for the early stages of adaptive evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43747">Hierarchical stem cell topography splits growth and homeostatic functions in the fish gill</a></h4>

While lower vertebrates contain adult stem cells (aSCs) that maintain homeostasis and drive un-exhaustive organismal growth, mammalian aSCs display mainly the homeostatic function. Here we use lineage analysis in the fish gill to address aSCs and report separate stem cell populations for homeostasis and growth. These aSCs are fate-restricted during the entire post-embryonic life and even during re-generation paradigms. We use chimeric animals to demonstrate that p53 mediates growth coordination among fate-restricted aSCs, suggesting a hierarchical organisation among lineages in composite organs like the fish gill. Homeostatic and growth aSCs are clonal but differ in their topology; modifications in tissue architecture can convert the homeostatic zone into a growth zone, indicating a leading role for the physical niche defining stem cell output. We hypothesise that physical niches are main players to restrict aSCs to a homeostatic function in animals with fixed adult size.

Although B cells expressing the IFNgR or the IFNg-inducible transcription factor T-bet drive autoimmunity in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)-prone mouse models, the role for IFNg signaling in human antibody responses is unknown. We show that elevated levels of IFNg in SLE patients correlate with expansion of the T-bet<sup> </sup>expressing IgD<sup>neg</sup>CD27<sup>neg</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>neg</sup> (DN2) pre-antibody secreting cell (pre-ASC) subset. We demonstrate that naïve B cells form T-bet<sup>hi</sup> pre-ASCs following stimulation with either Th1 cells or with IFNg, IL-2, anti-Ig and TLR7/8 ligand and that IL-21 dependent ASC formation is significantly enhanced by IFNg or IFNg-producing T cells. IFNg promotes ASC development by synergizing with IL-2 and TLR7/8 ligands to induce genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming of B cells, which results in increased chromatin accessibility surrounding IRF4 and BLIMP1 binding motifs and epigenetic remodeling of <i>IL21R</i> and <i>PRDM1</i> loci. Finally, we show that IFNg signals poise B cells to differentiate by increasing their responsiveness to IL-21.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40744">Elevated synaptic vesicle release probability in synaptophysin/gyrin family quadruple knockouts</a></h4>

Synaptophysins 1 and 2 and synaptogyrins 1 and 3 constitute a major family of synaptic vesicle membrane proteins. Unlike other widely expressed synaptic vesicle proteins such as vSNAREs and synaptotagmins, the primary function has not been resolved. Here, we report robust elevation in the probability of release of readily releasable vesicles with both high and low release probabilities at a variety of synapse types from knockout mice missing all four family members. Neither the number of readily releasable vesicles, nor the timing of recruitment to the readily releasable pool was affected. The results suggest that family members serve as negative regulators of neurotransmission, acting directly at the level of exocytosis to dampen connection strength selectively when presynaptic action potentials fire at low frequency. The widespread expression suggests that chemical synapses may play a frequency filtering role in biological computation that is more elemental than presently envisioned.

Social behavior, a highly adaptive and crucial component of mammalian life, is regulated by particularly sensitive regulatory brain mechanisms. Substantial evidence implicates classical epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and nucleosome remodeling as well as nonclassical mechanisms mediated by noncoding RNA in the regulation of social behavior. These mechanisms collectively form the ‘epigenetic network’ that orchestrates genomic integration of salient and transient social experiences.

<p>by Natalie Schaworonkow, Vadim V. Nikulin</p>

Neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous in the human brain and are implicated in virtually all brain functions. Although they can be described by a prominent peak in the power spectrum, their waveform is not necessarily sinusoidal and shows rather complex morphology. Both frequency and temporal descriptions of such non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations can be utilized. However, in non-invasive EEG/MEG recordings the waveform of oscillations often takes a sinusoidal shape which in turn leads to a rather oversimplified view on oscillatory processes. In this study, we show in simulations how spatial synchronization can mask non-sinusoidal features of the underlying rhythmic neuronal processes. Consequently, the degree of non-sinusoidality can serve as a measure of spatial synchronization. To confirm this empirically, we show that a mixture of EEG components is indeed associated with more sinusoidal oscillations compared to the waveform of oscillations in each constituent component. Using simulations, we also show that the spatial mixing of the non-sinusoidal neuronal signals strongly affects the amplitude ratio of the spectral harmonics constituting the waveform. Finally, our simulations show how spatial mixing can affect the strength and even the direction of the amplitude coupling between constituent neuronal harmonics at different frequencies. Validating these simulations, we also demonstrate these effects in real EEG recordings. Our findings have far reaching implications for the neurophysiological interpretation of spectral profiles, cross-frequency interactions, as well as for the unequivocal determination of oscillatory phase.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N0Etve-bRHE" width="1" />

<p>by Jingwei Sun, Jian Li, Hang Zhang</p>

Behavioral and neuroimaging evidence shows that human decisions are sensitive to the statistical regularities (mean, variance, skewness, etc.) of reward distributions. However, it is unclear what representations human observers form to approximate reward distributions, or probability distributions in general. When the possible values of a probability distribution are numerous, it is cognitively costly and perhaps unrealistic to maintain in mind the probability of each possible value. Here we propose a Clusters of Samples (CoS) representation model: The samples of the to-be-represented distribution are classified into a small number of clusters and only the centroids and relative weights of the clusters are retained for future use. We tested the behavioral relevance of CoS in four experiments. On each trial, human subjects reported the mean and mode of a sequentially presented multimodal distribution of spatial positions or orientations. By varying the global and local features of the distributions, we observed systematic errors in the reported mean and mode. We found that our CoS representation of probability distributions outperformed alternative models in accounting for subjects’ response patterns. The ostensible influence of positive/negative skewness on the over/under estimation of the reported mean, analogous to the “skewness preference” phenomenon in decisions, could be well explained by models based on CoS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cjl-cbibIkY" width="1" />

<p>by Yuanxiao Gao, Arne Traulsen, Yuriy Pichugin</p>

Evolution of complex multicellular life began from the emergence of a life cycle involving the formation of cell clusters. The opportunity for cells to interact within clusters provided them with an advantage over unicellular life forms. However, what kind of interactions may lead to the evolution of multicellular life cycles? Here, we combine evolutionary game theory with a model for the emergence of multicellular groups to investigate how cell interactions can influence reproduction modes during the early stages of the evolution of multicellularity. In our model, the presence of both cell types is maintained by stochastic phenotype switching during cell division. We identify evolutionary optimal life cycles as those which maximize the population growth rate. Among all interactions captured by two-player games, the vast majority promotes two classes of life cycles: (i) splitting into unicellular propagules or (ii) fragmentation into two offspring clusters of equal (or almost equal) size. Our findings indicate that the three most important characteristics, determining whether multicellular life cycles will evolve, are the average performance of homogeneous groups, heterogeneous groups, and solitary cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KOuRnIo7nI4" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>MicroRNA (miRNA)‐mediated (dys)regulation of gene expression has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), although results of miRNA expression studies remain inconclusive. We aimed to identify miRNAs that show consistent differential expression across all published expression studies in PD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a systematic literature search on miRNA expression studies in PD and extracted data from eligible publications. After stratification for brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)‐derived specimen, we performed meta‐analyses across miRNAs assessed in three or more independent data sets. Meta‐analyses were performed using effect‐size– and <i>p</i>‐value–based methods, as applicable.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After screening 599 publications, we identified 47 data sets eligible for meta‐analysis. On these, we performed 160 meta‐analyses on miRNAs quantified in brain (n = 125), blood (n = 31), or CSF (n = 4). Twenty‐one meta‐analyses were performed using effect sizes. We identified 13 significantly (Bonferroni‐adjusted α = 3.13 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) differentially expressed miRNAs in brain (n = 3) and blood (n = 10) with consistent effect directions across studies. The most compelling findings were with hsa‐miR‐132‐3p (<i>p</i> = 6.37 × 10<sup>–5</sup>), hsa‐miR‐497‐5p (<i>p</i> = 1.35 × 10<sup>–4</sup>), and hsa‐miR‐133b (<i>p</i> = 1.90 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) in brain and with hsa‐miR‐221‐3p (<i>p</i> = 4.49 × 10<sup>–35</sup>), hsa‐miR‐214‐3p (<i>p</i> = 2.00 × 10<sup>–34</sup>), and hsa‐miR‐29c‐3p (<i>p</i> = 3.00 × 10<sup>–12</sup>) in blood. No significant signals were found in CSF. Analyses of genome‐wide association study data for target genes of brain miRNAs showed significant association (α = 9.40 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) of genetic variants in nine loci.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified several miRNAs that showed highly significant differential expression in PD.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We compared outcomes after treatment with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a recent cerebral ischemia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted an individual patient data analysis of seven prospective cohort studies. We included patients with AF and a recent cerebral ischemia (&lt;3 months before starting oral anticoagulation) and a minimum follow‐up of 3 months. We analyzed the association between type of anticoagulation (DOAC versus VKA) with the composite primary endpoint (recurrent ischemic stroke [AIS], intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], or mortality) using mixed‐effects Cox proportional hazards regression models; we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 4,912 patients (median age, 78 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 71–84]; 2,331 [47.5%] women; median National Institute of Health Stroke Severity Scale at onset, 5 [IQR, 2–12]); 2,256 (45.9%) patients received VKAs and 2,656 (54.1%) DOACs. Median time from index event to starting oral anticoagulation was 5 days (IQR, 2–14) for VKAs and 5 days (IQR, 2–11) for DOACs (<i>p</i> = 0.53). There were 262 acute ischemic strokes (AISs; 4.4%/year), 71 intracranial hemorrrhages (ICHs; 1.2%/year), and 439 deaths (7.4%/year) during the total follow‐up of 5,970 patient‐years. Compared to VKAs, DOAC treatment was associated with reduced risks of the composite endpoint (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67–1.00; <i>p</i> = 0.05) and ICH (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24–0.71; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01); we found no differences for the risk of recurrent AIS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.70–1.19; <i>p</i> = 0.5) and mortality (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68–1.03; <i>p</i> = 0.09).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DOAC treatment commenced early after recent cerebral ischemia related to AF was associated with reduced risk of poor clinical outcomes compared to VKA, mainly attributed to lower risks of ICH. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:823–834.</b></p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25488?af=R">A hexanucleotide repeat modifies expressivity of X‐linked dystonia parkinsonism</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>X‐linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by a single mutation: SINE‐VNTR‐Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion in <i>TAF1</i>. Recently, a (CCCTCT)<sub>n</sub> repeat within the SVA insertion has been reported as an age‐at‐onset (AAO) modifier in XDP. Here we investigate the role of this hexanucleotide repeat in modifying expressivity of XDP.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We genotyped the hexanucleotide repeat in 355 XDP patients and correlated the repeat number (RN) with AAO (n = 295), initial clinical manifestation (n = 294), site of dystonia onset (n = 238), disease severity (n = 28), and cognitive function (n = 15). Furthermore, we investigated i) repeat instability by segregation analysis and Southern blotting using postmortem brain samples from two affected individuals and ii) relative <i>TAF1</i> expression in blood RNA from 31 XDP patients.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>RN showed significant inverse correlations with AAO and with <i>TAF1</i> expression and a positive correlation with disease severity and cognitive dysfunction. Importantly, AAO (and not RN) was directly associated with whether dystonia or parkinsonism will manifest at onset. RN was lower in patients affected by mouth/tongue dystonia compared with blepharospasm. RN was unstable across germline transmissions with an overall tendency to increase in length and exhibited somatic mosaicism in brain.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The hexanucleotide repeat within the SVA insertion acts as a genetic modifier of disease expressivity in XDP. RN‐dependent <i>TAF1</i> repression and subsequent differences in <i>TAF1</i> mRNA levels in patients may be potentiated in the brain through somatic variability leading to the neurological phenotype. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:812–822.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Common variants near <i>TMEM106B</i> associate with risk of developing frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Emerging evidence suggests a role for <i>TMEM106B</i> in neurodegenerative processes beyond FTD. We evaluate the effect of <i>TMEM106B</i> genotype on cognitive decline across multiple neurogenerative diseases.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We longitudinally followed 870 subjects with diagnoses of Parkinson disease (PD; n = 179), FTD (n = 179), Alzheimer disease (AD; n = 300), memory‐predominant mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 75), or neurologically normal control subjects (NC; n = 137) at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). All participants had annual Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE; median follow‐up duration = 3.0 years) and were genotyped at <i>TMEM106B</i> index single nucleotide polymorphism rs1990622. Genotype effects on cognition were confirmed by extending analyses to additional cognitive instruments (Mattis Dementia Rating Scale‐2 [DRS‐2] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) and to an international validation cohort (Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative [PPMI], N = 371).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The <i>TMEM106B</i> rs1990622<sup>T</sup> allele, linked to increased risk of FTD, associated with greater MMSE decline over time in PD subjects but not in AD or MCI subjects. For FTD subjects, rs1990622<sup>T</sup> associated with more rapid decrease in MMSE only under the minor‐allele, rs1990622<sup>C</sup>, dominant model. Among PD patients, rs1990622<sup>T</sup> carriers from the UPenn cohort demonstrated more rapid longitudinal decline in DRS‐2 scores. Finally, in the PPMI cohort, <i>TMEM106B</i> risk allele carriers demonstrated more rapid longitudinal decline in MoCA scores.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Irrespective of cognitive instrument or cohort assessed, <i>TMEM106B</i> acts as a genetic modifier for cognitive trajectory in PD. Our results implicate lysosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in 2 different proteinopathies. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:801–811.</b></p>

<p>Flow diverters are new generation stents that have recently garnered a large amount of interest for use in treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Flow diverters reduce blood flow into the aneurysm, with redirection along the path of the parent vessel. Flow stagnation into the aneurysm and neck coverage with subsequent endothelialization are the important synergistic mechanisms by which the therapy acts. Several studies have examined the mechanisms by which flow diverters subsequently lead to aneurysm occlusion. This review aims to provide a general overview of the flow diverters and their mechanism of action and potential implications. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:793–800.</b></p>

<p>c‐Jun‐amino‐terminal kinase‐interacting protein 3 (JIP3), encoded by <i>MAPK8IP3</i>, is an adaptor protein of the kinesin‐1 complex and essential for axonal transport in neurons. However, an association between <i>MAPK8IP3</i> variants and human disease has not been established. We identified 5 individuals from four families with recurrent de novo variants c.1732C&gt;T (p.Arg578Cys) and c.3436C&gt;T (p.Arg1146Cys) in <i>MAPK8IP3</i>. The core phenotype includes spastic diplegia, intellectual disability, cerebral atrophy, and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Zebrafish embryos overexpressing human mutant JIP3 showed axon varicosities of the posterior lateral line nerve, suggesting an adverse effect on the developing axons.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease is most commonly caused by duplication of a chromosomal segment surrounding <i>Peripheral Myelin Protein 22</i>, or <i>PMP22</i> gene, which is classified as CMT1A. Several candidate therapies reduce <i>Pmp22</i> mRNA levels in CMT1A rodent models, but development of biomarkers for clinical trials in CMT1A is a challenge given its slow progression and difficulty in obtaining nerve samples. Quantitative PCR measurements of <i>PMP22</i> mRNA in dermal nerves were performed using skin biopsies in human clinical trials for CMT1A, but this approach did not show increased <i>PMP22</i> mRNA in CMT1A patients compared to controls. One complicating factor is the variable amounts of Schwann cells (SCs) in skin. The objective of the study was to develop a novel method for precise evaluation of <i>PMP22</i> levels in skin biopsies that can discriminate CMT1A patients from controls.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We have developed methods to normalize <i>PMP22</i> transcript levels to SC‐specific genes that are not altered by CMT1A status. Several CMT1A‐associated genes were assembled into a custom Nanostring panel to enable precise transcript measurements that can be normalized to variable SC content.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The digital expression data from Nanostring analysis showed reproducible elevation of PMP22 levels in CMT1A versus control skin biopsies, particularly after normalization to SC‐specific genes.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This platform should be useful in clinical trials for CMT1A as a biomarker of target engagement that can be used to optimize dosing, and the same normalization framework is applicable to other types of CMT. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:887–898.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accurate identification of the ischemic penumbra, the therapeutic target in acute clinical stroke, is of critical importance to identify patients who might benefit from reperfusion therapies beyond the established time windows. Therefore, we aimed to validate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) mismatch–based penumbra detection against full quantitative positron emission tomography (<sup>15</sup>O‐PET), the gold standard for penumbra detection in acute ischemic stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ten patients (group A) with acute and subacute ischemic stroke underwent perfusion‐weighted (PW)/diffusion‐weighted MRI and consecutive full quantitative <sup>15</sup>O‐PET within 48 hours of stroke onset. Penumbra as defined by <sup>15</sup>O‐PET cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction, and oxygen metabolism was used to validate a wide range of established PW measures (eg, time‐to‐maximum [Tmax]) to optimize penumbral tissue detection. Validation was carried out using a voxel‐based receiver‐operating‐characteristic curve analysis. The same validation based on penumbra as defined by quantitative <sup>15</sup>O‐PET CBF was performed for comparative reasons in 23 patients measured within 48 hours of stroke onset (group B).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The PW map Tmax (area‐under‐the‐curve = 0.88) performed best in detecting penumbral tissue up to 48 hours after stroke onset. The optimal threshold to discriminate penumbra from oligemia was Tmax &gt;5.6 seconds with a sensitivity and specificity of &gt;80%.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The performance of the best PW measure Tmax to detect the upper penumbral flow threshold in ischemic stroke is excellent. Tmax &gt;5.6 seconds–based penumbra detection is reliable to guide treatment decisions up to 48 hours after stroke onset and might help to expand reperfusion treatment beyond the current time windows. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:875–886.</b></p>

Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of a 20‐month‐old <i>SLC1A2</i>‐related epilepsy patient with the SLC1A2‐modulating agent ceftriaxone did not result in a significant change in daily spasm count. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:921–926.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine the longitudinal course of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in women with a history of migraine in comparison to women without a history of migraine disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study sample consisted of 467 women with a self‐reported prior migraine diagnosis and 2,466 women without prior migraine diagnosis who were assessed longitudinally during menopausal transition as part of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Linear mixed regression models with backward elimination were used to evaluate longitudinal associations between VMS and migraine while adjusting for baseline and time‐varying demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and reproductive factors. Additional analyses were performed to further assess the specificity of the association between migraine and VMS that included evaluating the association between migraine and vaginal dryness and between back pain and VMS.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A history of migraine predicted an increased frequency of VMS but not vaginal dryness during menopausal transition. Significant interaction between history of migraine and menopausal status for the prediction of VMS was also identified. Burden of VMS was found to be higher during late‐stage perimenopause in women with migraine. In contrast, the history of back pain did not predict the frequency of VMS.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first study to delineate that a history of migraine predicts an increased frequency of VMS in women during menopausal transition. Hypothalamic abnormalities and thermoregulatory dysfunction against a milieu of decreasing estradiol concentrations during menopausal transition may explain the increased frequency of VMS in migraineurs during menopausal transition. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:865–874.</b></p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25475?af=R">Deep brain stimulation: Connectivity profile for bradykinesia alleviation</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Subthalamic deep brain stimulation may alleviate bradykinesia in Parkinson patients. Research suggests that this stimulation effect may be mediated by brain networks like the corticocerebellar loop. This study investigated the connectivity between stimulation sites and cortical and subcortical structures to identify connections for effective stimulation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively investigated 21 patients with Parkinson disease with bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation. Stimulation effectiveness in reducing bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity was evaluated for each electrode contact in brain hemispheres contralateral to the affected hemibody. Dysarthric side effects were also examined. Probabilistic tractography based on diffusion‐weighted imaging was performed in individual patient‐specific brains using electrode contacts as seeds. Connectivity profiles of contacts with effective and noneffective stimulation were compared.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Connectivity profiles of effective and noneffective contacts differed. Moreover, the connectivity profile for bradykinesia differed from that for rigidity, tremor, or dysarthria. Regarding bradykinesia, effective contacts were significantly more often connected with the ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncle and the ipsilateral dentate nucleus, which correspond to the ipsilateral portion of the cerebellothalamocortical pathway. Rigidity was mitigated by stimulation of ascending brainstem and intralaminar thalamic connections. Tremor alleviation was related to connections with the internal capsule (anterior limb) and the pallidum. Dysarthric side effects were associated with connections to the supplementary motor area and the decussating cerebellothalamocortical pathway.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Whereas bradykinesia seems to be mitigated by stimulation of the ascending, ipsilateral cerebellothalamocortical pathway, stimulation of the descending corticopontocerebellar pathway may be ineffective. Rigidity, tremor, and dysarthric side effects seem to be influenced by different neural networks. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:852–864.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite decades of epilepsy research, 30% of focal epilepsies remain resistant to antiseizure drugs, with effective drug development impeded by lack of understanding on how seizures are initiated. Here, we report the mechanism of seizure onset relevant to most seizures that are characteristic of focal epilepsies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Electric and metabolic network parameters were measured using several seizure models in mouse hippocampal slices and acutely induced seizures in rats in vivo to determine metabolic events occurring at seizure onset.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that seizure onset is associated with a rapid release of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resulting from N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor‐mediated activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX). NOX blockade prevented the fast H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> release as well as the direct current shift and seizurelike event induction in slices. Similarly, intracerebroventricular injection of NOX antagonists prevented acutely induced seizures in rats.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results show that seizures are initiated by NMDA receptor‐mediated NOX‐induced oxidative stress and can be arrested by NOX inhibition. We introduce a novel use for blood–brain barrier‐permeable NOX inhibitor with a significant potential to become the first seizure‐specific medication. Thus, targeting NOX may provide a breakthrough treatment for focal epilepsies. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:907–920.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To clinically and pathologically characterize a cohort of patients presenting with a novel form of distal myopathy and to identify the genetic cause of this new muscular dystrophy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied 4 families (3 from Spain and 1 from Sweden) suffering from an autosomal dominant distal myopathy. Affected members showed adult onset asymmetric distal muscle weakness with initial involvement of ankle dorsiflexion later progressing also to proximal limb muscles.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In all 3 Spanish families, we identified a unique missense variant in the <i>ACTN2</i> gene cosegregating with the disease. The affected members of the Swedish family carry a different <i>ACTN2</i> missense variant.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>
<i>ACTN2</i> encodes for alpha actinin2, which is highly expressed in the sarcomeric Z‐disk with a major structural and functional role. Actininopathy is thus a new genetically determined distal myopathy. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:899–906.</b></p>

<p>We investigated whether computed tomography (CT) perfusion can identify intracerebral hemorrhage patients at high risk of hematoma growth (HG). A total of 155 subjects underwent CT perfusion on admission. Variables associated with log‐transformed absolute HG were explored with multivariable linear regression. Perihematomal cerebral blood volume (CBV) was inversely associated with HG (B = –0.20; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), independently from blood pressure, hematoma volume, and other confounders. This association was not dose dependent, and only very low CBV (&lt;1.4 ml/100 g) was significantly associated with HG (B = 0.25; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, reduced perihematomal CBV is associated with HG, suggesting a potential role of the perihematomal region in the pathophysiology of hematoma enlargement. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:943–947.</b></p>

<p>Accumulating evidence corroborates the role of the “central vein sign” in the radiological diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we report human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and corresponding pathological data that inflammation‐dependent intracerebral remodeling of the vessel wall is directly associated with the prominence of intralesional veins on susceptibility‐based MRI. In adult marmosets with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, vessel‐wall fibrosis was detected early in the demyelinating process, even in lesions &lt;2 weeks old, though fibrosis was more evident after 6 weeks. Vascular remodeling consisted of both luminal enlargement and eccentric thickening of the perivascular space (fibrillar collagen type I deposition) and affected almost exclusively white matter, but not subpial cortical, lesions. The long‐term effect of vessel remodeling in MS lesions is currently unknown, but it might potentially affect tissue repair. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:934–942.</b></p>

Abstract
<p>Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that provides a functional interpretation of top-down and bottom-up interactions in sensory processing. The theory suggests there are differences in message passing up versus down the cortical hierarchy. These differences result from the linear feedforward of prediction errors, and the nonlinear feedback of predictions. This implies that cross-frequency interactions should predominate top-down. But it remains unknown whether these differences are expressed in cross-frequency interactions in the brain. Here we examined bidirectional cross-frequency coupling across four sectors of the auditory hierarchy in the macaque. We computed two measures of cross-frequency coupling, phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude–amplitude coupling (AAC). Our findings revealed distinct patterns for bottom-up and top-down information processing among cross-frequency interactions. Both top-down and bottom-up interactions made prominent use of low frequencies: low-to-low-frequency (theta, alpha, beta) and low-frequency-to-high- gamma couplings were predominant top-down, while low-frequency-to-low-gamma couplings were predominant bottom-up. These patterns were largely preserved across coupling types (PAC and AAC) and across stimulus types (natural and synthetic auditory stimuli), suggesting that they are a general feature of information processing in auditory cortex. Our findings suggest the modulatory effect of low frequencies on gamma-rhythms in distant regions is important for bidirectional information transfer. The finding of low-frequency-to-low-gamma interactions in the bottom-up direction suggest that nonlinearities may also play a role in feedforward message passing. Altogether, the patterns of cross-frequency interaction we observed across the auditory hierarchy are largely consistent with the predictive coding framework.</p>

<p>Blocking inhibitory factors within CNS demyelinating lesions is regarded as a promising strategy to promote remyelination. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is an inhibitory factor present in demyelinating lesions. Noggin, an endogenous antagonist to BMP, has previously been shown to increase the number of oligodendrocytes and promote remyelination <i>in vivo.</i> However, it remains unclear how BMP4 signaling inhibits remyelination. Here we investigated the downstream signaling pathway that mediates the inhibitory effect that BMP4 exerts upon remyelination through pharmacological and transgenic approaches. Using the cuprizone mouse model of central demyelination, we demonstrate that selectively blocking BMP4 signaling via the pharmacological inhibitor LDN-193189 significantly promotes oligodendroglial differentiation and the extent of remyelination <i>in vivo</i>. This was accompanied by the downregulation of transcriptional targets that suppress oligodendrocyte differentiation. Further, selective deletion of BMP receptor type IA (BMPRIA) within primary mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) significantly enhanced their differentiation and subsequent myelination <i>in vitro</i>. Together, the results of this study identify that BMP4 signals via BMPRIA within OPCs to inhibit oligodendroglial differentiation and their capacity to myelinate axons, and suggest that blocking the BMP4/BMPRIA pathway in OPCs is a promising strategy to promote CNS remyelination.</p>

<p>The human brain is constantly processing and integrating information in order
to make decisions and interact with the world, for tasks from recognizing a
familiar face to playing a game of tennis. These complex cognitive processes
require communication between large populations of neurons. The non-invasive
neuroimaging methods of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography
(MEG) provide population measures of neural activity with millisecond precision
that allow us to study the temporal dynamics of cognitive processes. However,
multi-sensor M/EEG data is inherently high dimensional, making it difficult to
parse important signal from noise. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) or
"decoding" methods offer vast potential for understanding high-dimensional
M/EEG neural data. MVPA can be used to distinguish between different conditions
and map the time courses of various neural processes, from basic sensory
processing to high-level cognitive processes. In this chapter, we discuss the
practical aspects of performing decoding analyses on M/EEG data as well as the
limitations of the method, and then we discuss some applications for
understanding representational dynamics in the human brain.

<p>An artificial neural network (ANN) based on fundamental principles of physics

<p>Cortical systems such as the visual cortex exhibit behaviors that change
according to behavioral and stimulus context. It is still unknown what
mechanisms underlie this adaptive processing in cortical circuitry. In this
paper, we present a model of randomly coupled supercritical Andronov-Hopf
oscillators, which as a whole system can act as an adaptive processor by
exhibiting drastically different dynamics depending on the value of a single
network parameter. Despite being only composed of supercritical subunits, the
full system can exhibit either supercritical or subcritical Andronov-Hopf
bifurcations. This model might provide a novel mechanism for switching between
globally asymptotically stable and nonhyperbolic neural network types in
pattern recognition theory.

Huntington’s Disease (HD) is a heritable neurological disorder that affects cognitive and motor performance in patients carrying the mutated huntingtin (HTT) gene. In mouse models of HD, previous reports showed a significant increase in spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). In this study, using optogenetics and slice electrophysiology, we examined the contribution of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing interneurons to the increase in GABA neurotransmission using the Q175 (heterozygote) mouse model of HD. Patch clamp recordings in voltage-clamp mode, were performed on SPNs from brain slices of presymptomatic (2 month) and symptomatic (8 and 12 month) Q175 mice and wildtype (WT) littermates. While inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked in SPNs following optical activation of PV- and SOM-expressing interneurons differed in amplitude, no genotype-dependent differences were observed at all ages from both interneuron types; however, responses evoked by either type were found to have faster kinetics in symptomatic mice. Since SOM-expressing interneurons are constitutively active in striatal brain slices, we then examined the effects of acutely silencing these neurons in symptomatic mice with halorhodopsin (eNpHR). Optically silencing SOM-expressing interneurons resulted in a greater decrease in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in a subset of SPNs from Q175 mice compared to WTs, suggesting that SOM-expressing interneurons are the main contributors to the overall increased GABA synaptic activity in HD SPNs. Additionally, the effects of activating GABAB and cannabinoid (CB1) receptors were investigated to determine whether these receptors were involved in modulating interneuron-specific GABA synaptic transmission and if this modulation differed in HD mice. When selectively activating PV- and SOM-expressing interneurons in the presence of the CB1 receptor agonist WIN-55,212, the magnitudes of the evoked IPSCs in SPNs decreased for both interneuron types although this change was less prominent in symptomatic Q175 SPNs during SOM-expressing interneuron activation. Overall, these findings show that dysfunction of SOM-expressing interneurons contributes to the increased GABA synaptic activity found in HD mouse models and that dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system may contribute to this effect.

Netrin-G ligand-1 (NGL-1), also known as LRRC4C, is a PSD-95–interacting postsynaptic adhesion molecule that interacts trans-synaptically with presynaptic netrin-G1. NGL-1 and its family member protein NGL-2 are thought to promote excitatory synapse development through largely non-overlapping neuronal pathways. While NGL-2 has been shown to be critical for excitatory synapse development in specific dendritic segments of neurons in an input-specific manner, whether NGL-1 has similar functions is unclear. Here, we show that NGL-1 deletion in male mice moderately suppresses excitatory synapse development and function, but surprisingly, does so in an input-independent manner. While NGL-1 is mainly detected in the stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) layer of the hippocampus relative to the stratum radiatum (SR) layer, NGL-1 deletion leads to decreases in dendritic spine density in both SLM and SR layers in the ventral hippocampus. In addition, both SLM and SR excitatory synapses display suppressed short-term synaptic plasticity in the ventral hippocampus. These morphological and functional changes are either absent or modest in the dorsal hippocampus. The input-independent synaptic changes induced by NGL-1 deletion involve abnormal translocation of NGL-2 from the SR to SLM layer. These results suggest that NGL-1 deletion moderately suppresses hippocampal excitatory synapse development and function in an input-independent manner.

Neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have shown promise as neuroprotective agents, indicating their potential in therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disease. However, the inherent bioactivity and pharmaceutical limitations of BDNF compromise its clinical efficacy. Research has documented the beneficial effects of electroacupuncture (EA) against neurodegeneration, possibly by BDNF-mediated mechanisms. The present study was designed to clarify whether EA can mount a neuroprotective effect in mice lesioned with MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) via stimulation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. We found that EA not only ameliorated the motor dysfunction but also restored the dopaminergic neuronal function and upregulated BDNF expression in MPTP-lesioned mice. Interestingly, the TrkB inhibitor K252a abolished the neuroprotective effects of EA. Western blot analyses further demonstrated that EA might recover the level of phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, and BDNF against MPTP neurotoxicity via reversing the imbalance between TrkB FL and TrkB T1. Taken together, the results of the present study show that EA stimulation can ameliorate MPTP-induced parkinsonism in mice. Such a neuroprotective effect may be partially mediated via restoring TrkB neurotrophic signaling.

Groupwise image registration tackles biases that can potentially arise from inappropriate template selection. It typically involves simultaneous registration of a cohort of images to a common space that is not specified a priori. Existing groupwise registration methods are computationally complex and are only effective for image populations without large anatomical variations. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework to rapidly estimate large deformations between images to significantly reduce structural variability. Specifically, we employ a multi-level graph coarsening method to agglomerate similar images into clusters, each represented by an exemplar image. We then use a deep learning framework to predict the initial deformations between images. Warping with the estimated deformations brings the images closer in the image manifold and their alignment can be further refined using conventional groupwise registration algorithms. We evaluated the effectiveness of our method in groupwise registration of MR brain images and compared it against state-of-the-art groupwise registration methods. Experimental results indicate that deformation initialization enables groupwise registration to converge significantly faster with competitive accuracy, therefore facilitates large-scale imaging studies.

To study the interplay of metabolic state (hungry vs. satiated) and glucose administration (including hormonal modulation) on brain function, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and blood samples were obtained in 24 healthy normal-weight men in a repeated measurement design. Participants were measured twice: once after a 36 hours fast (except water) and once under satiation (three meals/day for 36 hours). During each session, rs-fMRI and hormone concentrations were recorded before and after a 75 g oral dose of glucose. We calculated the amplitude map from BOLD signals by using the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) approach for each volunteer per condition. Using multiple linear regression analysis the interdependence of brain activity, plasma insulin and blood glucose was investigated. We observed a modulatory impact of fasting state on intrinsic brain activity in the posterior cingulate cortex. Strikingly, differences in plasma insulin levels between hunger and satiety states after glucose administration at the time of the scan were negatively related to brain activity in the posterior insula and superior frontal gyrus, while plasma glucose levels were positively associated with activity changes in the fusiform gyrus. Furthermore, we could show that changes in plasma insulin enhanced the connectivity between the posterior insula and superior frontal gyrus. Our results indicate that hormonal signals like insulin alleviate an acute hemostatic energy deficit by modifying the homeostatic and frontal circuitry of the human brain.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00161">A Perspective on Objective Measurement of the Perceived Challenge of Walking</a></h4>

Perceived challenge of walking is a broad term that we use to encompass walking-related anxiety, balance self-efficacy/confidence, and fear of falling. Evidence shows that even after accounting for physical performance capabilities, a higher perceived challenge can cause individuals to self-impose restrictions in walking-related activities. Perceived challenge is typically measured by self-report, which is susceptible to subjective measurement bias and error. We assert that measurement of perceived challenge can be enhanced by augmenting self-report with objective, physiologically based measures. A promising approach that has emerged in the literature is measurement of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity by recording skin conductance. Heightened SNS activity is a physiological stress response to conditions that are cognitively, emotionally, or physically challenging. In the present article we explain the rationale and physiological basis for measuring SNS activity to assess perceived challenge of walking. We also present existing and new evidence supporting the feasibility of this approach for assessing perceived challenge in lab-based and real-world walking environments. Future research directions are also discussed.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00160">Sleep Is a Refreshing Process: An fNIRS Study</a></h4>

Sleep is a very critical process that constitutes up to one third of daytime of a healthy adult. It is known to be an active period where body and brain is refreshed for the next day. It is both part of a larger cycle, i.e. circadian rhythm, and has subcsycles in it, i.e. sleep stages. Although hemodynamics of these stages have been investigated especially in the last two decades, there are still points in the hemodynamics to be illuminated especially in terms of refreshment. This study aims to investigate refreshing property of sleep in terms of sleep stages using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for measuring prefrontal cortex (PFC) hemodynamics.
Nine healthy subjects slept in sleep laboratories, monitored by polysomnography and fNIRS before, during, and after night sleep. REM stage had lower oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and total hemoglobin (HbT) than the other sleep stages and wakefulness. Deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) did not differ between any stages. All sleep stages and wakefulness stage at the end of the sleep had higher HbO and lower HbR than the beginning of the sleep. HbT levels did not differ between the beginning and the end of the sleep for any stages.
During REM sleep, PFC seems to get lower blood supply, possibly due to increased demand in other brain regions. Regardless of the stage, PFC has higher oxygenation towards the end of sleep, indicating refreshment.
Overall, our brain seems to be on duty during sleep throughout the night for “cleaning” and “refreshing” itself. Hemodynamic changes from the beginning to end of sleep might be the indicator of this work. Thus, accordingly REM stage seems to be at a central point for this work.

It is generally assumed that different EEG frequency bands are somehow related to different computational modes in the brain. Integration of these computational modes is reflected in the phenomenon of cross-frequency coupling (CFC). On slow temporal scales, CFC may reflect trait-like properties, which posits a question of its developmental trends. This is the first study that explored source-level CFC measures in developmental perspective using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. CFC measures demonstrated good test-retest stability and proved to be higher in adults in cortical areas participating in sensory-motor integration, response inhibition, and attentional control. In children, greater CFC was observed in parietal regions involved in self-centered cognition. Over the period from 7 to 10 years, CFC demonstrated nonlinear growth trajectories. Introversion was associated with higher CFC in cortical areas related to emotion, attention, and social cognition implying that the association between introversion and CFC appears early in the development.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00155">Grief, Mindfulness and Neural Predictors of Improvement in Family Dementia Caregivers</a></h4>

Background: Family dementia caregivers often suffer from an immense toll of grief while caring for their loved ones.  We sought to identify the clinical relationship between grief, depression and mindfulness and identify neural predictors of symptomatology and improvement. 

Methods: 23 family dementia caregivers were assessed at baseline for grief, mindfulness and depression, of which 17 underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  During fMRI, caregivers were shown faces of either their dementia-stricken relative or that of a stranger, paired with grief-related or neutral words.  In 9 subjects, post fMRI scans were also obtained after four weeks of either guided imagery or relaxation.  Robust regression was used to predict changes in symptoms with longitudinal brain activation changes as the dependent variable. 

Results:  Grief and depression symptoms were correlated (r = 0.50, p = .01), and both were negatively correlated with mindfulness (r = -.70, p = .0002; r = -.52, p = .01).  Relative to viewing strangers, caregivers shown pictures of their loved ones (picture factor) exhibited increased activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus.  Improvement in grief but not mindfulness or depression was predicted by increased relative brain activation in the precuneus and anterior cingulate (different subregions from baseline).  Viewing grief-related vs. neutral words elicited activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus.  

Conclusions: Caregiver grief, depression and mindfulness are interrelated but have at least partially nonoverlapping neural mechanisms.  Picture and word stimuli related to grief evoked brain activity in regions previously identified with bereavement grief.  These activation foci might be useful as biomarkers of treatment response.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00149">Analysis of Brain Lesion Impact on Balance and Gait Following Stroke</a></h4>

Falls are a leading cause of serious injury and restricted participation among persons with stroke (PwS). Reactive balance control is essential for fall prevention, however, only a few studies have explored the effects of lesion characteristics (location and extent) on balance control in PwS. We aimed to assess the impact of lesion characteristics on reactive and anticipatory balance capacity, gait, and hemiparetic lower limb function, in PwS. Forty-six subacute PwS were exposed to forward, backward, right and left unannounced horizontal surface translations in 6 increasing intensities, while standing. Fall threshold (i.e., perturbation intensity that results in a fall into the harness system) was measured. In addition, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) and Lower Extremity Fugl-Meyer (LEFM) were measured. Lesion effects were analyzed separately for left- and right-hemisphere damaged (LHD, RHD) patients, using voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM). Our results show that voxel clusters where damage exerted a significant impact on balance, gait and lower-limb function were found in the corticospinal tract, in its passage in the corona radiata and in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Additional significant impact was found to lesions affecting the putamen and the external capsule. Balance, gait, and hemiparetic lower limb function showed much overlap of the corresponding ‘significant’ voxel clusters. Test scores of RHD and LHD patients were affected largely by damage to homologous regions, with the LHD group showing a wider distribution of ‘significant’ voxels. The study corroborates and extends previous findings by demonstrating that balance control, gait, and lower limb function are all affected mainly by damage to essentially the same brain structures, namely - the corticospinal tract and adjacent structures in the capsular-putaminal region.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00146">Frequency-Dependent Spatial Distribution of Functional Hubs in the Human Brain and Alterations in Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

Alterations in large-scale brain intrinsic functional connectivity (FC), i.e., coherence between fluctuations of ongoing activity, have been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD). Yet, little is known about the frequency-dependent alterations of FC in MDD. We calculated frequency specific degree centrality (DC)—a measure of overall FC of a brain region—within 10 distinct frequency bands accessible from the full range of resting-state fMRI BOLD fluctuations (i.e., 0.01–0.25 Hz) in 24 healthy controls and 24 MDD patients. 

In healthy controls, results reveal a frequency-specific spatial distribution of highly connected brain regions—i.e., hubs—which play a fundamental role in information integration in the brain. MDD patients exhibited significant deviations from the healthy DC patterns, with decreased overall connectedness of widespread regions, in a frequency-specific manner. Decreased DC in MDD patients was observed predominantly in the occipital cortex at low frequencies (0.01–0.1 Hz), in the middle cingulate cortex, sensorimotor cortex, lateral parietal cortex, and the precuneus at middle frequencies (0.1–0.175 Hz), and in the anterior cingulate cortex at high frequencies (0.175–0.25 Hz). Additionally, decreased DC of distinct parts of the insula was observed across low, middle, and high frequency bands. Frequency-specific alterations in the DC of the temporal, insular, and lateral parietal cortices correlated with symptom severity.

Importantly, our results indicate that frequency-resolved analysis within the full range of frequencies accessible from the BOLD signal—also including higher frequencies (&gt; 0.1 Hz)—reveals unique information about brain organization and its changes, which can otherwise be overlooked.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00145">Mental Fatigue and Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) – Based Assessment of Cognitive Performance After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

Pathological mental fatigue after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI-MF) is characterized by pronounced mental fatigue after cognitive activity. The neurological origin is unknown, and we aimed in the present study to investigate how prolonged mental activity affects cognitive performance and its neural correlates in individuals with TBI-MF.
We recruited individuals with TBI-MF (n=20) at least 5 months after injury, and age-matched healthy controls (n=20). We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to assess hemodynamic changes in the frontal cortex. The self-assessed mental energy level was measured with a visual analog scale before and after the experimental procedure. A battery of six neuropsychological tests including Stroop-Simon, Symbol Search, Digit Span, Parallel Serial Mental Operation, Sustained Attention and Working Memory test, and Digit Symbol Coding were used. The sequence was repeated once after an eight-minute sustained-attention test. The test procedure lasted 2 ½ hours.
The experimental procedure resulted in a decrease in mental energy in the TBI-MF group, compared to controls (interaction, p&lt;0.001, ηp2 = 0.331). The TBI-MF group performed at a similar level on both Digit Symbol Coding tests, whereas the controls improved their performance in the second session (interaction, p&lt;0.01, ηp2 = 0.268). During the Stroop-Simon test, the fNIRS event-related response showed no time effect. However, the TBI-MF group exhibited lower oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentrations in the frontal polar area, ventrolateral motor cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from the beginning of the test session. A Stroop and Group interaction was found in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex showing that the TBI-MF group did have the same oxy-Hb concentration for both congruent and incongruent trials, whereas the controls had more oxy-Hb in the incongruent trial compared to the congruent trial (interaction, p&lt;0.01, ηp2 = 0.227). In sum these results indicate that individuals with TBI-MF have a reduced ability to recruit the frontal cortex, which is correlated with self-reported mental fatigue. This may result both in deterioration of cognitive function and the experience of a mental fatigue after extended mental activity.

Introduction. The amygdala is a brain structure involved in emotional regulation. Studies have shown that larger amygdala volumes are associated with behavioral disorders. Prenatal maternal depression is associated with structural changes in the amygdala, which in turn, is predictive of an increase in behavioral problems. Girls may be particularly vulnerable. However, it is not known whether disaster-related prenatal maternal stress (PNMS), or which aspect of the maternal stress experience (i.e., objective hardship, subjective distress and cognitive appraisal), influences amygdala volumes. Nor is it known whether amygdala volumes mediate the effect of PNMS on behavioral problems in girls and boys. 
Aims. To assess whether aspects of PNMS are associated with amygdala volume, to determine whether timing of exposure moderates the effect, and to test whether amygdala volume mediates the association between PNMS and internalizing and externalizing problems in 11½ year old children exposed to varying levels of disaster-related PNMS. 
Methods. Bilateral amygdala volumes (AGV) and total brain volume (TBV) were acquired using magnetic resonance imaging, from 35 boys and 33 girls whose mothers were pregnant during the January 1998 Quebec Ice Storm. The mothers’ disaster-related stress was assessed in June 1998. Child internalizing and externalizing problems were assessed at 11½ years using the Child Behavior Checklist. Hierarchical regression analyses and mediation analyses were conducted on boys and girls separately, controlling for perinatal and postnatal factors.
Results. In boys, subjective distress was associated with larger right AGV/TBV when mothers where exposed during late pregnancy, which in turn explained higher levels of externalizing behavior. However when adjusting for postnatal factors, the effect was no longer significant. In girls, later gestational exposure to the ice storm was associated with larger AGV/TBV, but here, higher levels of objective PNMS were associated with more externalizing problems, which was, in part, mediated by larger AGV/TBV. No effects were detected on internalizing behaviors.
Conclusion. These results suggest that the effects of PNMS on amygdala development and externalizing symptoms, as assessed in boys and girls in early adolescence, can be influenced by the timing of the stress in pregnancy, and the particular aspect of the mother’s stress experience.

Understanding the mechanisms of vision in health and disease requires knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the eye and the neural pathways relevant to visual perception. As such, development of imaging techniques for the visual system is crucial for unveiling the neural basis of visual function or impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers non-invasive probing of the structure and function of the neural circuits without depth limitation, and can help identify abnormalities in brain tissues in vivo. Among the advanced MRI techniques, manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) involves the use of active manganese contrast agents that positively enhance brain tissue signals in T1-weighted imaging with respect to the levels of connectivity and activity. Depending on the routes of administration, accumulation of manganese ions in the eye and the visual pathways can be attributed to systemic distribution or their local transport across axons in an anterograde fashion, entering the neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels. The use of the paramagnetic manganese contrast in MRI has a wide range of applications in the visual system from imaging normal neurodevelopment to assessing and monitoring neurodegeneration, neuroplasticity, neuroprotection, and neuroregeneration. In this review, we present four major domains of scientific inquiry where MEMRI can be put to imperative use — deciphering neuroarchitecture, tracing neuronal tracts, detecting neuronal activity, and identifying or differentiating glial activity. We deliberate upon each category studies that have successfully employed MEMRI to examine the visual system, including the delivery protocols, spatiotemporal characteristics, and biophysical interpretation. Based on this literature, we have identified some critical challenges in the field in terms of toxicity, and sensitivity and specificity of manganese enhancement. We also discuss the pitfalls and alternatives of MEMRI which will provide new avenues to explore in the future.

Essential to development, primary cilia are microtubule-based cellular organelles that protrude from the surface of cells. Acting as cellular antenna, primary cilia play central roles in transducing or regulating several signaling pathways, including Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt signaling. Defects in primary cilia contribute to a group of syndromic disorders known as ‘ciliopathies’ and can adversely affect development of the brain and other essential organs, including the kidneys, eyes, and liver. The molecular mechanisms of how defective primary cilia contribute to neurological defects, however, remain poorly understood. In this mini review, we summarize recent advances in understanding of the interactions between primary cilia and signaling pathways essential to cellular homeostasis and brain development.

Contextual fear conditioning is a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm capable of rapidly creating fear memories to contexts, such as rooms or chambers. Contextual fear conditioning protocols have long been utilised to evaluate how fear memories are consolidated, maintained, expressed, recalled and extinguished within the brain. These studies have identified the lateral portion of the amygdala and the dorsal portion of the hippocampus as essential for contextual fear memory consolidation. The current study was designed to evaluate how two different contextual fear memories alter amygdala and hippocampus microglia, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated cyclic-AMP response element binding (pCREB). We find rats provided with standard contextual fear conditioning to have more microglia and more cells expressing BDNF in the dentate gyrus as compared to a context only control group. Additionally, standard contextual fear conditioning altered microglia morphology to become amoeboid in shape – a common response to central nervous system insult, such as traumatic brain injury, infection, ischemia and more. The unpaired fear conditioning procedure (whereby non-reinforced and non-overlapping auditory tones were provided at random intervals during conditioning), despite producing equivalent levels of fear as the standard procedure, did not alter microglia, BDNF or pCREB number in any dorsal hippocampus or lateral amygdala brain regions. Despite this, the unpaired fear conditioning protocol produced some alterations in microglia morphology, but less compared to rats provided with standard contextual fear conditioning. Results from this study demonstrate that contextual fear conditioning is capable of producing large alterations to dentate gyrus plasticity and microglia, whereas unpaired fear conditioning only produces minor changes to microglia morphology. These data show, for the first time, that Pavlovian fear conditioning protocols can induce similar responses as trauma, infection or other insults within the central nervous system.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability characterized by social deficits and repetitive stereotyped behaviors. There are currently no drugs available for the treatment of the core symptoms of ASD, suggesting an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies. The neurobiology of autism is complex, but emerging research indicates that defects in hippocampal neurogenesis are associated with ASD in both humans and mouse models of ASD, leading to the suggestion that restoring neurogenesis may be a novel therapeutic approach for ASD. Here, we found that postnatal treatment with TO901317 (TO), a potent liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, typically activated LXRβ and its target genes in the hippocampus, and alleviated the social deficits and stereotypical behaviors in BTBR T+ tf/J (BTBR) and valproic acid (VPA)-induced mouse models. In addition, we further confirmed that TO postnatal treatment also rescued the inhibition of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in these two models. In summary, our study suggests that LXR agonist targeting hippocampal neurogenesis may represent a novel potential therapy for ASD.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00210">Modeling Analysis of Axonal After Potential at Hippocampal Mossy Fibers</a></h4>

Action potentials reliably propagate along the axons, and after potential often follows the axonal action potentials. After potential lasts for several tens of millisecond and plays a crucial role in regulating excitability during repetitive firings of the axon. Several mechanisms underlying the generation of after potential have been suggested, including activation of ionotropic autoreceptors, accumulation of K+ ions in the surrounding extracellular space, the opening of slow voltage-dependent currents, and capacitive discharge of upstream action potentials passively propagated through axon cable. Among them, capacitive discharge is difficult to examine experimentally, since the quantitative evaluation of a capacitive component requires simultaneous recordings from at least two different sites on the connecting axon. In this study, a series of numerical simulation of the axonal action potential was performed using a proposed model of the hippocampal mossy fiber where morphological as well as electrophysiological data are accumulated. To evaluate the relative contribution of the capacitive discharge in axonal after potential, voltage-dependent Na+ current as well as voltage-dependent K+ current was omitted from a distal part of mossy fiber axons. Slow depolarization with a similar time course with the recorded after potential in the previous study was left after blockade of Na+ and K+ currents, suggesting that a capacitive component contributes substantially in axonal after potential following propagating action potentials. On the other hand, it has been shown that experimentally recorded after potential often showed clear voltage-dependency upon changes in the initial membrane potential, obviously deviating from voltage-independent nature of the capacitive component. The simulation revealed that activation of voltage-dependent K+ current also contributes to shape a characteristic waveform of axonal after potential and reconstitute similar voltage-dependency with that reported for the after potential recorded from mossy fiber terminals. These findings suggest that the capacitive component reflecting passive propagation of upstream action potential substantially contributes to the slow time course of axonal after potential, although voltage-dependent K+ current provided a characteristic voltage dependency of after potential waveform.

Background: The success of a cochlear implant (CI), which is the standard therapy for patients suffering from severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss, depends on the number and excitability of spiral ganglion neurons (SGN). Brain-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has a protective effect on SGN but should be applied chronically to guarantee their lifelong survival. Long-term administration of BDNF could be achieved using genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which should be protected e.g. by ultra-high viscous (UHV) -alginate (‘alginate-MSC’) – from the recipient immune system and from uncontrolled migration.
Methods: BDNF-producing MSCs were encapsulated in UHV-alginate. Four experimental groups were investigated using guinea pigs as animal model. Three of them were systemically deafened and received unilaterally one of the following: I) a CI; II) an alginate-MSC-coated CI; III) an injection of alginate-embedded MSCs into the scala tympani followed by CI insertion and alginate polymerization. Group IV was normal hearing, with CI insertion in both ears and a unilateral injection of alginate-MSCs. Using acoustically evoked auditory brainstem response measurements, hearing thresholds were determined before implantation and before sacrificing the animals. Electrode impedance was measured weekly. Four weeks after implantation, the animals were sacrificed and the SGN density and degree of fibrosis were evaluated. 
Results: The MSCs survived being implanted for four weeks in vivo. Neither the alginate-MSC injection nor the coating affected electrode impedance or fibrosis. CI insertion with and without previous alginate injection in normal-hearing animals resulted in increased hearing thresholds within the high-frequency range. Low-frequency hearing loss was additionally observed in the alginate-injected and implanted cochleae.. In deafened animals, the alginate-MSC coating of the CI significantly prevented SGN from degeneration, but the injection of alginate-MSCs did not.
Conclusion: BDNF-producing MSCs encapsulated in UHV-alginate prevent SGN from degeneration in the form of coating on the CI surface, but not in the form of an injection. No increase in fibrosis or impedance was detected. Further research and development aimed at verifying long-term mechanical and biological properties of coated electrodes in vitro and in vivo, in combination with chronic electrical stimulation, is needed before the current concept can be tested in clinical trials.

Abstract
Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating sub-type of stroke with no proven treatment. Given the emerging role of Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 in neuroimmune responses, the objective of the current manuscript is to elucidate hemorrhagic-injury induced modulation and cellular expression of Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 in the brain in a pre-clinical model of ICH.  To address this, ICH was induced in male CD1 mice by collagenase injection method. Western blotting as well as Immunofluorescence staining was performed to characterize the temporal expression pattern as well as cellular localization of Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 after ICH.  Further, genetic studies were conducted to assess the functional role of Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 in inflammatory response employing a murine macrophage cell line, RAW. 264.7 cells. Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 exhibited very profound and increased expression from day 3 to day 7-post-injury, in the perihematomal brain region after ICH in comparison to Sham. Further, Galectin-1 expression was mostly observed in GFAP-positive astrocytes whereas Galectin-3 expression was observed mostly in Iba1-positive microglia/macrophages as well as CD16/32 (M1 microglial/macrophage marker)-positive cells.  Moreover, genetic studies revealed a negative regulatory role of both Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 in the release of a proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6 from RAW. 264.7 cells. Altogether, The present manuscript demonstrates for the first time, increased expression as well as cellular localization of Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 in the perihematomal brain regions after ICH. In addition, the manuscript raises the potential of Galectin-1 and Galectin-3 in modulating glial responses and thereby brain injury after ICH, warranting further investigation.

Down syndrome (DS), a genetic disorder caused by partial or complete triplication of chromosome 21, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. DS mouse models and cell lines display defects in cellular adaptive stress responses including autophagy, unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial bioenergetics. We tested the ability of hydroxyurea (HU), an FDA-approved pharmacological agent that activates adaptive cellular stress response pathways, to improve the cognitive function of Ts65Dn mice. The chronic HU treatment started at a stage when early mild cognitive deficits are present in this model (~3 months of age) and continued until a stage of advanced cognitive deficits in untreated mice (~ 5-6 months of age). The HU effects on cognitive performance were analyzed using a battery of water maze tasks designed to detect changes in different types of memory with sensitivity wide enough to detect deficits as well as improvements in spatial memory. The most common characteristic of cognitive deficits observed in trisomic mice at 5-6 months of age was their inability to rapidly acquire new information for long-term storage, a feature akin to episodic-like memory. On the background of severe cognitive impairments in untreated trisomic mice, HU-treatment produced mild but significant benefits in Ts65Dn by improving memory acquisition and short-term retention of spatial information. In control mice, HU treatment facilitated memory retention in constant (reference memory) as well as time-variant conditions (episodic-like memory) implicating a robust nootropic effect. This was the first proof-of-concept study of HU treatment in a DS model, and indicates that further studies are warranted to assess a window to optimize timing and dosage of the treatment in this pre-clinical phase. Findings of this study indicate that HU has potential for improving memory retention and cognitive flexibility that can be harnessed for the amelioration of cognitive deficits in normal aging and in cognitive decline (dementia) related to DS and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Activation of microglia, the primary mediators of inflammation in the brain, is a major component of gliosis and neuronal loss in a number of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer disease.  The role of activated microglia in white matter, and its relationship to cognitive decline during aging, are unknown. The current study evaluated microglia densities in white matter of postmortem specimens from cognitively normal young adults, cognitively normal older adults, and cognitive “SuperAgers”, a unique group of individuals over age 80 whose memory test scores are at a level equal to or better than scores of 50-to-65-year-olds. 

Specimens from cognitively-normal old, young, and “SuperAgers” were cut into whole hemisphere sections and immunohistochemical procedures were used to visualize activated microglia with HLA-DR antibody. Densities of HLA-DR-positive activated microglia underlying five cortical regions were evaluated.  

Statistical findings showed a significant main effect of group on differences in microglia density where cognitively-normal old showed highest densities; no difference between SuperAgers and young specimens were detected.  In two autopsied SuperAgers with MRI FLAIR available, prominent hyperintensities in periventricular regions were observed, and interestingly, examination of corresponding postmortem sections showed only sparse microglia densities. 

In conclusion, activated microglia appear to respond to age-related pathologic changes in cortical white matter, and this phenomenon is largely spared in SuperAgers. Findings offer insights into the relationship between white matter neuroinflammatory changes and cognitive integrity during aging.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Across cultures and throughout history, human beings have reported a variety of spiritual experiences and the concomitant perceived sense of union that transcends one’s ordinary sense of self. Nevertheless, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms of spiritual experiences, particularly when examined across different traditions and practices. By adapting an individualized guided-imagery task, we investigated neural correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences as compared with stressful and neutral-relaxing experiences. We observed in the spiritual condition, as compared with the neutral-relaxing condition, reduced activity in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), a result that suggests the IPL may contribute importantly to perceptual processing and self-other representations during spiritual experiences. Compared with stress cues, responses to spiritual cues showed reduced activity in the medial thalamus and caudate, regions associated with sensory and emotional processing. Overall, the study introduces a novel method for investigating brain correlates of personally meaningful spiritual experiences and suggests neural mechanisms associated with broadly defined and personally experienced spirituality.</span>

Cameron et al. report that spatial and temporal representations in IL-NAc neurons during drug seeking are degraded after a drug-free period. The disengagement of this “anti-relapse” projection may contribute to heightened drug seeking that results from a drug-free period.

Genetic interactions, a phenomenon whereby combinations of mutations lead to unexpected effects, reflect how cellular processes are wired and play an important role in complex genetic diseases. Understanding the molecular basis of genetic interactions is crucial for deciphering pathway organization as well as understanding the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Several hypothetical molecular mechanisms have been linked to different genetic interaction types. However, differences in genetic interaction patterns and their underlying mechanisms have not yet been compared systematically between different functional gene classes. Here, differences in the occurrence and types of genetic interactions are compared for two classes, gene-specific transcription factors (GSTFs) and signaling genes (kinases and phosphatases). Genome-wide gene expression data for 63 single and double deletion mutants in baker’s yeast reveals that the two most common genetic interaction patterns are buffering and inversion. Buffering is typically associated with redundancy and is well understood. In inversion, genes show opposite behavior in the double mutant compared to the corresponding single mutants. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Although both classes show buffering and inversion patterns, the prevalence of inversion is much stronger in GSTFs. To decipher potential mechanisms, a Petri Net modeling approach was employed, where genes are represented as nodes and relationships between genes as edges. This allowed over 9 million possible three and four node models to be exhaustively enumerated. The models show that a quantitative difference in interaction strength is a strict requirement for obtaining inversion. In addition, this difference is frequently accompanied with a second gene that shows buffering. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for inversion. Furthermore, the ability of transcription factors to differentially regulate expression of their targets provides a likely explanation why inversion is more prevalent for GSTFs compared to kinases and phosphatases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B5Yl8rn33yo" width="1" />

<p>by Vikash Pandey, Noushin Hadadi, Vassily Hatzimanikatis</p>

The ever-increasing availability of transcriptomic and metabolomic data can be used to deeply analyze and make ever-expanding predictions about biological processes, as changes in the reaction fluxes through genome-wide pathways can now be tracked. Currently, constraint-based metabolic modeling approaches, such as flux balance analysis (FBA), can quantify metabolic fluxes and make steady-state flux predictions on a genome-wide scale using optimization principles. However, relating the differential gene expression or differential metabolite abundances in different physiological states to the differential flux profiles remains a challenge. Here we present a novel method, named REMI (Relative Expression and Metabolomic Integrations), that employs genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to translate differential gene expression and metabolite abundance data obtained through genetic or environmental perturbations into differential fluxes to analyze the altered physiology for any given pair of conditions. REMI allows for gene-expression, metabolite abundance, and thermodynamic data to be integrated into a single framework, then uses optimization principles to maximize the consistency between the differential gene-expression levels and metabolite abundance data and the estimated differential fluxes and thermodynamic constraints. We applied REMI to integrate into the <i>Escherichia coli</i> GEM publicly available sets of expression and metabolomic data obtained from two independent studies and under wide-ranging conditions. The differential flux distributions obtained from REMI corresponding to the various perturbations better agreed with the measured fluxomic data, and thus better reflected the different physiological states, than a traditional model. Compared to the similar alternative method that provides one solution from the solution space, REMI was able to enumerate several alternative flux profiles using a mixed-integer linear programming approach. Using this important advantage, we performed a high-frequency analysis of common genes and their associated reactions in the obtained alternative solutions and identified the most commonly regulated genes across any two given conditions. We illustrate that this new implementation provides more robust and biologically relevant results for a better understanding of the system physiology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Nm8EXmtK-lQ" width="1" />

<p>by Victor Kulikov, Syuan-Ming Guo, Matthew Stone, Allen Goodman, Anne Carpenter, Mark Bathe, Victor Lempitsky</p>

Neuronal synapses transmit electrochemical signals between cells through the coordinated action of presynaptic vesicles, ion channels, scaffolding and adapter proteins, and membrane receptors. In situ structural characterization of numerous synaptic proteins simultaneously through multiplexed imaging facilitates a bottom-up approach to synapse classification and phenotypic description. Objective automation of efficient and reliable synapse detection within these datasets is essential for the high-throughput investigation of synaptic features. Convolutional neural networks can solve this generalized problem of synapse detection, however, these architectures require large numbers of training examples to optimize their thousands of parameters. We propose DoGNet, a neural network architecture that closes the gap between classical computer vision blob detectors, such as Difference of Gaussians (DoG) filters, and modern convolutional networks. DoGNet is optimized to analyze highly multiplexed microscopy data. Its small number of training parameters allows DoGNet to be trained with few examples, which facilitates its application to new datasets without overfitting. We evaluate the method on multiplexed fluorescence imaging data from both primary mouse neuronal cultures and mouse cortex tissue slices. We show that DoGNet outperforms convolutional networks with a low-to-moderate number of training examples, and DoGNet is efficiently transferred between datasets collected from separate research groups. DoGNet synapse localizations can then be used to guide the segmentation of individual synaptic protein locations and spatial extents, revealing their spatial organization and relative abundances within individual synapses.

Abstract
<p>Thoracic paravertebral sympathetic postganglionic neurons (tSPNs) comprise the final integrative output of the distributed sympathetic nervous system controlling vascular and thermoregulatory systems. Considered a non-integrating relay, what little is known of tSPN intrinsic excitability has been determined by sharp microelectrodes with presumed impalement injury. We thus undertook the first electrophysiological characterization of tSPN cellular properties using whole-cell recordings and coupled results with a conductance-based model to explore the principles governing their excitability in adult mice of both sexes. Recorded membrane resistance and time constant values were an order of magnitude greater than values previously obtained, leading to a demonstrable capacity for synaptic integration in driving recruitment. Variation in membrane resistivity was the primary determinant controlling cell excitability with vastly lower currents required for tSPN recruitment. Unlike previous microelectrode recordings in mouse which observed inability to sustain firing, all tSPNs were capable of repetitive firing. Computational modeling demonstrated that observed differences are explained by introduction of a microelectrode impalement injury conductance. Overall, tSPNs largely linearly encoded injected current magnitudes over a broad frequency range with distinct subpopulations differentiable based on repetitive firing signatures. Thus, whole-cell recordings reveal tSPNs have more dramatically amplified excitability than previously thought, with greater intrinsic capacity for synaptic integration and with the ability for maintained firing to support sustained actions on vasomotor tone and thermoregulatory function. Rather than acting as a relay, these studies support a more responsive role and possible intrinsic capacity for tSPNs to drive sympathetic autonomic function.</p>

Abstract
<p>It is not known why there is increased risk to have seizures with increased anxiety and stress after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Stressors cause the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) both from the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and from CNS neurons located in the central amygdala and GABAergic interneurons. We have previously shown that CRF signaling is plastic, becoming excitatory instead of inhibitory after the kindling model of epilepsy. Here, using Sprague Dawley rats we have found that CRF signaling increased excitability after TBI. Following TBI, CRF type 1 receptor (CRFR<sub>1</sub>)-mediated activity caused abnormally large electrical responses in the amygdala, including fast ripples, which are considered to be epileptogenic. After TBI, we also found the ripple (120–250 Hz) and fast ripple activity (&gt;250 Hz) was cross-frequency coupled with  (3–8 Hz) oscillations. CRFR<sub>1</sub> antagonists reduced the incidence of phase coupling between ripples and fast ripples. Our observations indicate that pathophysiological signaling of the CRFR<sub>1</sub> increases the incidence of epileptiform activity after TBI. The use for CRFR<sub>1</sub> antagonist may be useful to reduce the severity and frequency of TBI associated epileptic seizures.</p>

<p>Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is an important cognitive capacity that
varies across the healthy adult population and is affected in several
neurodevelopmental disorders. It has been suggested that neuroanatomy places
limits on this capacity through a map architecture that creates competition for
cortical space. This suggestion has been supported by the finding that primary
visual (V1) gray matter volume (GMV) is positively associated with VSTM
capacity. However, evidence from neurodevelopmental disorders suggests that the
dorsal visual stream more broadly is vulnerable and atypical volumes of other
map-containing regions may therefore play a role. For example, Turner syndrome
is associated with concomitantly reduced volume of the right intraparietal
sulcus (IPS) and deficits in VSTM. As posterior IPS regions (IPS0-2) contains
topographic maps, together this suggests that posterior IPS volumes may also
associate with VSTM. In this study, we assessed VSTM using two tasks, as well
as a composite score, and used voxel-based morphometry of T1-weighted magnetic
resonance images to assess GMV in V1 and right IPS0-2 in 32 healthy young
adults (16 female). For comparison with previous work, we also assessed
associations between VSTM and voxel-wise GMV on a whole-brain basis. We found
that total brain volume (TBV) significantly correlated with VSTM, and that
correlations between VSTM and regional GMV were substantially reduced in
strength when controlling for TBV. In our whole-brain analysis, we found that
VSTM was associated with GMV of clusters centered around the right putamen and
left Rolandic operculum, though only when TBV was not controlled for. Our
results suggest that VSTM ability is unlikely to be accounted for by the volume
of an individual cortical region and may instead rely on distributed structural
properties.

<p>Diffusion tractography is routinely used to study white matter architecture
and brain connectivity in vivo. A key step for successful tractography of
neuronal tracts is the correct identification of tract directions in each
voxel. Here we propose a fingerprinting-based methodology to identify these
fiber directions in Orientation Distribution Functions, dubbed
ODF-Fingerprinting (ODF-FP). In ODF-FP, fiber configurations are selected based
on the similarity between measured ODFs and elements in a pre-computed library.
In noisy ODFs, the library matching algorithm penalizes the more complex fiber
configurations. ODF simulations and analysis of bootstrapped partial and
whole-brain in vivo datasets show that the ODF-FP approach improves the
detection of fiber pairs with small crossing angles while maintaining fiber
direction precision, which leads to better tractography results. Rather than
focusing on the ODF maxima, the ODF-FP approach uses the whole ODF shape to
infer fiber directions to improve the detection of fiber bundles with small
crossing angle. The resulting fiber directions aid tractography algorithms in
accurately displaying neuronal tracts and calculating brain connectivity.

<p>The tight coupling between neuronal activity and the local increase of blood
flow termed neurovascular coupling is essential for normal brain function. This
mechanism of regulation is compromised in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In order to
determine whether a purely vascular dysfunction or a neuronal alteration of
blood vessels diameter control could be responsible for the impaired
neurovascular coupling observed in AD, blood vessels reactivity in response to
different pharmacological stimulations was examined in double transgenic
APPxPS1 mice model of AD. Blood vessels movements were monitored using infrared
videomicroscopy ex vivo, in cortical slices of 8 month-old APPxPS1 and wild
type (WT) mice. We quantified vasomotor responses induced either by direct
blood vessel stimulation with a thromboxane A 2 analogue, the U46619
(9,11-dideoxy-11a,9a-epoxymethanoprostaglandin F2) or via the stimulation of
interneurons with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) agonist DMPP
(1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide). Using both types of stimulation, no
significant differences were detected for the amplitude of blood vessel
diameter changes between the transgenic APPxPS1 mice model of AD and WT mice,
although the kinetics of recovery were slower in APPxPS1 mice. We find that
activation of neocortical interneurons with DMPP induced both vasodilation via
Nitric Oxide (NO) release and constriction via Neuropeptide Y (NPY) release.
However, we observed a smaller proportion of reactive blood vessels following a
neuronal activation in transgenic mice compared with WT mice. Altogether, these
results suggest that in this mouse model of AD, deficiency in the cortical
neurovascular coupling essentially results from a neuronal rather than a
vascular dysfunction.

and distinguish the direct causality from the indirect ones which makes it
almost inoperable in practice. In this work, we try to use a low order and
pairwise TE framework with binary data suitably filtered from the recorded
signals to avoid the high dimensional problem. Under this setting, we find and
explain that the TE values from the connected and unconnected pairs have a
significant difference of magnitude, which can be easily classified by cluster
methods. This phenomenon widely and robustly holds over a wide range of systems
and dynamical regimes. In addition, we find the TE value is quadratically
related to the coupling strength and thus we can establish a quantitative
mapping between the causal and structural connectivity.

<p>by Jung Eun Shim, Ji Hyun Kim, Junha Shin, Ji Eun Lee, Insuk Lee</p>

Protein domains are basic functional units of proteins. Many protein domains are pervasive among diverse biological processes, yet some are associated with specific pathways. Human complex diseases are generally viewed as pathway-level disorders. Therefore, we hypothesized that pathway-specific domains could be highly informative for human diseases. To test the hypothesis, we developed a network-based scoring scheme to quantify specificity of domain-pathway associations. We first generated domain profiles for human proteins, then constructed a co-pathway protein network based on the associations between domain profiles. Based on the score, we classified human protein domains into pathway-specific domains (PSDs) and non-specific domains (NSDs). We found that PSDs contained more pathogenic variants than NSDs. PSDs were also enriched for disease-associated mutations that disrupt protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and tend to have a moderate number of domain interactions. These results suggest that mutations in PSDs are likely to disrupt within-pathway PPIs, resulting in functional failure of pathways. Finally, we demonstrated the prediction capacity of PSDs for disease-associated genes with experimental validations in zebrafish. Taken together, the network-based quantitative method of modeling domain-pathway associations presented herein suggested underlying mechanisms of how protein domains associated with specific pathways influence mutational impacts on diseases via perturbations in within-pathway PPIs, and provided a novel genomic feature for interpreting genetic variants to facilitate the discovery of human disease genes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/W3UffL4_6BI" width="1" />

<p>by Adrien Doerig, Alban Bornet, Ruth Rosenholtz, Gregory Francis, Aaron M. Clarke, Michael H. Herzog</p>

In crowding, perception of an object deteriorates in the presence of nearby elements. Although crowding is a ubiquitous phenomenon, since elements are rarely seen in isolation, to date there exists no consensus on how to model it. Previous experiments showed that the global configuration of the entire stimulus must be taken into account. These findings rule out simple pooling or substitution models and favor models sensitive to global spatial aspects. In order to investigate how to incorporate global aspects into models, we tested a large number of models with a database of forty stimuli tailored for the global aspects of crowding. Our results show that incorporating grouping like components strongly improves model performance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WoMUtJ14I_w" width="1" />

The essential roles of microglia in maintaining homeostasis in the healthy brain and contributing to neuropathology are well documented. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic modulation regulates microglial behavior in both physiological and pathological conditions. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding epigenetic regulators that repress target gene expression mostly via binding to 3’-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of mRNA in a Dicer-dependent manner. Dysregulation of certain miRNAs can contribute to microglial hyper-activation, persistent neuroinflammation, and abnormal macrophage polarization in the brain. These abnormal conditions can support the pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as glioma, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, ischemia, and spinal cord injury. However, the roles of miRNAs in microglia in health and neurological disease have not been systematically summarized. This review will firstly report the role of Dicer, a key endoribonulease that is responsible for most miRNA biogenesis in microglia. Secondly, we will focus on recent research about the function of miRNAs in activation, inflammation and polarization of microglia, respectively. In addition, potential crosstalk between microglia and glioma cells via miRNAs will be discussed in this part. Finally, the role of two essential miRNAs, miR-124, and miR-155, in microglia will be highlighted.

Despite decades of research, current therapeutic interventions for Parkinson`s disease (PD) are insufficient as they fail to modify disease progression by ameliorating the underlying pathology. Cellular proteostasis (protein homeostasis) is an essential factor in maintaining a persistent environment for neuronal activity. Proteostasis is ensured by mechanisms including regulation of protein translation, chaperone-assisted protein folding and protein degradation pathways. It is generally accepted that deficits in proteostasis are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases including PD. While the proteasome fails to degrade large protein aggregates, particularly alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) in PD, drug-induced activation of autophagy can efficiently remove aggregates and prevent degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Therefore, maintenance of these mechanisms is essential to preserve all cellular functions relying on a correctly folded proteome. The correlations between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) that aims to restore proteostasis within the secretory pathway are well established. However, while mild insults increase the activity of chaperones, prolonged cell stress or insufficient adaptive response causes cell death. Modulating the activity of molecular chaperones, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) which assists refolding and contributes to the removal of unfolded proteins, and their associated pathways may offer a new approach for disease-modifying treatment. Here, we summarize some of the key concepts and emerging ideas on the relation of protein aggregation and imbalanced proteostasis with an emphasis on PD as our area of main expertise. Furthermore, we discuss recent insights into the strategies for reducing the toxic effects of protein unfolding in PD by targeting the ER UPR pathway.

Objective The notion that cerebellar pathology may contribute to cognitive impairment in ALS, especially in patients with C9orf72 repeated expansion, has been inconsistently reported. This study aimed exploring the relationship between cerebellar involvement, cognitive impairment and C9orf72repeated expansion of patients with ALS.
Methods Quantitative in-vivo assessment of cerebellar lobules has been investigated in 66 non-demented patients with ALS and 28 healthy controls. Pathologic C9orf72 repeated expansion was found in 13 patients. Mild cognitive and/or behavioral impairment was diagnosed in 22 C9orf72 negative ALS patients. Measures of cortical volume (CV) and cortical thickness (CT) of cerebellar lobules of all participants were used for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify clusters of lobular measures highly correlated with each other. PCA outcomes were used for between group comparisons and correlation analyses with neuropsychological and clinical features. 
Results Disease severity measured with ALS functional rating scale and index of disease progression rate significantly correlated with CV reduction of the second PCA cluster loading CV measures of anterior lobules. In all patients, cognitive impairment, measured with verbal fluency, was related to CV reduction of the third cluster comprising posterior lobules. No specific cortical thinning or volume reduction of cerebellar clustering patterns could be detected in ALS subgroups. 
Conclusion Our data show that specific patterns of subregional cerebellar involvement are associated with physical disability or cognitive impairment in ALS, in line with the topographic organization of the cerebellum. However, there was no specific correlation between cerebellar degeneration and cognitive syndromes or C9orf72 mutations.

In the current study, we used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to compare prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity in adults as they performed two conditions of the Tower of Hanoi (ToH) disk-transfer task that have equivalent executive function but different motor requirements. This study explored cognitive workload, here defined as the cognitive effort utilized while problem-solving by performance output. The first condition included a two-dimensional (2D) computerized ToH where participants completed trials using a computer mouse. In contrast, our second condition used a traditional, three-dimensional (3D) ToH that must be manually manipulated.  Our aim was to better understand the role of the prefrontal cortex in these two conditions to detect if prefrontal cortex activity increases as a function of motor planning. Twenty right-handed, neurotypical adults (10M/10F, x̅ = 24.6, SD ± 2.8 y.o.) participated in two blocks (one per condition) of three one-minute trials where they were asked to solve as many puzzles as possible.  These data were analyzed using a mixed effects ANOVA with participants nested within blocks for 2D vs 3D conditions, presentation order (leading block), individual participants, and regions and additional follow-up statistics. Results showed that changes in oxygenated hemoglobin, ΔHbO, were significantly higher for 3D compared to 2D condition (p=0.0211). Presentation order and condition interacted significantly (p=0.0015). Notably, a strong correlation between performance and ΔHbO existed between blocks 1 and 2 (r=-0.69, r2=0.473, p&lt;0.01) when the 3D condition was initially performed, in contrast to the 2D condition where no significant correlation was seen. Findings also showed a significant decrease in ∆HbO between the first and second block (p=0.0015) while performance increased significantly for both 3D and 2D conditions (p&lt;0.005). We plan to use this information in the future to narrow the potential points of impairment on the perception-cognition-action continuum in certain developmental disabilities.

Emotional labor is characterized by two main regulation strategies: surface acting and deep act-ing. However, which strategy consumes more energy? To explore this, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure changes in hemoglobin density while participants performed a task requiring them to make the opposite emotional facial expression of that pre-sented in a picture. We found that (1) neither surface nor deep acting led to a significant change in hemoglobin concentration in the prefrontal cortex; (2) making negative and positive facial ex-pressions activated the same left front and middle areas of the prefrontal cortex; and (3) making positive facial expressions activated the rear portion of the prefrontal cortex, but making negative facial expressions did not. Based on these findings and past work, we can infer that deep and surface acting may not significantly differ in terms of the activity in the prefrontal cortex energy consumed. Furthermore, engaging in positive and negative emotional labor appear to utilize some of the same neurological mechanisms, although they differ in others.

Peripheral mechanisms of primary headaches such as migraine remain unclear. Meningeal afferents surrounded by multiple mast cells have been suggested as a major source of migraine pain. Extracellular ATP, released during migraine attacks is a likely candidate for activating meningeal afferents via neuronal P2X receptors. Recently, we showed that ATP also increased degranulation of resident meningeal mast cells (Nurkhametova et al., 2019). However, the contribution of ATP-induced mast cell degranulation in aggravating the migraine pain remains unknown.
Here we explored the contribution of meningeal mast cells in the pro-nociceptive effects of extracellular ATP. The impact of mast cells on ATP mediated activation of peripheral branches of trigeminal nerves was measured electrophysiologically in the dura mater of adult wild type (WT) or mast cell deficient mice. We found that spontaneous spiking activity in meningeal afferents, at baseline level, was not different in two groups. However, in WT mice, meningeal application of ATP dramatically (24.6-fold) increased nociceptive firing peaking at frequencies around 10 Hz. In contrast, in mast cell deficient animals, ATP-induced excitation was significantly weaker (3.5-fold). Application of serotonin to meninges in WT induced strong spiking, analogous to ATP. Moreover, in WT mice, the 5-HT3 antagonist MDL-7222 inhibited the ATP induced nociceptive firing. 
Our data suggest that extracellular ATP activates nociceptive firing in meningeal trigeminal afferents via amplified degranulation of resident mast cells in addition to direct excitatory action on the nerve terminals. This highlights the importance of mast cell degranulation via extracellular ATP in aggravating the migraine pain.

A subpopulation of raphe 5-HT neurons expresses the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 with the co-release of glutamate and serotonin proposed to play a pivotal role in encoding reward- and anxiety-related behaviors. Serotonin axons are identifiable by immunolabelling of either serotonin (5-HT) or the plasma membrane 5-HT transporter (SERT), with SERT labeling demonstrated to be only partially overlapping with 5-HT staining. Studies investigating the colocalization or segregation of VGLUT3 within SERT or 5-HT immunolabeled boutons have led to inconsistent results. Therefore, we combined immunohistochemistry, high resolution confocal imaging and 3D-reconstruction techniques to map and quantify the distribution of VGLUT3 immunoreactive boutons within 5-HT vs SERT- positive axons in various regions of the mouse forebrain, including the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core and shell, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsal striatum, lateral septum, basolateral and central amygdala and hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that about 90% of 5-HT boutons are colocalized with SERT in almost all the brain regions studied, which therefore reveals that VGLUT3 and SERT do not segregate. However, in the posterior part of the NAC shell, we confirmed the presence of a subtype of 5-HT immunoreactive axons that lack the SERT. Interestingly, about 90% of the 5-HT/VGLUT3 boutons were labelled for the SERT in this region, suggesting that VGLUT3 is preferentially located in SERT immunoreactive 5-HT boutons. This work demonstrate that VGLUT3 and SERT cannot be used as specific markers to classify the different subtypes of 5-HT axons.

Neuronal damage and impaired vision in different retinal disorders are induced, among other factors, by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Since the mechanisms and the progression of ischemic injury are still not completely clarified, a timeline of this retinal degeneration is needed. In this study, we investigated protein and mRNA alterations at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours as well as 3 and 7 days after ischemia to determine the course of an ischemic insult through the whole retina. Moreover, functional analyses were performed at later stages. We detected a significant functional loss of cells in the inner nuclear layer and photoreceptors at 3 and 7 days. Additionally, the thickness of the whole retina was decreased at these points in time, indicating a severe degradation of all retinal layers. Immunohistological and qRT-PCR analyses of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), glial cells, AII amacrine, cone and rod bipolar as well as cone and rod photoreceptor cells confirmed this first assumption. Our results show that all investigated cell types were damaged by ischemia induction. Especially RGCs, cone bipolar cells, and photoreceptor cones are very sensitive to I/R, these cells were lost shortly after ischemia induction with a progressive course up to 7 days. In addition, Müller cell gliosis was observed over the entire period of time. These results provide evidence, that I/R induces damage of the whole retina already at early stages. This degeneration even increases over time. In conclusion, our study could demonstrate the intense impact of an ischemic injury. The ischemic defect spreads across the whole retina right up to the outer layers in the long-term and thus seems to impair the visual perception already during the stimulus processing. In addition, our findings indicate that the cone pathway seems to be particularly affected by this damage.

Amphetamine (AMPH) and methamphetamine (METH) are widely abused psychostimulants, which produce a variety of psychomotor, autonomic and neurotoxic effects. The behavioral and neurotoxic effects of both compounds (from now on defined as AMPHs) stem from a fair molecular and anatomical specificity for catecholamine-containing neurons, which are placed in the brainstem reticular formation. In fact, the structural cross-affinity joined with the presence of shared molecular targets between AMPHs and catecholamine provides the basis for a quite selective recruitment of brainstem catecholamine neurons following AMPHs administration. A great amount of investigations, commentary manuscripts and books reported a pivotal role of mesencephalic dopamine (DA)-containing neurons in producing behavioral and neurotoxic effects of AMPHs. Instead, the present review focuses on catecholamine reticular neurons of the low brainstem. In fact, these nuclei add on DA mesencephalic cells to mediate the effects of AMPHs. Among these, we also include two pontine cholinergic nuclei. Finally, we discuss the conundrum of a mixed neuronal population, which extends from the pons to the periaqueductal gray. In this way, a number of reticular nuclei beyond classic DA mesencephalic cells are considered to extend the scenario underlying the neurobiology of AMPHs abuse. The mechanistic approach followed here to describe the action of AMPHs within the reticular formation is rooted on the fine anatomy of this region of the brainstem. This is exemplified by a few medullary catecholamine neurons, which play a pivotal role compared with the bulk of peripheral sympathetic neurons in sustaining most of the cardiovascular effects induced by AMPHs.

Background.  Increasingly favorable mortality prognosis in multiple sclerosis (MS) raises questions regarding MS-specific cognitive aging and the presence of comorbidities such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
Objective.  To assess elderly with MS (EwMS) and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) using both MS- and AD-specific psychometrics.  
Methods.  EwMS (n=104) and 56 HCs were assessed on a broad spectrum of language, visual-spatial processing, memory, processing speed, and executive function tests.  Using logistic regression analysis, we examined cognitive performance differences between the EwMS and HC groups.  Cognitive impairment (CI) was defined using a -1.5 SD threshold relative to age and education years-matched HCs, in two cognitive domains. 
Results.  CI was observed in 47.1% of EwMS with differences most often seen on tests emphasizing cognitive processing speed as measured by Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) (d=0.9, p&lt;0.001) and verbal fluency (both category-based d=0.87, p&lt;0.001; letter-based d=0.67, p&lt;0.001).  After adjusting for age, sex and years of education, MS/HC diagnosis was the best predicted (R2=0.27) by differences in category-based verbal fluency (Wald=9.935, p=0.002) and SDMT (Wald=13.937, p&lt;0.001).  
Conclusion.  This study confirms the common hallmark of slowed cognitive processing speed in MS among elderly patients. Defective verbal fluency, less often observed in younger cohorts, may represent emerging cognitive pathology due to other etiologies.

<p>by Grégory Dumont, Boris Gutkin</p>

Macroscopic oscillations of different brain regions show multiple phase relationships that are persistent across time and have been implicated in routing information. While multiple cellular mechanisms influence the network oscillatory dynamics and structure the macroscopic firing motifs, one of the key questions is to identify the biophysical neuronal and synaptic properties that permit such motifs to arise. A second important issue is how the different neural activity coherence states determine the communication between the neural circuits. Here we analyse the emergence of phase-locking within bidirectionally delayed-coupled spiking circuits in which global gamma band oscillations arise from synaptic coupling among largely excitable neurons. We consider both the interneuronal (ING) and the pyramidal-interneuronal (PING) population gamma rhythms and the inter coupling targeting the pyramidal or the inhibitory neurons. Using a mean-field approach together with an exact reduction method, we reduce each spiking network to a low dimensional nonlinear system and derive the macroscopic phase resetting-curves (mPRCs) that determine how the phase of the global oscillation responds to incoming perturbations. This is made possible by the use of the quadratic integrate-and-fire model together with a Lorentzian distribution of the bias current. Depending on the type of gamma (PING vs. ING), we show that incoming excitatory inputs can either speed up the macroscopic oscillation (phase advance; type I PRC) or induce both a phase advance and a delay (type II PRC). From there we determine the structure of macroscopic coherence states (phase-locking) of two weakly synaptically-coupled networks. To do so we derive a phase equation for the coupled system which links the synaptic mechanisms to the coherence states of the system. We show that a synaptic transmission delay is a necessary condition for symmetry breaking, i.e. a non-symmetric phase lag between the macroscopic oscillations. This potentially provides an explanation to the experimentally observed variety of gamma phase-locking modes. Our analysis further shows that symmetry-broken coherence states can lead to a preferred direction of signal transfer between the oscillatory networks where this directionality also depends on the timing of the signal. Hence we suggest a causal theory for oscillatory modulation of functional connectivity between cortical circuits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IMMSb02YOS4" width="1" />

Anti-TNF agents have been in the first line of treatment of various inflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn’s Disease, with a number of different biologics being currently in use. A detailed analysis of their effect at transcriptome level has nevertheless been lacking. We herein present a concise analysis of an extended transcriptomics profiling of four different anti-TNF biologics upon treatment of the established hTNFTg (Tg197) mouse model of spontaneous inflammatory polyarthritis. We implement a series of computational analyses that include clustering of differentially expressed genes, functional analysis and random forest classification. Taking advantage of our detailed sample structure, we devise metrics of treatment efficiency that take into account changes in gene expression compared to both the healthy and the diseased state. Our results suggest considerable variability in the capacity of different biologics to modulate gene expression that can be attributed to treatment-specific functional pathways and differential preferences to restore over- or under-expressed genes. Early intervention appears to manage inflammation in a more efficient way but is accompanied by increased effects on a number of genes that are seemingly unrelated to the disease. Administration at an early stage is also lacking in capacity to restore healthy expression levels of under-expressed genes. We record quantifiable differences among anti-TNF biologics in their efficiency to modulate over-expressed genes related to immune and inflammatory pathways. More importantly, we find a subset of the tested substances to have quantitative advantages in addressing deregulation of under-expressed genes involved in pathways related to known RA comorbidities. Our study shows the potential of transcriptomic analyses to identify comprehensive and distinct treatment-specific gene signatures combining disease-related and unrelated genes and proposes a generalized framework for the assessment of drug efficacy, the search of biosimilars and the evaluation of the efficacy of TNF small molecule inhibitors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5Y_UHy_8nBA" width="1" />

Scientific data recording and reporting systems are of a great interest for endorsing reproducibility and transparency practices among the scientific community. Current research generates large datasets that can no longer be documented using paper lab notebooks (PLNs). In this regard, electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) could be a promising solution to replace PLNs and promote scientific reproducibility and transparency. We previously analyzed five ELNs and performed two survey-based studies to implement an ELN in a biomedical research institute. Among the ELNs tested, we found that Microsoft OneNote presents numerous features related to ELN best functionalities. In addition, both surveyed groups preferred OneNote over a scientifically designed ELN (PerkinElmer Elements). However, OneNote remains a general note-taking application and has not been designed for scientific purposes. We therefore provide a quick guide to adapt OneNote to an ELN workflow that can also be adjusted to other nonscientific ELNs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PzQPROKMCQU" width="1" />

<p>by Amitabha Bose, Áine Byrne, John Rinzel</p>

When listening to music, humans can easily identify and move to the beat. Numerous experimental studies have identified brain regions that may be involved with beat perception and representation. Several theoretical and algorithmic approaches have been proposed to account for this ability. Related to, but different from the issue of how we perceive a beat, is the question of how we learn to generate and hold a beat. In this paper, we introduce a neuronal framework for a beat generator that is capable of learning isochronous rhythms over a range of frequencies that are relevant to music and speech. Our approach combines ideas from error-correction and entrainment models to investigate the dynamics of how a biophysically-based neuronal network model synchronizes its period and phase to match that of an external stimulus. The model makes novel use of on-going faster gamma rhythms to form a set of discrete clocks that provide estimates, but not exact information, of how well the beat generator spike times match those of a stimulus sequence. The beat generator is endowed with plasticity allowing it to quickly learn and thereby adjust its spike times to achieve synchronization. Our model makes generalizable predictions about the existence of asymmetries in the synchronization process, as well as specific predictions about resynchronization times after changes in stimulus tempo or phase. Analysis of the model demonstrates that accurate rhythmic time keeping can be achieved over a range of frequencies relevant to music, in a manner that is robust to changes in parameters and to the presence of noise.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_hoJqGkSRLU" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Word familiarity and predictive context facilitate visual word processing, leading to faster recognition times and reduced neuronal responses. Previously, models with and without top-down connections, including lexical-semantic, pre-lexical (e.g., orthographic/phonological), and visual processing levels were successful in accounting for these facilitation effects. Here we systematically assessed context-based facilitation with a repetition priming task and explicitly dissociated pre-lexical and lexical processing levels using a pseudoword (PW) familiarization procedure. Experiment 1 investigated the temporal dynamics of neuronal facilitation effects with magnetoencephalography (MEG; <i>N</i> = 38 human participants), while experiment 2 assessed behavioral facilitation effects (<i>N</i> = 24 human participants). Across all stimulus conditions, MEG demonstrated context-based facilitation across multiple time windows starting at 100 ms, in occipital brain areas. This finding indicates context-based facilitation at an early visual processing level. In both experiments, we furthermore found an interaction of context and lexical familiarity, such that stimuli with associated meaning showed the strongest context-dependent facilitation in brain activation and behavior. Using MEG, this facilitation effect could be localized to the left anterior temporal lobe at around 400 ms, indicating within-level (i.e., exclusively lexical-semantic) facilitation but no top-down effects on earlier processing stages. Increased pre-lexical familiarity (in PWs familiarized utilizing training) did not enhance or reduce context effects significantly. We conclude that context-based facilitation is achieved within visual and lexical processing levels. Finally, by testing alternative hypotheses derived from mechanistic accounts of repetition suppression, we suggest that the facilitatory context effects found here are implemented using a predictive coding mechanism.</p>

SYNGAP1, a Synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein, regulates synapse maturation during a critical developmental window. Heterozygous mutation in SYNGAP1 (SYNGAP1+/-) has been shown to cause Intellectual Disability (ID) in children. Recent studies have provided evidence for altered neuronal protein synthesis in a mouse model of Syngap1+/-. However, the molecular mechanism behind the same is unclear. Here, we report the reduced expression of a known translation regulator, FMRP, during a specific developmental period in Syngap1+/- mice. Our results demonstrated that FMRP interacts with and regulates the translation of Syngap1 mRNA. We further show that, during development, reduced translation, and subsequent decrease in FMRP level leads to a compensatory increase of Syngap1 translation in Syngap1+/-. These developmental changes are reflected in the altered response of eEF2 phosphorylation downstream of NMDA Receptor (NMDAR)-mediated signalling. In this study, we propose a cross-talk between FMRP and SYNGAP1-mediated signalling which can also explain the compensatory effect of impaired signalling observed in Syngap1+/- mice.

Metabolic syndrome including obesity and type 2 diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. Similarly, there has been an increase in the cases of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) possibility due to increase in elderly population in the past few decades. Both, metabolic diseases and AD have one common feature that is insulin resistance.  Recent studies suggest a link between the regulatory functions of insulin in the brain and AD.  Hypoglycemia, a characteristic feature of AD may be a result of impaired insulin signaling in the affected regions of the brain. O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational protein modification, the levels of which are dependent on the availability of glucose inside the cells. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau is a major molecular feature, which leads to its aggregation and neurotoxicity in AD.  In addition, impaired processing of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to toxic amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation is also implicated in the pathogenesis of AD.  Both APP and Tau are also found to be O-GlcNAcylated. Reduced O-GlcNAcylation of APP and Tau due to hypoglycemia is found to be associated with their pathological features in AD brain. Recent studies have also identified perturbed O-GlcNAcylation/phosphorylation of several other proteins important for normal neuronal function, which may be contributing to the neuropathological development in AD. Herein, we discuss about the uptake and distribution of insulin inside the brain, brain insulin signaling and insulin resistance as well as its relation to neurodegenerative diseases with a special focus on protein O-GlcNAcylation and its potential role in the treatment of AD.

Background: The exact mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions are not fully known. The design of drugs that act on multiple targets represents a promising approach that should be explored for more effective clinical options for neurodegenerative disorders. B7C is s synthetic drug that has been studied for over 20 years and represents a promising multi-target drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD. 
Aims: The present systematic review, thus, aims at examining existing studies on the effect of B7C on different molecular targets and at discussing the relevance of B7C in neurological disorders.
Methods: A list of predefined search terms was used to retrieve relevant articles from the databases of Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The selection of articles was done by two independent authors, who were considering articles concerned primarily with the evaluation of the effect of B7C on neurological disorders. Only full-text articles written in English were included; whereas, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, book chapters, conference subtracts, and computational studies were excluded.   
Results: A total of 2266 articles were retrieved out of which 41 articles were included in the present systematic review. The effect of B7C on molecular targets, including AChE, BChE, BACE-1, NMDA receptor, GABA receptor, NOS, and Kv4.2 potassium channels was evaluated. Moreover, the studies that were included assessed the effect of B7C on biological processes, such as apoptosis, neuritogenesis, and amyloid beta aggregation. The animal studies examined in the review focused on the effect of B7C on cognition and memory. 
Conclusions: The beneficial effects observed on different molecular targets and biological processes relevant to neurological conditions confirm that B7C is a promising multi-target drug with the potential to treat neurological disorders.

Decision-making is assumed to be supported by model-free and model-based systems: the model-free system is based purely on experience, while the model-based system uses a cognitive map of the environment and is more accurate. The recently developed multistep decision-making task and its computational model can dissociate the contributions of the two systems and have been used widely. This study used this task and model to understand our value-based learning process and tested alternative algorithms for the model-free and model-based learning systems. The task used in this study had a deterministic transition structure, and the degree of use of this structure in learning is estimated as the relative contribution of the model-based system to choices. We obtained data from 29 participants and fitted them with various computational models that differ in the model-free and model-based assumptions. The results of model comparison and parameter estimation showed that the participants update the value of action sequences and not each action. Additionally, the model fit was improved substantially by assuming that the learning mechanism includes a forgetting process, where the values of unselected options change to a certain default value over time. We also examined the relationships between the estimated parameters and psychopathology and other traits measured by self-reported questionnaires, and the results suggested that the difference in model assumptions can change the conclusion. In particular, inclusion of the forgetting process in the computational models had a strong impact on estimation of the weighting parameter of the model-free and model-based systems.

It is believed that Mirror Visual Feedback (MVF) increases the interlimb transfer but the exact mechanism is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to compare between a bimanual task (BM) and a MVF task, within functionally rather than geometrically defined cortical domains. Measure Projection Analysis (MPA) approach was applied to compare the dynamic oscillatory activity (event-related synchronisation/desynchronisation ERS/ERD) between and within domains. EEG was recorded in 14 healthy participants performing a BM and an MVF task with the right hand. The MPA was applied on fitted equivalent current dipoles based on independent components to define domains containing functionally similar areas.  The measure of intradomain similarity was a “signed mutual information”, a parameter based on the coherence. Domain analysis was performed for joint tasks (BM and MVF) and for each task separately. MVF created 9 functional domains while MB task had only 4 functionally distinctive domains, two over the left hemispheres and two bilateraly. For all domains identified for BM task alone, similar domains could be identified in MVF and joint tasks analysis. In addition MVF had domains related to motor planning on the right hemisphere and to self-recognition of action. For joint tasks analysis, seven domains were identified, with similar functions for the left and the right hand with exception of a domain covering BA32 (self-recognition of action) of the left hand only.  In joint task domain analysis, the ERD/ERS showed a larger difference between domains than between tasks. All domains which involved the sensory cortex had a visible beta ERS at the onset of movement, and post movement beta ERS. The frequency of ERD varied between domains.  Largest difference between tasks existed in domains responsible for the awareness of action. In conclusion, functionally distinctive domains have different ERD/ERS patterns, similar for both tasks.  MVF activates contralateral hemisphere in similar manner to BM movements, while at the same time also activating the ipsilateral hemisphere. Significance: Following stroke cortical activation and interhemispheric inhibition from the contralesional side is reduced. MVF creates stronger ipsilateral activity than BM, which is highly relevant of neurorehabilitation of movements.

A unique nucleus, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus, has recently been recognized in the brain parenchyma. The outstanding feature of this nucleus is that the neural somas are located in the parenchyma, but their processes stretch into the CSF, implying that it may be a key structure bridging the nervous and body fluids-regulating systems and may play a pivotal role in modulating physiological activities. However, the true biological significance of this nucleus needs to be uncovered. The morphology of a nucleus is one of the most important parameters for neuroscience studies. For this reason, a common experimental animal, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, was chosen. The position, adjacent structures, neuronal distribution, size, three-dimensional reconstruction, and core coordinates of the CSF-contacting nucleus in SD rats of different weights (90-400 g) were illustrated for the first time. Furthermore, the formulas for calculating the core coordinates of the CSF-contacting nucleus in rats of different weights were revealed. Finally, the possible biological functions uncovered by past research are reviewed in this paper. This study provides an indispensable methodology and a significant reference for researchers interested in this unique nucleus.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is reportedly associated with the accumulation of calcium ions (Ca2+), and this accumulation is responsible for the phosphorylation of tau. Although several lines of evidence demonstrate the above phenomenon, the inherent mechanisms remain unknown. Using APP/PS1 Tg mice and neuroblastoma (N)2a cells as in vivo and in vitro experimental models, we observed that Ca2+ stimulated the phosphorylation of tau by activating microsomal PGE synthase 1 (mPGES1) in a prostaglandin (PG) E2-dependent EP receptor-activating manner. Specifically, the highly accumulated Ca2+ stimulated the expression of mPGES1 and the synthesis of PGE2. Treatment with the inhibitor of Ca2+ transporter, NMDAR, attenuated the expression of mPGES1 and the production of PGE2 were attenuated in S(+)-ketamine-treated APP/PS1 Tg mice. Elevated levels of PGE2 were responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of tau in an EP-1-, EP-2- and EP-3-dependent but not EP4-dependent cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 5-activating manner. Reciprocally, the knockdown of the expression of mPGES1 ameliorated the expected cognitive decline by inhibiting the phosphorylation of tau in APP/PS1 Tg mice. Moreover, CDK5 was found to be located downstream of EP1-3 to regulate the phosphorylation of tau though the cleavage of p35 to p25. Finally, the phosphorylation of tau by Ca2+ contributed to the cognitive decline of APP/PS1 Tg mice.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of multi-ingredient nutritional supplementation, with and without exercise training, on cognitive function in healthy older men. Forty-nine sedentary men (age: 73±6years [mean±SD]; body mass index: 28.5±3.6kg/m2) were randomized to consume a supplement (SUPP n=25; 1500mg n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, 30g whey protein, 2.5g creatine, 500IU vitamin D, and 400mg calcium) or control beverage (CON n=24; 22g maltodextrin) twice daily for 20wk consisting of Phase 1: SUPP/CON followed by Phase 2: 12-wk resistance exercise training plus high-intensity interval training, while continuing to consume the study beverages (SUPP/CON+EX). At baseline, 6wk, and 19wk we assessed cognitive function (Montréal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA]), memory (word recall during the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test [RAVLT]), and executive functions (working memory inhibition control), and nutrient bioavailability. We did not observe changes to any aspect of cognitive function after Phase 1; however, significant improvements in the following cognitive function outcomes were detected following Phase 2: MOCA scores increased (6wk: 23.5±3.3 vs. 19wk: 24.4±2.5, p=0.013); number of words recalled during the RAVLT (6wk: 6.6±3.6 vs. 19wk: 7.6±3.8, p=0.047); and reaction time improved (6wk: 567±49ms vs. 19wk: 551±51ms, p=0.002). Although between-group differences in these outcomes were not significant, we observed within-group improvements in composite cognitive function scores over the course of the entire study only in the SUPP group (Δ = 0.58±0.62, p=0.004) but not in the CON group (Δ = 0.31±0.61, p=0.06). We observed a progressive increase in n-3 index, and a concomitant decrease in the ratio of arachidonic acid (ARA) to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) within erythrocyte plasma membranes, in the SUPP group only. At week 19, n-3 index (r=0.49, p=0.02) and the ARA:EPA ratio (r=-0.44, p=0.03) were significantly correlated with composite cognitive function scores. Our results show that 12 weeks of RET + HIIT resulted in improved MOCA scores, word recall, and reaction time during an executive functions task; and suggest that a multi-ingredient supplement combined with this exercise training program may improve composite cognitive function scores in older men possibly via supplementation-mediated alterations to n-3 PUFA bioavailability. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02281331).

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The question whether the attentional control of working memory (WM) is shared across sensory modalities remains controversial. Here, we investigated whether attention shifts in visual and tactile WM are regulated independently. Participants memorized visual and tactile targets in a first memory sample set (S1) before encoding targets in a second sample set (S2). Importantly, visual or tactile S2 targets could appear on the same side as the corresponding S1 targets, or on opposite sides, thus, requiring shifts of spatial attention in visual or tactile WM. The activation of WM representations in modality-specific visual and somatosensory areas was tracked by recording visual and tactile contralateral delay activity (CDA/tCDA). CDA/tCDA components emerged contralateral to the side of visual or tactile S1 targets, and reversed polarity when S2 targets in the same modality appeared on the opposite side. Critically, the visual CDA was unaffected by the presence versus absence of concurrent attention shifts in tactile WM, and the tactile CDA remained insensitive to visual attention shifts. Visual and tactile WM performance was also not modulated by attention shifts in the other modality. These results show that the dynamic control of visual and tactile WM activation processes operates in an independent modality-specific fashion.</span>

<p>In male songbirds, the motivation to sing is largely regulated by testosterone (T) action in the medial preoptic area, whereas T acts on song control nuclei to modulate aspects of song quality. Stereotaxic implantation of T in the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) of castrated male canaries activates a high rate of singing activity, albeit with a longer latency than after systemic T treatment. Systemic T also increases the occurrence of male-like song in female canaries. We hypothesized that this effect is also mediated by T action in the POM. Females were stereotaxically implanted with either T or with 17β-estradiol (E2) targeted at the POM and their singing activity was recorded daily during 2 h for 28 d until brains were collected for histological analyses. Following identification of implant localizations, three groups of subjects were constituted that had either T or E2 implanted in the POM or had an implant that had missed the POM (Out). T and E2 in POM significantly increased the number of songs produced and the percentage of time spent singing as compared with the Out group. The songs produced were in general of a short duration and of poor quality. This effect was not associated with an increase in HVC volume as observed in males, but T in POM enhanced neurogenesis in HVC, as reflected by an increased density of doublecortin-immunoreactive (DCX-ir) multipolar neurons. These data indicate that, in female canaries, T acting in the POM plays a significant role in hormone-induced increases in the motivation to sing.</p>

Abstract
<p>Mutations and copy number variants of the CUB and Sushi multiple domains 2 (<i>CSMD2</i>) gene are associated with neuropsychiatric disease. <i>CSMD2</i> encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain comprising repeats of CUB and Sushi domains. High expression of <i>CSMD2</i> in the developing and mature brain suggests possible roles in neuron development or function, but the cellular functions of CSMD2 are not known. In this study, we show that mouse <i>Csmd2</i> is expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the forebrain. Csmd2 protein exhibits a somatodendritic localization in the neocortex and hippocampus, with smaller puncta localizing to the neuropil. Using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that Csmd2 localizes to dendritic spines and is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Accordingly, we show that the cytoplasmic tail domain of Csmd2 interacts with synaptic scaffolding proteins of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. The association between Csmd2 and MAGUK member PSD-95 is dependent on a PDZ-binding domain on the Csmd2 tail, which is also required for synaptic targeting of Csmd2. Finally, we show that knock-down of <i>Csmd2</i> expression in hippocampal neuron cultures results in reduced complexity of dendritic arbors and deficits in dendritic spine density. Knock-down of <i>Csmd2</i> in immature developing neurons results in reduced filopodia density, whereas <i>Csmd2</i> knock-down in mature neurons causes significant reductions in dendritic spine density and dendrite complexity. Together, these results point toward a function for Csmd2 in development and maintenance of dendrites and synapses, which may account for its association with certain psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>Neuropathy is the most common complication of prediabetes and diabetes and presents as distal-to-proximal loss of peripheral nerve function in the lower extremities. Neuropathy progression and disease severity in prediabetes and diabetes correlates with dyslipidemia in man and murine models of disease. Dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated levels of circulating saturated fatty acids (SFAs) that associate with the progression of neuropathy. Increased intake of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich diets confers metabolic health benefits; however, the impact of fatty acid saturation in neuropathy is unknown. This study examines the differential effect of SFAs and MUFAs on the development of neuropathy and the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of the complication. Male mice <i>Mus musculus</i> fed a high-fat diet rich in SFAs developed robust peripheral neuropathy. This neuropathy was completely reversed by switching the mice from the SFA-rich high-fat diet to a MUFA-rich high-fat diet; nerve conduction velocities and intraepidermal nerve fiber density were restored. A MUFA oleate also prevented the impairment of mitochondrial transport and protected mitochondrial membrane potential in cultured sensory neurons treated with mixtures of oleate and the SFA palmitate. Moreover, oleate also preserved intracellular ATP levels, prevented apoptosis induced by palmitate treatment, and promoted lipid droplet formation in sensory neurons, suggesting that lipid droplets protect sensory neurons from lipotoxicity. Together, these results suggest that MUFAs reverse the progression of neuropathy by protecting mitochondrial function and transport through the formation of intracellular lipid droplets in sensory neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> There is a global epidemic of prediabetes and diabetes, disorders that represent a continuum of metabolic disturbances in lipid and glucose metabolism. In the United States, 80 million individuals have prediabetes and 30 million have diabetes. Neuropathy is the most common complication of both disorders, carries a high morbidity, and, despite its prevalence, has no treatments. We report that dietary intervention with monounsaturated fatty acids reverses the progression of neuropathy and restores nerve function in high-fat diet-fed murine models of peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, the addition of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate to sensory neurons cultured under diabetic conditions shows that oleate prevents impairment of mitochondrial transport and mitochondrial dysfunction through a mechanism involving formation of axonal lipid droplets.</p>

<p>Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory suggests that the brain uses a
'neocortical' and a 'hippocampal' learning system to achieve complex behavior.
These two systems are complementary in that the 'neocortical' system relies on
slow learning of distributed representations while the 'hippocampal' system
relies on fast learning of pattern-separated representations. Both of these
systems project to the striatum, which is a key neural structure in the brain's
implementation of Reinforcement Learning (RL). Current deep RL approaches share
similarities with a 'neocortical' system because they slowly learn distributed
representations through backpropagation in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). An
ongoing criticism of such approaches is that they are data inefficient and lack
flexibility. CLS theory suggests that the addition of a 'hippocampal' system
could address these criticisms. In the present study we propose a novel
algorithm known as Complementary Temporal Difference Learning (CTDL), which
combines a DNN with a Self-Organising Map (SOM) to obtain the benefits of both
a 'neocortical' and a 'hippocampal' system. Key features of CTDL include the
use of Temporal Difference (TD) error to update a SOM and the combination of a
SOM and DNN to calculate action values. We evaluate CTDL on grid worlds and the
Cart-Pole environment, and show several benefits over the classic Deep
Q-Network (DQN) approach. These results demonstrate (1) the utility of
complementary learning systems for the evaluation of actions, (2) that the TD
error signal is a useful form of communication between the two systems and (3)
the biological plausibility of the proposed approach.

<p>Inter-personal touch is a powerful aspect of social interaction that we
expect to be particularly important for emotional communication. We studied the
capacity of closely acquainted humans to signal the meaning of several word
cues (e.g. gratitude, sadness) using touch sensation alone. Participants
communicated all cues with above chance performance. We show that emotionally
close people can accurately signal the meaning of different words through
touch, and that performance is affected by the amount of contextual information
available. Even with minimal context and feedback, both attention-getting and
love were communicated surprisingly well. Neither the type of close
relationship, nor self-reported comfort with touch significantly affected
performance.

the early brain folding process. Recent studies based on biomechanical modeling
have shown that mechanical forces play a crucial role in the formation of
cortical convolutions. However, the correlation between simulation results and
biological facts, and the effect of physical parameters in these models remain
unclear. In this paper, we propose a new brain longitudinal length growth model
to improve brain model growth. In addition, we investigate the effect of the
initial cortical thickness on folding patterns, quantifying the folds by the
surface-based three-dimensional gyrification index and a spectral analysis of
gyrification. The results tend to show that the use of such biomechanical
models could highlight the links between neurodevelopmental diseases and
physical parameters.

Previous research demonstrates that the underlying state of the brain influences how sensory stimuli are processed. Canonically, the state of the brain has been defined by quantifying the spectral characteristics of spontaneous fluctuations in local field potentials (LFP). Here, we utilized isoflurane and propofol anesthesia to parametrically alter the spectral state of the murine brain. With either drug, we produce slow wave delta dominant (1- 4Hz) activity, with low anesthetic doses, or burst suppression, with higher doses. We find that while spontaneous LFP oscillations were similar, the average visual-evoked potential (VEP) was always smaller in amplitude and shorter in duration under propofol than under comparable doses of isoflurane. This diminished average VEP results from increased trial-to-trial variability in VEPs under propofol.  One feature of single trial VEPs that was consistent in all animals was visual-evoked gamma band oscillation (20-60Hz). This gamma band oscillation was coherent between trials in the early phase (&lt;250 ms) of the visual evoked potential under isoflurane. Inter trial phase coherence (ITPC) of gamma oscillations was dramatically attenuated in the same propofol anesthetized mice despite similar spontaneous oscillations in the LFP. This suggests that while both anesthetics lead to loss of consciousness, elicit slow oscillations and burst suppression, only the isoflurane permits phase resetting of gamma oscillations by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate that accurate characterization of a brain state must include both spontaneous as well as stimulus-induced perturbations of brain activity.

The well documented precision of the cerebellar sagittal organization is commonly used to compose a comprehensive view on principles of cerebellar function. However, the physiological manifestation of this organization is either limited to information derived from single unit recordings or from imaging of a small group of closely located neurons. Here we used large scale imaging to monitor calcium concentration changes in the entire vermal area of folia V and VI in anesthetize mice. We found that the response to a strong auditory input or electrical shock to the tail area is composed of an early and a late component that differ in their spatiotemporal properties. The early component occurs throughout the scanned area whereas the late component reflects synchronous activation of Purkinje cells located along symmetric parasagittal bands that correspond well to sagittal band 2+ (Sugihara and Shinoda, 2004).  Similar organization was found in the rigorously disorganized cerebellum of Cxcr4 KO mice, suggesting that the sagittal organization is determined by the climbing fibers input to the cerebellar cortex. The responses for both stimuli are followed by prolonged recovery period but the rate of recovery from auditory stimulus is much longer reflecting different site of adapting process. We suggest that these sensory inputs, which are commonly used to evoke startle response, activate two sets of climbing fiber inputs that differ in their spatiotemporal properties and contribute to the motor organization and habituation of the startle response.

Major depressive disorder is a debilitating condition that affects approximately 15 % of the U.S. population.  Though the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie this disorder are not completely understood, both human and rodent studies suggest that excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is reduced with the depressive phenotype. In contrast, antidepressant efficacy in responsive individuals correlates with increased excitatory neurotransmission in select brain regions, suggesting that the restoration of E/I balance may improve mood.
Enhanced excitatory transmission can occur through mechanisms including increased dendritic arborization and synapse formation in pyramidal neurons. Reduced activity of inhibitory neurons may also contribute to antidepressant efficacy.  Consistent with this possibility, the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine may act by selective inhibition of glutamatergic input to GABA releasing parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons. Recent work has also shown that a negative allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor  subunit can improve depression-related behavior. PV-expressing interneurons are thought to represent critical pacemakers for synchronous network events. These neurons also represent the predominant GABAergic neuronal population that is enveloped by the perineuronal net (PNN), a lattice-like structure that is thought to stabilize glutamatergic input to this cell type. Disruption of the PNN reduces PV excitability and increases pyramidal cell excitability. 
Various antidepressant medications increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that can increase pyramidal cell dendritic arborization and spine formation. MMPs can also cleave PNN proteins to reduce PV neuron-mediated inhibition. The present review will focus on mechanisms that may underlie antidepressant efficacy, with a focus on monoamines as facilitators of increased matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression and activation. Discussion will include MMP-dependent effects on pyramidal cell structure and function, as well as MMP-dependent effects on PV expressing interneurons. We conclude with discussion of antidepressant use for those at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, and we also highlight areas for further study.

Stem cell therapy has emerged as a new promising therapeutic strategy for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the efficiency of stem cell therapy is partially limited by low retention and engraftment of the delivered cells. Therefore, it’s necessary to improve the migration ability of stem cells to the injured area in order to save the costs and duration of cell preparation. This study aimed to investigate whether overexpression of CX3CR1, the specific receptor of chemokine fractalkine (FKN), in adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can stimulate the cell migration to the injured area in the brain, improve functional recovery and protect against cell death following experimental ICH. ADSCs were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissues of rats. ICH was induced by means of an injection of collagenase type VII. ELISA showed that the expression levels of fractalkine/FKN were increased at early time points, with a peak at day 3 after ICH. And it was found that different passages of ADSCs could express the chemokine receptor CX3CR1. Besides, the chemotactic movements of ADSCs towards fractalkine have been verified by transwell migration assay. ADSCs overexpressing CX3CR1 were established through lentivirus transfection. We found that after overexpression of CX3CR1 receptor, the migration ability of ADSCs was increased both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, reduced cell death and improved sensory and motor functions were seen in the mice ICH model. Thus, ADSCs overexpression CX3CR1 might be taken as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ICH.

The recent recognition that Alzheimer disease-like pathology may be found in  chronic traumatic encephalopathy even after mild acute traumatic brain injury has increased the urgency of elucidating mechanisms, identifying biomarkers predictive of high risk of development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and establishing biomarker profiles indicative of impactful effects of treatments. Of the many proteins that are loaded into neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) from damaged neurons after acute traumatic brain injury, the levels of prion cellular protein, coagulation factor XIII, synaptogyrin-3, IL-6 and aquaporins remain elevated for months. Prolonged heightened expression of aquaporins and IL-6 may account for the persistent CNS edema and inflammation of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Prion cellular protein, coagulation factor XIII and synaptogyrin-3 bind and concentrate neurotoxic forms of oligomeric Aβ peptide or P-tau for delivery to neurons at or distant from the site of trauma. Our progression factor hypothesis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy asserts that physiological neuronal proteins, such as prion cellular protein, coagulation factor XIII, synaptogyrin-3, IL-6 and aquaporins, that increase in concentration in neurons and NDEs for months after acute traumatic brain injury, are etiological contributors to chronic traumatic encephalopathy by either direct actions or by mobilizing neurotoxic forms of Aβ peptides or P-tau. Such progression factors also may be useful new targets for development of drugs to prevent chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

Recent neuroimaging studies have indicated that abnormalities in brain structure and function may play an important role in the etiology of lifelong premature ejaculation (LPE). LPE patients have exhibited aberrant cortical structure, altered brain network function and abnormal brain activation in response to erotic pictures. However, it remains unclear whether resting-state whole brain functional connectivity (FC) is altered in LPE patients. Machine learning analysis has the advantage of screening the best classification features from high-throughput data (such as FC), which has the potential to identify the pathophysiological targets of disease by establishing classification indicators for patients and healthy controls (HCs). Therefore, the supported vector machine based classification model using FC as features was used in the present study to confirm the most specific FCs that distinguish LPE patients from healthy controls. After feature selection, the remained features were used to build the classification model, with an accuracy 0.85 ± 0.14, sensitivity of 0.92 ± 0.18, specificity of 0.72 ± 0.30, and recall index of 0.85 ± 0.17 across 1000 testing groups (100 times 10-folds cross validation). After that, two-sample t tests with family-wise error correction were used to compare these features that occurring more than 500 times during training steps between LPE patients and HCs. Four FCs, 1) between left medial part of orbital frontal cortex (mOFC) and right mOFC, 2) between the left rectus and right post-central gyrus, 3) between the right insula and left pallidum and 4) between the right middle part of temporal pole and right inferior part of temporal gyrus showed significant group difference. These results demonstrate that resting-state brain FC might be a discriminating feathers to distinguish LPE patients from HCs. These classification features, especially the FC between bilateral mOFC, provide underlying abnormal central functional targets in LPE etiology, which offers a novel alternative target for future intervention in LPE treatment.

EEG recordings are generally affected by interference from physiological and non physiological sources which may obscure underlying brain activity and hinder effective EEG analysis. In particular, cardiac interference can be caused by the electrical activity of the heart and/or cardiovascular activity related to blood flow. Successful EEG application in sports science settings requires a method for artifact removal that is automatic and flexible enough to be applied in a variety of acquisition conditions without requiring simultaneous ECG recordings that could restrict movement.

We developed an automatic method for classifying and removing both electrical cardiac and cardiovascular artifacts (ARCI) that does not require additional ECG recording. Our method employs independent component analysis (ICA) to isolate data independent components (ICs) and identifies the artifactual ICs by evaluating specific IC features in the time and frequency domains. We applied ARCI to EEG datasets with cued artifacts and acquired during an eyes-closed condition. Data were recorded using a standard EEG wet cap with either 128 or 64 electrodes and using a novel dry electrode cap with either 97 or 64 dry electrodes. All data were decomposed into different numbers of components to evaluate the effect of ICA decomposition level on effective cardiac artifact detection. ARCI performance was evaluated by comparing automatic ICs classifications with classifications performed by experienced investigators. Automatic and investigator classifications were highly consistent resulting in an overall accuracy greater than 99% in all datasets and decomposition levels, and an average sensitivity greater than 90%. Best results were attained when data were decomposed into a fewer number of components where the method achieved perfect sensitivity (100%). Performance was also evaluated by comparing automatic component classification with externally recorded ECG. Results showed that ICs automatically classified as artifactual were significantly correlated with ECG activity whereas the other ICs were not. We also assessed that the interference affecting EEG signals was reduced by more than 82% after automatic artifact removal.

Overall, ARCI represents a significant step in the detection and removal of cardiac-related EEG artifacts and can be applied in a variety of acquisition settings making it ideal for sports science applications.

Developing technologies for coupling neural activity and artificial neural components, is key for advancing neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics. We present a biohybrid experimental setting, where the activity of a biological neural network is coupled to a biomimetic hardware network. The implementation of the hardware network (denoted NeuroSoC) exhibits complex dynamics with a multiplicity of time-scales, emulating 2880 neurons and 12.7M synapses, designed on a VLSI chip. This network is coupled to a neural network in-vitro, where the activities of both the biological and the hardware networks can be recorded, processed and integrated bidirectionally in real-time. This experimental setup enables an adjustable and well-monitored coupling, while at the same time providing access to the key functional features of neural networks. We demonstrate the feasibility to functionally couple the two networks and of implementing control circuits to modify the biohybrid activity. Overall, we provide an experimental model for neuromorphic-neural interfaces, hopefully to advance the capability to interface with neural activity, and with its irregularities in pathology

Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve is an emerging treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) can produce unwanted side effects. Here, we investigated whether stimulating the vagus nerve closer to the end organ has fewer off-target effects, while reducing intestinal inflammation. An electrode array was developed to stimulate and record vagal neural responses in rats. Acute VNS off-target experiment: The cervical and abdominal vagus nerves of anaesthetised rats (n=5) were acutely implanted with an electrode array, stimulation delivered (10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase) and changes to heart rate, respiration and blood pressure assessed. Chronic VNS efficacy experiment: The abdominal vagus nerve was chronically implanted with an electrode array. After 2 weeks, the intestine was inflamed with TNBS (2.5% 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid), an established method for rodent models of IBD. Rats were randomly selected to receive therapeutic VNS (n=7; 10 Hz; symmetric biphasic current pulse; 320 nC per phase; 3 hours/day) or no stimulation (n=8) for 5 days. Stool quality, C-reactive protein in blood and histology of the inflamed intestine were assessed. VNS off-target experiment: Abdominal VNS had no effect (two-way RM-ANOVA: P&gt;0.05) on cardiac, respiratory and blood pressure parameters. However, during cervical VNS heart rate decreased by 31 ± 9 beats/minute (P&gt;0.05), respiration was inhibited and blood pressure decreased. VNS efficacy experiment: During the implantation period, electrically-evoked neural response thresholds remained stable (one-way RM ANOVA: P&gt;0.05), and were below stimulation levels. VNS rats, compared to unstimulated rats, had improved stool quality (two-way RM ANOVA: P&lt;0.0001), no blood in faeces (P&lt;0.0001), reduced plasma C-reactive protein (two-way RM ANOVA: P&lt;0.05) and a reduction in resident inflammatory cell populations within the intestine (Kruskal-Wallis: P&lt;0.05). Abdominal VNS did not evoke off-target effects, is an effective treatment of TNBS-induced inflammation, and may be an effective treatment of IBD in humans.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00371">Split-Hand Syndrome in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Differences in Dysfunction of the FDI and ADM Spinal Motoneurons</a></h4>

F-wave test allows the non-invasive assessment of spinal motoneuron excitability. We investigated the difference in spinal motoneuron dysfunction between the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digit minimi (ADM) muscles by investigating F-waves and to assess the contribution of spinal mechanisms to split-hand syndrome in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Sixty-five consecutive ALS patients and twenty age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Motor nerve conduction studies (NCSs) and F-waves were performed bilaterally on median and ulnar nerves in all subjects. HCs revealed prominently longer F-wave latencies, lower chronodispersion, mean F-wave amplitude, mean and maximal F/M amplitude ratio (P &lt; 0.001) in the FDI compared to the ADM. However, no significant differences in almost all F-wave parameters between the FDI and ADM were observed in ALS patients with affected hands except the minimal and mean F-wave latency. These data suggest that excitability is greatly changed in the spinal motoneurons innervating the FDI. Furthermore, the mean F-wave amplitude (r = 0.454, P = 0.002) of the FDI was significantly correlated with the FDI/ADM CMAP amplitude ratio in ALS patients with affected hands but not of the ADM. Our findings suggested that the dysfunction of spinal motoneurons between the FDI and ADM was different in ALS, and spinal motoneuron dysfunction was associated with development of the split-hand phenomenon.

Big Data promises to advance science through data-driven discovery. However, many standard lab protocols rely on manual examination, which is not feasible for large-scale datasets. Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of expert examination. We propose to 1) start with expertly labelled data, 2) amplify labels through web applications that engage citizen scientists, and 3) train machine learning on amplified labels, to emulate the experts. Demonstrating this, we developed a system to quality control brain magnetic resonance images. Expert-labeled data were amplified by citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality, based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC=0.99). Combining citizen science and deep learning can generalize and scale expert decision making; this is particularly important in disciplines where specialized, automated tools do not yet exist.

Children born preterm (PT) are at risk for white matter injuries based on complications of prematurity. They learn to read but on average perform below peers born full term (FT). Studies have yet to establish whether properties of white matter pathways at the onset of learning to read are associated with individual variation later in reading development in PT children. Here, we asked whether fractional anisotropy (FA) at age 6y is associated with reading outcome at age 8y in PT children in the same pathways as we previously demonstrated in a sample of FT children (Borchers et al., 2018).

PT (n = 34, mean gestational age = 29.5 weeks) and FT children (n = 37) completed diffusion MRI and standardized measures of non-verbal IQ, language, and phonological awareness at age 6y. Reading skills were assessed at age 8y. Mean tract-FA was extracted from pathways that predicted reading outcome in children born FT: left arcuate fasciculus (Arc), bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP). We explored associations in additional pathways in the PT children: bilateral inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and uncinate fasciculus (UF). Linear regression models examined whether the prediction of reading outcome at age 8y from mean tract-FA at age 6y was moderated by birth group.

Children born PT and FT did not differ significantly in tract-FA at age 6y or in reading at age 8y. Sex, socioeconomic status and non-verbal IQ at age 6y were associated with reading outcome and were included as covariates in all models. Birth group status significantly moderated associations between reading outcome and mean tract-FA only in the left Arc, right SLF, and left ICP, before and after consideration of pre-literacy skills.

Microstructural properties of these cerebral and cerebellar pathways predicted later reading outcome in FT but not in PT children. Children born PT may rely on alternative pathways to achieve fluent reading. These findings have implications for plasticity of neural organization after early white matter injury.

Synaptic plasticity serves as an essential mechanism underlying cognitive processes as learning and memory. For a better understanding detailed theoretical models combine experimental underpinnings of synaptic plasticity and match experimental results. However, these models are mathematically complex impeding the comprehensive investigation of their link to cognitive processes generally executed on the neuronal network level. Here, we derive a mathematical framework enabling the simplification of such detailed models of synaptic plasticity facilitating further mathematical analyses. By this framework we obtain a compact, firing-rate-dependent mathematical formulation, which includes the essential dynamics of the detailed model and, thus, of experimentally verified properties of synaptic plasticity. Amongst others, by testing our framework by abstracting the dynamics of two well-established calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity models, we derived that the synaptic changes depend on the square of the presynaptic firing rate, which is in contrast to previous assumptions. Thus, the here-presented framework enables the derivation of biologically plausible but simple mathematical models of synaptic plasticity allowing to analyze the underlying dependencies of synaptic dynamics from neuronal properties such as the firing rate and to investigate their implications in complex neuronal networks.

Histological studies of myelin-stained sectioned cadaver brain and in-vivo myelin-weighted magnetic resonance imaging show that the cerebral cortex is organized into cortical areas with generally well-defined boundaries, which have consistent internal patterns of myelination. The process of myelination is largely driven by neural experience, in which the axonal passage of action potentials stimulates neighbouring oligodendrocytes to perform their task. This bootstrapping process, such that the traffic of action potentials facilitates increased traffic, suggests the hypothesis that the specific pattern of myelination (myeloarchitecture) in each cortical area reveals the principal cortical microcircuits required for the function of that area. If this idea is correct, the observable sequential maturation of specific brain areas can provide evidence for models of the stages of cognitive development.

Parental migration has caused millions of children left behind, especially in China and India. Left behind children (LBC) have a high risk of mental disorders and may present negative life outcomes in the future. However, little is known whether there are cerebral structural alterations in LBC in relative to those with parents. This study is to explore the effect of parental migration on brain maturation by comparing gray matter volume (GMV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of LBC with well-matched non-LBC. Thirty-eight LBC (21 boys, age=9.60±1.8yrs) and 30 non-LBC (19 boys, age=10.00±1.95yrs) were recruited and underwent brain scans in 3.0 T MR. IQ and other factors including family income, guardians’ educational level and separation time et al., were also acquired. Gray matter volume (GMV) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured for each participant and compared between groups using 2-sample t-tests with atlas-based analysis. Compared to non-LBC, LBC exhibited greater GMV in emotional and cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, and altered FA in bilateral superior occipitofrontal fasciculi and right medial lemniscus (P&lt;0.05, Cohen's d&gt;0.89, corrected for false-discovery rate). The increased GMV in bilateral parahippocampi was negatively correlated with IQ. Other factors including family income, guardians’ educational level and separation time were not associated with these brain changes. Our study provides empirical evidence of altered brain structure in LBC compared to non-LBC, responsible for emotion regulation and processing, which may account for mental disorders and negative life outcome of LBC. Our study suggests that absence of direct biological parental care may impact children's brain development. Therefore, public health efforts may be needed to provide additional academic and social/emotional supports to LBC when their parents migrate to seeking better economic circumstances, which has become increasingly common in developing countries.

The communication of the neurons is maintained by synapses, which play a crucial role in the functioning of the nervous system. Therefore, synaptic failure may impair information processing in the brain, to the extent of the loss of consciousness, as well as may underlie many neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, a number of studies suggested that anesthetics regulate conscious state by affecting synaptic transmission primarily of network hubs and subsequently reducing the coherence in the network activity. Here, we studied network-wide spatio-temporal patterning in scale-free networks with two types of synaptic failure: activity-dependent and activity-independent. Further, we defined scale-free network structures based on the dominating direction of the connections at the hub neurons: incoming and outgoing. We found that the two structures have significantly different dynamical properties. Moreover, synaptic failure may not only lead to the loss of coherence but, under some conditions, also can facilitate its emergence unintuitively. We showed that this is because activity-dependent synaptic failure homogenizes the activity levels in the network creating a dynamical substrate for the observed coherence increase. Our results indicate that coherence breakdown due to the synaptic failure may not be enough to explain the loss of consciousness, but at the same time can lead to such pathologies as epilepsy.

Recent improvements in correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) technology have led to dramatic improvements in the ability to observe tissues and cells. Fluorescence labeling has been used to visualize the localization of molecules of interest through immunostaining or genetic modification strategies for the identification of the molecular signatures of biological specimens. Newer technologies such as tissue clearing have expanded the field of observation available for fluorescence labeling; however, the area of correlative observation available for electron microscopy remains restricted.
In this study, we developed a large-area CLEM imaging procedure to show specific molecular localization in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) sections of mouse and marmoset brain. Target molecules were labeled with antibodies and sequentially visualized in cryostat sections using fluorescence and gold particles. Fluorescence images were obtained by light microscopy immediately after antibody staining. Immunostained sections were postfixed for EM, and silver-enhanced sections were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in resin. Ultrathin sections for EM were prepared from fully polymerized resin blocks, collected on silicon wafers, and observed by multibeam scanning electron microscopy. Multibeam scanning electron microscopy has made rapid, large-area observation at high resolution possible, paving the way for the analysis of detailed structures using the CLEM approach. Here, we describe detailed methods for large-area CLEM in various tissues of both rodents and primates.

Long perceived as a primitive and poorly differentiated brain structure, the primate insular cortex recently emerged as a highly evolved, organized and richly connected cortical hub interfacing bodily states with sensorimotor, environmental and limbic activities. This insular interface likely substantiates emotional embodiment and has the potential to have a key role in the interoceptive shaping of cognitive processes, including perceptual awareness. In the present review, we present a novel working model of the insular cortex, based on an accumulation of neuroanatomical and functional evidence obtained essentially in the macaque monkey. This model proposes that interoceptive afferents that represent the ongoing physiological status of all the organs of the body are first being received in the granular dorsal fundus of the insula or “primary interoceptive cortex”, then processed through a series of dysgranular poly-modal “insular stripes”, and finally integrated in anterior agranular areas that serve as an additional sensory platform for visceral functions and as an output stage for efferent autonomic regulation. One of the agranular areas hosts the specialized von Economo and Fork neurons, which could provide a decisive evolutionary advantage for the role of the anterior insula in the autonomic and emotional binding inherent to subjective awareness.

Background Acupuncture has been reported to have significant effects in not only alleviating motor function, but also rescuing dopamine neuron deficit of Parkinson’s disease (PD) rodent model. However, systemic analysis of these beneficial effects has yet to be evaluated.
Objective To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of acupuncture in animal models of PD
Methods A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI, RISS, and JJSAM to collect studies that investigated effects of acupuncture on PD. Study quality of each included article was evaluated based on the 10-item checklist modified from CAMARADES. The software RevMan 5.3 was used for the meta-analysis.
Results 42 studies were included and the included studies scored between 2 and 7 points, with a mean of 4.6. Outcome measures include TH level and dopamine content. The result of meta-analysis showed significance of acupuncture for increasing both TH level (33.97, 95% CI: 33.15 ~ 34.79; p &lt; 0.00001) and dopamine content (4.23, 95% CI: 3.53 ~ 4.92; p &lt; 0.00001) compared with the PD control groups. In addition, motor dysfunctions showed in PD animal were also mitigated as a result of acupuncture treatment. 
Conclusions While there are limitations in number and quality of included studies, this study suggests that acupuncture shows the effect of dopamine neuron protection in PD rodent models.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Schizophrenia (SCZ) is recognized as a disorder of distributed brain dysconnectivity. While progress has been made delineating large-scale functional networks in SCZ, little is known about alterations in grey matter integrity of these networks. We used a multivariate approach to identify the structural covariance of the salience, default, motor, visual, fronto-parietal control, and dorsal attention networks: salience, default, motor, visual, fronto-parietal control, and dorsal attention networks. We derived individual scores reflecting covariance in each structural image for a given network. Seed-based multivariate analyses were conducted on structural images in a discovery (n = 90) and replication (n = 74) sample of SCZ patients and healthy controls. We first validated patterns across all networks, consistent with well-established functional connectivity reports. Next, across two SCZ samples, we found reliable and robust reductions in structural integrity of the fronto-parietal control and salience networks, but not default, dorsal attention, motor and sensory networks. Well-powered exploratory analyses failed to identify relationships with symptoms. These findings provide evidence of selective structural decline in associative networks in SCZ. Such decline may be linked with recently identified functional disturbances in associative networks, providing more sensitive multi-modal network-level probes in SCZ. Absence of symptom effects suggests that identified disturbances may underlie a trait-type marker in SCZ.</span>

We propose a mechanism for myelin plasticity that would complement synaptic plasticity by adjusting conduction velocity for optimal spike-time arrival. In the proposed treadmilling model, myelin sheath thickness is a dynamic balance between the rates of new myelin deposited adjacent to the axon and removal of the outermost layer.

<p>Hierarchical predictive coding is an influential model of cortical organization, in which sequential hierarchical levels are connected by backward connections carrying predictions, as well as forward connections carrying prediction errors. To date, however, predictive coding models have largely neglected to take into account that neural transmission itself takes time. For a time-varying stimulus, such as a moving object, this means that backward predictions become misaligned with new sensory input. We present an extended model implementing both forward and backward extrapolation mechanisms that realigns backward predictions to minimize prediction error. This realignment has the consequence that neural representations across all hierarchical levels become aligned in real time. Using visual motion as an example, we show that the model is neurally plausible, that it is consistent with evidence of extrapolation mechanisms throughout the visual hierarchy, that it predicts several known motion–position illusions in human observers, and that it provides a solution to the temporal binding problem.</p>

<p>Proliferation and migration during adult neurogenesis are regulated by a microenvironment of signaling molecules originating from local vasculature, from CSF produced by the choroid plexus, and from local supporting cells including astrocytes. Here, we focus on the function of OTX2 homeoprotein transcription factor in the mouse adult ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), which generates olfactory bulb neurons. We find that OTX2 secreted by choroid plexus is transferred to the supporting cells of the V-SVZ and rostral migratory stream. Deletion of <i>Otx2</i> in choroid plexus affects neuroblast migration and reduces the number of olfactory bulb newborn neurons. Adult neurogenesis was also decreased by expressing secreted single-chain antibodies to sequester OTX2 in the CSF, demonstrating the importance of non-cell-autonomous OTX2. We show that OTX2 activity modifies extracellular matrix components and signaling molecules produced by supporting astrocytes. Thus, we reveal a multilevel and non-cell-autonomous role of a homeoprotein and reinforce the choroid plexus and astrocytes as key niche compartments affecting adult neurogenesis.</p>

<p>Fear behavior depends on interactions between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the expression of fear involves synchronized activity in  and  oscillatory activities. In addition, freezing, the most classical measure of fear response in rodents, temporally coincides with the development of sustained 4-Hz oscillations in prefrontal-amygdala circuits. Interestingly, these oscillations were recently shown to depend on the animal’s respiratory rhythm, supporting the growing body of evidence pinpointing the influence of nasal breathing on brain rhythms. During fearful states, rats also emit 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) which drastically affect respiratory rhythm. However, the relationship between 22-kHz USV, respiration, and brain oscillatory activities is still unknown. Yet such information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how the different components of fear response collectively modulate rat’s brain neural dynamics. Here, we trained male rats in an odor fear conditioning task, while recording simultaneously local field potentials (LFPs) in BLA, mPFC, and olfactory piriform cortex (PIR), together with USV calls and respiration. We show that USV calls coincide with an increase in delta and gamma power and a decrease in theta power. In addition, during USV emission in contrast to silent freezing, there is no coupling between respiratory rate and delta frequency, and the modulation of fast oscillations amplitude relative to the phase of respiration is modified. We propose that sequences of USV calls could result in a differential gating of information within the network of structures sustaining fear behavior, thus potentially modulating fear expression/memory.</p>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Chen Ding, Marc Hammarlund</p><div><p>Injury-induced axon degeneration in model organisms and cell culture has emerged as an area of growing interest due to its experimental tractability and to the promise of identifying conserved mechanisms that mediate axon loss in human disease. Injury-induced axon degeneration is also observed within the well-studied process of Wallerian degeneration, a complex phenomenon triggered by axon injury to peripheral nerves in mammals. Recent studies have led to the identification of key molecular components of injury-induced axon degeneration. Axon survival factors, such as NMNAT2, act to protect injured axons from degeneration. By contrast, factors such as SARM1, MAPK, and PHR1 act to promote degeneration. The coordinated activity of these factors determines axon fate after injury. Since axon loss is an early feature of neurodegenerative diseases, it is possible that understanding the molecular mechanism of injury-induced degeneration will lead to new treatments for axon loss in neurodegenerative disease. Here, we discuss the critical pathways for injury-induced axon degeneration across species with an emphasis on their interactions in an integrated signaling network.</p></div>

Detailed behavioral analysis is key to understanding the brain-behavior relationship. Here, we present deep learning-based methods for analysis of behavior imaging data in mice and humans. Specifically, we use three different convolutional neural network architectures and five different behavior tasks in mice and humans and provide detailed instructions for rapid implementation of these methods for the neuroscience community. We provide examples of three dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis in the food pellet reaching task in mice, social behavior analysis in freely moving mice with simultaneous miniscope calcium imaging, and 3D kinematic analysis of reaching and fine hand movements in humans. We demonstrate that the transfer learning approach accelerates the training of the network when using images from these types of behavior video recordings. We also provide code for post-processing of the data after initial analysis with deep learning. Our methods expand the repertoire of available tools using deep learning for behavior analysis by providing detailed instruction on implementation, applications in several behavior tests, and post-processing methods and annotated code for detailed behavior analysis. Moreover, our methods in human motor behavior can be used in the clinic to assess motor function during recovery after an injury such as stroke.

Unraveling the alterations of the underlying circuits in neurobiological disorders is with no doubt one of the most interesting applications of studying brain oscillatory activity. Sleep and brain oscillatory activity in Down syndrome (DS) is a particularly explored field of study, with early findings in sleep alterations in DS patients. Nowadays it is well accepted the relationship of sleep with cognitive function, due to its implication in processes such as memory consolidation. As well, rhythmic activity of neural networks such as alpha or gamma waves has been related widely to cognition in the last decades. Both sleep and oscillatory activity are tightly related, as the major oscillatory feature of sleep -the slow oscillation (∼1Hz)- shows an exquisite interplay of different forms of rhythmic neuronal activity. Sleep and oscillatory activity in DS has been studied from the mid 20th century, but literature has appeared sporadically in the last decades. From the early descriptive studies, few works reported the differential features of sleep in DS individuals, showing a wide diversity of results. Some studies, addressed network oscillatory activity emerging from external brain circuits of DS individuals, with results related to different frequency bands of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. Even fewer studies have been published in models, but interestingly, some of them focused in the network mechanisms that may explain intellectual disability and cognitive deficits observed in DS. Here, a review is presented that aims to gather the work performed in the field and provide a wide and global view about the diversity of published studies. We aim to highlight the importance of studying network oscillatory activity in mouse models to infer alterations in the underlying circuits related to cognition, such as in intellectual disability. In this direction, we claim alpha and gamma rhythms generated by the cerebral cortex as a tool for evaluating an unbalance between excitation and inhibition in DS, which points out toward an over-inhibited network. Finally, we also aim to situate oscillatory activity as a key phenomenon that may be used as a biomarker for monitoring as well the effect of novel therapeutic strategies.

The view that different kinds of memory are mediated by dissociable neural systems has received extensive experimental support.  Dissociations between memory systems are usually observed during initial acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of memory, however increasing evidence also indicates a role for multiple memory systems in extinction behavior.  The present paper reviews a recent series of maze learning experiments that provide evidence for a multiple memory systems approach to extinction learning and memory. Evidence is described indicating that (1) the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) mediate different kinds of extinction learning, (2) the effectiveness of different extinction protocols depends on the kind of memory being extinguished, and (3) whether a neural system is involved in extinction is also determined by the extinction protocol and kind of memory undergoing extinction.  Based on these findings, a novel hypothetical model regarding the role of multiple memory systems in extinction is presented.  In addition, the relevance of this multiple memory systems approach to other learning paradigms involving extinction (i.e. extinction of conditioned fear) and for treating human psychopathologies characterized by maladaptive memories (e.g. drug addiction and relapse) is briefly considered.

GABAergic interneuron diversity is a key feature in the brain that helps to create different brain activity patterns and behavioral states. Cell type classification schemes—based on anatomical, physiological and molecular features—have provided us with a detailed understanding of the distinct types that constitute this diversity and their contribution to brain function. Over recent years, the utility of single-cell RNAseq has majorly complemented this existing framework, vastly expanding our knowledge base, particularly regarding molecular features. Single-cell gene-expression profiles of tens of thousands of GABAergic cells from many different types are now available. The analysis of these data has shed new lights onto previous classification principles and illuminates a path towards a deeper understanding of molecular hallmarks behind interneuron diversity. A large part of such molecular features are synapse-related. These include ion channels and receptors, as well as key synaptic organizers and trans-synaptic signaling molecules. Increasing evidence suggest that transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications further diversify these molecules and generate cell type-specific features. Thus, unraveling the cell type-specific nature of gene-isoform expression will be a key in cell type classification. This review discusses progress in the transcriptomic survey of interneurons and insights that have begun to manifest from isoform-level analyses.

Metabolic dysfunction is a hallmark of aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). But the crosstalk between metabolic alteration and disease progression in ALS is still largely unknown. Glycogen, a branched polymer of glucose residues, is identified as the energy reserve of central nervous system (CNS), where its aberrant accumulation leads to neurodegeneration. Glycogen was reported to be accumulated in both CNS and visceral organs of SOD1G93A mice, a well-known ALS model, and contributes to pathological process of ALS. However, the accumulative patterns and mechanisms are not well elucidated. Here, we provide extensive evidence to show that glycogen accumulated in the lumbar spinal cord of ALS mice along with the disease progression, but not in the motor cortex. This regional accumulation of glycogen was caused by deteriorated glycogenolysis, which was triggered by decreased PYGB (glycogen phosphorylase, brain form). Moreover, miR-338-3p, an elevated miRNA in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice, directly targeted PYGB and was responsible for the decreased glycogenolysis and subsequent glycogen accumulation. Our work is helpful for better understanding of metabolic dysfunctions in ALS and provides novel targets for the therapeutic intervention in the future.

Alzheimer disease (AD) represents an oncoming epidemic that without an effective treatment promises to exact extraordinary financial and emotional burdens. Studies of pathogenesis are essential for defining critical molecular and cellular events and for discovering therapies to prevent or mitigate their effects. Through studies of neuropathology, genetic and cellular and molecular biology recent decades have provided many important insights. Several hypotheses have been suggested. Documentation in the 1980s of selective loss of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, followed by clinical improvement in those treated with inhibitors of acetylycholinesterase, supported the “cholinergic hypothesis of age-related cognitive dysfunction”. A second hypothesis, prompted by the selective loss of cholinergic neurons and the discovery of central nervous system (CNS) neurotrophic factors, including NGF, prompted the “deficient neurotrophic hypothesis”. The most persuasive hypothesis, the amyloid cascade hypothesis first proposed more than 25 years ago, is supported by a wealth of observations. Genetic studies were exceptionally important, pointing to increased dose of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Down syndrome (DS) and a familial AD (FAD) due to duplication of APP and to mutations in APP and in the genes for Presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1, 2), which encode the γ-secretase enzyme that processes APP. The “tau hypothesis” noted the prominence of tau-related pathology and its correlation with dementia. Recent interest in induction of microglial activation in the AD brain, as well as other manifestations of inflammation, supports the ‘inflammatory hypothesis” . We place these findings in the context of the selective, but by no means unique, involvement of BFCNs and their trophic dependence on NGF signaling and speculate as to how pathogenesis in these neurons is initiated, amplified and ultimately results in their dysfunction and death. In so doing we attempt to show how the different hypotheses for AD may interact and reinforce one another. Finally, we address current attempts to prevent and/or treat AD in light of advances in understanding pathogenetic mechanisms and suggest that studies in the Down syndrome population may provide unique insights into AD pathogenesis and treatment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with main symptoms of chronic primary memory loss and cognitive impairment. The study aim is to investigate the correlation between hippocampal functional connectivity (FC) and MRI radiomic features in AD. A total of 67 AD patients and 44 normal controls (NC) were enrolled in this study. Using one method of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), the whole-brain FC with bilateral hippocampus as seed was performed, and the FC values were extracted from the bilateral hippocampus respectively. We observed that AD patients demonstrated disruptive FC in some brain regions in the left hippocampal functional network, including right gyrus rectus, right anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, bilateral precuneus, bilateral angular gyrus, and bilateral middle occipital gyrus. In addition, decreased FC was witnessed in some brain regions in the right hippocampal functional network, including bilateral anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, and right precentral gyrus. Bilateral hippocampal radiomics features were calculated and selected respectively using A.K software.  Pearson correlation analysis suggested that two gray level run-length matrix (RLM) radiomic features and one gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) radiomic features weakly associated with FC values in the left hippocampus. However, there were no significant correlations between radiomic features and FC values in the right hippocampus. Compared with the NC group, the AD group showed abnormalities of FC level in the bilateral hippocampal functional network. This is a prospective study revealed the correlation between the MRI radiomic features and the rs-fMRI in AD patients.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a widely used technique for mapping the brain’s functional architecture, so delineating the main sources of variance comprising the signal is crucial. Low frequency oscillations (LFO) that are not of neural origin, but which are driven by mechanisms related to cerebral autoregulation (CA), are present in the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal within the rs-fMRI frequency band. In this study we use a MR compatible device (Caretaker, Biopac) to obtain a non-invasive estimate of beat-to-beat mean arterial pressure (MAP) fluctuations concurrently with rs-fMRI at 3T. Healthy adult subjects (n=9; 5 male) completed two 20-minute rs-fMRI scans. MAP fluctuations were decomposed into different frequency scales using a discrete wavelet transform, and oscillations at approximately 0.1Hz show a high degree of spatially structured correlations with matched frequency fMRI fluctuations. On average across subjects, MAP fluctuations at this scale of the wavelet decomposition explain ~ 2.2% of matched frequency fMRI signal variance. Additionally, a simultaneous multi-slice multi-echo acquisition was used to collect 10-minute rs-fMRI at three echo times at 7T in a separate group of healthy adults (n=5; 5 male). Multiple echo times were used to estimate the R2* decay at every time point, and MAP was shown to strongly correlate with this signal, which suggests a purely BOLD (i.e. blood flow related) origin. This study demonstrates that there is a significant component of the BOLD signal that has a systemic physiological origin, and highlights the fact that not all localized BOLD signal changes necessarily reflect blood flow supporting local neural activity. Instead, these data show that a proportion of BOLD signal fluctuations in rs-fMRI are due to localized control of blood flow that is independent of local neural activity, most likely reflecting more general systemic autoregulatory processes. Thus, fMRI is a promising tool for studying flow changes associated with cerebral autoregulation with high spatial resolution.

Two-photon imaging of fluorescently labelled microglia in vivo provides a direct approach to measure motility of microglial processes as a readout of microglial function that is crucial in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to understand the neuroinflammatory response to implanted substrates and brain-computer interfaces. In this longitudinal study, we quantified surveilling and photodamage-directed microglial processes motility in both acute and chronic cranial window preparations and compared the motility under isoflurane and ketamine anesthesia to awake condition in the same animal. The isoflurane anesthesia increased the length of surveilling microglial processes in both acute and chronic preparations, while ketamine increased the number of microglial branches in acute preparation only. In chronic (but not acute) preparation, the extension of microglial processes towards the laser-ablated microglial cell was faster under isoflurane (but not ketamine) anesthesia than in awake mice, indicating distinct effects of anesthetics and of preparation type. These data reveal potentiating effects of isoflurane on microglial response to damage, and provide a framework for comparison and optimal selection of experimental conditions for quantitative analysis of microglial function using two-photon microscopy in vivo.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00032">A Brief History of Simulation Neuroscience</a></h4>

Our knowledge of the brain has evolved over millennia in philosophical, experimental and theoretical phases. We suggest that the next phase is simulation neuroscience. The main drivers of simulation neuroscience are big data generated at multiple levels of brain organization and the need to integrate these data to trace the causal chain of interactions within and across all these levels. Simulation neuroscience is currently the only methodology for systematically approaching the multiscale brain. In this review, we attempt to reconstruct the deep historical paths leading to simulation neuroscience, from the first observations of the nerve cell to modern efforts to digitally reconstruct and simulate the brain. Neuroscience began with the identification of the neuron as the fundamental unit of brain structure and function and has evolved towards understanding the role of each cell type in the brain, how brain cells are connected to each other, and how the seemingly infinite networks they form give rise to the vast diversity of brain functions. Neuronal mapping is evolving from subjective descriptions of cell types towards objective classes, subclasses and types. Connectivity mapping is evolving from loose topographic maps between brain regions towards dense anatomical and physiological maps of connections between individual genetically distinct neurons. Functional mapping is evolving from psychological and behavioral stereotypes towards a map of behaviors emerging from structural and functional connectomes. We show how industrialization of neuroscience and the resulting large disconnected datasets are generating demand for integrative neuroscience, how the scale of neuronal and connectivity maps is driving digital atlasing and digital reconstruction to piece together the multiple levels of brain organization, and how the complexity of the interactions between molecules, neurons, microcircuits and brain regions is driving brain simulation to understand the interactions in the multiscale brain.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00028">Longitudinal Changes in Diffusion Tensor Imaging Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury and Correlation With Outcome</a></h4>

The chronic consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may contribute to the increased risk for early cognitive decline and dementia, primarily due to the diffusion axonal injury. Previous studies in mild (mTBI) have been controversy in describing the white matter tracts integrity changes occurring at acute and sub-acute post-injury. In the prospective longitudinal study, we aim to investigate the longitudinal changes of white matter using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and their correlations with neuropsychological tests. Thirty-three patients with sub-acute mTBI, 31 matched healthy controls were studied with an extensive imaging and clinical battery. Neuroimaging was obtained within 7 days post-injury for acute scans and repeated at 1 month and 3 month post-injury. Using a region-of-interest-based approach, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics was used to conduct voxel-wise analysis on diffusion changes in mTBI and was compared to those of healthy matched controls, scanned during the same time period and rescanned with a similar interval as that of patients. We found decreased FA values in the left anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC) and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) during the 7 days post-injury, which showed longitudinal evidence of recovery following one-month post-injury. Increased FA values in these two tracts at 1 month post-injury was positively associated with better performance on cognitive information processing speed at initial assessment. By contrast, there were also some tracts (right anterior corona radiata, forceps major and body of corpus callosum) exhibiting the continuing loss of integrity sustaining even beyond 3 months, which can predict the persisting post-concussion syndromes. Continuing loss of structural integrity in some tracts may contribute to the persistent post-concussion syndromes in mTBI patients, suggesting certain tracts providing an objective biomarker for tracking the pathological recovery process following mTBI.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00109">Direct Measurements of Abdominal Visceral Fat and Cognitive Impairment in Late Life: Findings From an Autopsy Study</a></h4>

Background: The relationship between cognitive impairment and abdominal visceral is controversial. Moreover, all studies so far used imaging studies to evaluate visceral fat and this association has not been described yet using autopsy material, which allows the direct quantification of abdominal fat. We aimed to investigate the association between direct measurements of abdominal visceral fat and cognitive impairment in an autopsy study. 
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we collected information on sociodemographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cognitive status from subjects aged 50 or older at time of death in a general autopsy service in Brazil. Abdominal visceral fat was obtained in natura by the dissection of perirenal, mesenteric, omental, and mesocolon fat. The associations of total abdominal visceral fat with cognitive impairment [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score ≥0.5) and CDR-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) were evaluated using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models, respectively. All analyses were adjusted for height, age, sex, education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, smoking, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. In addition, we compared the discrimination of visceral fat, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) measurements in predicting cognitive impairment.
Results: We evaluated 234 participants (mean age=71.2±12.9 years old, 59% male). Abdominal visceral fat was inversely associated with cognitive impairment (OR=0.46, CI=0.30; 0.70, p&lt;0.0001) and with CDR-SB scores (β=-0.85, 95% CI=-1.28; -0.43, p&lt;0.0001). When we compared the area under the ROC curve (AUC), visceral fat (AUC=0.754), BMI (AUC=0.729), and WC (AUC=0.720) showed similar discrimination in predicting cognitive impairment (p=0.38).
Conclusion: In an autopsy study, larger amount of directly measured abdominal visceral fat was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in older adults.

Background: The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is associated with dysregulation at different levels from transcriptome to cellular functioning. Such complexity necessitates investigations of disease etiology to be carried out considering multiple aspects of the disease and the use of independent strategies. The established works more emphasized on the structural organization of gene regulatory network while neglecting the internal regulation changes.

Methods: Applying a strategy different from popularly used co-expression network analysis, this study investigated the transcriptional dysregulations during the transition from normal to disease states. 

Results: 97 genes were predicted as dysregulated genes, which were also associated with clinical outcomes of Alzheimer's disease. Both the co-expression and differential co-expression analysis suggested these genes to be interconnected as a core network and that their regulations were strengthened during the transition to disease states. Functional studies suggested the dysregulated genes to be associated with aging and synaptic function. Further, we checked the evolutionary conservation of the gene co-expression and found that human and mouse brain might have divergent transcriptional co-regulation even when they had conserved gene expression profiles.

Conclusion: Overall, our study reveals a core network of transcriptional dysregulation associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease by affecting the aging and synaptic functions related genes; the gene regulation  is not conserved in the human and mouse brains.

A growing body of evidence indicates that biomarkers of cardiovascular risk may be related to cerebral health. However, little is known about the role non-fasting lipoprotein play in assessing age-related declines in a cerebral biomarker sensitive to vascular compromise, white matter (WM) microstructure. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is atheroprotective and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major atherogenic lipoprotein. This study explored the relationships between non-fasting levels of cholesterol and WM microstructure in healthy older adults. A voxelwise and region of interest approach was used to determine the relationship between cholesterol and fractional anisotropy (FA). Participants were 87 older adults between the ages of 59 and 77 (mean age = 65.5 years, SD = 3.9). Results indicated that higher HDL-C was associated with higher FA in diffuse regions of the brain when controlling for age, sex, and body mass index. HDL-C was also positively associated with FA in the corpus callosum and fornix. No relationship was observed between LDL-C and FA. Findings suggest that a modifiable lifestyle variable associated with cardiovascular health may help to preserve cerebral WM.

Background
Cognitive training at a laboratory improves car driving skills of older car drivers. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether cognitive training of other types undertaken at home has beneficial effects on driving skills. Using our developed cognitive training games that work on a TV with a set-top box in a person’s home, we investigated effects of 6-week cognitive training on driving skills which assessed with on-road evaluation (primary outcome) and also check the benefit on cognitive functions and emotional states (secondary outcome) in older people.
Methods
For this double-blinded randomized control trial (RCT), 60 older licensed drivers were assigned randomly to two groups: a cognitive training game for car driving (CTCD) group and an active control cognitive training game (ACT) group. The CTCD, participants played CTCD (processing speed, dual attention, and speed prediction) for 20 min during 5 sessions per week for 6 weeks. The ACT group participants played ACT (select large number, select number from largest to smallest, rock–paper–scissors) for 20 min during 5 sessions per week for 6 weeks. We measured driving skills, several cognitive functions, and emotional states before and after the 6 week intervention period.
Results
Our main results demonstrated that, compared to ACT, CTCD improved driving skills (adjusted p = 0.034). Moreover, compared to ACT, CTCD improved inhibition (stroop, adjusted p = 0.042: reverse Stroop, adjusted p = 0.043) and processing speed performance (symbol search, adjusted p = 0.049; digit symbol coding, (adjusted p = 0.047). It increased vigor–activity mood scores (adjusted p = 0.041) as measured using the Profile of Mood State.
Discussion
This randomized controlled trial first provided scientific evidence related to benefits of 6-week CTCD on driving skills, cognitive functions such as processing speed, inhibition, and vigor–activity mood in healthy older people. Our results suggested cognitive training as a useful tool for improving driving skills of older adults.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Many studies have shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays an important role in top-down cognitive control over intentional and deliberate behavior. However, recent studies have reported that DLPFC-mediated top-down control interferes with implicit forms of learning. Here we used continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) combined with electroencephalography to investigate the causal role of DLPFC in implicit contextual memory-guided attention. We aimed to test whether transient disruption of the DLPFC would interfere with implicit learning performance and related electrical brain activity. We applied neuronavigation-guided cTBS to the DLPFC or to the vertex as a control region prior to the performance of an implicit contextual learning task. We found that cTBS applied over the DLPFC significantly improved performance during implicit contextual learning. We also noted that beta-band (13–19 Hz) oscillatory power was reduced at fronto-central channels about 140 to 370 ms after visual stimulus onset in cTBS DLPFC compared with cTBS vertex. Taken together, our results provide evidence that DLPFC-mediated top-down control interferes with contextual memory-guided attention and beta-band oscillatory activity.</span>

Abstract<p>Functional brain networks self-assemble during development, although the molecular basis of network assembly is poorly understood. <i>Protocadherin-19</i> (<i>pcdh19</i>) is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, and influences multiple cellular and developmental events in zebrafish. Although loss of <i>PCDH19</i> in humans and model organisms leads to functional deficits, the underlying network defects remain unknown. Here, we employ multiplane, resonant-scanning <i>in vivo</i> two-photon calcium imaging of developing zebrafish, and use graph theory to characterize the development of resting state functional networks in both wild type and <i>pcdh19</i> mutant larvae. We find that the brain networks of <i>pcdh19</i> mutants display enhanced clustering and an altered developmental trajectory of network assembly. Our results show that functional imaging and network analysis in zebrafish larvae is an effective approach for characterizing the developmental impact of lesions in genes of clinical interest.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Non-clustered protocadherins are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders that include microcephaly, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. In humans, mutations in <i>PCDH19</i> cause a female limited form of infantile epileptic encephalopathy and are associated with an increased incidence of schizophrenia and autism. In this study, we use large-scale calcium imaging to reveal that mutations in zebrafish <i>pcdh19</i> alter the development of brain network topology. This work is the first to use functional imaging to explore the effects of a clinically relevant mutation on brain-wide network assembly <i>in vivo</i>. We show that graph analysis of spontaneous network activity is a sensitive method for revealing subtle changes to network architecture in response to genetic perturbations.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>“Superagers” are older adults who, despite their advanced age, maintain youthful memory. Previous morphometry studies revealed multiple default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) regions whose cortical thickness is greater in superagers and correlates with memory performance. In this study, we examined the intrinsic functional connectivity within DMN and SN in 41 young (24.5 ± 3.6 years old) and 40 older adults (66.9 ± 5.5 years old). Superaging was defined as youthful performance on a memory recall task, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). Participants underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan and performed a separate visual–verbal recognition memory task. As predicted, within both DMN and SN, superagers had stronger connectivity compared with typical older adults and similar connectivity compared with young adults. Superagers also performed similarly to young adults and better than typical older adults on the recognition task, demonstrating youthful episodic memory that generalized across memory tasks. Stronger connectivity within each network independently predicted better performance on both the CVLT and recognition task in older adults. Variation in intrinsic connectivity explained unique variance in memory performance, above and beyond youthful neuroanatomy. These results extend our understanding of the neural basis of superaging as a model of successful aging.</span>

Abstract
<p>Midbrain dopamine seems to play an outsized role in motivated behavior and learning. Widely associated with mediating reward-related behavior, decision making, and learning, dopamine continues to generate controversies in the field. While many studies and theories focus on what dopamine cells encode, the question of how the midbrain derives the information it encodes is poorly understood and comparatively less addressed. Recent anatomical studies suggest greater diversity and complexity of afferent inputs than previously appreciated, requiring rethinking of prior models. Here, we elaborate a hypothesis that construes midbrain dopamine as implementing a Bayesian selector in which individual dopamine cells sample afferent activity across distributed brain substrates, comprising evidence to be evaluated on the extent to which stimuli in the on-going sensorimotor stream organizes distributed, parallel processing, reflecting implicit value. To effectively generate a temporally resolved phasic signal, a population of dopamine cells must exhibit synchronous activity. We argue that synchronous activity across a population of dopamine cells signals consensus across distributed afferent substrates, invigorating responding to recognized opportunities and facilitating further learning. In framing our hypothesis, we shift from the question of how value is computed to the broader question of how the brain achieves coordination across distributed, parallel processing. We posit the midbrain is part of an "axis of agency" in which the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basal ganglia (BGS), and midbrain form an axis mediating control, coordination, and consensus, respectively.</p>

Abstract<p>Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful markers of neuronal activation and essential components of neuronal response. While studies of gastropods have provided many insights into the basic learning and memory mechanisms, the genome-wide assessment of IEGs has been mainly restricted to vertebrates. In this study we identified IEGs in the terrestrial snail <i>Helix lucorum</i>. In the absence of the genome, we conducted <i>de novo</i> transcriptome assembly using reads with short and intermediate lengths cumulatively covering more than 98 billion nucleotides. Based on this assembly, we identified 37 proteins corresponding to contigs differentially expressed in either the parietal ganglia or two giant interneurons located within the parietal ganglia of the snail in response to the neuronal stimulation. These proteins included homologues of well-known mammalian IEGs, such as <i>c-jun/jund</i>, <i>C/EBP</i>, <i>c-fos/fosl2</i> and <i>Egr1</i>, as well as homologues of genes not yet implicated in the neuronal response.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Gastropods, which include snails and slugs, are widely used in studies of basic neuronal activity mechanisms. The first step of the transcriptional response to neuronal stimulation requires the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs). The identification of IEGs is important for the understanding of neuronal response mechanisms and for the visualization of activated neurons. However, genome-wide studies of IEGs have thus far been mainly restricted to vertebrates. Furthermore, a study of activity-regulated genes, a gene group that includes IEGs, conducted in fruit flies did not reveal a clear overlap with vertebrate IEGs. In this study we present a transcriptome-wide study of snail IEGs, which reveals multiple homologues of well-known mammalian IEGs, as well as a number of novel IEG candidates.</p>

Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) causes severe distress and is therefore counted by the WHO as one of the ten most impairing illnesses. There is evidence for a strong genetic under-pinning especially in early onset OCD. Though several genes involved in neurotransmission have been reported as candidates there is still need to identify new pathways. In this study, we focussed on genetic variants of the Neuropetide Y (NPY) system. NPY is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the human brain with emerging evidence of capacity to modulate stress response, which is of high relevance in OCD. We focussed on tag-SNPs of NPY and its receptor gene NPY1R in a family-based approach. The sample comprised 86 patients (children and adolescents) with early onset OCD with both their biological parents. However, this first study on genetic variants of the NPY-system could not confirm association between the investi-gated SNPs and early onset OCD.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive mental illness characterized by memory loss and multiple cognitive impairments. In the last several decades, significant progress has been made in understanding basic biology, molecular mechanisms, and development of biomarkers and therapeutic drugs. Multiple cellular changes are implicated in the disease process including amyloid beta and phosphorylation of tau synaptic damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD. Among these, amyloid beta is considered a major player in the disease process. Recent advancements in molecular biology revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered potential biomarkers in AD with a focus on amyloid beta.  In this article we discussed several aspects of AD including its prevalence, classifications, risk factors, and amyloid species &amp; their accumulation in subcellular compartments. This article also discusses the discovery and biogenesis of miRNAs and their relevance to AD. Today’s research continues to add to the wealth of miRNA data that has been accumulated, however, there still lacks clear-cut understanding of the physiological relevance of miRNAs to AD. MiRNAs appear to regulate translation of gene products in AD and other human diseases. However, the mechanism of how many of these miRNAs regulate both the 5’ and 3’UTR of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing is still being extrapolated. Hence, we still need more research on miRNAs and APP/amyloid beta formation in the progression and pathogenesis of AD.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00424">Association Between Connectivity of Hippocampal Sub-Regions and Auditory Verbal Hallucinations in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

Background: Hippocampal dysconnectivity has been detected in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. Neuroanatomical evidence has indicated distinct sub-regions in the hippocampus, but which sub-regions within the hippocampus may emerge dysfunction in the brain network, and the relationship between connection strength and the severity of this debilitating disease have yet to be revealed. Masked independent component analysis (mICA), i.e., ICA restricted to a defined region of interest, can provide insight into observing local functional connectivity in a particular brain region. We aim to map out the sub-regions in the hippocampus with dysconnectivity linked to auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.
Methods: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study of schizophrenia patients with (n = 57) and without (n = 83) auditory verbal hallucinations, and 71 healthy controls, we first examined hippocampal connectivity using mICA, and then the correlation between connection metric and clinical severity was generated.
Results: As compared with patients without auditory verbal hallucinations, mICA showed a group of hyper-connections for the left middle part, as well as another group of hypo-connections for the bilateral antero-lateral and right antero-medial parts in patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. Connectivity was linked to the clinical symptoms scores in the sample of patients with auditory verbal hallucinations.
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the left middle part is more densely connected, but the bilateral antero-lateral and right antero-medial parts are more sparsely connected in schizophrenia patients with auditory verbal hallucinations. The findings in the present study show proof of precious location in the hippocampus mediating the neural mechanism behind auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.

Fusing complementary information from different modalities can lead to the discovery of more accurate diagnostic biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. However, biomarker discovery through data fusion is challenging since it requires extracting interpretable and reproducible patterns from data sets, consisting of shared/unshared patterns and of different orders. For example, multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals from multiple subjects can be represented as a third-order tensor with modes: subject, time, and channel, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data may be in the form of subject by voxel matrices. Traditional data fusion methods rearrange higher-order tensors, such as EEG, as matrices to use matrix factorization-based approaches. In contrast, fusion methods based on coupled matrix and tensor factorizations (CMTF) exploit the potential multi-way structure of higher-order tensors. The CMTF approach has been shown to capture underlying patterns more accurately without imposing strong constraints on the latent neural patterns, i.e., biomarkers. In this paper, EEG, fMRI and structural MRI (sMRI) data collected during an auditory oddball task (AOD) from a group of subjects consisting of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, are arranged as matrices and higher-order tensors coupled along the subject mode, and jointly analyzed using structure-revealing CMTF methods (also known as advanced CMTF (ACMTF)) focusing on unique identification of underlying patterns in the presence of shared/unshared patterns. We demonstrate that joint analysis of the EEG tensor and fMRI matrix using ACMTF reveals significant and biologically meaningful components in terms of differentiating between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls while also providing spatial patterns with high resolution and improving the clustering performance compared to the analysis of only the EEG tensor. We also show that these patterns are reproducible, and study reproducibility for different model parameters. In comparison to the joint independent component analysis (jICA) data fusion approach, ACMTF provides easier interpretation of EEG data by revealing a single summary map of the topography for each component. Furthermore, fusion of sMRI data with EEG and fMRI through an ACMTF model provides structural patterns; however, we also show that when fusing data sets from multiple modalities, hence of very different nature, preprocessing plays a crucial role.

There have always been practical demands for objective and accurate assessment of muscle spasticity beyond its clinical routine. A novel regression-based framework for quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity is proposed in this paper using wearable surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial sensors combined with a simple examination procedure. Sixteen subjects with elbow flexor or extensor (i.e., biceps brachii muscle or triceps brachii muscle) spasticity and eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study. The sEMG and inertial data were recorded from each subject when a series of passive elbow stretches with different stretch velocities were conducted. In the proposed framework, both lambda model and kinematic model were constructed from the recorded data, and biomarkers were extracted respectively from the two models to describe the neurogenic component and biomechanical component of the muscle spasticity, respectively. Subsequently, three evaluation methods using supervised machine learning algorithms including single-/multi-variable linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied to calibrate biomarkers from each single model or combination of two models into evaluation scores. Each of these evaluation scores can be regarded as a prediction of the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) grades for spasticity assessment with the same meaning and clinical interpretation. In order to validate performance of three proposed methods within the framework, a 24-fold leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for each of all subjects. Both methods with each individual model achieved satisfactory performance, with low mean square error (MSE, 0.14 and 0.47) between the resultant evaluation score and the MAS. By contrast, the method using SVR to fuse biomarkers from both models outperformed other two methods with the lowest MSE at 0.059. The experimental results demonstrated the usability and feasibility of the proposed framework, and it provides an objective, quantitative and convenient solution to spasticity assessment, suitable for clinical, community and home-based rehabilitation.

Subplate (SP) neurons are among the earliest-born neurons in the cerebral cortex and heterogeneous in terms of gene expression. SP neurons consist mainly of projection neurons, which begin to extend their axons to specific target areas very early during development. However, the relationships between axon projection and gene expression patterns of the SP neurons, and their remnant layer 6b (L6b) neurons, are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the corticocortical projections of L6b/SP neurons in the mouse cortex and searched for a marker gene expressed in L6b/SP neurons that have ipsilateral inter-areal projections. Retrograde tracing experiments demonstrated that L6b/SP neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) projected to the primary motor cortex (M1) within the same cortical hemisphere at postnatal day (PD) 2 but did not show any callosal projection. This unilateral projection pattern persisted into adulthood. Our microarray analysis identified the gene encoding a β subunit of voltage-gated potassium channel (Kcnab1) as being expressed in L6b/SP. Double labeling with retrograde tracing and in situ hybridization demonstrated that Kcnab1 was expressed in the unilaterally-projecting neurons in L6b/SP. Embryonic expression was specifically detected in the SP as early as embryonic day (E) 14.5, shortly after the emergence of subplate. Double immunostaining experiments revealed different degrees of co-expression of the protein product Kvβ1 with L6b/SP markers Ctgf (88%), Cplx3 (79%), and Nurr1 (58%), suggesting molecular subdivision of unilaterally-projecting L6b/SP neurons. In addition to expression in L6b/SP, scattered expression of Kcnab1 was observed during postnatal stages without layer specificity. Among splicing variants with three alternative first exons, the variant 1.1 explained all the cortical expression mentioned in this study. Together, our data suggest that L6b/SP neurons have corticocortical projections and Kcnab1 expression defines a subpopulation of L6b/SP neurons with a unilateral inter-areal projection.

We investigated whether P300-ERP and cognitive test performance differ for age, sex and education in two groups of healthy elderly, and verified whether any correlations exist between P300 amplitude and latency and grey matter volume using whole brain voxel-by-voxel-based mapping, controlling for age, education, sex and Total Intracranial Volume (TIV). We used 32 channel electroencephalograms (EEG) to record the P300 responses and 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine grey matter volume. We recruited 36 native-Dutch speaking healthy older subjects, equally divided in two sub-groups of 52-64 and 65-76 years old, administered a battery of cognitive tests and recorded their demographics, EEGs and task performance; additionally, 16 adults from the second sub-group underwent an MRI scan. We found significant differences between age groups in their cognitive tests performance, P300 amplitudes for the frontal and parietal electrodes for the most difficult task, and P300 latencies for frontal, central and parietal electrodes for all three tasks difficulty levels. Interesting, sex and education affected cognitive and P300 results. Higher education was related to higher accuracy, and P300 amplitudes and shorter latencies. Moreover, females exhibited higher P300 amplitudes and shorter latencies, and better cognitive tasks performance compared to males. Additionally, for the 16 adults underwent to MRI scan, we found positive correlations between P300 characteristics in frontal, central and parietal areas and grey matter volume, controlling for demographic variables and TIV, but also showing that age, sex and education correlate with grey matter volume. These findings provide support that age, sex and education affect an individual’s cognitive, neurophysiological and structural characteristics, and therefore motivate the need to further investigate these in relation to P300 responses and grey matter volume in healthy elderly.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>GABA signaling sustains fundamental brain functions, from nervous system development to the synchronization of population activity and synaptic plasticity. Despite these pivotal features, molecular determinants underscoring the rapid and cell-autonomous replenishment of the vesicular neurotransmitter GABA and its impact on synaptic plasticity remain elusive. Here, we show that genetic disruption of the glutamine transporter Slc38a1 in mice hampers GABA synthesis, modifies synaptic vesicle morphology in GABAergic presynapses and impairs critical period plasticity. We demonstrate that Slc38a1-mediated glutamine transport regulates vesicular GABA content, induces high-frequency membrane oscillations and shapes cortical processing and plasticity. Taken together, this work shows that Slc38a1 is not merely a transporter accumulating glutamine for metabolic purposes, but a key component regulating several neuronal functions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Studies of sensory loss are a model for understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. In congenital blindness, subsets of visual cortex are recruited during higher-cognitive tasks, such as language and math tasks. Is such dramatic functional repurposing possible throughout the lifespan or restricted to sensitive periods in development? We compared visual cortex function in individuals who lost their vision as adults (after age 17) to congenitally blind and sighted blindfolded adults. Participants took part in resting-state and task-based fMRI scans during which they solved math equations of varying difficulty and judged the meanings of sentences. Blindness at any age caused “visual” cortices to synchronize with specific frontoparietal networks at rest. However, in task-based data, visual cortices showed regional specialization for math and language and load-dependent activity only in congenital blindness. Thus, despite the presence of long-range functional connectivity, cognitive repurposing of human cortex is limited by sensitive periods.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human precuneus is involved in many high-level cognitive functions, which strongly suggests the existence of biologically meaningful subdivisions. However, the functional parcellation of the precuneus needs much to be investigated. In this study, we developed an eigen clustering (EIC) approach for the parcellation using precuneus–cortical functional connectivity from fMRI data of the Human Connectome Project. The EIC approach is robust to noise and can automatically determine the cluster number. It is consistently demonstrated that the human precuneus can be subdivided into six symmetrical and connected parcels. The anterior and posterior precuneus participate in sensorimotor and visual functions, respectively. The central precuneus with four subregions indicates a media role in the interaction of the default mode, dorsal attention, and frontoparietal control networks. The EIC-based functional parcellation is free of the spatial distance constraint and is more functionally coherent than parcellation using typical clustering algorithms. The precuneus subregions had high accordance with cortical morphology and revealed good functional segregation and integration characteristics in functional task-evoked activations. This study may shed new light on the human precuneus function at a delicate level and offer an alternative scheme for human brain parcellation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Human intelligence can be broadly subdivided into fluid (g<span style="font-style: italic;">f</span>) and crystallized (g<span style="font-style: italic;">c</span>) intelligence, each tapping into distinct cognitive abilities.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Socioeconomic status (SES) is a multidimensional construct that includes not only measures of material wealth, but also education, social prestige, and neighborhood quality. Socioeconomic correlates between wealth and cognitive functions have been well established in behavioral studies. However, functional and structural brain correlates of SES remain unclear. Here, we sought to uncover the most likely neural regions to be affected by low SES, specifically associated with age. Using effect size–seed-based d Mapping, we compiled studies that examined individuals with low SES and performed functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry meta-analyses. The results revealed that as from early to late age, individuals exposed to low SES are less likely to have sustained executive network activity yet a greater likelihood to enhanced activity within reward-related regions. A similar activity was shown for gray matter volume across early to older age. These findings provide the first quantitative integration of neuroimaging results pertaining to the neural basis of SES. Hypoactivation of the executive network and hyperactivation of the reward network in low SES individuals may support the scarcity hypothesis and animal models of the effects of early adversity.</span>

During development, neural crest (NC) cells are early precursors of several lineages including melanocytes. Along their differentiation from multipotent cells to mature melanocytes, NC cells will go through successive steps which require either proliferative or motile capacities. For example, they will undergo Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in order the separate from the neural tube and migrate to their final location in the epidermis (Larribere &amp; Utikal, 2013; Skrypek, Goossens, De Smedt, Vandamme, &amp; Berx, 2017). The differentiated melanocytes are the cells of origin of melanoma tumors which progress through several stages such as radial growth phase, vertical growth phase, metastasis formation, and often resistance to current therapies. Interestingly, depending on the stage of the disease, melanoma tumor cells share phenotypes with NC cells (proliferative, motile, EMT). These phenotypes are tightly controlled by specific signaling pathways and transcription factors which tend to be reactivated during the onset of melanoma. In this review, we summarize first the main transcription factors which control these common phenotypes. Then, we focus on the existing strategies used to generate human neural crests. Finally we discuss how identification and regulation of neural crest-associated genes provide an additional approach to improving current melanoma targeted therapies.

Differential regulation of the μ-opioid receptor (MOP) has been linked to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence which both limit the clinical use of opioid analgesics. At a cellular level, MOP regulation occurs via receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, plasma membrane redistribution and internalization. Here, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to detect and quantify ligand-dependent changes in the plasma membrane organization of MOP expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. The low internalizing agonist morphine and the antagonist naloxone did not alter constitutive MOP plasma membrane organization. In contrast, the internalizing agonist DAMGO changed MOP plasma membrane organization in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner and by two mechanisms. Firstly, it slowed MOP diffusion in a manner that was independent of internalization but dependent on GRK2/3. Secondly, DAMGO reduced the surface receptor number and the proportion of mobile receptors, and increased receptor clustering in a manner that was dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Overall, these results suggest the existence of distinct sequential MOP reorganization events at the plasma membrane and provide insights into the specific protein interactions that control MOP plasma membrane organization.

Stress and the circadian systems play a major role in an organism’s adaptation to environmental changes. The adaptive value of the stress system is reactive while that of the circadian system is predictive. Dysfunctions in these two systems may account for many clinically relevant disorders. Despite the evidence that interindividual differences in stress sensitivity and in the functioning of the circadian system are related, there is limited integrated research on these topics. Moreover, sex differences in these systems are poorly investigated. We used the perinatal stress (PRS) rat model, a well-characterized model of maladaptive programming of reactive and predictive adaptation, to examine the relationship of early life stress-by-sex-by-circadian system at the behavioral and molecular level. We monitored the running wheel behavior in male and female adult PRS rats, under a normal light/dark cycle as well as in response to a chronobiological stressor (6-hours phase advance/shift). We then analyzed across different time points the expression of genes involved in circadian clocks, stress response, signaling, and glucose metabolism regulation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In the unstressed control group, we found a sex-specific profile that was either enhanced or inverted by PRS. Also, PRS disrupted circadian wheel-running behavior by inducing a phase advance in the activity of males and hypoactivity in females and increased vulnerability to chronobiological stress in both sexes. We also observed circadian oscillations of several genes in the SCN of the unstressed group in both sexes. PRS affected males to a greater extent than females, with PRS males displaying a pattern similar to unstressed females. Altogether, our findings provide evidence for a specific profile of dysmasculinization induced by PRS at the behavioral and molecular level, thus advocating the necessity to include sex as a biological variable to study the set-up of circadian system in animal models.

In most task and resting state fMRI studies, a group consensus is often sought, where individual variability is considered a nuisance. None the less, biological variability is an important factor that cannot be ignored and is gaining more attention in the field. One recent development is the individual identification based on static functional connectome. While the original work was based on the static connectome, subsequent efforts using recurrent neural networks (RNN) demonstrated that the inclusion of temporal features greatly improved identification accuracy. Given that convolutional RNN (ConvRNN) seamlessly integrates spatial and temporal features, the present work applied ConvRNN for individual identification with resting state fMRI data. Our result demonstrates ConvRNN achieving a higher identification accuracy than conventional RNN, likely due to better extraction of local features between neighboring ROIs. Furthermore, given that each convolutional output assembles in-place features, they provide a natural way for us to visualize the informative spatial pattern and temporal information, opening up a promising new avenue for analyzing fMRI data.

Outgroup members (e.g., individuals whose racial identity differs from perceivers’) are stigmatized in Eastern and Western cultures. However, it remains an open question how specific cultural influences affect stigmatization. In this study, we assessed whether cultural learning (i.e., social information acquired from the people in one’s environment) associated with Chinese individuals’ relocation to the United States differentiated the response to multiple outgroups. Two types of cultural learning predict diverging responses to outgroups – awareness of stereotypes about different racial outgroups is associated with increased negative affect and cognitive control towards the stereotyped outgroup. Conversely, intergroup contact attenuates those responses, and does so to a greater extent for individuals from Western cultures. As Chinese-Americans would have had more opportunities to have contact with both White and Black individuals (relative to the Chinese participants), we explored their responses to outgroups as well. Because the neural regions associated with stereotyping and intergroup contact have been well-characterized, we used neuroimaging to disentangle these possibilities. Eighteen White American, 18 Chinese-American, and 17 Chinese participants – who had relocated to the United States less than one year prior – viewed images of Black and White individuals while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants also completed measures of awareness of cultural stereotypes in the United States about Black and White individuals, implicit bias, and experiences with White and Black individuals. Behaviorally, White American and Chinese-American participants had more intergroup contact with either race than did Chinese participants, but there was no effect of participant group on stereotype knowledge or implicit bias. When viewing faces of White (as compared to Black) individuals while undergoing fMRI, White American (relative to Chinese) participants had attenuated activation in regions of the brain associated with cognitive control, including the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Chinese-Americans’ neural response to either race did not differ from White American or Chinese participants. Taken together, outgroup biases seemed to emerge in a culturally-dependent way based on variability in intergroup contact, but not necessarily awareness of stereotypes.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Combat-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained impairments in military service members and veterans. Recent animal studies show that GABA-ergic parvalbumin-positive interneurons are susceptible to brain injury, with damage causing abnormal increases in spontaneous gamma-band (30–80 Hz) activity. We investigated spontaneous gamma activity in individuals with mTBI using high-resolution resting-state magnetoencephalography source imaging. Participants included 25 symptomatic individuals with chronic combat-related blast mTBI and 35 healthy controls with similar combat experiences. Compared with controls, gamma activity was markedly elevated in mTBI participants throughout frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, whereas gamma activity was reduced in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Across groups, greater gamma activity correlated with poorer performances on tests of executive functioning and visuospatial processing. Many neurocognitive associations, however, were partly driven by the higher incidence of mTBI participants with both higher gamma activity and poorer cognition, suggesting that expansive upregulation of gamma has negative repercussions for cognition particularly in mTBI. This is the first human study to demonstrate abnormal resting-state gamma activity in mTBI. These novel findings suggest the possibility that abnormal gamma activities may be a proxy for GABA-ergic interneuron dysfunction and a promising neuroimaging marker of insidious mild head injuries.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A single bout of cardiovascular exercise can enhance plasticity in human cortex; however, the intensity required for optimal enhancement is debated. We investigated the effect of exercise intensity on motor cortex synaptic plasticity, using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Twenty healthy adults (<span style="font-style: italic;">M</span><sub>age</sub> = 35.10 ± 13.25 years) completed three sessions. Measures of cortico-motor excitability (CME) and inhibition were obtained before and after a 20-min bout of either high-intensity interval exercise, moderate-intensity continuous exercise, or rest, and again after intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS). Results showed that high-intensity interval exercise enhanced iTBS plasticity more than rest, evidenced by increased CME and intracortical facilitation, and reduced intracortical inhibition. In comparison, the effect of moderate-intensity exercise was intermediate between high-intensity exercise and rest. Importantly, analysis of each participant’s plasticity response profile indicated that high-intensity exercise increased the likelihood of a facilitatory response to iTBS. We also established that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val<sup>66</sup>Met polymorphism attenuated plasticity responses following high-intensity exercise. These findings suggest that high-intensity interval exercise should be considered not only when planning exercise interventions designed to enhance neuroplasticity, but also to maximize the therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation. Additionally, genetic profiling may enhance efficacy of exercise interventions for brain health.</span>

Evidence suggests that amyloid β is highly toxic to synapses in a phospho-Tau-dependent manner. Here, I present a hypothesis that links previous evidence from the first rise of amyloid β through to Tau tangles and neurodegeneration. In the immediate vicinity of plaques, concentrated soluble amyloid β occurs in equilibrium with deposited forms. Initially, plaques cover only a small percentage of brain volume. Microglia, by efficiently removing damaged synapses, may prevent spread of damage along the axon, restricting damage to the immediate vicinity of plaques.

Globus pallidus internus (GPi) neurons in the basal ganglia are traditionally thought to play a significant role in the promotion and suppression of movement via a change in firing rates. Here, we hypothesize that a primary mechanism of movement control by GPi neurons is through specific modulations in their oscillatory patterns. We analyzed neuronal spiking activity of 83 GPi neurons recorded from two healthy nonhuman primates executing a radial center-out motor task. We found that, in directionally tuned neurons, the power in the gamma band is significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater than that in the beta band (a ‘cross-over’ effect), during the planning stages of movements in their preferred direction. This cross-over effect is not observed in the non-directionally tuned neurons or when tuned neurons are aligned to their non-preferred direction. These data suggest that, during movement planning, information encoding by GPi neurons may be governed by a sudden emergence and suppression of oscillatory activities, rather than simply by a change in average firing rates.

UBE3A is a gene implicated in the neurodevelopmental disorders. The protein product of UBE3A is the E3 ligase E6AP, and its expression in the brain is uniquely regulated via genetic imprinting. Loss of E6AP expression leads to the development of Angelman syndrome, clinically characterized by lack of speech, abnormal motor development, and the presence of seizures. Conversely, copy number variations (CNVs) that result in the overexpression of E6AP are strongly associated with the development of ASDs, defined by decreased communication, impaired social interest, and increased repetitive behavior. In this review, we focus on the neurobiological function of Ube3A/E6AP. As an E3 ligase, many functional target proteins of E6AP have been discovered, including p53, Arc, Ephexin5, and SK2. On a neuronal level, E6AP is widely expressed within the cell, including dendritic arbors, spines, and the nucleus. E6AP regulates neuronal morphological maturation, and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and cortical development. These molecular findings provide insight into our understanding of the molecular events underlying AS and ASDs.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00105">Sodium Benzoate Attenuates Secondary Brain Injury by Inhibiting Neuronal Apoptosis and Reducing Mitochondria-Mediated Oxidative Stress in a Rat Model of Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Possible Involvement of DJ-1/Akt/IKK/NFκB Pathway</a></h4>

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease with high rates of mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to explore whether Sodium Benzoate (NaB) could reduce neural cell apoptosis and alleviate neurological deficits after ICH. To assess the therapeutic effects of NaB, first, we measured brain water content, neurobehavior, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity at 24 h after ICH in different groups. Then western blot and immunofluorescence staining (IF) were applied to test the levels of different proteins. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to observe ultra-structures within the cells in different groups. The results showed that levels of DJ-1, p-Akt and p-IκB kinase (IKK) increased after ICH and peaked at 24 h. Besides, NaB significantly upregulated DJ-1 in both cytoplasm and mitochondria, and also increased the levels of p-Akt, p-IKK and Bcl-2/Bax ratio, but decreased the levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Additionally, NaB decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) while increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which then improving the neurological functions at 24 h and long-term (21 days) memory and spatial learning ability after ICH. However, the results mentioned above could be greatly reversed by MK2206 and rotenone. Therefore, we concluded that NaB could attenuate secondary brain injury via inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and reducing mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress via DJ-1/Akt/IKK/NFκB pathway.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00415">Altered Brain Functional Hubs and Connectivity Underlie Persistent Somatoform Pain Disorder</a></h4>

This study investigated the degree of brain functional impairment in persistent somatoform pain disorder (PSPD) by examining changes in the patterns of brain functional hubs by degree centrality (DC) analysis as well as the connectivity among these hubs by functional connectivity (FC) analysis and Granger causality analysis (GCA). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 21 PSPD patients with headache as the main symptom and 17 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. DC, seed-based FC, and GCA were performed to characterize abnormal brain networks in PSPD (Gaussian random field corrected: P &lt; 0.001, Z &gt; 3.09). The relationships between DC and connectivity and clinical parameters were also examined. DC values in the bilateral inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), bilateral calcarine fissure (CAL), and left paracentral lobule (PCL) and FC values of right IOG–left CAL, right IOG–right CAL, right IOG–left IOG, left CAL–right CAL, left CAL–left IOG, left CAL–left PCL, right CAL–left PCL, and left IOG–left PCL were lower in PSPD patients as compared to controls. A negative causal effect from the left CAL to the left paracentral lobule and a positive effect from the right CAL to the right IOG were observed in PSPD patients. Abnormal DC, FC, and signed-path coefﬁcients in PSPD patients were negatively correlated with self-rating anxiety and depression scale scores. These results indicate that altered functional hubs and connectivity patterns in the somatosensory cortex may reflect emotional disturbance in PSPD patients.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00400">Effects of Hemodynamic Response Function Selection on Rat fMRI Statistical Analyses</a></h4>

The selection of the appropriate hemodynamic response function (HRF) for signal modeling in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is important. Although the use of the boxcar-shaped hemodynamic response function (BHRF) and canonical hemodynamic response (CHRF) has gained increasing popularity in rodent fMRI studies, whether the selected HRF affects the results of rodent fMRI has not been fully elucidated. Here we investigated the signal change and t-statistic sensitivities of BHRF, CHRF, and impulse response function (IRF). The effect of HRF selection on different tasks was analyzed by using data collected from two groups of rats receiving either 3 mA whisker pad or 3 mA forepaw electrical stimulations (n = 10 for each group). Under whisker pad stimulation with large blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal change (4.31% ± 0.42%), BHRF significantly underestimated signal changes (P &lt; 0.001) and t-statistics (P &lt; 0.001) compared with CHRF or IRF. CHRF and IRF did not provide significantly different t-statistics (P &gt; 0.05). Under forepaw stimulation with small BOLD signal change (1.71% ± 0.34%), different HRFs provided insignificantly different t-statistics (P &gt; 0.05). Therefore, the selected HRF can influence data analysis in rodent fMRI experiments with large BOLD responses but not in those with small BOLD responses.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00367">Toward a Bidirectional Communication Between Retinal Cells and a Prosthetic Device – A Proof of Concept</a></h4>

Background: Significant progress towards the recovery of useful vision in blind patients with severe degenerative retinal diseases caused by photoreceptor death has been achieved with the development of visual prostheses that stimulate the retina electrically. However, currently used prostheses do not provide feedback about the retinal activity before and upon stimulation and do not adjust to changes during the remodeling processes in the retina. Both features are desirable to improve the efficiency of the electrical stimulation therapy offered by these devices. Accordingly, devices that not only enable electrical stimulation but at the same time provide information about the retinal activity are required. Given the above, a bidirectional communication strategy, in which inner retinal cells are stimulated and the output neurons of the retina, the ganglion cells, are recorded using penetrating microelectrode arrays (MEAs) is proposed. 
Methods: Custom-made penetrating MEAs with four silicon-based shanks, each one with three or four iridium oxide electrodes were used to record the activity of light-adapted wildtype mice retinas and degenerated retinas from rd10 mice in vitro. In addition, responses to high potassium concentration and to light stimulation in wildtype retinas were examined. Furthermore, voltage-controlled electrical stimulation was performed.
Results: The spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells was recorded at different depths of penetration inside the retina. Physiological responses during an increase of the extracellular potassium concentration and phasic and tonic responses during light stimulation were captured. Moreover, pathologic rhythmic activity was recorded from degenerated retinas. Finally, electrical stimulation of the inner retina and simultaneous recording of the activity of retinal ganglion cells was accomplished.
Conclusions: The access to different layers of the retina with penetrating electrodes while recording at the same time the spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells broadens the use and the field of action of multi-shank and multi-site penetrating MEAs for retinal applications. It enables a bidirectional strategy to stimulate inner retinal cells electrically and to record from the spiking retinal ganglion cells simultaneously (BiMEA). This opens the possibility of a feedback loop system to acknowledge the success of electrical stimulation carried out by retinal prostheses.

In-ear EEG offers a promising path toward usable, discreet brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for both healthy individuals and persons with disabilities. To test the promise of this modality, we produced a brain-based authentication system using custom-fit EEG earpieces. In a sample of N=7 participants, we demonstrated that our system has high accuracy, higher than prior work using non-custom earpieces. We demonstrated that both inherence and knowledge factors contribute to authentication accuracy, and performed a simulated attack to show our system's robustness against impersonation. From an authentication standpoint, our system provides three factors of authentication in a single step. From a usability standpoint, our system does not require a cumbersome, head-worn device.

Lower back problems are common in the world, which leads to the development of various lumbar support exoskeletons to alleviate this problem. In general, previous studies evaluating lumbar support devices quantified assistance by reporting the reduction in back muscle activity and perceived fatigue. However, despite the beneficial effects of such devices, the effects of using such exoskeletons on muscle coordination are not well-studied. In this study, we examined the short-term change in muscle coordination of subjects using a bioelectrically-controlled lumbar support exoskeleton in a fatiguing stoop lifting task with muscle synergy analysis. Results indicate that muscle coordination changes were dominated by changes in timing coefficients, with minimal change in muscle synergy vectors. Analysis on muscle coordination changes would be useful to design future generations of exoskeletons.

Basic and applied research are increasingly adopting transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) for modulating perceptual, cognitive, affective, and motor processes. Industry and defense applications of tES hold potential for accelerating training and knowledge acquisition and sustaining work-related performance in the face of fatigue, workload, and stress. This mini-review describes the promises and perils of tES, and reviews research testing its influence on two broad applied areas: sustaining and dividing attention, and operating in virtual environments. Also included is a discussion of challenges related to viable mechanistic explanations for tES effectiveness, attempts at replication and consideration of null results, and the potential importance of individual differences in predicting tES influences on human performance. Finally, future research directions are proposed to address these challenges and help develop a fuller understanding of tES viability for enhancing real-world performance.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00027">Depth and the Uncertainty of Statistical Knowledge on Musical Creativity Fluctuate Over a Composer's Lifetime</a></h4>

Brain models music as a hierarchy of dynamical systems that encode probability distributions and complexity (i.e., entropy and uncertainty). Through musical experience over lifetime, a human is intrinsically motivated in optimizing the internalized probabilistic model for efficient information processing and the uncertainty resolution, which has been regarded as rewords. Human’s behavior, however, appears to be not necessarily directing to efficiency but sometimes act inefficiently in order to explore a maximum rewards of uncertainty resolution. Previous studies suggest that the drive for novelty seeking behavior (high uncertain phenomenon) reflects human’s curiosity, and that the curiosity rewards encourage humans to create and learn new regularities. That is to say, although brain generally minimizes uncertainty of music structure, we sometimes derive pleasure from music with uncertain structure due to curiosity for novelty seeking behavior by which we anticipate the resolution of uncertainty. Few studies, however, investigated how curiosity for uncertain and novelty seeking behavior modulates musical creativity. The present study investigated how the probabilistic model and the uncertainty in music fluctuate over a composer’s lifetime (all of the 32 piano sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven). In the late periods of the composer’s lifetime, the transitional probabilities (TPs) of sequential patterns that ubiquitously appear in all of his music (familiar phrase) were decreased, whereas the uncertainties of the whole structure were increased. Furthemore, these findings were prominent in higher-, rather than lower-, order models of TP distribution. This may suggest that the higher-order probabilistic model is susceptible to experience and psychological phenomena over the composer’s lifetime. The present study first suggested the fluctuation of uncertainty of musical structure over a composer’s lifetime. It is suggested that human’s curiosity for uncertain and novelty seeking behavior may modulate optimization and creativity in human’s brain.

The mouse somatosensory cortex is an excellent model to study the structural basis of cortical information processing, since it possesses anatomically recognizable domains that receive different thalamic inputs, which indicates spatial segregation of different processing tasks. In this work we examined three genetically labeled, non-overlapping subpopulations of GABAergic neurons: parvalbumin- (PV+), somatostatin- (SST+) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing (VIP+) cells. Each of these subpopulations displayed a unique cellular distribution pattern across layers. In terms of columnar localization, the distribution of these three populations was not quantitatively different between barrel-related versus septal compartments in most layers. However, in layer IV, SST+ and VIP+, but not PV+ neurons preferred the septal compartment over barrels. The examined cell types showed a tendency toward differential distribution in supragranular and infragranular barrel-related versus septal compartments, too. Our data suggests that the location of GABAergic neuron cell bodies correlates with the spatial pattern of cortical domains receiving different kinds of thalamic input. Thus, at least in layer IV, lemniscal inputs present a close spatial relation preferentially to PV+ cells whereas paralemniscal inputs target compartments in which more SST+ and VIP+ cells are localized. Our findings suggest pathway-specific roles for neocortical GABAergic neurons.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00087">Decreased Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow Is Associated With Cognitive Deficit in Elderly Patients</a></h4>

Background
Disruptions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow during aging could compromise protein clearance from the brain and contribute to the etiology of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). 
Objective
To determine whether CSF flow is associated with cognitive deficit in elderly patients (&gt;70 years). 
Methods
We studied 92 patients admitted to our geriatric unit for non-acute reasons using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) to calculate their ventricular and spinal CSF flow, and assessed their global cognitive status, memory, executive functions and praxis. Multivariable regressions with backward selection (criterion p&lt;0.15) were performed to determine associations between cognitive tests and ventricular and spinal CSF flow, adjusting for depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular risk factors.
Results 
The cohort comprised 71 women (77%) and 21 (33%) men, aged 84.1±5.2 years (range, 73¬–96). Net ventricular CSF flow was 52±40µL/cc (range, 0¬–210), and net spinal CSF flow was 500±295µL/cc (range, 0–1420). Ventricular CSF flow was associated with the number of BEC96 figures recognized (β=0.18, CI, 0.02–0.33; p=0.025). Spinal CSF flow was associated with the WAIS Digit Span Backward test (β=0.06, CI, 0.01–0.12; p=0.034), and categoric verbal fluency (β=0.53, CI, 0.07–0.98; p=0.024) and semantic verbal fluency (β=0.55, CI, 0.07–1.02; p=0.024). 
Conclusions
Patients with lower CSF flow had significantly worse memory, visuo-constructive capacities, and verbal fluency. Alterations in CSF flow could contribute to some of the cognitive deficit observed in patients with AD. Diagnosis and treatment of CSF flow alterations in geriatric patients with neurocognitive disorders could contribute to the prevention of their cognitive decline.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) mutations are the primary cause of Rett syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Cortical parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons (PV) make exuberant somatic connections onto pyramidal cells in the visual cortex of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span>-deficient mice, which contributes to silencing neuronal cortical circuits. This phenotype can be rescued independently of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span> by environmental, pharmacological, and genetic manipulation. It remains unknown how <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span> mutation can result in abnormal inhibitory circuit refinement. In the present manuscript, we examined the development of GABAergic circuits in the primary visual cortex of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span>-deficient mice. We identified that PV circuits were the only GABAergic interneurons to be upregulated, while other interneurons were downregulated. Acceleration of PV cell maturation was accompanied by increased PV cells engulfment by perineuronal nets (PNNs) and by an increase of PV cellular and PNN structural complexity. Interestingly, selective deletion of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span> from PV cells was sufficient to drive increased structure complexity of PNN. Moreover, the accelerated PV and PNN maturation was recapitulated in organotypic cultures. Our results identify a specific timeline of disruption of GABAergic circuits in the absence of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mecp2</span>, indicating a possible cell-autonomous role of MeCP2 in the formation of PV cellular arbors and PNN structures in the visual cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dopaminergic modulation of prefrontal cortex plays an important role in numerous cognitive processes, including attention. The frontal eye field (FEF) is modulated by dopamine and has an established role in visual attention, yet the underlying circuitry upon which dopamine acts is not known. We compared the expression of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (D1Rs and D2Rs) across different classes of FEF neurons, including those projecting to dorsal or ventral extrastriate cortex. First, we found that both D1Rs and D2Rs are more prevalent on pyramidal neurons than on several classes of interneurons and are particularly prevalent on putatively long-range projecting pyramidals. Second, higher proportions of pyramidal neurons express D1Rs than D2Rs. Third, overall a higher proportion of inhibitory neurons expresses D2Rs than D1Rs. Fourth, among inhibitory interneurons, a significantly higher proportion of parvalbumin+ neurons expresses D2Rs than D1Rs, and a significantly higher proportion of calbindin+ neurons expresses D1Rs than D2Rs. Finally, compared with D2Rs, virtually all of the neurons with identified projections to both dorsal and ventral extrastriate visual cortex expressed D1Rs. Our results demonstrate that dopamine tends to act directly on the output of the FEF and that dopaminergic modulation of top-down projections to visual cortex is achieved predominately via D1Rs.</span>

The intrauterine environment provides a key interface between the mother and the developing fetus during pregnancy, and is a target for investigating mechanisms of fetal programming. Studies have demonstrated an association between prenatal stress and neurodevelopmental disorders. The role of the intrauterine environment in mediating this effect is still being elucidated. In this review, we discuss emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting the existence of microbial communities in utero.

Humans can simultaneously combine automatic/habitual and voluntary/goal-directed aspects of behavioral control. Habitual routines permit us to perform well practiced task-components with minimal or no voluntary attention. Evidence from animal and human investigations indicates that dopaminergic neurons in lateral substantia nigra, which innervate the sensorimotor striatum, are engaged during the acquisition and performance of automatized skills and habits. Typically, in Parkinson disease (PD), there is a differential loss of dopamine, which occurs earliest and most severely in the caudal sensorimotor striatum, a subdivision of the striatum implicated in habitual control.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Brain development is likely impacted by micronutrients. This is supported by the effects of the ω-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during early neuronal differentiation, when it increases neurite growth. Aiming to delineate DHA roles in postnatal stages, we selected the visual cortex due to its stereotypic maturation. Immunohistochemistry showed that young mice that received dietary DHA from birth exhibited more abundant presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations. DHA also increased density and size of synapses in a dose-dependent manner in cultured neurons. In addition, dendritic arbors of neurons treated with DHA were more complex. In agreement with improved connectivity, DHA enhanced physiological parameters of network maturation in vitro, including bursting strength and oscillatory behavior. Aiming to analyze functional maturation of the cortex, we performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings from awake mice to measure responses to patterned visual inputs. Dietary DHA robustly promoted the developmental increase in visual acuity, without altering light sensitivity. The visual acuity of DHA-supplemented animals continued to improve even after their cortex had matured and DHA abolished the acuity plateau. Our findings show that the ω-3 fatty acid DHA promotes synaptic connectivity and cortical processing. These results provide evidence that micronutrients can support the maturation of neuronal networks.</span>

Although iron is crucial for neuronal functioning, many aspects of cerebral iron biology await clarification. The ability to quantify specific iron forms in the living brain would open new avenues for diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and understanding pathogenesis of diseases. A modality that allows assessment of brain tissue composition in vivo, in particular of iron deposits or myelin content on a submillimeter spatial scale, is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multimodal strategies combining MRI with complementary analytical techniques ex vivo have emerged, which may lead to improved specificity.

NAbstract
NAD+ (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) administration is highly beneficial in numerous models of diseases and aging.  It is becoming increasingly important to determine if NAD+ treatment may directly increase the antioxidant capacity of cells under basal conditions.  In current study we tested our hypothesis that NAD+ can directly enhance the antioxidant capacity of cells under basal conditions by using PC12 cells as a cellular model.  We found that NAD+ treatment can increase the GSH/GSSG ratios in the cells under basal conditions.  NAD+ can also increase both the mRNA and protein level of -glutamylcysteine ligase – a key enzyme for glutathione synthesis, which appears to be mediated by the NAD+-induced increase in Nrf2 activity.  These NAD+-induced changes can be prevented by both SIRT2 siRNA and the SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2.  The NAD+-induced changes can also be blocked by the ERK signaling inhibitor U0126.  Moreover, the NAD+-induced ERK activation can be blocked by both SIRT2 siRNA and AGK2.  Collectively, our study has provided the first evidence that NAD+ can enhance directly the antioxidant capacity of the cells under basal conditions, which is mediated by SIRT2, ERK, and Nrf2.  These findings have suggested not only the great nutritional potential of NAD+, but also a novel mechanism underlying the protective effects of the NAD+ administration in the disease models: The NAD+ administration can enhance the resistance of the normal cells to oxidative insults by increasing the antioxidant capacity of the cells.

Understanding underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases is fundamental to develop effective therapeutic intervention. Yet they remain largely elusive, but metabolic and transcriptional dysregulation are common events. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent lysine deacetylase, regulating transcription and critical for the cellular adaptations to metabolic stress. SIRT1 regulates the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), connecting the energetic state with cell growth and function. The activity of the transcription initiation factor-IA (TIF-IA) is important for the transcriptional regulation of rDNA genes in the nucleolus, and is also sensitive to changes in the cellular energetic state. Moreover TIF-IA is responsive to nutrient-deprivation, neurotrophic stimulation and oxidative stress. Hence, both SIRT1 and TIF-IA connect changes in cellular stress with transcriptional regulation and metabolic adaptation. Moreover, they finely tune the activity of the transcription factor p53, and maintain mitochondrial function and oxidative stress responses. 
Here we reviewed and discussed evidence that SIRT1 and TIF-IA are regulated by shared pathways and their activities preserve neuronal homeostasis in response to metabolic stressors. We provide evidence that loss of rDNA transcription due to altered TIF-IA function alters SIRT1 expression and propose a model of interdependent feedback mechanisms. An imbalance of this signaling might be a critical common event in neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, we provide a novel perspective for the prediction of the therapeutic benefits of the modulation of SIRT1- and nucleolar-dependent pathways in metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a progressive hereditary retinal degenerative disease in which photoreceptor cells undergo degeneration and apoptosis, eventually resulting in irreversible loss of visual function. Currently, no effective treatment exists for this disease. Neuroprotection and inflammation suppression have been reported to delay the development of RP. Metformin is a well-tested drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, and it has been reported to exert beneficial effects in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. In the present study, we used immunofluorescence staining, electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and RNA-Seq to explore the effects of metformin on photoreceptor degeneration and its mechanism in rd1 mice. We found that metformin significantly reduced apoptosis in photoreceptors and delayed the degeneration of photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells in rd1 mice, thus markedly improving the visual function of rd1 mice at P14, P18 and P22 when tested with a light/dark transition test and ERG. Microglial activation in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of the retina of rd1 mice was significantly suppressed by metformin. RNA-Seq showed that metformin markedly downregulated inflammatory genes and upregulated the expression of crystallin proteins, which have been demonstrated to be important neuroprotective molecules in the retina, revealing the therapeutic potential of metformin for RP treatment. αA-crystallin proteins were further confirmed to be involved in the neuroprotective effects of metformin in a Ca2+ ionophore-damaged 661W photoreceptor cell line. These data suggest that metformin exerts a protective effect in rd1 mice via both immunoregulatory and new neuroprotective mechanisms.

Decoding laminar information across deep brain structures and cortical regions is necessary in order to understand the neuronal ensembles that represent cognition and memory. Large animal models are essential for translational research due to their gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition. A lack of long-length probes with appropriate stiffness to penetrate to deeper structures with minimal damage to the neural interface is one of the major technical limitations to applying the approaches currently utilized in lower order animals to large animals. We therefore tested the performance of multichannel silicon probes of various solutions and designs that were developed specifically for large animal electrophysiology. Neurophysiological signals from dorsal hippocampus were recorded in chronically implanted awake behaving Yucatan pigs. Single units and local field potentials were analyzed to evaluate performance of given silicon probes over time. EDGE-style probes had the highest yields during intra-hippocampal recordings in pigs, making them the most suitable for chronic implantations and awake behavioral experimentation. In addition, the cross-sectional area of silicon probes was found to be a crucial determinant of silicon probe performance over time, potentially due to reduction of damage to the neural interface. Novel 64-channel EDGE-style probes tested acutely produced an optimal single unit separation and a denser sampling of the laminar structure, identifying these research silicon probes as potential candidates for chronic implantations. This study provides an analysis of multichannel silicon probes designed for large animal electrophysiology of deep laminar brain structures, and suggests that current designs are reaching the physical thresholds necessary for long-term (~ 1 month) recordings with single-unit resolution.

Advances in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of devices containing arrays of thousands of closely spaced recording electrodes, which afford subcellular resolution of electrical signals in neurons and neuronal networks. Rationalizing the electrode size and configuration in such arrays demands consideration of application-specific requirements and inherent features of the electrodes. Tradeoffs among size, spatial density, sensitivity, noise, attenuation, and other factors are inevitable. Although recording extracellular signals from neurons with planar metal electrodes is fairly well established, the effects of the electrode characteristics on the quality and utility of recorded signals, especially for small, densely packed electrodes, have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we present a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidating how electrode size, and size-dependent parameters, such as impedance, baseline noise, and transmission characteristics, influence recorded neuronal signals. Using arrays containing platinum electrodes of different sizes, we experimentally evaluated the electrode performance in the recording of local-field-potentials (LFPs) and extracellular-action-potentials (EAPs) from the following cell preparations: acute brain slices, dissociated cell cultures, and organotypic slice cultures. Moreover, we simulated the potential spatial decay of point-current sources to investigate signal averaging using known signal sources. We demonstrated that the noise and signal attenuation depend more on the electrode impedance than on electrode size, per se, especially for electrodes &lt; 10 µm in width or diameter to achieve high-spatial-resolution readout. By minimizing electrode impedance in small electrodes (&lt; 10 µm), via surface modification, we could maximize the signal-to-noise ratio to electrically visualize the propagation of axonal EAPs and to isolate single-unit spikes. Due to the large amplitude of LFP signals, recording quality was high and nearly independent of electrode size. These findings should be of value in configuring in vitro and in vivo microelectrode arrays for extracellular recordings with high spatial resolution in various applications.

Epilepsy surgery is a clinical procedure that aims to remove the brain tissue responsible for the emergence of seizures, the epileptogenic zone (EZ). It is preceded by an evaluation to determine the brain tissue that must be resected. The identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) from intracranial EEG recordings stands as one of the key proxies for the EZ. In this study we used computational models of epilepsy to assess to what extent the SOZ may or may not represent the EZ. We considered a set of different synthetic networks (e.g. regular, small-world, random, and scale-free networks) to represent large-scale brain networks and a phenomenological network model of seizure generation. In the model, the SOZ was inferred from the seizure likelihood (SL), a measure of the propensity of single nodes to produce epileptiform dynamics, whilst a surgery corresponded to the removal of nodes and connections from the network. We used the concept of node ictogenicity (NI) to quantify the effectiveness of each node removal on reducing the network’s propensity to generate seizures. This framework enabled us to systematically compare the SOZ and the seizure control achieved by each considered surgery. Specifically, we compared the distributions of SL and NI across different networks. We found that SL and NI were concordant when all nodes were similarly ictogenic, whereas when there was a small fraction of nodes with high NI, the SL was not specific at identifying these nodes. We further considered networks with heterogeneous node excitabilities, i.e. nodes with different susceptibilities of being engaged in seizure activity, to understand how such heterogeneity may affect the relationship between SL and NI. We found that while SL and NI are concordant when there is a small fraction of hyper-excitable nodes in a network that is otherwise homogeneous, they do diverge if the network is heterogeneous, such as in scale-free networks. We observe that SL is highly dependent on node excitabilities, whilst the effect of surgical resections as revealed by NI is mostly determined by network structure. Together our results suggest that the SOZ is not always a good marker of the EZ.

Objective: Stimulus visual patterns, such as size, content, color, luminosity, and interval, play key roles for brain–computer interface (BCI) performance. However, the three primary colors to be intercompared as a single variable or factor on the same platform are poorly studied. In this work, we configured the visual stimulus patterns with red, green, and blue and designed a novel layout of the BCI interface to study the waveforms and performance of the evoked related potential (ERP).
Approach: Twelve subjects participated in our experiment, which was composed of three different color sub-experiments. Four blocks of the interface were presented along the edge of the screen, and the other four were assembled in the center, to investigate the problem of adjacency distraction. Repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni correction were applied for statistical analysis. 
Main results: The averaged online accuracy was 98.44% for red paradigm, higher than 92.71% for green paradigm and 93.23% for blue paradigm. Furthermore, significant differences in online accuracy (p&lt;0.05) and information transfer rate (p&lt;0.05) were found between red and green paradigms.
Significance: The red stimulus paradigm yielded the best performance. The proposed design of ERP-based BCI was practical and effective for many potential applications.

Background: Chronic inflammation plays a significant role in accelerating the aging process and is closely associated with the initiation and progression of a broad range of age-related diseases. Physical exercise is considered beneficial in alleviating these conditions, but the effects of aerobic exercise on inflammatory markers in a healthy population should be furtherly clarified. Objective: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise on inflammatory markers in middle-aged and older adults. Methods: The literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from their inception through April 2018, and the reference lists were screened to identify appropriate studies. Only randomized controlled trials that investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on inflammatory markers in middle-aged and older adults were eligible for this review. Results: Eleven studies involving 1250 participants were retrieved from the databases for analysis. The pooled results showed that aerobic exercise significantly reduced inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP): SMD = 0.53, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.11, p = 0.0002; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α): SMD = 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.19, p = 0.0007; interleukin 6（IL-6): SMD = 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.19, p = 0.0007). No significant improvement was found in relation to interleukin 4 (IL-4). Conclusions: Aerobic exercise may have a positive effect on reduction of CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 in middle-aged and older adults. Further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) need to be conducted to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on additional inflammatory markers in the population of middle-aged and older adults.

Age-related hearing loss is associated with cognitive decline and has been proposed as a risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms that relate hearing loss to cognitive decline remain elusive. Here, we propose that the impairment of the cochlear amplifier mechanism is associated with structural brain changes and cognitive impairment. Ninety-six subjects aged over 65 years old (63 female and 33 male) were evaluated using brain magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and audiological assessments, including distortion product otoacoustic emissions as a measure of the cochlear amplifier function. All the analyses were adjusted by age, gender and education. The group with cochlear amplifier dysfunction showed greater brain atrophy in the cingulate cortex and in the parahippocampus. In addition, the atrophy of the cingulate cortex was associated with cognitive impairment in episodic and working memories and in language and visuoconstructive abilities. We conclude that the neural abnormalities observed in presbycusis subjects with cochlear amplifier dysfunction extend beyond core auditory network and are associated with cognitive decline in multiple domains. These results suggest that a cochlear amplifier dysfunction in presbycusis is an important mechanism relating hearing impairments to brain atrophy in the extended network of effortful hearing.

Abstract
Background:
Cerebral amyloid beta (Aβ) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ can be detected in vivo with amyloid imaging or cerebrospinal fluid assessments. However, these technologies can be both expensive and invasive, and their accessibility is limited in many clinical settings. Hence the current study aims to identify multivariate cost-efficient markers for Aβ positivity among non-demented individuals using machine learning (ML) approaches.
Methods:
The relationship between cost-efficient candidate markers and Aβ status was examined by analyzing 762 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 cohort at baseline visit (286 cognitively normal, 332 with mild cognitive impairment, and 144 with AD; mean age 73.2 years, range 55–90). Demographic variables (age, gender, education, and APOE status) and neuropsychological test scores were used as predictors in an ML algorithm. Cerebral Aβ burden and Aβ positivity were measured using 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography images. The adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) ML algorithm was implemented to identify cognitive performance and demographic variables and distinguish individuals from the population at high risk for cerebral Aβ burden. For generalizability, results were further checked by randomly dividing the data into training sets and test sets and checking predictive performances by 10-fold cross-validation.
Results:
Out of neuropsychological predictors, visuospatial ability and episodic memory test results were consistently significant predictors for Aβ positivity across subgroups with demographic variables and other cognitive measures considered. The adaptive LASSO model using out-of-sample classification could distinguish abnormal levels of Aβ. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.754 in the mild change group, 0.803 in the moderate change group, and 0.864 in the severe change group, respectively.
Conclusions:
Our results showed that the cost-efficient neuropsychological model with demographics could predict Aβ positivity, suggesting a potential surrogate method for detecting Aβ deposition non-invasively with clinical utility. More specifically, it could be a very brief screening tool in various settings to recruit participants with potential biomarker evidence of AD brain pathology. These identified individuals would be valuable participants in secondary prevention trials aimed at detecting an anti-amyloid drug effect in the non-demented population.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent pathology and associated with poor outcome in the aged population. We recently observed accelerated cerebral inflammation in aged mice in response to TBI. Candesartan is a potent specific inhibitor of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) which limits cerebral inflammation and brain damage in juvenile animals after experimental TBI. In the present study, we show significantly lower posttraumatic AT1 mRNA levels in aged (21 months) compared to young (2 months) mice. Despite low cerebral At1 expression, pharmacologic blockade by treatment with candesartan (daily, beginning 30 minutes after experimental TBI by controlled cortical impact [CCI]) was highly effective in both young and aged animals and reduced histological brain damage by -20 % after five days. In young mice neurological improvement was enhanced by AT1 inhibition five days after CCI. In old animals, candesartan treatment reduced functional impairment already on day 3 after TBI and post-traumatic body weight loss was attenuated. Candesartan reduced microglial activation (-40 %) in young and aged animals, and neutrophil infiltration (-40 - 50 %) in aged mice, whereas T-cell infiltration was not changed in both age groups. In young animals, markers of anti-inflammatory microglia M2a polarization (arginase 1 [Arg1], chitinase3-like 3 [Ym1]) were increased by candesartan at days 1 and 5 after insult. In aged mice five days after insult expression of Arg1 was significantly higher independent of the treatment, whereas Ym1 gene expression was further enhanced by AT1 inhibition. Despite age dependent posttraumatic differences in At1 expression levels, inhibition of AT1 was highly effective in a posttreatment paradigm. Targeting inflammation with candesartan is therefore a promising therapeutic strategy to limit secondary brain damage independent of the age.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The functional heterogeneity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) suggests it may include distinct functional subregions. To date these have not been well elucidated. Regions with differentiable connectivity (and as a result likely dissociable functions) may be identified using emergent data-driven approaches. However, prior parcellations of the vmPFC have only considered hard splits between distinct regions, although both hard and graded connectivity changes may exist. Here we determine the full pattern of change in structural and functional connectivity across the vmPFC for the first time and extract core distinct regions. Both structural and functional connectivity varied along a dorsomedial to ventrolateral axis from relatively dorsal medial wall regions to relatively lateral basal orbitofrontal cortex. The pattern of connectivity shifted from default mode network to sensorimotor and multimodal semantic connections. This finding extends the classical distinction between primate medial and orbital regions by demonstrating a similar gradient in humans for the first time. Additionally, core distinct regions in the medial wall and orbitofrontal cortex were identified that may show greater correspondence to functional differences than prior hard parcellations. The possible functional roles of the orbitofrontal cortex and medial wall are discussed.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The dorsal striatum exhibits bidirectional corticostriatal synaptic plasticity, NMDAR and endocannabinoids (eCB) mediated, necessary for the encoding of procedural learning. Therefore, characterizing factors controlling corticostriatal plasticity is of crucial importance. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, the tropomyosine receptor kinase-B (TrkB), shape striatal functions, and their dysfunction deeply affects basal ganglia. BDNF/TrkB signaling controls NMDAR plasticity in various brain structures including the striatum. However, despite cross-talk between BDNF and eCBs, the role of BDNF in eCB plasticity remains unknown. Here, we show that BDNF/TrkB signaling promotes eCB-plasticity (LTD and LTP) induced by rate-based (low-frequency stimulation) or spike-timing–based (spike-timing–dependent plasticity, STDP) paradigm in striatum. We show that TrkB activation is required for the expression and the scaling of both eCB-LTD and eCB-LTP. Using 2-photon imaging of dendritic spines combined with patch-clamp recordings, we show that TrkB activation prolongs intracellular calcium transients, thus increasing eCB synthesis and release. We provide a mathematical model for the dynamics of the signaling pathways involved in corticostriatal plasticity. Finally, we show that TrkB activation enlarges the domain of expression of eCB-STDP. Our results reveal a novel role for BDNF/TrkB signaling in governing eCB-plasticity expression in striatum and thus the engram of procedural learning.</span>

Medial frontal cortex is currently viewed as the main hub of the performance monitoring system; upon detection of an error committed, it establishes functional connections with brain regions involved in task performance, thus leading to neural adjustments in them. Previous research has identified targets of such adjustments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cortical regions, motor cortical areas, and subthalamic nucleus. Yet most of such studies involved visual tasks with relatively moderate cognitive load and strong dependence on motor inhibition – thus highlighting sensory, executive and motor effects while underestimating sensorimotor transformation and related aspects of decision making. Currently there is ample evidence that posterior parietal cortical areas are involved in task-specific neural processes of decision making (including evidence accumulation, sensorimotor transformation, attention, etc.) – yet, to our knowledge, no EEG studies have demonstrated post-error increase in functional connectivity in the theta-band between midfrontal and posterior parietal areas during performance on non-visual tasks. In the present study, we recorded EEG while subjects were performing an auditory version of the cognitively demanding attentional condensation task; this task involves rather non-straightforward stimulus-to-response mapping rules, thus, creating increased load on sensorimotor transformation. We observed strong pre-response alpha-band suppression in the left parietal area, which presumably reflected involvement of the posterior parietal cortex in task-specific decision-making processes. Negative feedback was followed by increased midfrontal theta-band power and increased functional coupling in the theta band between midfrontal and left parietal regions. This could be interpreted as activation of the performance monitoring system and top-down influence of this system on the posterior parietal regions involved in decision making, respectively. This inter-site coupling related to negative feedback was stronger for subjects who tended to commit errors with slower response times. Generally, current findings support the idea that slower errors are related to the state of outcome uncertainty caused by failures of task-specific processes, associated with posterior parietal regions.

Extensive research using penetrating electrodes implanted in the central and peripheral nervous systems has been performed for many decades with significant advances made in recent years. While penetrating devices provide proximity to individual neurons in vivo, they suffer from declining performance over the course of months and often fail within a year. 2D histology studies using serial tissue sections have been extremely insightful in identifying and quantifying factors such as astroglial scar formation and neuronal death around the implant sites that may be contributing to failures. However, 2D histology has limitations in providing a holistic picture of the problems occurring at the electrode-tissue interface and struggles to analyze tissue below the electrode tips where the electrode tracks are no longer visible. In this study, we present 3D reconstruction of serial sections to overcome the limitations of 2D histological analysis. We used a cohort of software: XuvStitch, AutoAligner, and Imaris coupled with custom MATLAB programming to correct warping effects. Once the 3D image volume was reconstructed, we were able to use Imaris to quantify neuronal densities around the electrode tips of a hybrid microelectrode array incorporating Blackrock, Microprobes, and NeuroNexus electrodes in the same implant. This paper presents proof-of-concept and detailed methodological description of a technique which can be used to quantify neuronal densities in future studies of implanted electrodes.

Introduction: Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes partial or complete damage to sensory and motor pathways and induces immediate changes in cortical function. Current rehabilitative strategies do not address this early alteration, therefore impacting the degree of neuroplasticity and subsequent recovery. The following study aims to test if a non-invasive brain stimulation technique such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in promoting plasticity and rehabilitation, and can be used as an early intervention strategy in a rat model of SCI. 

Methods: A contusion SCI was induced at segment T9 in adult rats. An rTMS coil was positioned over the brain to deliver high frequency stimulation. Behavior, motor and sensory functions were tested in three groups: SCI rats that received high-frequency (20 Hz) rTMS within 10 minutes post injury (acute-TMS; n=7); SCI rats that received TMS starting two weeks post injury (chronic-TMS; n=5), and SCI rats that received sham TMS (no-TMS, n=5). Locomotion was evaluated by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) and gridwalk tests. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were recorded from the forepaw across all groups to measure integrity of motor pathways. Functional MRI (fMRI) responses to contralateral tactile hindlimb stimulation were measured in an 11.7T horizontal bore small-animal scanner. 

Results: The acute-TMS group demonstrated the fastest improvements in locomotor performance in both the BBB and gridwalk tests compared to chronic and no-TMS groups. MEP responses from forepaw showed significantly greater difference in the inter-peak latency between acute-TMS and no-TMS groups, suggesting increases in motor function. Finally, the acute-TMS group showed increased fMRI-evoked responses to hindlimb stimulation over the right and left hindlimb primary somatosensory representations (S1), respectively; the chronic-TMS group showed moderate sensory responses in comparison, and the no-TMS group exhibited the lowest sensory responses to both hindlimbs.

Conclusion: The results suggest that rTMS therapy beginning in the acute phase after spinal cord injury promotes neuroplasticity and is an effective rehabilitative approach in a rat model of SCI.

The safe charge injection capacity and charge density of neural stimulating electrodes is based on empirical evidence obtained from stimulating feline cortices.  Stimulation induced tissue damage may be caused by electrochemical or biological mechanisms.  Separating these mechanisms requires greater understanding of charge transfer at the electrode-tissue interface.  Clinical devices typically use a biphasic waveform with controlled current.  Therefore, the charge injection mechanism and charge injection capacity of platinum was assessed on a commercial potentiostat by chronopotentiometry (controlled current stimulation).  Platinum is a non-ideal electrode, charge injection by chronopotentiometry can be passed via capacitive and Faradaic mechanisms.  Electrodes were tested under a variety of conditions to assess the impact on charge injection capacity.  The change in electrode potential (charge injection capacity) was affected by applied charge density, pulse length, pulse polarity, electrode size, polishing method, electrolyte composition and oxygen concentration.  The safe charge injection capacity and charge density could be increased by changing the electrode-solution composition and stimulation parameters.  However, certain conditions (eg acid polished electrodes) allowed the electrode to exceed the water electrolysis potential despite the stimulation protocol being deemed safe according to the Shannon plot.  Multiple current pulses led to a shift or ratcheting in electrode potential due to changes in the electrode-solution composition. An accurate measure of safe charge injection capacity and charge density of an implantable electrode can only be obtained from suitable conditions (an appropriately degassed electrolyte and clinically relevant electrode structure).  Cyclic voltammetric measurement of charge injection capacity can be performed on implantable electrodes, but will not provide information on electrode stability to multiple chronopotentiometric pulses.  In contrast, chronopotentiometry will provide details on electrode stability, but the minimum time resolution of typical commercial potentiostats (ms range) is greater than used in a clinical stimulator (µs range) so that extrapolation to short stimulation pulses is required.  A chronopotentiometic biphasic protocol is typically used as an impedance test.  Here it is shown that the measured potential is a function of many parameters.  Subsequently, impedance test results allow electrode comparison and to indicate electrode failure, but use of Ohm’s law to calculate an impedance value is not valid.

Reproducibly generating human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based functional neuronal circuits, solely obtained from single individuals, poses particular challenges to achieve personalized and patient specific functional neuronal in vitro models. A hallmark of functional neuronal assemblies, synchronous neuronal activity, can be non-invasively studied by microelectrode array (MEA) technology, reliably capturing physiological and pathophysiological aspects of human brain function. In our here presented manuscript, we demonstrate a procedure to generate 3D neural aggregates comprising astrocytes, oligodendroglial cells and neurons obtained from the same human tissue sample. Moreover, we demonstrate the robust ability of those neurons to create a highly synchronously active neuronal network within 3 weeks in vitro, without additionally applied astrocytes. The fusion of MEA-technology with functional neuronal circuits solely obtained from one individuals cells represent isogenic person-specific human neuronal sensor chips that pave the way for specific personalized in vitro neuronal networks as well as neurological and neuropsychiatric disease modelling.

Contralateral intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) can potentially improve swallowing disorders with unilateral lesion of the swallowing cortex. However, the after-effects of iTBS on brain excitability remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the alterations of temporal dynamics of inter-regional connectivity induced by iTBS following continuous TBS (cTBS) in the contralateral suprahyoid muscle cortex. A total of 20 right-handed healthy subjects underwent cTBS over the left suprahyoid muscle motor cortex and then immediately afterwards, iTBS was applied to the contralateral homologous area. All of the subjects underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) before and post-TBS implemented on a different day. We compared the static and dynamic functional connectivity (FC) between the post-TBS and the baseline. The whole-cortical time series and a sliding-window correlation approach were used to quantify the dynamic characteristics of FC. Compared with the baseline, for static FC measurement, increased FC was found in the precuneus (BA 19), left fusiform gyrus (BA 37), and right pre/post-central gyrus (BA 4/3), and decreased FC was observed in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC) (BA 29) and left inferior parietal lobule (BA 39). However, in the dynamic FC analysis, post-TBS showed reduced FC in the left angular and PCC in the early windows, and in the following windows, increased FC in multiple cortical areas including bilateral pre- and postcentral gyri and paracentral lobule and non-sensorimotor areas including the prefrontal, temporal and occipital gyrus, and brain stem. Our results indicate that iTBS reverses the after-effects induced by cTBS on the contralateral suprahyoid muscle cortex. Dynamic FC analysis displayed a different pattern of alteration compared with the static FC approach in brain excitability induced by TBS. Our results provide novel evidence for us in understanding the topographical and temporal aftereffects linked to brain excitability induced by different TBS protocols and might be valuable information for their application in the rehabilitation of deglutition.

We describe the steps involved in analysis of multi-modal, multi-subject human neuroimaging data using the SPM12 free and open source software (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and a publically-available dataset organised according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117/). The dataset contains electroencephalographic (EEG), magnetoencephalographic (MEG), and functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 16 subjects who undertook multiple runs of a simple task performed on a large number of famous, unfamiliar and scrambled faces. We demonstrate: 1) batching and scripting of preprocessing of multiple runs/subjects of combined MEG and EEG data, 2) creation of trial-averaged evoked responses, 3) source-reconstruction of the power (induced and evoked) across trials within a time-frequency window around the “N/M170” evoked component, using structural MRI for forward modelling and simultaneous inversion (fusion) of MEG and EEG data, 4) group-based optimisation of spatial priors during M/EEG source reconstruction using fMRI data on the same paradigm, and 5) statistical mapping across subjects of cortical source power increases for faces versus scrambled faces.

Real-time visualization of large-scale neural dynamics in whole mammalian brains is hindered with existing neuroimaging methods having limited capacity when it comes to imaging large tissue volumes at high speeds. Optoacoustic imaging has been shown to be capable of real-time three-dimensional imaging of multiple cerebral hemodynamic parameters in rodents. However, optoacoustic imaging of calcium activity deep within the mammalian brain is hampered by strong blood absorption in the visible light spectrum as well as lack of activity labels excitable in the near-infrared window. We have developed and validated an isolated whole mouse brain preparation labelled with genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f, which can closely resemble in vivo conditions. An optoacoustic imaging system coupled to a superfusion system was further designed and used for rapid volumetric monitoring of stimulus-evoked calcium dynamics in the brain. Our new technique captures calcium fluxes as true three-dimensional information across the entire brain with temporal resolution of 10ms and spatial resolution of 150µm, thus enabling large-scale neural recording at penetration depths and spatio-temporal resolution scales not covered with any existing neuroimaging techniques.

Objective: Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease, which is prone to relapse and affects individuals of all ages worldwide, particularly the very young and elderly. Up to one-third of these patients are medically intractable and require resection surgery. However, the outcomes of epilepsy surgery rely upon the clear identification of epileptogenic zone (EZ). The combination of cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) and electrocorticography (ECoG) provides an opportunity to observe the connectivity of human brain network and more comprehensive information that may help the clinicians localize the epileptogenic focus more precisely. However, there is no standard analysis method in the clinical application of CCEPs, especially for the quantitative analysis of abnormal connectivity of epileptic networks. The aim of this paper was to present an approach on the batch processing of CCEPs and provide information relating to the localization of EZ for clinical study.
Methods: Eight medically intractable epilepsy patients were included in this study. Each patient was implanted with subdural grid electrodes and electrical stimulations were applied directly to their cortex to induce CCEPs. After signal preprocessing, we constructed three effective brain networks at different spatial scales for each patient, regarding the amplitudes of CCEPs as the connection weights. Graph theory was then applied to analyze the brain network topology of epileptic patients, and the topological metrics of EZ and non-EZ (NEZ) were compared.
Results: The effective connectivity network reconstructed from CCEPs was asymmetric, and both the number and the amplitudes of effective CCEPs decreased with increasing distance between stimulating and recording sites. Besides, the distribution of CCEP responses were associated with the locations of EZ which tended to have higher degree centrality and shortest path length than NEZ.
Conclusions: Our results indicated that the brain networks of epileptics were asymmetric and mainly composed of short-distance connections. The degree centrality and shortest path length were highly consistent to the distribution of the EZ, and these topological parameters have great potential to be readily applied to the clinical localization of the epileptogenic zone.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00030">Dilated Dense U-Net for Infant Hippocampus Subfield Segmentation</a></h4>

Accurate and automatic segmentation of infant hippocampal subfields from magnetic resonance (MR) images is an important step for studying memory related infant neurological diseases. However, existing hippocampus subfield segmentation methods were generally designed based on adult subjects and would compromise performance when applied to infant subjects due to insufficient tissue contrast and fast changing structural patterns of early hippocampal development. In this paper, we propose a new fully convolutional network (FCN) for infant hippocampus subfield segmentation by embedding the dilated dense network in the U-net, namely DUnet. The embedded dilated dense network can generate multi-scale features while keeping high spatial resolution, which is useful in fusing the low-level features in the contracting path with the high-level features in the expanding path. To further improve the performance, we group every two convolutional layers with one residual connection in the DUnet, and obtain the Residual DUnet (ResDUnet). Experimental results show that the proposed DUnet and ResDUnet improve the average Dice coefficient by 2.1% and 2.5% for infant hippocampus subfield segmentation, respectively, when compared with the 3D U-net. The results also demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods.
