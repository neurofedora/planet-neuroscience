              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07991">DLGE: Dual Local-Global Encoding for Generalizable Cross-BCI-Paradigm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have been frequently used to decode a single brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm based on electroencephalography (EEG). It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\%, 59.88\%, and 59.56\%, respectively. We made an initial attempt to develop a general model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification, avoiding retraining or redevelopment for each paradigm. This study paves the way for the development of an effective but simple model for cross-BCI-paradigm decoding, which might benefit the design of portable devices for universal BCI decoding.

                arXiv:2509.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale modelling presents a multifaceted perspective into understanding the mechanisms of the brain and how neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD) manifest and evolve over time. In this study, we propose a novel co-simulation multiscale approach that unifies both micro- and macroscales to more rigorously capture brain dynamics. The presented design considers the electrodiffusive activity across the brain and in the network defined by the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus that is implicated in the mechanics of PD, as well as the contribution of presynaptic inputs in the highlighted regions. The application of DBS and its effects, along with the inclusion of stochastic noise are also examined. We found that the thalamus exhibits large, fluctuating spiking in both the deterministic and stochastic conditions, suggesting that noise contributes primarily to neural variability, rather than driving the overall spiking activity. Ultimately, this work intends to provide greater insights into the dynamics of PD and the brain which can eventually be converted into clinical use.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08442">Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models for Conditional Cortical Thickness Forecasting</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness (CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes, providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet), which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

                arXiv:2509.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls), employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy. Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner 2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation. ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06286">A 7T fMRI dataset of synthetic images for out-of-distribution modeling of vision</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.06286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale datasets of brain responses such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting computational neuroscience research by enabling models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, these datasets lack out-of-distribution (OOD) components, which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the same eight NSD participants for 284 synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, we provide a proof of principle that OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with the original NSD data; we demonstrate that the degree of OOD (quantified as the distance between a set of responses and the training data used for modeling) is predictive of the magnitude of model failures; and we show that the concept of OOD is not restricted to artificial stimuli but can be usefully applied even within the domain of naturalistic stimuli. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06810">Reward function compression facilitates goal-dependent reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.06810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely assign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However, this flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here, we propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a capacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners create a "compressed" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal) which is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon receiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting learning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent with our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically impaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space structure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to correlate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal valuation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We leverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work suggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex goal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive mechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the neuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral techniques that support people in achieving their goals.

                arXiv:2509.07009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article provides an overview of approaches to modeling the human psyche in the perspective of building an artificial one. Based on the review, a concept of cognitive architecture is proposed, where the psyche is considered as an operating system of a living or artificial subject, including a space of needs that determines its life meanings in connection with stimuli from the external world, and intelligence as a decision-making system for actions in relation to this world in order to satisfy these needs. Based on the concept, a computational formalization is proposed for creating artificial intelligence systems through learning from experience in the space of a space of needs, taking into account their biological or existential significance for an intelligent agent. Thus, the problem of building general artificial intelligence as a system for making optimal decisions in the space of agent-specific needs under conditions of uncertainty is formalized, with maximization of success in achieving goals, minimization of existential risks and maximization of energy efficiency. A minimal experimental implementation of the model is also provided.

                arXiv:2306.13802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neuroimaging, extensive post-processing of resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data is necessary for its application and investigation in relation to brain-behavior associations. Such post-processing is used to derive brain representations, lower dimensional feature sets used for brain-behavior association studies. A brain representation involves a choice of dimension reduction (a parcellation into regions or networks) and a choice of feature type, such as spatial topography, connectivity matrix, amplitude. However, widespread variability in rfMRI brain representations has hindered both reproducibility and knowledge accumulation across the field. Brain representation choice effects measurements of inter-subject variability, which muddies the comparison and integration of findings. We leveraged persistent homology on the subject-space topologies induced by 34 different brain representations to enable direct comparison of brain representations in the context of individual differences. Our findings reveal the importance of considering feature type when comparing results derived from different brain representations, suggesting best practices for assessing the replicability and generalizability of brain-behavior research in rfMRI data.

                arXiv:2509.07999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why do collectives outperform individuals when solving some problems? Fundamentally, collectives have greater computational resources with more sensory information, more memory, more processing capacity, and more ways to act. While greater resources present opportunities, there are also challenges in coordination and cooperation inherent in collectives with distributed, modular structures. Despite these challenges, we show how collective resource advantages lead directly to well-known forms of collective intelligence including the wisdom of the crowd, collective sensing, division of labour, and cultural learning. Our framework also generates testable predictions about collective capabilities in distributed reasoning and context-dependent behavioural switching. Through case studies of animal navigation and decision-making, we demonstrate how collectives leverage their computational resources to solve problems not only more effectively than individuals, but by using qualitatively different problem-solving strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08188">ArtifactGen: Benchmarking WGAN-GP vs Diffusion for Label-Aware EEG Artifact Synthesis</a></h4>

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode, chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic, label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing. Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing tailored to each model (per-window min--max for adversarial training; per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$), channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts -- to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable failure modes for future work.

                arXiv:2509.08269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization. An up-to-date collection of related literature is maintained at https://github.com/ishmael233/LLM4OPT.

                arXiv:2509.08315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for KV cache budget allocation.

">Fractionation of sex differences in human cortical anatomy</a></h4>

              
                Humans show reproducible sex differences in regional cortical volume (CV), but it remains unclear how these arise from underlying sex-biases in the two biologically dissociable determinants of CV: surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT). Moreover, limited access to experimental methods in humans has hindered direct studies of the causal drivers of regional sex differences in the human cortex, although rodent models have argued for both chromosomal and gonadal contributions to sex-biased mammalian cortical development. Here, we first use structural neuroimaging data in two independent human cohorts (combined N=1,754; 967 females) to quantify and spatially resolve the differential contributions of SA and CT to observed sex differences in CV. These dissociable facets of sex-biased cortical organization are highly reproducible and align with distinct functional networks and histo-molecular signatures. We then leverage complementary neuroimaging data in clinical case-control cohorts (combined N=313) featuring variations in X and Y chromosome dosage (sex chromosome aneuploidies) and testicular hormone production (isolated GnRH deficiency) to establish that regions of sex-biased CV, SA and CT in humans are enriched for congruent anatomical effects of X-chromosome dosage (e.g., primary sensory and insular cortices) and gonadal hormones (e.g. dorsomedial frontal and temporo-parietal-occipital regions). Taken together, these findings substantially advance both the breadth and granularity of our understanding regarding sex-biased cortical organization in humans - disambiguating sex effects on regional CV, SA and CT and nominating their potential genetic and endocrine causes.

">CA2 neurons show abnormal responses to social stimuli in a rat model of Fragile X syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly comorbid with autism spectrum disorders and can cause abnormal social behaviors. The CA2 subregion of the hippocampus is essential for social memory processing and social recognition. A social interaction induces changes in CA2 neuronal firing; however, it is unknown whether these changes are impaired in FXS models. Here, we examined CA2 activity in a rat model of Fragile X Syndrome (Fmr1 knockout rats). In Fmr1 knockout rats, we observed impaired CA2 cell responses to social stimuli, despite similar social behaviors. Further, in CA2 of Fmr1 knockout rats, we found reduced expression of oxytocin receptors and impaired whole cell responses to oxytocin. Together, these results raise the possibility that abnormal CA2 activity contributes to impaired social behavior in FXS and may suggest novel treatment targets for FXS patients.

">Spectral envelopes of rhythmic facial movements predict intention and motor cortical representations</a></h4>

              
                Animals, including humans, use coordinated facial movements to sample the environment, ingest nutrients, and communicate. To study these behaviors and the neural signals that underlie them, we introduce face-rhythm, a tool for quantitatively tracking, extracting, and interpreting facial movements. The approach utilizes markerless point tracking, spectral analysis, and tensor component analysis to extract demixed components of behavior from videos of facial movements. Face-rhythm is fully unsupervised and allows for the discovery of uninstructed behaviors; when applied to videos of facial behavior, face-rhythm identifies interpretable behaviors such as whisking, sniffing, and snout movements. Analysis of videos of mice in various behavioral conditions, including a classical conditioning protocol, a brain-machine interface (BMI) task, and natural behaviors outside of a task structure, revealed robust signatures of uninstructed facial movements in all regimes. The expression of these facial movements predicted internal belief states during classical conditioning and was correlated with instructed neural activity when the BMI was activated. Furthermore, facial behaviors identified by face-rhythm were highly represented in face-associated areas of primary motor cortex (M1). We found that M1 neural activity encodes a mixed representation of both the phase of facial movements as well as the phase-invariant spectral envelope of movement patterns, with higher-frequency facial movements being more likely to be represented as phase-invariant. Our results demonstrate that face-rhythm provides a novel and flexible approach for decomposing continuous face movements into natural behavioral motifs that are closely linked to neural activity patterns.

">Loss of presenilin 2 function age-dependently increases susceptibility to kainate-induced acute seizures and blunts hippocampal kainate-type glutamate receptor expression</a></h4>

              
                Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene variants increase the risk of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD patients with PSEN2 variants have increased risk of unprovoked seizures versus age-matched healthy controls, yet few studies have interrogated PSEN2 contributions to seizures, and fewer have done so with aging. PSEN2 variant mice also do not exhibit amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) accumulation, allowing for the assessment of A{beta}-independent contributions to seizure risk in AD. Critically, PSEN proteolytic capacity may regulate hippocampal kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs), with PSEN deletion reducing KAR availability and synaptic transmission in vitro (Barthet et al 2022). Kainic acid (KA) is a naturally occurring KAR agonist that acutely evokes severe seizures in mice. We thus hypothesized that PSEN2 knockout (KO) mice would have reduced latency to acutely evoked seizures and status epilepticus (SE), increased convulsive SE burden, worsened 7-day survival, and altered hippocampal KAR expression vs age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Using a repeated low-dose systemic KA administration paradigm, we quantified the latency to acute seizures and convulsive SE, then quantified neuropathology in 3-4-month-old and 12-15-month-old male and female PSEN2 KO versus WT mice. GluK2 and GluK5 KAR subunit expression was colocalized in astrocytes and neurons by immunohistochemistry 7 days after KA-SE or sham-SE to define the interaction between PSEN2 loss and acute seizures on hippocampal KARs. Regardless of sex, young PSEN2 KO mice were more susceptible to KA-induced acute seizures than WTs. Young PSEN2 KO mice of both sexes also entered SE sooner than age-matched WT mice. In aged mice, there was no significant difference in latency to first seizure or SE onset between genotypes in either sex. However, regardless of genotype, aged females entered SE sooner than young females and experienced greater mortality. This was not observed in males. Among young animals, there was no difference in KAR expression between genotypes and regardless of treatment group. In both genotypes, hippocampal CA3 astrocytes expressed GluK5 following KA-SE, however, astrocytic GluK2 expression only occurred in WT mice. GluK5 expression was significantly reduced in untreated aged PSEN2 KO mice versus untreated WT mice, while total GluK2 expression did not differ between genotypes or seizure groups. Following KA-SE, astrocytic GluK5 expression was only present in WT animals in CA3, while both genotypes presented with astrocytic GluK5 expression. This study highlights that KARs are an understudied contributor to seizures in aging and AD that warrant further investigation.

">Integration of memory and sensory information in skilled sequence production</a></h4>

              
                Sequential movements rely on two information sources: external sensory cues and internal memory representations. Although often both sources jointly drive sequential behavior, previous research has primarily examined them in isolation. To address this, we trained participants to perform sequences of rapid finger presses in response to numerical cues. Sensory influence was measured by varying the number of visible cues, and memory influence by comparing repeating and random sequences. Early in learning, participants integrated sensory and memory information: repeating sequences were performed more quickly when more cues were visible. After learning, when repeating sequences were predictable with certainty, participants relied solely on memory and ignored sensory cues. However, when this certainty was manipulated by introducing occasional violations within repeating sequences, participants reverted to integrating memory with sensory cues. We propose a computational model that successfully predicted both speed and accuracy of individual presses. Critically, this model relied on the assumption that multiple movements are planned independently of each other. This independence assumption was then validated by examining response patterns to isolated violations in repeating sequences. Finally, we provide evidence into how sequence memories can be flexibly deactivated and reactivated in response to these violations. Together, these results reveal how brain dynamically integrates sensory and memory information to produce sequences of movements.

                <p>After stroke, microglia and hematogenous macrophages, together referred to as M, clear dead cells and cellular debris in the infarcted brain through phagocytosis as an essential part of the recovery process. However, the phagocytic capability of M declines with age. Furthermore, aged M become overactivated in response to stroke, enhancing secondary brain injury. In this study, we demonstrated that by reversing the age-related dysfunctions in M through activating the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the recovery after stroke in the aged brain could be improved. Using RNA-sequencing, we compared the transcriptomes between M isolated from the brains of young and aged male mice. We observed higher levels of proinflammatory genes and lower levels of phagocytosis-facilitating genes (<I>Cd206</I> and <I>Cd36</I>) expressed by aged M. Meanwhile, the treatment with RXR agonist bexarotene (BEX) reversed the signature genes of microglia aging in the aged M. With the in vivo phagocytosis model, we showed that BEX enhanced the phagocytic ability of aged M. Using the MCAo stroke model and male and female mice, we established that BEX improved sensorimotor and cognitive recovery after MCAo in a myeloid-RXR&alpha;&ndash;specific and myeloid-RXR&alpha;&ndash;dependent manner. In conclusion, we showed that activating RXR&alpha; partially restores age-related M dysfunctions and that RXR&alpha; deficiency in M limits the therapeutic effect of RXR in improving poststroke recovery in the aged brain.</p>

                <p>Prediction errors (PEs) can enhance memory for preceding events. While such PE-related memory enhancements are critical for understanding adaptive memory, their underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and neuro-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with multivariate pattern analysis, this preregistered study aimed to elucidate the brain mechanisms underlying PE effects on memory. Specifically, we tested whether PEs trigger a neural reactivation of the preceding stimulus and whether the PE-induced effects on memory depend on the specific neural state before the PE. We also examined whether inhibitory TMS over the superior parietal cortex (SPC) reduces PE effects on memory. A total of 118 participants (male and female) received inhibitory theta-burst or sham stimulation over the SPC before completing an incidental encoding-fear learning task. In this task, participants learned trial-unique stimuli and predicted whether these would be followed by an electric shock, while EEG was recorded. Recognition memory was tested 24&nbsp;h later. Our findings show that signed PEs enhance subsequent memory, depending on theta and alpha oscillations as well as neural category reactivation shortly before the PE. Moreover, this memory enhancement was associated with post-PE theta but not with PE-driven category reinstatement. Theta-burst stimulation over the SPC led to a more conservative mnemonic response bias but left the PE effect on memory unaffected. Together, our findings reveal that PE effects on memory formation are influenced by neural states and representations surrounding the PE, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of adaptive memory formation.</p>

                <p>The lateral septum (LS) is anatomically positioned to play a critical role in directing information from the hippocampus and cortex to downstream subcortical structures, such as the hypothalamus. Early anatomical tracing studies investigated the organization of hippocampal inputs to the LS and its hypothalamic outputs to begin to understand how its structure might relate to its function. These studies also characterized the cellular anatomy of the LS and the organization of molecular markers within it. However, little is known about the organization of nonhypothalamic projection populations within the LS and what types of input these different projection populations receive. We used retrograde tracing to determine the organization of LS projections to six brain regions that mediate various social behaviors in male mice, specifically, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), nucleus accumbens (NAc), periaqueductal gray (PAG), ventromedial hypothalamus (vmH), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). We found that these projection populations occupy discrete anatomical compartments within the LS. We then used a monosynaptic rabies tracing strategy in male mice to map brainwide inputs to these six discrete LS projection populations and examine how different brain regions innervate them. We identified unique region-dependent patterns of inputs to individual LS projection populations. In particular, we observed differences in cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic innervation of the six different LS projection populations, while the hypothalamic inputs were largely similar across projection populations. Thus, this study provides insight into the anatomical connectivity that may underlie the functional heterogeneity of the LS.</p>

                <p>Human and nonhuman primate studies suggest that timing and tempo of cortical development varies neuroanatomically along a sensorimotor-to-association (S&ndash;A) axis. Prior human studies have reported a principal S&ndash;A axis across various modalities but largely rely on cross-sectional samples with wide age ranges. Here, we investigate developmental changes and individual variability therein along the S&ndash;A axis between the ages of 9&ndash;13&nbsp;years using a large, longitudinal sample (<I>N</I> = 2,487&ndash;3,747; 46&ndash;50% female) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study). This work assesses multiple aspects of neurodevelopment indexed by changes in cortical thickness, cortical microarchitecture, and resting-state low&ndash;frequency oscillations. First, we evaluated S&ndash;A organization in age-related changes and then computed individual-level S&ndash;A alignment in brain changes and assessing differences therein due to age, sex, and puberty. Age-related brain changes aligned linearly and quadratically with the S&ndash;A axis. Yet, these patterns of cortical development were overshadowed by considerable individual variability in S&ndash;A alignment. Even within individuals, there was little correspondence between S&ndash;A patterning across the different aspects of neurodevelopment investigated (i.e., cortical morphology, microarchitecture, function). Some of the individual variation in developmental patterning of cortical morphology and microarchitecture was explained by age, sex, and pubertal development. Altogether, this work contextualizes prior findings that regional age differences do progress along an S&ndash;A axis at a group level while highlighting broad variation in developmental change between individuals and between aspects of cortical development, in part due to sex and puberty.</p>

                <p>To build an understanding of our world, we make inferences about the connections between our actions, experiences, and the environment. This process, state inference, requires an agent to guess the current state of the world given a set of observations. During value-based decision-making, a growing body of evidence implicates the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) in the process of contextualizing information and identifying links between stimuli, actions, and outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms driving these processes in primates remain unknown. To investigate how OFC and HPC contribute to state inference, we recorded simultaneously from both regions while two male monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) performed a probabilistic reversal learning task, where reward contingencies could be captured by two task states. Using population-level decoding, we found neural representations of task state in both OFC and HPC that remained stable within each trial but strengthened with learning as monkeys adapted to reversals. Subjects also appeared to use their understanding of task structure to anticipate reversals, evidenced by anticipatory neural representations of the upcoming task state.</p>

                <p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule and ventral striatum (VC/VS) is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder (trOCD). DBS initiation often produces acute improvements in mood and energy. These acute behavioral changes, which we refer to as "approach behaviors," include increased social engagement and talkativeness. We investigated the relationship between stimulation amplitude, spectral power in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and speech rate in one male patient with trOCD implanted with bilateral VC/VS DBS leads and subdural electrodes adjacent to the orbitofrontal cortex and vlPFC. Several times over the first 24&nbsp;weeks of therapy, we conducted experiments where we recorded data during epochs of high-amplitude or zero-/low-amplitude stimulation. We found that both the speech rate and vlPFC power in a high beta frequency band (31 &plusmn; 1.5&nbsp;Hz, 1/<I>f</I> activity removed) increased during high-amplitude as compared with low-amplitude periods. The speech rate correlated with vlPFC high beta power. These effects were more consistent across time points in the left hemisphere than the right. At Week 24, we performed an experiment where stimulation was held constant, while the patient was asked to speak or remain silent. We showed that the presence or absence of speech was not sufficient to increase the vlPFC high beta power, suggesting stimulation is a key driver of the observed neurobehavioral phenomenon. Our results suggest vlPFC high beta power is a biomarker for approach behaviors associated with VC/VS DBS.</p>

                <p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for higher-order cognitive functions, emotional responses, and monitoring internal states. ACC dysfunction has been implicated in an array of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders which have a bidirectional relationship with the metabolic disorder Type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, loss of insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, and increased morbidity and mortality chances. To better understand the functional effects of T2D on ACC information processing, we delivered an intermittent, low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) protocol to rats (all male due to female insensitivity to STZ) which led to lasting hyperglycemia and recorded single neurons during a delayed alternation task. We observed changes in spatial and reward processing in spite of no differences in overall behavioral accuracy, though we did find hyperglycemic animals spent less time at the reward site. Hyperglycemic animal (<I>n</I> = 5) ACC neurons had higher spatial information scores and changes in the allotment of spatial coding assets. Specifically, the hyperglycemic group had greatest spatial information during the reward approach, while in controls (<I>n</I> = 3) it was uniformly distributed. We found that state space separation and decoding accuracy were greater in control ensembles at the reward location. Furthermore, control hippocampal theta phase-locked cells had the strongest reward coding, and this effect was absent in hyperglycemic animals, leading to a muted reward location representation, despite increased reward approach coding. T2D inferred a nuanced and layered effect on ACC activity, leading to reward coding deficits, a reduced post-reinforcement pause, and a differential change in spatial coding properties.</p>

                <p>Multiple brain regions need to coordinate activity to support cognitive flexibility and behavioral adaptation. Neural activity in both the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to represent the spatial context and is sensitive to reward and rule alterations. Midbrain dopamine (DA) activity is key to reward-seeking behavior and learning. There is abundant evidence that midbrain DA modulates HPC and PFC activity. However, it remains underexplored how these networks engage dynamically and coordinate temporally when animals adjust their behavior according to changing reward contingencies. In particular, is there any relationship between DA reward prediction change during rule switching and rule representation changes in mPFC and CA1? We addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of neuronal population activity from the hippocampal area CA1, mPFC, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in male TH-Cre rats performing two spatial working memory tasks with frequent rule switches in blocks of trials. CA1 and mPFC ensembles showed rule-specific activity both during maze running and at reward locations, with mPFC rule coding more consistent across animals compared with CA1. Optogenetically tagged VTA DA neuron firing activity responded to and predicted reward outcome. We found that the correct prediction in DA emerged gradually over trials after rule switching in coordination with transitions in mPFC and CA1 ensemble representations of the current rule after a rule switch, followed by behavioral adaptation to the correct rule sequence. Therefore, our study demonstrates a crucial temporal coordination between the rule representation in mPFC/CA1, the dopamine reward signal, and behavioral strategy.</p>

                <p>Working memory updating is an important executive process. Here, we study the single-neuron mechanisms involved in updating versus protecting memory from distractors in the macaque prefrontal cortex. We recorded single-neuron activity from the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and prearcuate cortex (PAC) while male monkeys performed a task that required them to update their memory of target locations while ignoring distractors. Our findings revealed that neurons in the PAC signaled updated memory locations ~100&nbsp;ms after stimulus onset, significantly faster than the ~400&nbsp;ms observed in the LPFC. Additionally, PAC neurons exhibited longer encoding of distractor information. Population decoding analyses further indicated that distractor information was maintained in orthogonal subspaces from target information in both regions, minimizing interference. These results demonstrate the distinct temporal dynamics in memory updating processes between the PAC and LPFC and highlight the interplay between robust memory maintenance and updating, suggesting that local neural mechanisms may contribute to these processes.</p>

                <p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an emerging treatment for otherwise treatment-refractory psychiatric disorders. It can produce remarkable clinical results in expert hands, but has not fared as well in controlled, multisite trials. That difficulty with scaling up arises in part because DBS&rsquo; mechanisms are poorly understood, meaning that it is difficult to objectively identify patients likely to respond and/or to customize stimulation to match individual patients&rsquo; needs. In the first part of this review, we overview converging anatomic and physiological evidence that psychiatric DBS acts by modulating distributed networks centered on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). We discuss potential physiological mechanisms of that modulation, including mixed excitatory/inhibitory effects, changes in local field potential oscillations, and neuroplastic changes. A major challenge is that mechanistic data from humans are limited and sometimes contradictory, in part because these studies can only be conducted at low <I>N</I> with limited technical replication. Animal models may overcome that challenge, but are challenging themselves because psychiatric disorders are not fully recapitulated in animal models and are defined primarily by self-reports that are unavailable in nonverbal model species. Thus, in the second part, we review paths to more reliable animal models of psychiatric DBS, including putative disease models and models based on cognitive and decision-making impairments. The latter class includes traditional cognitive assays and newer approaches based on computational modeling, both of which also implicate PFC-centric networks. Taken together, these approaches may yield new insights into DBS&rsquo; mechanisms that can in turn improve its scalability and clinical reliability.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/37/e2197242025?rss=1">Robustness of Working Memory to Prefrontal Cortex Microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Delay period activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been linked to the maintenance and control of sensory information in working memory. The stability of working memory-related signals found in such delay period activity is believed to support robust memory-guided behavior during sensory perturbations, such as distractors. Here, we directly probed dlPFC's delay period activity with a diverse set of activity perturbations and measured their consequences on neural activity and behavior. We applied patterned microstimulation to the dlPFC of two male rhesus macaques implanted with multielectrode arrays by electrically stimulating different electrodes in the array while they performed a memory-guided saccade task. We found that the microstimulation perturbations affected spatial working memory-related signals in individual dlPFC neurons. However, task performance remained largely unaffected. These apparently contradictory observations could be understood by examining different dimensions of the dlPFC population activity. In dimensions where working memory-related signals naturally evolved over time, microstimulation impacted neural activity. In contrast, in dimensions containing working memory-related signals that were stable over time, microstimulation minimally impacted neural activity. This dissociation could explain how working memory-related information may be stably maintained in dlPFC despite the activity changes induced by microstimulation. Thus, working memory processes are robust to a variety of activity perturbations in the dlPFC.</p>

                <p>Pathological levels of beta amyloid (A&beta;) lead to disruption and elimination of synapses in brain as the result of direct neurotoxicity as well as neuroinflammation. The synaptic impact of beta amyloid includes altered morphology and reduced number of dendritic spines at excitatory synapses, evident in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Here, we assessed the ability of an identified neuroprotective peptide, YEVHHQ, derived from the N-terminal domain of A&beta;, known as the A&beta;Core, to protect against A&beta;-induced alterations in dendritic spines. Our approach involved both 2D and 3D imaging of spine morphology in hippocampal neuron cultures from mice of either sex, with the 3D imaging focusing on the postsynaptic density (PSD), as its morphology is tightly correlated with synaptic strength, and presynaptic terminal morphology and density to assess the impact on both sides of the synapse. We present evidence for uniform prevention by the A&beta;Core of A&beta;-induced reductions in spine cross-sectional size and density as well as PSD surface area and volume. In addition, the A&beta;Core alone increased the presynaptic terminal volume in parallel to the reversal of A&beta;-induced changes in spine and PSD size. Together, these results provide support for reversal of structural changes underlying the functional reversal by the A&beta;Core of A&beta;-induced impairment of synaptic dynamics.</p>

The coronal sections were imaged using a 40<FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> objective (widefield fluorescence) on a Leica Thunder fluorescent microscope, and the images were processed using open-source ImageJ/Fiji software and analyzed using the Imaris software. The central amygdala was identified using Paxinos and Watson's <I>The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates</I> (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B50">Paxinos and Franklin, 2019</cross-ref>). Eight distinct cell populations were enumerated (i.e., <I>oxtr</I>-only, <I>oprm1</I>-only, <I>oprk1</I>-only, <I>oxtr</I> + <I>oprm1</I>-only, <I>oxtr</I> + <I>oprk1</I>-only, <I>oprm1</I> + <I>oprk1</I>-only, <I>oxtr</I> + <I>oprm1</I> + <I>oprk1</I>, and nontranscript cells). Our findings demonstrated that 47% of cells in the central amygdala express <I>oxtr</I> with <I>oprm1</I> and/or <I>oprk1</I>. Of the <I>oxtr</I>-expressing cells, 38% colocalized only <I>oprm1</I>, and 56% of <I>oxtr</I>-expressing cells colocalized both <I>oprm1</I> and <I>oprk1</I>. However, 53% of <I>oprm1</I>-expressing cells colocalized <I>oxtr</I>, and 61% of <I>oprk1</I>-expressiong cells colocalized <I>oxtr</I>. These findings suggest that opioid and oxytocin receptors can function at the cellular level through morphological interactions. Future work will examine the physiological basis for the interaction between opioid and oxytocin receptors using transgenic behavior and electrophysiological assays.</p>

                <p>by Kwangjun Lee, Cyriel M. A. Pennartz, Jorge F. Mejias</p>

Predictive coding (PC) proposes that our brains work as an inference machine, generating an internal model of the world and minimizing predictions errors (i.e., differences between external sensory evidence and internal prediction signals). Theoretical models of PC often rely on high-level approaches, and therefore implementations detailing which neurons or pathways are used to compute prediction errors or adapt the internal representations, as well as their level of agreement with biological circuitry, are currently missing. Here we propose a computational model of PC, which integrates a neuroanatomically informed hierarchy of two cortical areas with a simplified laminar organization and cell-type-specific connectivity between excitatory, PV, SST and VIP cells. Our model efficiently performs PC, even in the presence of external and internal noise, by forming latent representations of naturalistic visual input (MNIST, fashion-MNIST and grayscale CIFAR-10) via Hebbian learning and using them to predict sensory input by minimizing prediction errors. The model assumes that both positive and negative prediction errors are computed by stereotypical excitatory-PV-SST-VIP circuits with the same structure but different incoming input. During sensory inference, neural oscillatory activity emerges in the system due to interactions between representation and prediction error microcircuits, with optogenetics-inspired inactivation protocols revealing a differentiated role of PV, SST and VIP cell types in such dynamics. Finally, our model shows anomalous responses to deviant stimuli within series of same-image presentations, in agreement with experimental results on mismatch negativity and oddball paradigms. We argue that our model constitutes an important step to better understand the circuits mediating PC in real cortical networks.

Biology has been transformed by the rapid development of computing and the concurrent rise of data-rich approaches such as, omics or high-resolution imaging. However, there is a persistent computational skills gap in the biomedical research workforce. Inherent limitations of classroom teaching and institutional core support highlight the need for accessible ways for researchers to explore developments in computational biology. An analysis of the Scripps Research Genomics Core revealed increases in the total number and diversity of experiments: the share of experiments other than bulk RNA- or DNA-sequencing increased from 34% to 60% within 10 years, requiring more tailored computational analyses. These challenges were tackled by forming a volunteer-led affinity group of approximately 300 academic biomedical researchers interested in computational biology, referred to as the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) affinity group. This adaptive group has provided continuing education and networking opportunities through seminars, workshops, and coding sessions while evolving along with the needs of its members. A survey of CBB’s impact confirmed the group’s events increased the members’ exposure to computational biology educational and research events (79% respondents) and networking opportunities (61% respondents). Thus, volunteer-led affinity groups may be a viable complement to traditional institutional resources for enhancing the application of computing in biomedical research.

                <p>by Kristi Lin-Rahardja, Jessica Scarborough, Jacob G. Scott</p>
Gene signatures predictive of chemotherapeutic response have the potential to extend the reach of precision medicine by allowing oncologists to optimize treatment for individuals. Most published predictive signatures are only capable of predicting response for individual drugs, but most chemotherapy regimens utilize combinations of different agents. We propose a unified framework, called the chemogram, that uses predictive signatures to rank the relative predicted sensitivity of different drugs for individual tumors. Using this approach, providers could efficiently screen against many therapeutics to optimize chemotherapy at any time, whether it be for a treatment-naive tumor or a chemo-resistant tumor requiring a new treatment strategy. To demonstrate the utility of the chemogram, we used predictive signatures (extracted from a previously established method) in our framework to rank predicted sensitivity among drugs within cell lines. We then compared the rank order of predicted and observed response against each drug. Across most cancer types, chemogram-generated predictions were more accurate than predictions made by randomly generated gene signatures, signatures extracted from differential expression alone, and was comparable to another established method of drug response prediction. Our framework demonstrates the ability of transcriptomic signatures to not only predict chemotherapeutic response, but also correctly assign rankings of drug sensitivity on an individual basis. Additionally, scaling the chemogram to include more drugs does not compromise accuracy.

                <p>by Hunter L. Colegrove, Raymond J. Monnat, Alison F. Feder</p>

Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a heritable syndrome characterized by DNA damage repair deficits, frequent malformations and a significantly elevated risk of bone marrow failure, leukemia, and mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy can prevent marrow failure and lower leukemia risk, but mucosal gene therapy to lower HNSCC risk remains untested. Major knowledge gaps include an incomplete understanding of how rapidly gene-corrected cellular lineages could spread through the oral epithelium, and which delivery parameters are critical for ensuring efficient gene correction. To answer these questions, we extended an agent-based model of the oral epithelium to include the delivery of gene correction <i>in situ</i> to FA cells and the competitive dynamics between cellular lineages with and without gene correction. We found that only gene-corrected lineages with substantial proliferative advantages (probability of resisting displacement out of the basal layer ≥0.1) could spread on clinically relevant timelines, and that these lineages were initially at high risk of loss in the generations following correction. Delivering gene correction to many cells minimizes the risk of loss, while delivery to many distinct locations within a tissue maximizes the rate of spread. To determine the impact of mucosal gene therapy in preventing the clonal expansion of pre-cancerous mutations, we compared the expected burden of <i>TP53</i> mutations in simulated tissue sections with and without gene correction. We found that when FA cells have elevated genome instability or a <i>TP53</i>-dependent proliferative advantage, gene correction can substantially reduce the accumulation of pro-tumorigenic mutations. This model illustrates the power of computational frameworks to identify critical determinants of therapeutic success to enable experimental optimization and support novel and effective gene therapy applications.

                <p>by Amany Azevedo Amin, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

Individually foraging ants use egocentric views as a dominant navigation strategy for learning and retracing routes. Evidence suggests that route retracing can be achieved by algorithms which use views as ‘visual compasses’, where individuals choose the heading that leads to the most familiar visual scene when compared to route memories. However, such a mechanism does not naturally lead to route approach, and alternative strategies are required to enable convergence when off-route and for correcting on-route divergence. In this work we investigate how behaviour incorporated into visual compass like route learning and recapitulation strategies might enable convergence to a learned route and its destination. Without alterations to the basic form of the initial learning route, the most successful recapitulation method comes from a ‘cast and surge’ approach, a mechanism seen across arthropods for olfactory navigation. In this strategy casts form a ‘zig-zagged’ or oscillatory search in space for familiar views, and surges exploit visual familiarity gradients. We also find that performance improves if the learned route consists of an oscillatory motor mechanism with learning gated to occur when the agent approaches the central axis of the oscillation. Furthermore, such oscillations combined with the cast and surge method additively enhance performance, showing that it benefits to incorporate oscillatory behaviour in both learning and recapitulation. As destination reaching is the primary goal of navigation, we show that a suitably sized goal-orientated learning walk might suffice, but that the scale of this is dependent on the degree of divergence, and thus depends on route length and the route learning and recapitulation strategies used. Finally we show that view familiarity can modulate on-the-spot scans performed by an agent, providing a better reflection of ant behaviour. Overall, our results show that the visual compass can provide a basis for robust visual navigation, so long as it is considered holistically with the details of basic motor and sensory-motor patterns of ants undertaking route learning and recapitulation.

                <p>by Zhaojie Chai, Guansheng Li, Papa Alioune Ndour, Philippe Connes, Pierre A. Buffet, Melanie Franco, George Em Karniadakis</p>

Gaucher Disease (GD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucosylceramide in various cells, including red blood cells (RBCs). This accumulation results in altered biomechanical properties and rheological behavior of RBCs, which may play an important role in blood rheology and the development of bone infarcts, avascular necrosis (AVN) and other bone diseases associated with GD. In this study, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations are employed to investigate the biomechanics and rheology of blood and RBCs in GD under various flow conditions. The model incorporates the unique characteristics of GD RBCs, such as decreased deformability and increased aggregation properties, and aims to capture the resulting changes in RBC biophysics and blood viscosity. This study is the first to explore the Young’s modulus and aggregation parameters of GD RBCs by validating simulations with confocal imaging and experimental RBC disaggregation thresholds. Through <i>in silico</i> simulations, we examine the impact of hematocrit, RBC disaggregation threshold, and cell stiffness on blood viscosity in GD. The results reveal three distinct domains of GD blood viscosity based on shear rate: the aggregation domain, where the RBC disaggregation threshold predominantly influences blood viscosity; the transition area, where both RBC aggregation and stiffness impact on blood viscosity; and the stiffness domain, where the stiffness of RBCs emerges as the primary determinant of blood viscosity. By analyzing RBC mechanical properties and blood viscosity in relation to bone disease, we find that the RBC aggregation properties, deformability, and blood viscosity, may contribute to its onset. These findings enhance our understanding of how changes in RBC properties impact on blood viscosity and may affect bone health, offering a partial explanation for the bone complications observed in GD patients.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78003?af=R">Predictive Value of Plasma Biomarkers in Tau‐PET Transitions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine the predictive value of amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) versus the plasma ratio of phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217) to non-phosphorylated tau217 (%p-tau217) for tau-PET transitions (T− to T+). The added value of combining plasma amyloid-β 42 and amyloid-β 40 (Aβ42/40) and %p-tau217 into an amyloid probability score (APS2) was also assessed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) participants had plasma markers measured at via mass spectrometry (MS), an amyloid-PET scan, and a tau-PET (meta-temporal region of interest [ROI]) negative scan (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR] &lt;1.29) at the index (baseline) date, along with one or more follow-up tau-PET scans. The BioFINDER-2 cohort was used for validation. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and apolipoprotein (<i>APOE</i>) ε4 were used to assess predictors, with scaling to the interquartile range (IQR) for comparability of hazard ratios (HR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 255 tau-PET negative MCSA participants (median age: 71.9 years), 37 converted to tau-PET positive (median follow-up time: 3.81 years). Higher %p-tau217 (HR: 1.52 [95% CI: 1.28–1.80]), amyloid-PET centiloid (HR: 1.47 [95% CI: 1.20–1.79]), and APS2 (HR: 1.62 [95% CI: 1.22–2.16]) predicted tau-PET conversion. However, Aβ42/40 (HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.54–1.66]) was not associated with tau-PET conversion. In the BioFINDER-2 cohort (605 tau-negative, median age: 70.2), 33 converted to tau-positive (median follow-up time: 2 years), with higher %p-tau217 (HR: 1.80 [95% CI: 1.50–2.17]), amyloid-PET centiloid (HR: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.77–2.97]), and lower Aβ42/40 (HR: 2.38 [95% CI: 1.17–4.83]) predicting conversion.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In two cohorts, %p-tau217 was associated with tau-PET conversion, comparable to amyloid-PET. APS2 also predicted conversion in the MCSA cohort, whereas Aβ42/40 predicted conversion in the BioFINDER-2 cohort, which had more individuals with cognitive impairment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78026?af=R">Cuneiform Nucleus Stimulation Can Assist Gait Training to Promote Locomotor Recovery in Individuals With Incomplete Tetraplegia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Impaired ability to induce stepping after incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) can limit the efficacy of locomotor training, often leaving patients wheelchair-bound. The cuneiform nucleus (CNF), a key mesencephalic locomotor control center, modulates the activity of spinal locomotor centers via the reticulospinal tract. Even with severe corticospinal damage, the widely distributed reticulospinal fibers frequently cross the lesion, and lumbosacral spinal locomotor centers remain responsive. Unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the CNF (CNF-DBS) can increase modulatory input to sublesional locomotor centers and was shown to induce stepping and promote locomotor recovery in rodent models of severe incomplete SCI. Given the evolutionarily conserved CNF-reticulospinal system, we hypothesize that CNF-DBS can augment training and improve gait in humans with incomplete SCI above the lumbosacral levels.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Aiming at bench-to-bedside translation, we investigate CNF-DBS in non-ambulatory patients (<a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</a>, NCT03053791). Here, we present the first 2 individuals with chronic tetraplegia who underwent 6 months of locomotor training supported by unilateral CNF-DBS, with regular follow-up assessments of adverse and therapeutic effects performed without and with stimulation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The walking distance covered during the 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) after 6 months compared to baseline served as the primary study end point, which was reached by patient 1 in the off-condition and by patient 2 in the off- and the on-condition. No serious adverse events occurred.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that the CNF-DBS was well tolerated and had therapeutic potential in the first 2 patients, and discuss the lessons learnt with resulting implementations for the next patients. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Using electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and modeling, Lempel et al. study the development of feedforward-recurrent interactions that underlie reliable cortical representations. They show that visual cortical responses develop interlaminar temporal coherence along with reliability following eye opening, changes driven by improved discriminability of feedforward inputs and their alignment with recurrent circuits.

                Javad-Zada et al. analyze ∼1,500 animal species for conserved miRNA hairpins, and find ones with atypically long stems. These occur recurrently within invertebrates and can be >1 kilobase. Structure-function analyses demonstrate that extensive stem base-pairing and a proximal bulge that mimics an internal DGCR8 binding site are needed for biogenesis.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 10 September 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62710-0">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-62710-0</a></p>Enfortumab vedotin (EV), an antibody-drug conjugate that targets NECTIN4, has become the new standard of care treatment for patients with advanced bladder cancer, which is also known as urothelial carcinoma (UC). Although EV has proven to be very effective both as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients unfortunately develop resistance to EV after about 1 year, which calls for the need to develop new treatment options. In this study, we developed a NECTIN4-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, and showed that it was highly effective against bladder cancer cells expressing NECTIN4. We previously found that patient tumors ranged from negative to very high levels of NECTIN4. We showed that cells with higher. NECTIN4 levels were more easily targeted by the CAR T cell. Interestingly, stimulating the PPARγ pathway using small molecules like rosiglitazone (an old diabetes drug) was effective at increasing NECTIN4 expression, particularly in UC cells with lower NECTIN4 levels. This translated into enhanced NECTIN4-CAR T killing in vitro and in mouse tumor xenografts. Moreover, we found that NECTIN4 is largely retained on tumors after patients become resistant to EV, and we developed EV-resistant cell lines to study this. Importantly, NECTIN4-CAR T cells remained effective even against these EV-resistant cancer cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that NECTIN4-CAR T cells are effective, whose activity can be further enhanced by repurposing a diabetes drug, rosiglitazone, to induce NECTIN4. Our findings may pave the way to new therapeutic approaches for bladder cancer patients in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103537">p53 isoforms have a high aggregation propensity, interact with chaperones and lack binding to p53 interaction partners</a></h4>

              
                The p53 transcription factor family consists of the three members p53, p63, and p73. Both p63 and p73 exist in different isoforms that are well characterized. Isoforms have also been identified for p53 and it has been proposed that they are responsible for increased cancer metastasis. In contrast to the p63 and p73 isoforms, which do not contain truncations in folded domains, most of the p53 isoforms contain only parts of either the DNA-binding domain (DBD) or the oligomerization domain. To better understand the effect of p53 isoforms in cancer, we provide here a comprehensive biochemical characterization. With the exception of the Δ40p53α isoform, none of the other variants can bind to DNA with high affinity and none can upregulate transcription. Probing with antibodies, DARPins and other interaction partners confirmed that isoforms harbouring deletions in the DBD cannot interact specifically with them, but instead are bound to chaperones and other factors known to interact with misfolded proteins. Expression of isoforms with deletions in the DBD results in upregulation of cellular chaperones. If the expression level surpasses a threshold, the chaperone system can no longer keep these isoforms soluble, resulting in aggregation and co-aggregation with other factors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104720">Scheduled feeding improves behavioral outcomes and reduces inflammation in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading inherited cause of intellectual disability and autism, is frequently accompanied by sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. In this study, we comprehensively characterized these disruptions and evaluated the therapeutic potential of a circadian-based intervention in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<i>Fmr1</i>) knockout (KO) mouse. The <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice exhibited fragmented sleep, impaired locomotor rhythmicity, and attenuated behavioral responses to light, linked to an abnormal retinal innervation and reduction of light-evoked neuronal activation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Behavioral testing revealed significant deficits in social memory and increased repetitive behaviors in the mutants, which correlated with sleep fragmentation. Remarkably, a scheduled feeding paradigm (6 hr feeding/18 hr fasting) significantly enhanced circadian rhythmicity, consolidated sleep, and improved social deficits and repetitive behaviors in the <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. This intervention also normalized the elevated levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 and IFN-γ, in the mutants’ blood, suggesting that its benefits extend to inflammatory pathways. These findings highlight the interplay between circadian disruption, behavior and an inflammatory response in FXS, and provide compelling evidence that time-restricted feeding may serve as a promising non-pharmacological approach for improving core symptoms in neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103191">Accept–reject decision-making revealed via a quantitative and ethological study of C. elegans foraging</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making is a ubiquitous component of animal behavior that is often studied in the context of foraging. Foragers make a series of decisions while locating food (food search), choosing between food types (diet or patch choice), and allocating time spent within patches of food (patch-leaving). Here, we introduce a framework for investigating foraging decisions using detailed analysis of individual behavior and quantitative modeling in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We demonstrate that <i>C. elegans</i> make <i>accept–reject</i> patch choice decisions upon encounter with food. Specifically, we show that when foraging among small, dispersed, and dilute patches of bacteria, <i>C. elegans</i> initially <i>reject</i> several bacterial patches, opting to prioritize exploration of the environment, before switching to a more exploitatory foraging strategy during subsequent encounters. Observed across a range of bacterial patch densities, sizes, and distributions, we use a quantitative model to show that this decision to <i>explore</i> or <i>exploit</i> is guided by available sensory information, internal satiety signals, and learned environmental statistics related to the bacterial density of recently encountered and <i>exploited</i> patches. We behaviorally validated model predictions on animals that had been food-deprived, animals foraging in environments with multiple patch densities, and null mutants with defective sensory modalities. Broadly, we present a framework to study ecologically relevant foraging decisions that could guide future investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying decision-making.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102269">The flexible stalk domain of sTREM2 modulates its interactions with brain-based phospholipids</a></h4>

              
                The microglial surface protein Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) plays a critical role in mediating brain homeostasis and inflammatory responses in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The soluble form of TREM2 (sTREM2) exhibits neuroprotective effects in AD, though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Moreover, differences in ligand binding between TREM2 and sTREM2, which have major implications for their roles in AD pathology, remain unexplained. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted the most computationally intensive molecular dynamics simulations to date of human (s)TREM2, exploring their interactions with key damage- and lipoprotein-associated phospholipids and the impact of the AD-risk mutation R47H. Our results demonstrate that the flexible stalk domain of sTREM2 serves as the molecular basis for differential ligand binding between sTREM2 and TREM2, facilitated by its role in modulating the dynamics of the Ig-like domain and altering the accessibility of canonical ligand binding sites. We identified a novel ligand binding site on sTREM2, termed the ‘Expanded Surface 2,’ which emerges due to competitive binding of the stalk with the Ig-like domain. Additionally, we observed that the stalk domain itself functions as a site for ligand binding, with increased binding frequency in the presence of R47H. This suggests that sTREM2’s neuroprotective role in AD may, at least in part, arise from the stalk domain’s ability to rescue dysfunctional ligand binding caused by AD-risk mutations. Lastly, our findings indicate that R47H-induced dysfunction in TREM2 may result from both diminished ligand binding due to restricted complementarity-determining region 2 loop motions and an impaired ability to differentiate between ligands, proposing a novel mechanism for loss-of-function. In summary, these results provide valuable insights into the role of sTREM2 in AD pathology, laying the groundwork for the design of new therapeutic approaches targeting (s)TREM2 in AD.

                Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of cell death sparking adaptive immune responses that can reshape the tumor microenvironment. Exploring key ICD-related genes in bladder cancer (BLCA) could enhance personalized treatment. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) BLCA patients were divided into two ICD subtypes: ICD-high and ICD-low. High ICD expression linked to increased immune cell infiltration and longer survival, but with potentially suppressed immune function. The high ICD group responded better to PD1-targeted therapy. A risk-scoring model with four ICD-related genes (CALR, IL1R1, IFNB1, IFNG) was validated across TCGA, GEO datasets, and tissue samples, showing higher risk score correlated with weaker anti-tumor immune function, more tumor-promoting elements, lower immunotherapy response rates, and shorter patient survival. This study connects ICD-related genes to BLCA prognosis and immune infiltration, offering a vital tool for personalized treatment guidance.

                Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects up to 80% of the world’s population. Here, we show that HCMV infection leads to widespread changes in human chromatin accessibility and chromatin looping, with hundreds of thousands of genomic regions affected 48 hr after infection. Integrative analyses reveal HCMV-induced perturbation of Hippo signaling through drastic reduction of TEAD1 transcription factor activity. We confirm extensive concordant loss of TEAD1 binding, active H3K27ac histone marks, and chromatin looping interactions upon infection. Our data position TEAD1 at the top of a hierarchy involving multiple altered important developmental pathways. HCMV infection reduces TEAD1 activity through four distinct mechanisms: closing of TEAD1-bound chromatin, reduction of YAP1 and phosphorylated YAP1 levels, reduction of TEAD1 transcript and protein levels, and alteration of <i>TEAD1</i> exon 6 usage. Altered TEAD1-based mechanisms are highly enriched at genetic risk loci associated with eye and ear development, providing mechanistic insight into HCMV’s established roles in these processes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104240">The second messenger signaling molecule cyclic di-AMP drives developmental cycle progression in Chlamydia trachomatis</a></h4>

              
                The obligate intracellular bacterium <i>Chlamydia</i> alternates between two functional forms during its developmental cycle: elementary body (EB) and reticulate body (RB). However, the molecular mechanisms governing the transitions between these forms are unknown. Here, we present evidence that cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a key factor in triggering the transition from RB to EB (i.e., secondary differentiation) in the chlamydial developmental cycle. By overexpressing or knocking down expression of c-di-AMP synthase genes, we made strains producing different levels of c-di-AMP, which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status. Increases in c-di-AMP resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of EB-associated genes, and this was further manifested in earlier production of EBs. In contrast, when c-di-AMP levels were decreased, developmental cycle progression was delayed. Based on these data, we conclude there is a threshold level of c-di-AMP needed to trigger secondary differentiation in <i>Chlamydia</i>. This study identifies a mechanism by which secondary differentiation is initiated in <i>Chlamydia</i> and reveals a critical role for the second messenger signaling molecule c-di-AMP in this process.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94310">Inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex triggers an aberrant immune response in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                The UFD-1 (ubiquitin fusion degradation 1)-NPL-4 (nuclear protein localization homolog 4) heterodimer is involved in extracting ubiquitinated proteins from several plasma membrane locations, including the endoplasmic reticulum. This heterodimer complex helps in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins via the proteasome with the help of the AAA+ATPase CDC-48. While the ubiquitin-proteasome system is known to have important roles in maintaining innate immune responses, the role of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in regulating immunity remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the role of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in maintaining <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> innate immune responses. Inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex activates an aberrant immune response that reduces the survival of the wild-type worms on the pathogenic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> despite diminishing colonization of the gut with the bacterium. This aberrant immune response improves the survival of severely immunocompromised worms on pathogenic bacteria but is detrimental on nonpathogenic bacteria. Transcriptomics studies reveal that the GATA transcription factor ELT-2 mediates the aberrant immune response upon inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex. Collectively, our findings show that inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex triggers an aberrant immune response that is detrimental to immunocompetent worms under infection conditions but can be advantageous for immunocompromised worms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103608">Regulatory networks of KRAB zinc finger genes and transposable elements changed during human brain evolution and disease</a></h4>

              
                Evidence indicates that transposable elements (TEs) can contribute to the evolution of new traits, with some TEs acting as deleterious elements while others are repurposed for beneficial roles in evolution. In mammals, some KRAB-ZNF proteins can serve as a key defense mechanism to repress TEs, offering genomic protection. Notably, the family of KRAB-ZNF genes evolves rapidly and exhibits diverse expression patterns in primate brains, where some TEs, including autonomous LINE-1 and non-autonomous Alu and SVA elements, remain mobile. This prompts questions about their interactions in primate brains and potential roles in human brain evolution and disease. For a systematic comparative analysis of TE interactions with other genes, we developed the tool TEKRABber and focused on strong and experimentally validated cases. Our bipartite network analysis revealed significantly more interactions between KRAB-ZNF genes and TEs in humans than in other primates, especially with recently evolved, i.e., Simiiformes-specific, TEs. Notably, ZNF528, under positive selection in humans, shows numerous human-specific TE interactions. Most negative interactions in our network, indicative of repression by KRAB-ZNF proteins, entail Alu TEs, while links to other TEs are generally positive. In Alzheimer’s patients, a subnetwork involving 21 interactions with an Alu module appears diminished or lost. Our findings suggest that KRAB-ZNF and TE interactions vary across TE families, have increased throughout human evolution, and may influence susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease.

">Synchrotron XRF imaging reveals manganese accumulation in the Golgi and post-synapses of neurons and enhanced uptake in astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Manganese is an essential trace metal for humans, but excessive exposure can cause neurotoxicity, including parkinsonian syndromes, cognitive deficits, and has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Globally, tens of millions of people are exposed to elevated manganese levels through drinking water, exceeding the WHO recommended guideline. Despite its public health significance, the cellular and subcellular mechanisms underlying manganese neurotoxicity remain poorly defined, particularly its distribution across brain cell types and its specific intracellular targets. In this study, we investigated manganese accumulation in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and astrocytes. Using a correlative imaging approach that combined cryo-fluorescence light microscopy with synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging, we mapped and quantified manganese at subcellular resolution. Our analysis revealed that manganese preferentially accumulates in the Golgi apparatus of both neurons and astrocytes. In neurons, manganese was also detected in dendrites at the postsynaptic density, suggesting a role in synaptic vulnerability. Quantitative elemental analysis showed that astrocytes accumulated 3 times more manganese than neurons. Furthermore, when neurons were co-cultured with astrocytes, their manganese uptake was significantly reduced, indicating a possible protective or buffering role of astrocytes. These findings identify key cellular and subcellular targets of manganese and highlight the Golgi apparatus as a major regulator of manganese neurotoxicity. This work provides a foundation for understanding cell type-specific responses to manganese exposure and may inform the development of targeted neuroprotection strategies.

">Axon termination of the SAB motor neurons in C. elegans depends on pre- and postsynaptic activity</a></h4>

              
                Axon termination is a critical step in neural circuit formation, but the contribution of activity from postsynaptic targets to this process remains unclear. Using Caenorhabditis elegans SAB neurons as a model system, we showed that inhibition of muscle activity during a critical period of postembryonic development led to axonal overgrowth and ectopic synapse formation. This effect is mediated by a local retrograde signal and requires neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) acting cell-autonomously to constrain axon growth. Manipulating SAB neuron excitability demonstrated that increased intrinsic neuronal activity drives overgrowth, while reducing activity suppresses it, establishing a functional link between muscle-derived cues and presynaptic excitability. Transcriptomic analysis and genetic studies further implicate the neuropeptides FLP-18 and NLP-12 as essential modulators of this activity-dependent process. Our findings reveal a temporally and spatially restricted retrograde signaling mechanism in motor neurons, where target activity, neuronal calcium dynamics and neuropeptide signaling cooperate to ensure proper axon termination. These results highlight conserved principles of activity-dependent regulation at neuromuscular junctions and provide a framework for understanding how motor circuits integrate target feedback to sculpt precise connectivity.

">Permethrin elicits chemoreceptive responses on different Anopheles gambiae sensory appendages.</a></h4>

              
                Non-contact detection of pyrethroid insecticides by malaria mosquitoes has been unveiled and may contribute to the evolution of mosquito behavioral modifications against vector control tools. However, the mechanisms underlying this detection are not yet fully understood. It has been hypothesized that the spatial repellency of pyrethroids may be mediated by chemosensory receptors and/or via the activation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). This study aimed to explore these two hypotheses by identifying which chemosensory appendages in Anopheles gambiae are involved in the non-contact detection of permethrin, a widely used pyrethroid in malaria control. Behavioral responses to permethrin headspace were recorded in female An. gambiae, in which specific sensory appendages were either removed or coated with resin to impair their chemosensory function. Additionally, electrophysiological recordings were performed on different sensory appendages: antennae, palpi and tarsi, to characterize their electrophysiological activity after permethrin stimulation. The behavioral assays revealed that tarsi were primarily responsible for mediating mosquito takeoff responses after permethrin headspace delivery. This finding was supported by significant electrophysiological tarsal responses to the insecticide. In contrast, removal of the antennae did not alter behavioral responses, although electroantennogram recordings indicated neural activity in response to permethrin. Palps showed neither behavioral nor electrophysiological responses. These findings indicate that permethrin is detected through two distinct sensory appendages, tarsi and antennae, but with varying behavioral output. Such appendage-specific detection favors the hypothesis that permethrin detection and the associated behavioral output is mediated by chemosensory receptors rather than by VGSCs. Nonetheless, further investigations are needed to identify the chemosensory receptors and pathways involved in pyrethroid insecticide detection in malaria mosquitoes.

">Facial Micro-Movements as a Proxy of Increasingly Erratic Heart Rate Variability While Experiencing Pressure Pain</a></h4>

              
                The sensation of pain varies from person to person. These patterns of individual variations are difficult to capture using coarse subjective self-reports. However, they are important when prescribing therapies and tailoring them to the person 's own sensations. Pain can be experienced differently by the same person, and fluctuate differently depending on the context, yet most analyses treat the problem under a one-size-fits-all model. In this work, we introduce a series of assays to objectively assess pressure pain across tasks with different motoric and cognitive demands, in relation to resting state. In a cohort of healthy individuals, we examine pain-free vs. pain states at rest, during drawing with heavy cognitive demands, during pointing to a visual target, and during a grooved peg task like inserting a grooved key in a matching grooved keyhole. We recorded face videos, electrocardiographic signals and adopt a standardized data type called the micro-movement spikes (MMS) to characterize the biorhythmic activities of the face micro-expressions and of the micro-fluctuations in the heart 's inter beat interval timings. Using the MMS peaks, we find that the continuous Gamma family of probability distribution functions best fit the frequency histograms of both the Face and the heart data. Further, we find that the Gamma shape and scale parameters in both signals span a scaling power law whereby as the noise-to-signal ratio (Gamma scale parameter) increases, so does the randomness of the stochastic process (the Gamma shape decreases towards the memoryless exponential range). We find that as the heart IBI turns more erratic (noisier and more random) the facial ophthalmic region increases the noise and randomness too, with higher linear correlation for tasks requiring haptic feedback (R2 0.84) than for tasks requiring higher cognitive and memory loads (R2 0.77). Increases in transfer entropy shows that recent past activity (~167ms back) of the heart IBI and Face combined lower the uncertainty in the prediction of the present ophthalmic-Face activity, suggesting that this Face region may serve as a proxy of an increasingly dysregulated heart. These results bear implications for the detection and monitoring of pressure pain and heart dysregulated states.

">Periodic and aperiodic contributions to EEG delta power are translatable and complementary Angelman syndrome biomarkers</a></h4>

              
                Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of maternal UBE3A expression. With promising AS therapies now in clinical trials, there is a pressing need for reliable and translatable biomarkers. Elevated EEG delta power is a hallmark of AS and a promising biomarker, but traditional measures conflate delta oscillations with broadband spectral shifts, limiting interpretability and utility. We dissociated periodic and aperiodic contributions to delta power using spectral parameterization in children with AS and Ube3a mutant mice. In both species, elevated delta power reflected a combination of increased periodic delta oscillations and elevated aperiodic slope and offset. These features were linked to different behavioral domains and followed divergent developmental trajectories, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. Together, our findings establish aperiodic changes as a novel translatable EEG biomarker for AS and support the complementary use of periodic and aperiodic features in preclinical and clinical research.

">Sleep Deprivation Primes Synaptic Vulnerability Without Inducing Oxidative Damage: A Mechanistic Reappraisal</a></h4>

              
                The question of whether sleep deprivation is inherently lethal has remained unresolved due to the inability to separate pure sleep loss from experimental stress. Historical studies dating back over a century have consistently reported that prolonged wakefulness leads to death, but these findings have been confounded by the stressful nature of the experimental interventions used to maintain wakefulness. Recent work has suggested that sleep deprivation-induced lethality may result from accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestines, providing a potential molecular explanation for these long-standing observations. Here we address whether lethality stems from sleep loss itself or experimental stress using stress-controlled sleep deprivation in Drosophila and stress paradigms in both flies and mice. Using real-time feedback-controlled sleep deprivation in Drosophila -- which only stimulates animals when they attempt to sleep -- we found no lethality or intestinal ROS accumulation even after 240 hours of continuous wakefulness. In contrast, both physical perturbation and psychological challenges rapidly induced intestinal ROS accumulation independent of sleep loss, in flies and mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed entirely distinct molecular signatures between sleep deprivation and oxidative stress, demonstrating these represent fundamentally different biological challenges. However, while sleep deprivation alone caused no lethality or intestinal oxidative stress, it increased susceptibility to traumatic brain injury through enhanced synaptic strength. Sleep-deprived flies showed increased mortality when subjected to violent physical challenges, an effect that correlated with synaptic excitability rather than sleep duration, and was rescued by restorative recovery sleep or prevented in mutants lacking synaptic potentiation mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that experimental stress, not sleep loss, drives the oxidative damage and lethality historically attributed to sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation, however, creates conditional vulnerability by transforming the brain into a hyperexcitable state susceptible to trauma, rather than causing cumulative damage.

">Information, Movement and Adaptation in Human Vision</a></h4>

              
                Our eyes are never still. Even when fixating, they exhibit small, jittery motions. While it has long been argued that these fixational eye movements (FEMs) aid the acquisition of visual information, a complete theoretical description of their impact on the information available in the early visual system has been lacking. Here we build FEMs into a minimal theoretical model of the early visual response, including the critical process of adaptation (a fading response to a fixed image). We establish the effect of FEMs on the mutual information between a visual stimulus and this response. Our approach identifies the key dimensionless parameters that characterise the effect of fixational eye movements, and reveals the regimes in which this effect can be beneficial, detrimental or negligible. Taking parameter values appropriate for human vision, we show that the spatio-temporal couplings induced by fixational eye movements can explain the qualitative features of the human contrast sensitivity function as well as classic experiments on temporal integration. To our knowledge, the consideration of fixational eye movements in this latter context is novel, and our results suggest the need for future experiments to determine the mechanisms by which spatial and temporal responses are coupled in the human visual system.

">Teneurin-4 switches between self-recognition and canonical Latrophilin binding to direct neuronal migration</a></h4>

              
                Cortical migration is a complex process in which neurons migrate along radial glial cells (RGC) to form functional layers. Teneurins (Ten1-4) play a role by interacting with Latrophilins (Lphn/ADGRL1-3). Teneurins are also known as cell adhesion molecules, but how homophilic and heterophilic Teneurin interactions are integrated is unknown. Here, single-particle-cryo-EM data of Ten2 shows that canonical Latrophilin-binding is sterically incompatible with Ten2-dimerisation, making these interactions exclusive. We engineered surface mutations that specifically disrupt Ten2-Ten2 or Ten2-Latrophilin interactions. These are transferrable to Ten4, suggesting conserved binding mechanisms. Proteomics, in-vivo-gene-editing and super-resolution-microscopy show that Ten4 is expressed along RGC fibres and that migrating neurons switch from low-to-high Ten4-expression. Ten4 expression is highest in the cortical plate where Ten4-Ten4 interactions reduce RGC-attachment. In the intermediate zone, Ten4-Latrophilin interactions are required to promote neuron-RGC association. The results show how Ten4 orchestrates cortical migration by exclusive structural mechanisms, underpinning the integration of distinct migration programmes.

">A molecular atlas of cell-type specific signatures in the parkinsonian striatum.</a></h4>

              
                The progressive degeneration of dopaminergic projections to the striatum is a key disease mechanism in Parkinson's disease (PD). To define the cellular landscape in the parkinsonian striatum, we mapped the cell-type specific transcriptional landscape in early and progressive PD mouse models and in human PD stages. Our analyses revealed substantial transcriptomic changes across both neuronal and glial populations, with astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct disease-associated gene expression profiles. Notably, progressive dopamine depletion uncovered differential neuronal vulnerability, identifying eccentric striatal projection neurons (SPNs) and Chst9-expressing direct-pathway SPNs as among the most resilient subtypes in both species. This cross-species resource establishes a comprehensive framework for investigating cell-state dynamics in the parkinsonian striatum and uncovers selectively vulnerable and resistant cell types that can inspire new therapeutic strategies.

">Cortical-layer EEG-fMRI at 7T: experimental setup and analysis pipeline to elucidate generating mechanisms of alpha oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Alpha band (8-13Hz) electroencephalography (EEG) oscillations play a key role in cognition, but their generating mechanisms are still poorly understood. Most studies investigating laminar origins of alpha oscillations have been conducted on animals using invasive intracranial recordings. To relate these findings to human alpha generation, non-invasive techniques need to be developed. Layer functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high field (UHF, 7T) allows for the interrogation of brain responses across cortical depths and combined with simultaneous EEG, provides the opportunity to gain new insight into human alpha generation mechanisms. This work establishes a framework to study the generating mechanisms of electrophysiological signals non-invasively in humans using simultaneous EEG layer-fMRI. Data were acquired on 10 participants during an eyes closed/eyes open paradigm. We showed that in 9/10 participants the quality of EEG and Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) fMRI data were sufficient to observe a significant negative correlation between EEG alpha power and the BOLD signal in visual cortex grey matter to the eyes open/eyes closed task. "Deveining" was performed to overcome the increase in BOLD signal toward the pial surface due to draining veins, and the effects of each of the steps in the deveining analysis on the cortical depth profiles of the negative alpha-BOLD correlations studied. The largest effect was dependent on the exclusion of voxels in the tissue immediately surrounding veins. Following deveining, the cortical depth profiles showed the negative alpha-BOLD correlations were significantly weaker in the middle depths compared with deep and superficial depths. When a boxcar rather than EEG alpha power was used to model the task, this depth-dependence was not seen, suggesting this was specific to spontaneous alpha-power modulations. In conclusion, we have established a method to non-invasively interrogate the origins of electrophysiological signals. Our alpha-BOLD depth profiles suggest the alpha signal to an eyes open-closed task is generated in superficial and deep layers suggesting top-down processes.

">Immediate early genes act in the medial hypothalamus to promote adaptation to social defeat</a></h4>

              
                Territorial animals must moderate their social aggression and avoidance behaviors in a manner that maximizes their access to resources and fitness. The ventrolateral division of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMHvl) has been shown to control both social aggression and avoidance in mice, and emerging data show that neural plasticity within VMHvl can drive the experience-dependent adaptation of these behaviors. Here, we investigated the contribution of immediate early gene (IEG) function in supporting this plasticity. In initial experiments, we found that downregulation of the IEG cFos in VMHvl did not significantly moderate the long-term increase in social avoidance seen following an experience of social defeat. However, local knockout of the IEG master regulator Serum Response Factor (SRF, Srf) was able to blunt the impact of social defeat on social avoidance and prevented the effect of social defeat on local optogenetic-evoked social avoidance behavior, demonstrating a critical role for subcortical IEG activity in social defeat-induced behavioral plasticity. To test whether NMDA receptor dependent plasticity might be involved in this effect, we locally infused the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 into VMHvl and assessed the impact of social defeat. Unexpectedly, MK-801 treatment led to an increase in social defeat-induced avoidance, pointing to the existence of opposing IEG and NMDA receptor-dependent adaptive mechanisms in medial hypothalamus. These findings suggest that multiple neural plasticity mechanisms are likely to be at play in the hypothalamic nuclei supporting innate behavior adaptation and show how IEG blockade can be used as a genetic tool to systematically map neural plasticity in the brain.

">Contextual Cues and Transition Statistics Drive Expression of Competing Motor Memories</a></h4>

              
                Learning multiple motor skills without interference and expressing the correct one in a changing environment is a fundamental challenge. Contextual cues are known to help separate these memories, but how they interact during retrieval is not well understood. We investigated how the stability, recency, and transitional statistics of learning environments influence this process. Across six visuomotor adaptation experiments, participants learned opposing rotations (Tasks A and B) tagged with distinct contextual cues under different schedules (blocked or interleaved) and were tested in stable or dynamic environments. We found that while contextual cues can successfully separate memories, expression is systematically biased by learned transition statistics: towards more stable memories after imbalanced training, and towards more recent memories when stabilities are matched. Critically, when the stable statistics of training mismatched the volatile statistics of testing, cue-based retrieval collapsed, and behavior was dominated by these stability or recency biases. Conversely, learning in a high-entropy, interleaved environment enabled precise, cue-appropriate expression regardless of the testing schedule. These results demonstrate that memory retrieval is not cue-driven but arises from an arbitration process between cues and transition priors. Our findings reveal that memory retrieval involves weighting sensory information against latent priors derived from the history of context transitions. This work provides a unifying theoretical framework for understanding adaptive memory expression, positing that the brain leverages the learned statistical structure of the environment to infer which memory to recall, thereby balancing cue-driven selection with the stability and predictability of past experience. This principle offers a unifying explanation for interference, spontaneous recovery, and the benefits of variable practice, providing a more holistic model of adaptive motor behavior.

">The anterior cingulate cortex drives lateralized age-dependent modulation of claustrum circuits</a></h4>

              
                The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) sends top-down inputs to the claustrum during sensory, motor, and cognitive processing. This ACC input is thought to drive the activation of claustrum neurons which in turn project back to the cortex to help orchestrate cortical networks during demanding cognitive states such as attention. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying ACC-claustrum signaling are not fully understood. Using in vivo single neuron recordings in mice, we show that ACC neuron activation drives a lateralized modulation of claustrum excitability that changes as a function of postnatal age. In adulthood, ACC activation evoked feed-forward inhibition of ipsilateral excitatory claustrum neurons and activation of contralateral excitatory claustrum neurons. Chemogenetic manipulation in adult mice revealed that ipsilateral claustrum inhibition by the ACC was due to feed-forward activation of claustrum parvalbumin inhibitory neurons. However, in neonatal mice, which lack mature parvalbumin interneurons, ACC inputs evoked claustrum excitation. In juvenile mice, the developmental switch from ACC-evoked claustrum excitation to inhibition occurred in parallel with the maturation of claustrum parvalbumin interneurons, thus corroborating the chemogenetic findings. Therefore, this work provides a novel mechanism of cortical control over claustrum activity that is refined during early postnatal life.

">Distinct contributions of hippocampal pathways in learning regularities and exceptions revealed by functional footprints</a></h4>

              
                Fundamental aspects of learning are theorized to be supported by hippocampal pathways: monosynaptic pathway (MSP) extracts regularities whereas trisynaptic pathway (TSP) rapidly encodes exceptional items. Yet, the empirical evidence for the dynamic involvement of MSP and TSP in learning remains elusive. We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging to estimate the end points of MSP- and TSP-related white matter structures (i.e., footprints) within hippocampal subfields and entorhinal cortex. We then measured the activation of pathway-specific footprints with functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants learned novel concepts defined by regularities and exceptions. The functional footprint method revealed links between MSP-related footprint activation and regularity encoding early in learning, and TSP-related footprint activation and exception encoding late in learning. These findings provide novel evidence that learning concept regularities and exceptions is distinctly supported by hippocampal pathways. Pathway footprint approach provides insights into the functional dynamics of the human hippocampus, translating theoretical and computational work into empirically testable questions in humans.

">Inter-individual variability of neurotransmitter receptor and transporter density in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter receptors guide the propagation of signals between brain regions. Mapping receptor distributions in the brain is therefore necessary for understanding how neurotransmitter systems mediate the link between brain structure and function. Normative receptor density can be estimated using group averages from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. However, the generalizability and reliability of group-average receptor maps depends on the inter-individual variability of receptor density, which is currently unknown. Here we collect group standard deviation brain maps of PET-estimated protein abundance for 12 different neurotransmitter receptors and transporters across 7 neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, cannabinoid, and opioid. We illustrate how cortical and subcortical inter-individual variability of receptor and transporter density varies across brain regions and across neurotransmitter systems. We complement inter-individual variability with inter-regional variability, and show that receptors that vary more across brain regions than across individuals also demonstrate greater out-of-sample spatial consistency. Altogether, this work quantifies how receptor systems vary in healthy individuals, and provides a means of assessing the generalizability of PET-derived receptor density quantification.

">Legal but immoral: attitudes toward non-invasive brain stimulation for cognitive enhancement</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive enhancement involves using substances or technologies to improve mental performance in healthy individuals. While methods such as caffeine are widely accepted, others, including prescription stimulants and non-invasive brain stimulation (tDCS), evoke ethical concern. This study examined how university students evaluate three forms of cognitive enhancement (natural, pharmacological, brain stimulation) across five moral domains: academic fairness, free will, naturalness, self-identity, and safety. We also tested how evaluations were shaped by framing (preservation vs. enhancement) and priming (self-affecting vs. non-self-affecting). A total of 449 students completed an online experiment with a 2 by 2 by 3 mixed design, rating enhancement acceptability after reading intervention-specific scenarios. Natural enhancers were judged most positively, followed by brain stimulation and then pharmacological agents. Importantly, although brain stimulation is legal and marketed as non-invasive, it was evaluated more like pharmacological enhancement than natural methods, indicating that legality does not equate to moral acceptability. Framing effects showed that participants were more accepting of enhancement when it was described as preserving ability rather than augmenting it beyond baseline. Priming participants to consider how others use might affect their own outcomes reduced moral acceptability, particularly for pharmacological and brain stimulation methods in the domain of academic fairness. Overall, public attitudes toward enhancement appeared shaped less by legality or objective safety than by intuitive moral reasoning. These findings highlight the importance of adopting pluralistic, context-sensitive approaches to policy and regulation, as student judgments reflect concerns about fairness, authenticity, and competition in academic life.

">Adaptive Eye Movement Behavior for Actions in Younger and Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                Humans typically combine eye and head movements to visually track and interact with moving objects. If the object's trajectory can be predicted, humans can shift gaze to the anticipated object's future location. For instance, when hitting a moving ball, people predictively look at the ball's bouncing location, allowing them to overcome sensorimotor delays that would otherwise limit visual information uptake from that position. Such delays become pronounced with healthy aging, which might drive a behavioral shift towards stronger reliance on predictive gaze allocation to future positions of interest during visuomotor tasks. To investigate this, we examined gaze and hand movements of older and younger adults who played an iPad-based version of the game 'Pong' against an automated opponent. Participants moved a paddle of two different sizes with their finger to intercept a ball moving in two speeds and bouncing off the side walls. We hypothesized that aging would lead to earlier gaze shifts to positions of interest, such as to the final wall bounce location before the ball moved toward the participants' paddle, and to their own paddle around the moment of interception. As expected, both age groups intercepted fewer balls when using smaller paddles. Contrary to our hypothesis, older participants looked later than younger adults to the final wall bounce. However, they shifted their gaze earlier to their own paddle before interception, especially at the beginning of the experiment. This suggests that aging enhances predictive gaze shifts related to the immediate action. While gaze allocation patterns largely overlap between older and younger adults, aging specifically leads to adaptive eye movements just before interacting with the environment.

">Disruption of the developmental factor Otp in the adult forebrain reveals its diverse physiological functions</a></h4>

              
                Orthopedia (Otp) transcription factor is a critical determinant in the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus, and its embryonic deletion results in lethality. Although Otp expression is maintained throughout life, its physiological function in adulthood is not well understood. Here, we generated a forebrain-specific, tamoxifen-inducible, conditional knockout mouse model to investigate the roles of Otp beyond development. Conditional deletion of Otp in two-month-old mice resulted in impaired stress responses, characterized by increased depressive-like behavior and elevated stress-induced cortisol levels. It also led to various metabolic changes, including reduced thyroid hormone levels and body temperature, a higher percentage of fat mass, and diminished responsiveness to ghrelin without affecting food intake, energy expenditure, or body weight. This composite metabolic phenotype was associated with reduced hypothalamic neuropeptides TRH, CRH, AgRP, and NPY expression. Our findings highlight the role of Otp in adult physiological functions as a key neuroendocrine integrator of adaptive stress response and energy balance.

">Nociceptors use multiple neurotransmitters to drive pain</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptors are excitatory neurons that express a range of neuropeptides and have the essential role of detecting noxious mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli. Ablating these neurons profoundly reduces responses to pain. Here we investigated how nociceptive information is transmitted by developing genetic approaches to suppress glutamate transmission and neuropeptide signaling, individually and in combination. Remarkably, many pain responses persisted in mice where either nociceptor glutamate or neuropeptide signaling was blocked. By contrast, mice lacking both glutamate and neuropeptide transmission in nociceptors displayed profound pain insensitivity closely matching the effects of cell ablation. Together our results establish a role for neuropeptides as bone fide pain transmitters and demonstrate redundancy in nociceptor signaling, resolving long-standing questions about how pain is communicated to the brain.

Data were preprocessed and analyzed using the HCP Pipelines. Compared to fixation, both smooth and saccadic tracking elicited significant activation across widespread cortical regions previously reported, along with deactivation in several others. Smooth tracking predominantly activated the occipital visual cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, retroinsular cortex, and postcentral gyrus. Saccadic tracking showed a similar activation–deactivation pattern but with broader cortical involvement, including the medial and basal surfaces of the occipital cortex, intraparietal sulcus, inferior parietal lobule, and the premotor and supplementary oculomotor areas. Subcortically, saccadic tracking involved greater activation of cerebellar lobules (up to VII) and the putamen.

Notably, when memorised content is spatially lateralised, the power of posterior alpha activity exhibits corresponding lateralisation during the retention interval, consistent with the retinotopic organisation of the visual cortex.

These findings position alpha oscillations as a promising target for neuromodulation. In this study, we demonstrate that although alpha frequency is not typically lateralised in a retinotopic manner during working memory retention, such lateralisation can be externally induced. Using alpha closed-loop auditory stimulation targeted to opposite alpha phases on opposite cortices and leveraging the previously demonstrated phase-dependent modulation of alpha oscillations’ frequency by sound, we successfully modulated alpha frequency asymmetrically between the visual cortices.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This commentary reflects three decades of interaction between the Cuban neuroinformatics tradition and the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) framework. From the early development of neurometrics in Cuba to global initiatives like the Global Brain Consortium, our trajectory has paralleled and intersected with that of SPM. We highlight shared commitments to generative modeling, Bayesian inference, and population-level brain mapping, as shaped through collaborations, workshops, and joint theoretical work with Karl Friston and his group. This convergence continues to guide our efforts toward global, open, and explicable neuroscience.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Semantic composition allows us to construct complex meanings (e.g., “dog house”, “house dog”) from simpler constituents (“dog”, “house”). Neuroimaging studies have often relied on high-level contrasts (e.g., meaningful &gt; non-meaningful phrases) to identify brain regions sensitive to composition. However, such an approach is less apt at addressing <span style="font-style:italic;">how</span> composition is carried out, namely what functions best characterize constituents integration. Here, we rely on simple computational models to explicitly characterize alternative compositional operations, and use representational similarity analysis to compare models to target regions of interest. We re-analyze fMRI data aggregated from four published studies (N = 85), all employing two-word combinations but differing in task requirements. Confirmatory and exploratory analyses reveal compositional representations in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA45), even when the task did not require semantic access. These results suggest that BA45 represents combinatorial information automatically across task demands, and further characterize composition as the (symmetric) intersection of constituent features. Additionally, a cluster of compositional representations emerges in the left middle superior temporal sulcus, while semantic, but not compositional, representations are observed in the left angular gyrus. Overall, our work clarifies which brain regions represent semantic information compositionally across contexts and tasks, and qualifies which operations best describe composition.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human auditory system must distinguish relevant sounds from noise. Severe hearing loss can be treated with cochlear implants (CIs), but how the brain adapts to electrical hearing remains unclear. This study examined adaptation to unilateral CI use in the first and seventh months after CI activation using speech comprehension measures and electroencephalography recordings, both during passive listening and an active spatial listening task. Neural phase-locking to amplitude-modulated sounds interacted with time, such that phase-locking longitudinally increased stronger for 40 Hz compared with 4 Hz. In the spatial listening task, the benefit of performing the task with the CI on vs. off was most pronounced when the CI ear was primarily exposed to target speech. Lateralized alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) reliably marked CI users’ focus of spatial attention. Stronger alpha modulation in the hemisphere opposite to the nonimplanted ear indicates an attentional bias toward the acoustically hearing ear. Our findings suggest that adaptation to hearing with a CI is accomplished by dynamic changes in auditory phase locking and a bias in auditory spatial attention.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) has been profoundly influential to neuroimaging as it has fostered rigorous, statistically grounded structure for model-based inferences that have led to mechanistic insights about the human brain over the past 30 years. The statistical constructs shared with the world through SPM have been instrumental for deriving meaning from neuroimaging data; however, they require simplifying assumptions which can provide results that, while statistically sound, may not accurately reflect the mechanisms of brain function. A platform that fosters the exploration of the rich and varying neuronal and physiologic underpinnings of the measured signals and their associations to behavior and physiologic measures needs a different set of tools. These tools, typically developed outside of platforms, allow rapid, iterative hypotheses testing, and flexibility. Rather than primarily working to build tools that account for and normalize sources of variability, platforms would benefit from building more exploratory tools that enable the community to characterize and understand this non-random variability in the signal as it is likely to be brimming with features that could catalyze new directions, as well as enhance the reach of statistical models.</span>
