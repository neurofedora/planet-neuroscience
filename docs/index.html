              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epidemiological and ecological consequences of virus manipulation of host and vector in plant virus transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nik J. Cunniffe, Nick P. Taylor, Frédéric M. Hamelin, Michael J. Jeger</p>

Many plant viruses are transmitted by insect vectors. Transmission can be described as persistent or non-persistent depending on rates of acquisition, retention, and inoculation of virus. Much experimental evidence has accumulated indicating vectors can prefer to settle and/or feed on infected versus noninfected host plants. For persistent transmission, vector preference can also be conditional, depending on the vector’s own infection status. Since viruses can alter host plant quality as a resource for feeding, infection potentially also affects vector population dynamics. Here we use mathematical modelling to develop a theoretical framework addressing the effects of vector preferences for landing, settling and feeding–as well as potential effects of infection on vector population density–on plant virus epidemics. We explore the consequences of preferences that depend on the host (infected or healthy) and vector (viruliferous or nonviruliferous) phenotypes, and how this is affected by the form of transmission, persistent or non-persistent. We show how different components of vector preference have characteristic effects on both the basic reproduction number and the final incidence of disease. We also show how vector preference can induce bistability, in which the virus is able to persist even when it cannot invade from very low densities. Feedbacks between plant infection status, vector population dynamics and virus transmission potentially lead to very complex dynamics, including sustained oscillations. Our work is supported by an interactive interface https://plantdiseasevectorpreference.herokuapp.com/. Our model reiterates the importance of coupling virus infection to vector behaviour, life history and population dynamics to fully understand plant virus epidemics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Realistic retinal modeling unravels the differential role of excitation and inhibition to starburst amacrine cells in direction selectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elishai Ezra-Tsur, Oren Amsalem, Lea Ankri, Pritish Patil, Idan Segev, Michal Rivlin-Etzion</p>

Retinal direction-selectivity originates in starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which display a centrifugal preference, responding with greater depolarization to a stimulus expanding from soma to dendrites than to a collapsing stimulus. Various mechanisms were hypothesized to underlie SAC centrifugal preference, but dissociating them is experimentally challenging and the mechanisms remain debatable. To address this issue, we developed the Retinal Stimulation Modeling Environment (RSME), a multifaceted data-driven retinal model that encompasses detailed neuronal morphology and biophysical properties, retina-tailored connectivity scheme and visual input. Using a genetic algorithm, we demonstrated that spatiotemporally diverse excitatory inputs–sustained in the proximal and transient in the distal processes–are sufficient to generate experimentally validated centrifugal preference in a single SAC. Reversing these input kinetics did not produce any centrifugal-preferring SAC. We then explored the contribution of SAC-SAC inhibitory connections in establishing the centrifugal preference. SAC inhibitory network enhanced the centrifugal preference, but failed to generate it in its absence. Embedding a direction selective ganglion cell (DSGC) in a SAC network showed that the known SAC-DSGC asymmetric connectivity by itself produces direction selectivity. Still, this selectivity is sharpened in a centrifugal-preferring SAC network. Finally, we use RSME to demonstrate the contribution of SAC-SAC inhibitory connections in mediating direction selectivity and recapitulate recent experimental findings. Thus, using RSME, we obtained a mechanistic understanding of SACs’ centrifugal preference and its contribution to direction selectivity.

Assemblies of neurons, called concepts cells, encode acquired concepts in human Medial Temporal Lobe. Those concept cells that are shared between two assemblies have been hypothesized to encode associations between concepts. Here we test this hypothesis in a computational model of attractor neural networks. We find that for concepts encoded in sparse neural assemblies there is a minimal fraction <i>c</i><sub>min</sub> of neurons shared between assemblies below which associations cannot be reliably implemented; and a maximal fraction <i>c</i><sub>max</sub> of shared neurons above which single concepts can no longer be retrieved. In the presence of a periodically modulated background signal, such as hippocampal oscillations, recall takes the form of association chains reminiscent of those postulated by theories of free recall of words. Predictions of an iterative overlap-generating model match experimental data on the number of concepts to which a neuron responds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Unsupervised discovery of dynamic cell phenotypic states from transmitted light movies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Phuc Nguyen, Sylvia Chien, Jin Dai, Raymond J. Monnat Jr, Pamela S. Becker, Hao Yuan Kueh</p>

Identification of cell phenotypic states within heterogeneous populations, along with elucidation of their switching dynamics, is a central challenge in modern biology. Conventional single-cell analysis methods typically provide only indirect, static phenotypic readouts. Transmitted light images, on the other hand, provide direct morphological readouts and can be acquired over time to provide a rich data source for dynamic cell phenotypic state identification. Here, we describe an end-to-end deep learning platform, UPSIDE (Unsupervised Phenotypic State IDEntification), for discovering cell states and their dynamics from transmitted light movies. UPSIDE uses the variational auto-encoder architecture to learn latent cell representations, which are then clustered for state identification, decoded for feature interpretation, and linked across movie frames for transition rate inference. Using UPSIDE, we identified distinct blood cell types in a heterogeneous dataset. We then analyzed movies of patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells, from which we identified stem-cell associated morphological states as well as the transition rates to and from these states. UPSIDE opens up the use of transmitted light movies for systematic exploration of cell state heterogeneity and dynamics in biology and medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Ultradian rhythms of AKT phosphorylation and gene expression emerge in the absence of the circadian clock components Per1 and Per2</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rona Aviram, Vaishnavi Dandavate, Gal Manella, Marina Golik, Gad Asher</p>

Rhythmicity of biological processes can be elicited either in response to environmental cycles or driven by endogenous oscillators. In mammals, the circadian clock drives about 24-hour rhythms of multitude metabolic and physiological processes in anticipation to environmental daily oscillations. Also at the intersection of environment and metabolism is the protein kinase—AKT. It conveys extracellular signals, primarily feeding-related signals, to regulate various key cellular functions. Previous studies in mice identified rhythmicity in AKT activation (pAKT) with elevated levels in the fed state. However, it is still unknown whether rhythmic AKT activation can be driven through intrinsic mechanisms. Here, we inspected temporal changes in pAKT levels both in cultured cells and animal models. In cultured cells, pAKT levels showed circadian oscillations similar to those observed in livers of wild-type mice under free-running conditions. Unexpectedly, in livers of <i>Per1</i>,<i>2</i><sup>−/−</sup> but not of <i>Bmal1</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice we detected ultradian (about 16 hours) oscillations of pAKT levels. Importantly, the liver transcriptome of <i>Per1</i>,<i>2</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice also showed ultradian rhythms, corresponding to pAKT rhythmicity and consisting of AKT-related genes and regulators. Overall, our findings reveal ultradian rhythms in liver gene expression and AKT phosphorylation that emerge in the absence of environmental rhythms and <i>Per1</i>,<i>2</i><sup>−/−</sup> genes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Bisphosphonate drugs have actions in the lung and inhibit the mevalonate pathway in alveolar macrophages</a></h4>

              
                Bisphosphonates drugs target the skeleton and are used globally for the treatment of common bone disorders. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates act by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in bone-resorbing osteoclasts but, surprisingly, also appear to reduce the risk of death from pneumonia. We overturn the long-held belief that these drugs act only in the skeleton and show that a fluorescently labelled bisphosphonate is internalised by alveolar macrophages and large peritoneal macrophages in vivo. Furthermore, a single dose of a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in mice was sufficient to inhibit the mevalonate pathway in tissue-resident macrophages, causing the build-up of a mevalonate metabolite and preventing protein prenylation. Importantly, one dose of bisphosphonate enhanced the immune response to bacterial endotoxin in the lung and increased the level of cytokines and chemokines in bronchoalveolar fluid. These studies suggest that bisphosphonates, as well as preventing bone loss, may boost immune responses to infection in the lung and provide a mechanistic basis to fully examine the potential of bisphosphonates to help combat respiratory infections that cause pneumonia.

                A fundamental unit of neural computation is the action potential. While significant advances have been made in the ability to sample action potentials of large numbers of individual neurons in animal models, translation of these methodologies to humans has been lacking due to clinical time constraints, electrical noise in the operating room, and reliability of the methodology. Here we present a reliable method for intraoperative recording of dozens of neurons in humans using the Neuropixels probe, yielding up to ~100 simultaneously-recorded single-units (n=596 across 11 recordings in 8 participants). Most single-units were active within 1 minute of reaching target depth, compatible with clinical time constraints. Cell pairs active close in time were spatially closer in most recordings, demonstrating the power to resolve complex cortical dynamics. Altogether, this approach provides access to population single-unit activity across the depth of human neocortex at scales previously only accessible in animal models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Information encoded in volumes and areas of dendritic spines is nearly maximal across mammalian brains</a></h4>

              
                Long-term information associated with neuronal memory resides in dendritic spines. However, spines can have a limited size due to metabolic and neuroanatomical constraints, which should effectively limit the amount of encoded information in excitatory synapses. This study investigates how much information can be stored in the sizes of dendritic spines, and whether is it optimal in any sense? It is shown here, using empirical data for several mammalian brains across different regions and physiological conditions, that dendritic spines nearly maximize entropy contained in their volumes and surface areas for a given mean size. This result is essentially independent of the type of a fitting distribution to size data, as both short- and heavy-tailed distributions yield similar nearly 100 % information efficiency in the majority of cases, although heavy-tailed distributions slightly better fit the data. On average, the highest information is contained in spine volume, and the lowest in spine length or spine head diameter. Depending on a species and brain region, a typical spine can encode between 6.1 and 10.8 bits of information in its volume, and 3.1-8.1 bits in its surface area. Our results suggest a universality of entropy maximization in spine volumes and areas, which can be a new principle of memory storing in synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Properties and proximity proteomics of synaptopodin provide insight into the molecular organization of the spine apparatus of dendritic spines</a></h4>

              
                The spine apparatus is a specialization of the neuronal ER in dendritic spines consisting of stacks of interconnected cisterns separated by a dense matrix. Synaptopodin, a specific actin binding protein of the spine apparatus, is essential for its formation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We show that synaptopodin, when expressed in fibroblasts, forms actin-rich structures with connections to the ER, and that an ER-tethered synaptopodin assembles into liquid condensates. We also identified protein neighbors of synaptopodin in spines by in vivo proximity biotinylation. We validated a small subset of such proteins and showed that they co-assemble with synaptopodin in living cells. One of them is Pdlim7, an actin binding protein not previously identified in spines, and we show its precise colocalization with synaptopodin. We suggest that the matrix of the spine apparatus has the property of a liquid protein condensate generated by a multiplicity of low affinity interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Map-independent representation of an aggression-promoting social cue in the main olfactory pathway</a></h4>

              
                While the olfactory system is required for proper social behaviors, the molecular basis for how social cues are detected via the main olfactory pathway of mammals is not well-characterized. Trimethylamine is a volatile, sex-specific odor found in adult male mouse urine that selectively activates main olfactory sensory neurons that express trace amine-associated receptor 5 (TAAR5). Here we show that trimethylamine, acting via TAAR5, elicits state-dependent attraction or aversion in male mice and drives inter-male aggression. Genetic knockout of TAAR5 significantly reduces aggression-related behaviors, while adding trimethylamine augments aggressive behavior towards juvenile males. We further show that transgenic expression of TAAR5 specifically in olfactory sensory neurons rescues aggressive behaviors in knockout mice, despite extensive remapping of TAAR5 projections to the olfactory bulb. Our results identify a specific main olfactory input that detects a prominent male-specific odor to induce inter-male aggression in a mammalian species and reveal that apparently innate behavioral responses are independent of patterned glomerular input to the olfactory bulb.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic inhibition of the dorsal hippocampus CA3 region during early-stage cocaine-memory reconsolidation disrupts subsequent context-induced cocaine seeking in rats</a></h4>

              
                The dorsal hippocampus (DH) is key to the long-term maintenance of cocaine memories following retrieval-induced memory destabilization; even though, it is not the site of protein synthesis-dependent memory reconsolidation. Here, we took advantage of the temporal and spatial specificity of an optogenetic manipulation to examine the role of the cornu ammonis 3 subregion of the DH (dCA3) in early-stage cocaine-memory reconsolidation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats expressing eNpHR3.0 in the DH were trained to self-administer cocaine in a distinct context and underwent extinction training in a different context. Rats then received a 15-min memory-reactivation session, to destabilize cocaine memories and trigger reconsolidation, or remained in their home cages (no-reactivation controls). Optogenetic inhibition of the dCA3 for 1 h immediately, but not 1 h, after memory reactivation resulted in cocaine-memory impairment as indicated by reduction in drug-seeking behavior selectively in the cocaine-paired context 3 d later, at test, relative to responding in no-inhibition, no-reactivation, and no-eNpHR3.0 controls. Cocaine-memory impairment was associated with reduced c-Fos expression, an index of neuronal activation, in the dCA3 stratum lucidum (SL) and stratum pyramidale (SP) at test. Based on these observations and extant literature, we postulate that recurrent circuits in the SP are activated during early-stage memory reconsolidation to maintain labile cocaine memories prior to protein synthesis-dependent restabilization in another brain region, such as the basolateral amygdala. Furthermore, SL and SP interneurons may enhance memory reconsolidation by limiting synaptic noise in the SP and also contribute to recall as elements of the updated cocaine engram or retrieval links.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BDNF-induced BDNF release mediates presynaptic LTP and is regulated by cannabinoids</a></h4>

              
                Although brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its effector, Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), are implicated in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, the precise underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal input region that expresses uniquely high levels of BDNF, repetitive activation of mossy cells (MCs) induces a presynaptic, BDNF/TrkB-dependent form of LTP at MC to granule cell (GC) synapses. Here, we report that activity-induced BDNF release from MC axons in mice elicits postsynaptic BDNF release in a TrkB- and calcium-dependent manner, and that BDNF-induced BDNF release is essential for LTP induction. Suppression of BDNF release by tonic and phasic activity of presynaptic type-1 cannabinoid receptors dampened LTP, revealing an unprecedented role of these receptors in controlling neuropeptide release. Lastly, BDNF-mediated MC-GC LTP can be elicited in vivo. Thus, BDNF-induced BDNF release emerges as a mechanism for activity-dependent LTP that may contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prolactin action is necessary for parental behavior in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Parental care is critical for successful reproduction in mammals. In comparison to maternal care, the neuroendocrine mechanisms supporting paternal care are less well-studied. Laboratory mice show a mating-induced suppression of infanticide (normally observed in virgins) and onset of paternal behavior. Using this model, we sought to investigate whether the hormone prolactin plays a role in paternal behavior, as it does for maternal behavior. First, using c-fos immunoreactivity in Prlr-IRES-Cre-tdtomato reporter mouse sires, we show that the circuitry activated during paternal interactions contains prolactin-responsive neurons, including the medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and medial amygdala. To evaluate whether prolactin action is required for the establishment and display of paternal behavior, we conditionally deleted the prolactin receptor (Prlr) from 3 distinct cell types: glutamatergic, GABAergic, and CaMKII-expressing forebrain neurons. Prlr-deletion from CaMKII-expressing forebrain neurons, but not from glutamatergic or GABAergic cells, resulted in a profound effect on paternal behavior, as none of these males completed the pup retrieval task. Finally, although sires do not show an acute increase in circulating prolactin levels in response to pups, pharmacological blockade of prolactin-release at the time of pup exposure resulted in failure to retrieve pups, similar to when the Prlr was deleted from CaMKII neurons, with prolactin administration rescuing this behavior. Taken together, our data show that paternal behavior in sires is dependent on basal levels of circulating prolactin acting at the Prlr on CaMKII-expressing neurons. These new data in male mice demonstrate that prolactin has a similar action in both sexes to promote parental care.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical glutamatergic projection neuron types contribute to distinct functional subnetworks</a></h4>

              
                The cellular basis of cerebral cortex functional architecture remains not well understood. A major challenge is to monitor and decipher neural network dynamics across broad cortical areas yet with projection neuron (PN) type resolution in real time during behavior. Combining genetic targeting and wide-field imaging, we monitored activity dynamics of subcortical-projecting (PTFezf2) and intratelencephalic-projecting (ITPlxnD1) types across dorsal cortex of mice during multiple brain states and behaviors. ITPlxnD1 and PTFezf2 showed distinct activation patterns during wakeful resting, spontaneous movements, and upon sensory stimulation. Distinct ITPlxnD1 and PTFezf2 subnetworks dynamically tuned to different sensorimotor components of a naturalistic feeding behavior, and optogenetic inhibition of subnetwork nodes disrupted specific behavioral components. ITPlxnD1 and PTFezf2 projection patterns supported their subnetwork activation patterns. Our results suggest that, in addition to the concept of columnar organization, dynamic areal and PN type-specific subnetworks is a key feature of cortical functional architecture linking microcircuit components with global brain networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A meta-analysis of task-based differences in bilingual L1 and L2 language networks</a></h4>

              
                The functional organization of first (L1) and second (L2) language processing in bilinguals remains a topic of great interest to the neurolinguistics community. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies report meaningful differences in the location and extent of hemodynamic changes between tasks performed in the L1 and L2, yet there is no consensus on whether these networks can be considered truly distinct. In part, this may be due to the multiplicity of task designs implemented in such studies, which complicates the interpretation of their findings. This paper compares the results of previous bilingual meta-analyses to a new ALE meta-analysis that categorizes neuroimaging studies by task design. Factors such as the age of L2 acquisition (AoA) and the L2 language proficiency level of participants are also considered. The findings support previous accounts of the effect of participant characteristics on linguistic processing, while at the same time revealing dissociable differences in fMRI activation for L1 and L2 networks within and across tasks that appear independent of these external factors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Narcolepsy and the Dissociation of REM Sleep and Cataplexy through Ambient Temperature Manipulation</a></h4>

              
                Narcolepsy is characterized by increased REM sleep propensity and cataplexy. Although narcolepsy is caused by the selective loss or dysfunction of hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons within the lateral hypothalamus (LH), mechanisms underlying REM sleep propensity and cataplexy remain to be elucidated. We have recently shown that wild type (WT) mice increase REM sleep expression when exposed to thermoneutral ambient temperature (Ta) warming during the light (inactive) phase. We hypothesized that the loss of Hcrt may lead to exaggerated responses with respect to increased REM sleep and cataplexy during Ta warming. To test this hypothesis, Hcrt-KO mice were implanted for chronic sleep recordings and housed in a temperature-controlled cabinet. Sleep-wake expression and both spontaneous cataplexy and food-elicited cataplexy were evaluated at constant Ta and during a Ta manipulation protocol. Here we show several unexpected findings. First, Hcrt-KO mice show opposite circadian patterns with respect to REM sleep responsiveness to thermoneutral Ta warming compared to WT mice. As previously demonstrated, WT mice increased REM sleep when Ta warming is presented during the inactive (light) phase, whereas Hcrt-KO showed a significant decrease in REM sleep expression. In contrast, Hcrt-KO mice increased REM sleep expression upon exposure to Ta warming when presented during the active (dark) phase, a circadian time when WT mice showed no significant changes in REM sleep as a function of Ta. Second, we found that REM sleep and cataplexy can be dissociated through Ta manipulation. Specifically, although Ta warming significantly increased REM sleep expression in Hcrt-KO mice during the active phase, cataplexy bout number and total cataplexy duration significantly decreased. In contrast, cataplexy expression was favoured during Ta cooling when REM sleep expression significantly decreased. Finally, video actigraphy and sleep-wake recordings in Hcrt-KO mice demonstrated that Ta manipulation did not significantly alter waking motor activity patterns or waking or NREM sleep durations. These data suggest that neural circuits gating REM sleep and cataplexy expression can be dissociated with Ta manipulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perception and propagation of activity through the cortical hierarchy is determined by neural variability</a></h4>

              
                The brains of higher organisms are composed of anatomically and functionally distinct regions performing specialised tasks; but regions do not operate in isolation. Orchestration of complex behaviours requires communication between brain regions, but how neural activity dynamics are organised to facilitate reliable transmission is not well understood. We studied this process directly by generating neural activity that propagates between brain regions and drives behaviour, allowing us to assess how populations of neurons in sensory cortex cooperate to transmit information. We achieved this by imaging two hierarchically organised and densely interconnected regions, the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (S1 and S2) in mice while performing two-photon photostimulation of S1 neurons and assigning behavioural salience to the photostimulation. We found that the probability of perception is determined not only by the strength of the photostimulation signal, but also by the variability of S1 neural activity. Therefore, maximising the signal-to-noise ratio of the stimulus representation in cortex is critical to its continued propagation downstream. Further, we show that propagated, behaviourally salient activity elicits balanced, persistent, and generalised activation of the downstream region. Hence, our work adds to existing understanding of cortical function by identifying how population activity is formatted to ensure robust transmission of information, allowing specialised brain regions to communicate and coordinate behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Excitatory effect of biphasic kHz field stimulation on CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices</a></h4>

              
                Background: Electrical stimulation in the kilohertz-frequency range has been successfully used for treatment of various neurological disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying this stimulation are poorly understood. Objective: To study the effect of kilohertz-frequency electric fields on neuronal membrane biophysics we developed a reliable experimental method to measure responses of single neurons to kilohertz field stimulation in brain slice preparations. Methods: In the submerged brain slice pyramidal neurons of the CA1 subfield were recorded in the whole-cell configuration before, during and after stimulation with an external electric field at 2kHz, 5kHz or 10 kHz. Results: Reproducible excitatory changes in rheobase and spontaneous firing were elicited during kHz-field application at all stimulating frequencies. The rheobase only decreased and spontaneous firing either was initiated in silent neurons or became more intense in previously spontaneously active neurons. Response thresholds were higher at higher frequencies. Blockade of glutamatergic synaptic transmission did not alter the magnitude of responses. Inhibitory synaptic input was not changed by kilohertz field stimulation. Conclusion: kHz-frequency current applied in brain tissue has an excitatory effect on pyramidal neurons during stimulation. This effect is more prominent and occurs at a lower stimulus intensity at a frequency of 2kHz as compared to 5kHz and 10kHz.

                The evolution of species involves changes in the timeline of key developmental programs. Among these, neuronal development is considerably prolonged in the human cerebral cortex compared with other mammals, leading to brain neoteny. Here we explore whether mitochondria influence the species-specific properties of cortical neuron maturation. By comparing human and mouse cortical neuronal maturation at high temporal and cell resolution, we found a slower pattern of mitochondria development in human cortical neurons compared with the mouse, together with lower mitochondria metabolic activity, particularly oxidative phosphorylation. Stimulation of mitochondria metabolism in human neurons resulted in accelerated maturation, leading to excitable and complex cells weeks ahead of time. Our data identify mitochondria as important regulators of the pace of neuronal development underlying human-specific features of brain evolution.

                Biological aging is the strongest factor associated with the clinical phenotype of multiple sclerosis (MS). Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) typically presents in the third or fourth decade, while the mean age of presentation of progressive MS (pMS) is 45 years old. Here we show that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), induced by the adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic CD4+ Th17 cells, is more severe, and less like to remit, in middle-aged compared with young adult mice. Donor T cells and neutrophils are more abundant, while B cells are relatively sparse, in central nervous system (CNS) infiltrates of the older mice. Experiments with reciprocal bone marrow chimeras demonstrate that radio-resistant, non-hematopoietic cells play a dominant role in shaping age-related features of the neuroinflammatory response, as well as the clinical course, during EAE. Reminiscent of pMS, EAE in middle-aged adoptive transfer recipients is characterized by widespread microglial activation. Microglia from older mice express a distinctive transcriptomic profile, suggestive of enhanced chemokine synthesis and antigen presentation. Collectively, our findings suggest that drugs that suppress microglial activation, and acquisition or expression of aging-associated properties, may be beneficial in the treatment of progressive forms of inflammatory demyelinating disease.

<p>Glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I–II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. Based on dendritic morphology, we divided them into three and six groups in laminae I–II and III–IV, respectively. At least one type of neurons in laminae III–IV may project its axon into laminae I–II. We also provided experimental evidence indicating that there are glycine-only neurons and axon terminals in laminae I–II.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A growing body of experimental evidence shows that glycinergic inhibition plays vital roles in spinal pain processing. In spite of this, however, our knowledge about the morphology, neurochemical characteristics, and synaptic relations of glycinergic neurons in the spinal dorsal horn is very limited. The lack of this knowledge makes our understanding about the specific contribution of glycinergic neurons to spinal pain processing quite vague. Here we investigated the morphology and neurochemical characteristics of glycinergic neurons in laminae I–IV of the spinal dorsal horn using a GlyT2::CreERT2-tdTomato transgenic mouse line. Confirming previous reports, we show that glycinergic neurons are sparsely distributed in laminae I–II, but their densities are much higher in lamina III and especially in lamina IV. First in the literature, we provide experimental evidence indicating that in addition to neurons in which glycine colocalizes with GABA, there are glycinergic neurons in laminae I–II that do not express GABA and can thus be referred to as glycine-only neurons. According to the shape and size of cell bodies and dendritic morphology, we divided the tdTomato-labeled glycinergic neurons into three and six morphological groups in laminae I–II and laminae III–IV, respectively. We also demonstrate that most of the glycinergic neurons co-express neuronal nitric oxide synthase, parvalbumin, the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, and the retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptor β (RORβ), but there might be others that need further neurochemical characterization. The present findings may foster our understanding about the contribution of glycinergic inhibition to spinal pain processing.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Orexin neurons play an important role in stress-related mental disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety- and depression-related symptoms commonly occur in combination with PTSD. However, the role of the orexin system in mediating alterations in these affective symptoms remains unclear. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. In the present study, we investigated anxiety- and depression-related behavioral changes using the elevated plus maze, the sucrose preference test, and the open field test in male rats with single prolonged stress (SPS) induced-PTSD. The expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the mPFC was detected and quantified by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that the SPS rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. Furthermore, SPS resulted in reductions in the expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and the increased the expression of OX1R in the mPFC. The intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated behavioral changes in SPS rats and partly restored the increased levels of OX1R in the mPFC. These results suggest that the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in PTSD.</p>

<p>Aromatase neurons are distributed in clustered populations primarily in a network of brain regions (red) devoted to social behavior. Out of all potential sources of aromatase neurons, only the ventral medial amygdala projects back to the accessory olfactory bulb. The population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the ventral medial amygdala also expresses ERα and displays two sex differences: (1) aromatase-expressing neurons are larger in females; (2) there are more aromatase-expressing neurons in male mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) plays a critical role in classifying pheromonal signals. Here we identify two previously undescribed sources of aromatase signaling in the AOB: (1) a population of aromatase-expressing neurons in the AOB itself; (2) a tract of aromatase-expressing axons which originate in the ventral medial amygdala (MEA) and terminate in the AOB. Using a retrograde tracer in conjunction with a transgenic strategy to label aromatase-expressing neurons throughout the brain, we found that a single contiguous population of neurons in the ventral MEA provides the only significant feedback by aromatase-expressing neurons to the AOB. This population expresses the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and displayed anatomical sex differences in the number of neurons (higher in male mice) and the size of cell bodies (larger in females). Given the previously established relationship between aromatase expression, estrogen signaling, and the function of sexually dimorphic circuits, we suggest that this feedback population is well-positioned to provide neuroendocrine feedback to modulate sensory processing of social stimuli in the AOB.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mutations in genes encoding Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α1, α2, and α3 subunits cause a wide range of disabling neurological disorders, and dysfunction of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase may contribute to neuronal injury in stroke and dementia. To better understand the pathogenesis of these diseases, it is important to determine the expression patterns of the different Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase subunits within the brain and among specific cell types. Using two available scRNA-Seq databases from the adult mouse nervous system, we examined the mRNA expression patterns of the different isoforms of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase α, β and <i>Fxyd</i> subunits at the single-cell level among brain regions and various neuronal populations. We subsequently identified specific types of neurons enriched with transcripts for α1 and α3 isoforms and elaborated how α3-expressing neuronal populations govern cerebellar neuronal circuits. We further analyzed the co-expression network for α1 and α3 isoforms, highlighting the genes that positively correlated with α1 and α3 expression. The top 10 genes for α1 were <i>Chn2</i>, <i>Hpcal1</i>, <i>Nrgn</i>, <i>Neurod1</i>, <i>Selm</i>, <i>Kcnc1</i>, <i>Snrk</i>, <i>Snap25</i>, <i>Ckb</i> and <i>Ccndbp1</i> and for α3 were <i>Sorcs3</i>, <i>Eml5</i>, <i>Neurod2</i>, <i>Ckb</i>, <i>Tbc1d4</i>, <i>Ptprz1</i>, <i>Pvrl1</i>, <i>Kirrel3</i>, <i>Pvalb</i>, and <i>Asic2</i>.</p>

     alt="Constitutive tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-deficiency causes a reduction in spine density in mouse dentate granule cells accompanied by homeostatic adaptations of spine head size"/>
<p>TNF plays a role in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the CNS. To investigate whether constitutive TNF-deficiency affects the number and geometry of dendritic spines, dentate granule cells of TNF-deficient mice and controls were intracellularly filled and immunolabeled for the plasticity-related protein Synaptopodin (SP), which marks strong and stable spines. Spine head area, density, presence of SP and SP cluster size were analyzed blindly. Constitutively TNF-deficient granule cells had ∼20% fewer spines compared to controls and exhibited a homeostatic increase in head size of large SP+ spines. These changes are similar to those reported after entorhinal denervation of granule cells.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The majority of excitatory synapses terminating on cortical neurons are found on dendritic spines. The geometry of spines, in particular the size of the spine head, tightly correlates with the strength of the excitatory synapse formed with the spine. Under conditions of synaptic plasticity, spine geometry may change, reflecting functional adaptations. Since the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to influence synaptic transmission as well as Hebbian and homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity, we speculated that TNF-deficiency may cause concomitant structural changes at the level of dendritic spines. To address this question, we analyzed spine density and spine head area of Alexa568-filled granule cells in the dentate gyrus of adult C57BL/6J and TNF-deficient (TNF-KO) mice. Tissue sections were double-stained for the actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein synaptopodin (SP), a molecular marker for strong and stable spines. Dendritic segments of TNF-deficient granule cells exhibited ∼20% fewer spines in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus compared to controls, indicating a reduced afferent innervation. Of note, these segments also had larger spines containing larger SP-clusters. This pattern of changes is strikingly similar to the one seen after denervation-associated spine loss following experimental entorhinal denervation of granule cells: Denervated granule cells increase the SP-content and strength of their remaining spines to homeostatically compensate for those that were lost. Our data suggest a similar compensatory mechanism in TNF-deficient granule cells in response to a reduction in their afferent innervation.</p>

     alt="The complex synaptic pathways onto a looming-detector neuron revealed using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy"/>
<p>We traced two trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons, in separate larval locusts from their synapses with the LGMD1 in the lobula complex (LOX) through the second optic chiasm (OCH2) back into the medulla. In the medulla, we found not only downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron but also a feedback loop with TmA neurons making outputs and receiving inputs.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability of locusts to detect looming stimuli and avoid collisions or predators depends on a neuronal circuit in the locust's optic lobe. Although comprehensively studied for over three decades, there are still major questions about the computational steps of this circuit. We used fourth instar larvae of <i>Locusta migratoria</i> to describe the connection between the lobula giant movement detector 1 (LGMD1) neuron in the lobula complex and the upstream neuropil, the medulla. Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) was used to characterize the morphology of the connecting neurons termed trans-medullary afferent (TmA) neurons and their synaptic connectivity. This enabled us to trace neurons over several hundred micrometers between the medulla and the lobula complex while identifying their synapses. We traced two different TmA neurons, each from a different individual, from their synapses with the LGMD in the lobula complex up into the medulla and describe their synaptic relationships. There is not a simple downstream transmission of the signal from a lamina neuron onto these TmA neurons; there is also a feedback loop in place with TmA neurons making outputs as well as receiving inputs. More than one type of neuron shapes the signal of the TmA neurons in the medulla. We found both columnar and trans-columnar neurons connected with the traced TmA neurons in the medulla. These findings indicate that there are computational steps in the medulla that have not been included in models of the neuronal pathway for looming detection.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic distribution and inferior colliculus projection pattern of inhibitory and excitatory cell types in the lateral superior olive of Mongolian gerbils"/>
<p>In situ hybridization was used to identify inhibitory and excitatory principal neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) of Mongolian gerbil. Inhibitory LSO neurons were less numerous and projected contralaterally. One third of excitatory neurons projected ipsilaterally and were biased to the low-frequency limb of the LSO. This projection appears species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sound localization critically relies on brainstem neurons that compare information from the two ears. The conventional role of the lateral superior olive (LSO) is extraction of intensity differences; however, it is increasingly clear that relative timing, especially of transients, is also an important function. Cellular diversity within the LSO that is not well understood may underlie its multiple roles. There are glycinergic inhibitory and glutamatergic excitatory principal neurons in the LSO, however, there is some disagreement regarding their relative distribution and projection pattern. Here we employ in situ hybridization to definitively identify transmitter types combined with retrograde labeling of projections to the inferior colliculus (IC) to address these questions. Excitatory LSO neurons were more numerous (76%) than inhibitory ones. A smaller proportion of inhibitory neurons were IC-projecting (45% vs. 64% for excitatory) suggesting that inhibitory LSO neurons may have more projections to other regions such the lateral lemniscus or more distributed IC projections. Inhibitory LSO neurons almost exclusively projected ipsilaterally making up a sizeable proportion (41%) of the transmitter type-labeled ipsilateral IC projection from LSO and exhibited a moderate low frequency bias (10% difference H-L). Two thirds of excitatory neurons projected contralaterally and had a slight high frequency bias (4%). One third of excitatory LSO neurons projected ipsilaterally to the IC and these cells were strongly biased toward the low frequency limb of the LSO (37%). This projection appears to be species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing suggesting that it may be a specialization for such ability.</p>

     alt="The RNA-binding protein and stress granule component ATAXIN-2 is expressed in mouse and human tissues associated with glaucoma pathogenesis"/>
<p>The RNA-binding protein Ataxin 2 (ATXN2) is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and vision loss. Retinal ATXN2 is confined to spiking neurons (ganglion cells and amacrine cells) and largely absent from photoreceptors/bipolar cells and glia. Prominent expression in the trabecular meshwork and the ciliary body suggests relevance to glaucoma.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Polyglutamine repeat expansions in the <i>Ataxin-</i>2 (<i>ATXN</i>2) gene were first implicated in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2, a disease associated with degeneration of motor neurons and Purkinje cells. Recent studies linked single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene to elevated intraocular pressure in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG); yet, the localization of ATXN2 across glaucoma-relevant tissues of the vertebrate eye has not been thoroughly examined. This study characterizes ATXN2 expression in the mouse and human retina, and anterior eye, using an antibody validated in ATXN2<sup>−/−</sup> retinas. ATXN2-ir was localized to cytosolic sub compartments in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata and proximal dendrites in addition to GABAergic, glycinergic, and cholinergic amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and displaced amacrine cells. Human, but not mouse retinas showed modest immunolabeling of bipolar cells. ATXN2 immunofluorescence was prominent in the trabecular meshwork and pigmented and nonpigmented cells of the ciliary body, with analyses of primary human trabecular meshwork cells confirming the finding. The expression of ATXN2 in key POAG-relevant ocular tissues supports the potential role in autophagy and stress granule formation in response to ocular hypertension.</p>

     alt="Change in the neurochemical signature and morphological development of the parvocellular isthmic projection to the avian tectum"/>
<p>The “paintbrush” axon terminals from neurons of the nucleus isthmi parvocellularis (Ipc) exert a powerful boosting effect upon the ascending visual transmission in the optic tectum of birds. Although classically considered a cholinergic nucleus, Ipc neurons in adult chicks express VGLUT2 instead of VAChT. Performing in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in chick embryos, the authors find that both vesicular transporters are strongly expressed in Ipc neurons throughout development, along with other cholinergic markers, but there is a marked decrease in VAChT expression before hatching. Ex vivo deposits of tracer crystals and intracellular fillings reveal that Ipc axons exhibit conspicuous morphological transformations until late in development, suggesting that the presumptive dual vesicular transmitter release might be related to the growing and remodeling of this complex axon.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons can change their classical neurotransmitters during ontogeny, sometimes going through stages of dual release. Here, we explored the development of the neurotransmitter identity of neurons of the avian nucleus isthmi parvocellularis (Ipc), whose axon terminals are retinotopically arranged in the optic tectum (TeO) and exert a focal gating effect upon the ascending transmission of retinal inputs. Although cholinergic and glutamatergic markers are both found in Ipc neurons and terminals of adult pigeons and chicks, the mRNA expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, VAChT, is weak or absent. To explore how the Ipc neurotransmitter identity is established during ontogeny, we analyzed the expression of mRNAs coding for cholinergic (ChAT, VAChT, and CHT) and glutamatergic (VGluT2 and VGluT3) markers in chick embryos at different developmental stages. We found that between E12 and E18, Ipc neurons expressed all cholinergic mRNAs and also VGluT2 mRNA; however, from E16 through posthatch stages, VAChT mRNA expression was specifically diminished. Our ex vivo deposits of tracer crystals and intracellular filling experiments revealed that Ipc axons exhibit a mature paintbrush morphology late in development, experiencing marked morphological transformations during the period of presumptive dual vesicular transmitter release. Additionally, although ChAT protein immunoassays increasingly label the growing Ipc axon, this labeling was consistently restricted to sparse portions of the terminal branches. Combined, these results suggest that the synthesis of glutamate and acetylcholine, and their vesicular release, is complexly linked to the developmental processes of branching, growing and remodeling of these unique axons.</p>

<p>In the common marmoset, detailed morphological analysis of 3D-reconstructed astrocytes residing in vocal production circuits revealed that, in general, cortical astrocytes are structurally more complex than those residing within midbrain regions. We hypothesize that this morphological complexity of cortical astrocytes reflects their function in providing neuronal support or modulation of vocalization.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes, the star-shaped glial cells, are the most abundant non-neuronal cell population in the central nervous system. They play a key role in modulating activities of neural networks, including those involved in complex motor behaviors. Common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus)</i>, the most vocal non-human primate (NHP), have been used to study the physiology of vocalization and social vocal production. However, the neural circuitry involved in vocal production is not fully understood. In addition, even less is known about the involvement of astrocytes in this circuit. To understand the role, that astrocytes may play in the complex behavior of vocalization, the initial step may be to study their structural properties in the cortical and subcortical regions that are known to be involved in vocalization. Here, in the common marmoset, we identify all astrocytic subtypes seen in other primate's brains, including intralaminar astrocytes. In addition, we reveal detailed structural characteristics of astrocytes and perform morphometric analysis of astrocytes residing in the cortex and midbrain regions that are associated with vocal production. We found that cortical astrocytes in these regions illustrate a higher level of complexity when compared to those in the midbrain. We hypothesize that this complexity that is expressed in cortical astrocytes may reflect their functions to meet the metabolic/structural needs of these regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Drug-Induced Hyperglycemia as a Potential Contributor to Translational Failure of Uncompetitive NMDA Receptor Antagonists</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hyperglycemia is a comorbidity in 60&ndash;80% of stroke patients; nevertheless, neuroprotective drugs like NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonists are typically assessed in normoglycemic animals at the preclinical stage before they are approved to enter clinical trials. Interestingly, as a possible explanation for the translational failure of NMDAR antagonists, it was recently reported that stroke occurring during nighttime causes smaller infarctions in rodents and therefore has a smaller window for neuroprotection. To investigate why stroke occurring during different circadian phases confers a difference in severity, we reanalyzed the published source data and found that some mice that were used in the daytime have higher blood glucose than mice that were used in the nighttime. We then repeated the experiments but found no difference in blood glucose concentration or infarct volume regardless of the circadian phase during which stroke occurs. On the other hand, induction of hyperglycemia by glucose injection reproducibly increased stroke severity. Moreover, although hyperglycemia increases infarction volume, which presumably would provide a larger window for neuroprotection, uncompetitive NMDAR antagonists were unexpectedly found to exacerbate stroke outcome by worsening hyperglycemia. Taken together, our new data and reanalysis of the published source data suggested that blood glucose during stroke, rather than the circadian phase during which stroke occurs, affects the size of the ischemic infarction; moreover, we have revealed drug-induced hyperglycemia as a potential reason for the translational failure of uncompetitive NMDAR antagonists. Future trials for this class of neuroprotective drugs should monitor patients&rsquo; blood glucose at enrollment and exclude hyperglycemic patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The automatic parameter-exploration with a machine-learning-like approach: Powering the evolutionary modeling on the origin of life</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuzhen Liang, Chunwu Yu, Wentao Ma</p>

The origin of life involved complicated evolutionary processes. Computer modeling is a promising way to reveal relevant mechanisms. However, due to the limitation of our knowledge on prebiotic chemistry, it is usually difficult to justify parameter-setting for the modeling. Thus, typically, the studies were conducted in a reverse way: the parameter-space was explored to find those parameter values “supporting” a hypothetical scene (that is, leaving the parameter-justification a later job when sufficient knowledge is available). Exploring the parameter-space manually is an arduous job (especially when the modeling becomes complicated) and additionally, difficult to characterize as regular “Methods” in a paper. Here we show that a machine-learning-like approach may be adopted, automatically optimizing the parameters. With this efficient parameter-exploring approach, the evolutionary modeling on the origin of life would become much more powerful. In particular, based on this, it is expected that more near-reality (complex) models could be introduced, and thereby theoretical research would be more tightly associated with experimental investigation in this field–hopefully leading to significant steps forward in respect to our understanding on the origin of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The quantitative basis for the redistribution of immobile bacterial lipoproteins to division septa</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lara Connolley, Joanna Szczepaniak, Colin Kleanthous, Seán M. Murray</p>

The spatial localisation of proteins is critical for most cellular function. In bacteria, this is typically achieved through capture by established landmark proteins. However, this requires that the protein is diffusive on the appropriate timescale. It is therefore unknown how the localisation of effectively immobile proteins is achieved. Here, we investigate the localisation to the division site of the slowly diffusing lipoprotein Pal, which anchors the outer membrane to the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. While the proton motive force-linked TolQRAB system is known to be required for this repositioning, the underlying mechanism is unresolved, especially given the very low mobility of Pal. We present a quantitative, mathematical model for Pal relocalisation in which dissociation of TolB-Pal complexes, powered by the proton motive force across the inner membrane, leads to the net transport of Pal along the outer membrane and its deposition at the division septum. We fit the model to experimental measurements of protein mobility and successfully test its predictions experimentally against mutant phenotypes. Our model not only explains a key aspect of cell division in Gram-negative bacteria, but also presents a physical mechanism for the transport of low-mobility proteins that may be applicable to multi-membrane organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Motif-pattern dependence of biomolecular phase separation driven by specific interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Benjamin G. Weiner, Andrew G. T. Pyo, Yigal Meir, Ned S. Wingreen</p>

Eukaryotic cells partition a wide variety of important materials and processes into biomolecular condensates—phase-separated droplets that lack a membrane. In addition to nonspecific electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions, phase separation also depends on specific binding motifs that link together constituent molecules. Nevertheless, few rules have been established for how these ubiquitous specific, saturating, motif-motif interactions drive phase separation. By integrating Monte Carlo simulations of lattice-polymers with mean-field theory, we show that the sequence of heterotypic binding motifs strongly affects a polymer’s ability to phase separate, influencing both phase boundaries and condensate properties (e.g. viscosity and polymer diffusion). We find that sequences with large blocks of single motifs typically form more inter-polymer bonds, which promotes phase separation. Notably, the sequence of binding motifs influences phase separation primarily by determining the conformational entropy of self-bonding by single polymers. This contrasts with systems where the molecular architecture primarily affects the energy of the dense phase, providing a new entropy-based mechanism for the biological control of phase separation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modeling CRISPR gene drives for suppression of invasive rodents using a supervised machine learning framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel E. Champer, Nathan Oakes, Ronin Sharma, Pablo García-Díaz, Jackson Champer, Philipp W. Messer</p>

Invasive rodent populations pose a threat to biodiversity across the globe. When confronted with these invaders, native species that evolved independently are often defenseless. CRISPR gene drive systems could provide a solution to this problem by spreading transgenes among invaders that induce population collapse, and could be deployed even where traditional control methods are impractical or prohibitively expensive. Here, we develop a high-fidelity model of an island population of invasive rodents that includes three types of suppression gene drive systems. The individual-based model is spatially explicit, allows for overlapping generations and a fluctuating population size, and includes variables for drive fitness, efficiency, resistance allele formation rate, as well as a variety of ecological parameters. The computational burden of evaluating a model with such a high number of parameters presents a substantial barrier to a comprehensive understanding of its outcome space. We therefore accompany our population model with a meta-model that utilizes supervised machine learning to approximate the outcome space of the underlying model with a high degree of accuracy. This enables us to conduct an exhaustive inquiry of the population model, including variance-based sensitivity analyses using tens of millions of evaluations. Our results suggest that sufficiently capable gene drive systems have the potential to eliminate island populations of rodents under a wide range of demographic assumptions, though only if resistance can be kept to a minimal level. This study highlights the power of supervised machine learning to identify the key parameters and processes that determine the population dynamics of a complex evolutionary system.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is increasing evidence for the important role of gut microbiota (GMB) in the development and progression of neurologic pathologies. Some studies have shown that modifying the microbiome profile can confer benefits to patients. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a common occurrence in the general population. Although most patients recover, in a minority, disabling symptoms can persist for several months. We carried out a review of the literature to assess the effect of mTBI on GMB and to determine whether alleviating dysbiosis can improve clinical outcomes in mTBI patients. We performed searches in Medline/PubMed and Embase using the keywords “MTBI” AND “microbiome” OR “microbiota”. Additional articles were identified by manual searches and using the Google search engine. In animal models, a clear perturbation of GMB was reported following TBI and probiotic supplementation (<i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i> or <i>Clostridium butyricum</i>) improved neurologic function. There were no studies on changes in GMB after mTBI in humans; however, pre- or probiotic supplementation reduced the infection rate in patients with severe TBI and shortened the time spent in the intensive care unit without conferring any neurologic benefits. Thus, although the findings from animal models are promising, clinical studies are needed to determine whether therapeutic strategies that restore gut microbiome profile can improve long-term outcomes of patients with mTBI.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The associative network of hippocampal CA3 is thought to contribute to rapid formation of contextual memory from one-trial learning, but the network mechanisms underlying decorrelation of neuronal ensembles in CA3 is largely unknown. Kv1.2 expressions in rodent CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) are polarized to distal apical dendrites, and its downregulation specifically enhances dendritic responses to perforant pathway (PP) synaptic inputs. We found that haploinsufficiency of Kv1.2 (<i>Kcna2</i>+/−) in CA3-PCs, but not Kv1.1 (<i>Kcna1</i>+/−), lowers the threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP) at PP-CA3 synapses, and that the <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice are normal in discrimination of distinct contexts but impaired in discrimination of similar but slightly distinct contexts. We further examined the neuronal ensembles in CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG), which represent the two similar contexts using in situ hybridization of immediate early genes, Homer1a and Arc. The size and overlap of CA3 ensembles activated by the first visit to the similar contexts were not different between wild type and <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice, but these ensemble parameters diverged over training days between genotypes, suggesting that abnormal plastic changes at PP-CA3 synapses of <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice is responsible for the impaired pattern separation. Unlike CA3, DG ensembles were not different between two genotype mice. The DG ensembles were already separated on the first day, and their overlap did not further evolve. Eventually, the <i>Kcna2</i>+/− mice exhibited larger CA3 ensemble size and overlap upon retrieval of two contexts, compared to wild type or <i>Kcna1</i>+/− mice. These results suggest that sparse LTP at PP-CA3 synapse probably supervised by mossy fiber inputs is essential for gradual decorrelation of CA3 ensembles.</p>

<p>Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique with advantages of high spatial precision and ability to target deep brain regions. This study aimed to develop a TUS protocol to effectively induce brain plasticity in human subjects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An 80 s train of theta burst patterned TUS (tbTUS), regularly patterned TUS (rTUS) with the same sonication duration and sham tbTUS were delievered to the motor cortex in healthy subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to examine changes in corticospinal excitability, intracortical inhibition and facilitation, and the site of plasticity induction. The effects of motor cortical tbTUS on a visuo-motor task and the effects of occipital cortex tbTUS on motor cortical excitability were also tested.</p>

<p>The tbTUS produced consistent increase in corticospinal excitability for at least 30 minutes while rTUS and sham tbTUS produced no significant change. tbTUS decreased short-interval intracortical inhibiton and increased intracortical facilitation. The effects of TMS in different current directions suggested that the site of the plastic changes was within the motor cortex. tbTUS to the occipital cortex did not change motor cortical excitability. Motor cortical tbTUS shortened movement time in a visuo-motor task.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>tbTUS is a novel and efficient paradigm to induce cortical plasticity in human. It has the potential to be developed for neuromodulation treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders, and to advance neuroscience research.</p>

                In the gut, coordinated cell interactions regulate tissue repair and immunity. How enteric glial cells (EGCs) mediate these processes remained elusive. In a recent paper, Progatzky et al. demonstrate that EGCs interact with immune and mesothelial cells under homeostasis and helminth infection, revealing an indispensable role of an interferon-γ (IFNγ)-EGC-CXCL10 axis in tissue repair.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatial tuning of face part representations within face-selective areas revealed by high-field fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Regions sensitive to specific object categories as well as organized spatial patterns sensitive to different features have been found across the whole ventral temporal cortex (VTC). However, it is unclear that within each object category region, how specific feature representations are organized to support object identification. Would object features, such as object parts, be represented in fine-scale spatial tuning within object category-specific regions? Here, we used high-field 7T fMRI to examine the spatial tuning to different face parts within each face-selective region. Our results show consistent spatial tuning of face parts across individuals that within right posterior fusiform face area (pFFA) and right occipital face area (OFA), the posterior portion of each region was biased to eyes, while the anterior portion was biased to mouth and chin stimuli. Our results demonstrate that within the occipital and fusiform face processing regions, there exist systematic spatial tuning to different face parts that support further computation combining them.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The anterior paired lateral neuron normalizes odour-evoked activity in the Drosophila mushroom body calyx</a></h4>

              
                To identify and memorize discrete but similar environmental inputs, the brain needs to distinguish between subtle differences of activity patterns in defined neuronal populations. The Kenyon cells of the <i>Drosophila </i>adult mushroom body (MB) respond sparsely to complex olfactory input, a property that is thought to support stimuli discrimination in the MB. To understand how this property emerges, we investigated the role of the inhibitory anterior paired lateral neuron (APL) in the input circuit of the MB, the calyx. Within the calyx, presynaptic boutons of projection neurons (PNs) form large synaptic microglomeruli (MGs) with dendrites of postsynaptic Kenyon cells (KCs). Combining EM data analysis and <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging, we show that APL, via inhibitory and reciprocal synapses targeting both PN boutons and KC dendrites, normalizes odour-evoked representations in MGs of the calyx. APL response scales with the PN input strength and is regionalized around PN input distribution. Our data indicate that the formation of a sparse code by the Kenyon cells requires APL-driven normalization of their MG postsynaptic responses. This work provides experimental insights on how inhibition shapes sensory information representation in a higher brain centre, thereby supporting stimuli discrimination and allowing for efficient associative memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular structures and conformations of protocadherin-15 and its complexes on stereocilia elucidated by cryo-electron tomography</a></h4>

              
                Mechanosensory transduction (MT), the conversion of mechanical stimuli into electrical signals, underpins hearing and balance and is carried out within hair cells in the inner ear. Hair cells harbor actin-filled stereocilia, arranged in rows of descending heights, where the tips of stereocilia are connected to their taller neighbors by a filament composed of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), deemed the ‘tip link’. Tension exerted on the tip link opens an ion channel at the tip of the shorter stereocilia, thus converting mechanical force into an electrical signal. While biochemical and structural studies have provided insights into the molecular composition and structure of isolated portions of the tip link, the architecture, location and conformational states of intact tip links, on stereocilia, remains unknown. Here we report <i>in situ</i> cryo-electron microscopy imaging of the tip link in mouse stereocilia. We observe individual PCDH15 molecules at the tip and shaft of stereocilia and determine their stoichiometry, conformational heterogeneity, and their complexes with other filamentous proteins, perhaps including CDH23. The PCDH15 complexes occur in clusters, frequently with more than one copy of PCDH15 at the tip of stereocilia, suggesting that tip links might consist of more than one copy of PCDH15 complexes and, by extension, might include multiple MT complexes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Partial connectomes of labeled dopaminergic circuits reveal non-synaptic communication and axonal remodeling after exposure to cocaine</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic (DA) neurons exert profound influences on behavior including addiction. However, how DA axons communicate with target neurons and how those communications change with drug exposure remains poorly understood. We leverage cell type-specific labeling with large volume serial electron microscopy to detail DA connections in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) before and after exposure to cocaine. We find that individual DA axons contain different varicosity types based on their vesicle contents. Spatially ordering along individual axons further suggests that varicosity types are non-randomly organized. DA axon varicosities rarely make specific synapses (&lt;2%, 6/410), but instead are more likely to form spinule-like structures (15%, 61/410) with neighboring neurons. Days after a brief exposure to cocaine, DA axons were extensively branched relative to controls, formed blind-ended ‘bulbs’ filled with mitochondria, and were surrounded by elaborated glia. Finally, mitochondrial lengths increased by ~2.2 times relative to control only in DA axons and NAc spiny dendrites after cocaine exposure. We conclude that DA axonal transmission is unlikely to be mediated via classical synapses in the NAc and that the major locus of anatomical plasticity of DA circuits after exposure to cocaine are large-scale axonal re-arrangements with correlated changes in mitochondria.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">aCPSF1 cooperates with terminator U-tract to dictate archaeal transcription termination efficacy</a></h4>

              
                Recently, aCPSF1 was reported to function as the long-sought global transcription termination factor of archaea; however, the working mechanism remains elusive. This work, through analyzing transcript-3′end-sequencing data of <i>Methanococcus maripaludis</i>, found genome-wide positive correlations of both the terminator uridine(U)-tract and aCPSF1 with hierarchical transcription termination efficacies (TTEs). In vitro assays determined that aCPSF1 specifically binds to the terminator U-tract with U-tract number-related binding affinity, and in vivo assays demonstrated the two elements are indispensable in dictating high TTEs, revealing that aCPSF1 and the terminator U-tract cooperatively determine high TTEs. The N-terminal KH domains equip aCPSF1 with specific-binding capacity to terminator U-tract and the aCPSF1-terminator U-tract cooperation; while the nuclease activity of aCPSF1 was also required for TTEs. aCPSF1 also guarantees the terminations of transcripts with weak intrinsic terminator signals. aCPSF1 orthologs from Lokiarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota exhibited similar U-tract cooperation in dictating TTEs. Therefore, aCPSF1 and the intrinsic U-rich terminator could work in a noteworthy two-in-one termination mode in archaea, which may be widely employed by archaeal phyla; using one trans-action factor to recognize U-rich terminator signal and cleave transcript 3′-end, the archaeal aCPSF1-dependent transcription termination may represent a simplified archetypal mode of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II termination machinery.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Learning developmental mode dynamics from single-cell trajectories</a></h4>

              
                Embryogenesis is a multiscale process during which developmental symmetry breaking transitions give rise to complex multicellular organisms. Recent advances in high-resolution live-cell microscopy provide unprecedented insights into the collective cell dynamics at various stages of embryonic development. This rapid experimental progress poses the theoretical challenge of translating high-dimensional imaging data into predictive low-dimensional models that capture the essential ordering principles governing developmental cell migration in complex geometries. Here, we combine mode decomposition ideas that have proved successful in condensed matter physics and turbulence theory with recent advances in sparse dynamical systems inference to realize a computational framework for learning quantitative continuum models from single-cell imaging data. Considering pan-embryo cell migration during early gastrulation in zebrafish as a widely studied example, we show how cell trajectory data on a curved surface can be coarse-grained and compressed with suitable harmonic basis functions. The resulting low-dimensional representation of the collective cell dynamics enables a compact characterization of developmental symmetry breaking and the direct inference of an interpretable hydrodynamic model, which reveals similarities between pan-embryo cell migration and active Brownian particle dynamics on curved surfaces. Due to its generic conceptual foundation, we expect that mode-based model learning can help advance the quantitative biophysical understanding of a wide range of developmental structure formation processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Delilah, prospero, and D-Pax2 constitute a gene regulatory network essential for the development of functional proprioceptors</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated animal locomotion depends on the development of functional proprioceptors. While early cell-fate determination processes are well characterized, little is known about the terminal differentiation of cells within the proprioceptive lineage and the genetic networks that control them. In this work we describe a gene regulatory network consisting of three transcription factors–Prospero (Pros), D-Pax2, and Delilah (Dei)–that dictates two alternative differentiation programs within the proprioceptive lineage in <i>Drosophila</i>. We show that D-Pax2 and Pros control the differentiation of cap versus scolopale cells in the chordotonal organ lineage by, respectively, activating and repressing the transcription of <i>dei</i>. Normally, D-Pax2 activates the expression of <i>dei</i> in the cap cell but is unable to do so in the scolopale cell where Pros is co-expressed. We further show that D-Pax2 and Pros exert their effects on <i>dei</i> transcription via a 262 bp chordotonal-specific enhancer in which two D-Pax2- and three Pros-binding sites were identified experimentally. When this enhancer was removed from the fly genome, the cap- and ligament-specific expression of <i>dei</i> was lost, resulting in loss of chordotonal organ functionality and defective larval locomotion. Thus, coordinated larval locomotion depends on the activity of a <i>dei</i> enhancer that integrates both activating and repressive inputs for the generation of a functional proprioceptive organ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diversity of microglial transcriptional responses during opioid exposure and neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Microglia take on an altered morphology during chronic opioid treatment. This morphological change is broadly used to identify the activated microglial state associated with opioid side effects, including tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). Following chronic opioid treatment and peripheral nerve injury (PNI) microglia in the spinal cord display similar morphological responses. Consistent with this observation, functional studies have suggested that microglia activated by PNI or opioids engage common molecular mechanisms to induce hypersensitivity. Here we conducted deep RNA sequencing of acutely isolated spinal cord microglia from male mice to comprehensively interrogate transcriptional states and mechanistic commonality between multiple OIH and PNI models. Following PNI, we identify a common early proliferative transcriptional event across models that precedes the upregulation of histological markers of activation, followed by a delayed and injury-specific transcriptional response. Strikingly, we found no such transcriptional responses associated with opioid-induced microglial activation, consistent with histological data indicating that microglia number remain stable during morphine treatment. Collectively, these results reveal the diversity of pain-associated microglial transcriptomes and point towards the targeting of distinct insult-specific microglial responses to treat OIH, PNI, or other CNS pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Landscape of human spinal cord cell type diversity at midgestation</a></h4>

              
                Understanding spinal cord generation and assembly is essential to elucidate how motor behavior is controlled and how disorders arise. The cellular landscape of the human spinal cord remains, however, insufficiently explored. Here, we profiled the midgestation human spinal cord with single cell-resolution and discovered, even at this fetal stage, remarkable heterogeneity across and within cell types. Glia displayed diversity related to positional identity along the dorso-ventral and rostro-caudal axes, while astrocytes with specialized transcriptional programs mapped onto distinct histological domains. We discovered a surprisingly early diversification of alpha () and gamma ({gamma}) motor neurons that control and modulate contraction of muscle fibers, which was suggestive of accelerated developmental timing in human spinal cord compared to rodents. Together with mapping of disease-related genes, this transcriptional profile of the developing human spinal cord opens new avenues for interrogating the cellular basis of motor control and related disorders in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Programmable Ontology Encompassing the Functional Logic of the Drosophila Brain</a></h4>

              
                The Drosophila brain has only a fraction of the number of neurons of higher organisms such as mice. Yet the sheer complexity of its neural circuits recently revealed by large connectomics datasets suggests that computationally modeling the function of fruit fly brain at this scale posits significant challenges. To address these challenges, we present here a programmable ontology that expands the scope of the current Drosophila brain anatomy ontologies to encompass the functional logic of the fly brain. The programmable ontology provides a language not only for defining functional circuit motifs but also for programmatically exploring their functional logic. To achieve this goal, we tightly integrated the programmable ontology with the workflow of the interactive FlyBrainLab computing platform. As part of the programmable ontology, we developed NeuroNLP++, a web application that supports free-form English queries for constructing functional brain circuits fully anchored on the available connectome/synaptome datasets, and the published worldwide literature. In addition, we present a methodology for including a model of the space of odorants into the programmable ontology, and for modeling olfactory sensory circuits of the antenna of the fruit fly brain that detect odorant sources. Furthermore, we describe a methodology for modeling the functional logic of the antennal lobe circuit consisting of massive local feedback loops, a characteristic feature observed across Drosophila brain regions. Finally, using a circuit library, we demonstrate the power of our methodology for interactively exploring the functional logic of the massive number of feedback loops in the antennal lobe.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single Nuclei Transcriptome Reveals Perturbed Brain Vascular Molecules in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is well-known in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the precise molecular changes contributing to its pathophysiology are unclear. To understand the transcriptional changes in brain vascular cells, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of temporal cortex tissue in 24 AD and control brains resulting in 79,751 nuclei, 4,604 of which formed three distinct vascular clusters characterized as activated pericytes, endothelia and resting pericytes. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their enriched pathways in these clusters and detected the most transcriptional changes within activated pericytes. Using our data and a knowledge-based predictive algorithm, we discovered and prioritized molecular interactions between vascular and astrocyte clusters, the main cell types of the gliovascular unit (GVU) of the BBB. Vascular targets predicted to interact with astrocytic ligands have biological functions in signaling, angiogenesis, amyloid {beta} metabolism and cytoskeletal structure. Top astrocytic and vascular interacting molecules include both novel and known AD risk genes such as APOE, APP and ECE1. Our findings provide information on transcriptional changes in predicted vascular-astrocytic partners at the GVU, bringing insights to the molecular mechanisms of BBB breakdown in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor modulates the rate of functional maturation in parvalbumin-positive interneurons</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are excitatory glutamate-gated ion channels that are expressed throughout the central nervous system. NMDARs mediate calcium entry into cells, and are involved in a host of neurological functions, including neuronal development and maturation. The GluN2A subunit, encoded by the GRIN2A gene, has a slightly delayed expression pattern, with low transcript levels during embryonic development that peak in the early neonatal period. Given its unique expression pattern and ability to speed up the synaptic time course after incorporation into the postsynaptic density compared to other GluN2 subunits, the GluN2A subunit is well positioned to participate in synaptic maturation and circuit refinement. By using Grin2a knockout mice, we show that the loss of GluN2A signaling impacts parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneuron development in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. Specifically, Grin2a knockout mice have 33% more parvalbumin-positive cells in CA1 compared to wild type controls, with no impact on cholecystokinin-positive cell density. By using immunohistochemical colocalization staining and electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that these excess parvalbumin cells do eventually incorporate into the hippocampal network and participate in phasic inhibition, although their presynaptic release probability may be dampened. Moreover, we show that although the morphology of Grin2a knockout parvalbumin-positive cells is unaffected, key measures of intrinsic excitability and action-potential firing properties show age-dependent alterations. Preadolescent (P20-25) parvalbumin-positive cells have an increased input resistance, longer membrane time constant, longer action-potential half-width, a lower current threshold for depolarization-induced block of action-potential firing, and a decrease in peak action-potential firing rate. Each of these electrophysiological measures becomes corrected in adulthood, reaching wild type levels, suggesting a delay of electrophysiological maturation. The circuit and behavioral implications of delayed parvalbumin-positive interneuron maturation are not known; however, we find that neonatal Grin2a knockout mice are more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide and febrile-induced seizures, consistent with a critical role for early GluN2A signaling in neuronal development and maintenance of excitatory-inhibitory balance. These results could provide insights into how loss-of-function GRIN2A human variants can generate an epileptic phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Copper imbalance linked to oxidative stress and cell death during Zika virus infection in human astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The Zika virus (ZIKV) caused neurological abnormalities in more than 3500 Brazilian newborns between 2015 and 2020. Data have pointed to oxidative stress in astrocytes as well as to dysregulations in neural cell proliferation and cell cycle as important events accounting for the cell death and neurological complications observed in Congenital Zika Syndrome. Copper imbalance has been shown to induce similar alterations in other pathologies, and disturbances in copper homeostasis have already been described in viral infections. For this reason, we investigated copper homeostasis imbalance as a factor that could contribute to the cytotoxic effects of ZIKV infection in iPSC-derived human astrocytes. Our results show that ZIKV infection leads to a downregulation of one of the transporters mediating copper release, ATP7B protein. We also observed the activation of mechanisms that counteract high copper levels, including the synthesis of copper chaperones and the reduction of the copper importer protein CTR1. Finally, we show that chelator-mediated copper sequestration in ZIKV-infected astrocytes reduces the levels of reactive oxygen species and improves cell viability, but does not change the overall percentage of infected cells. In summary, our results show that copper homeostasis imbalance plays a role in the pathology of ZIKV in astrocytes, indicating that it may also be a factor accounting for the developmental abnormalities in the central nervous system following viral infection. Evaluating micronutrient levels and the use of copper chelators in pregnant women susceptible to ZIKV infection may be promising strategies to manage novel cases of congenital ZIKV syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dissociable influences of reward and punishment on adaptive cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiamin Leng, Debbie Yee, Harrison Ritz, Amitai Shenhav</p>

To invest effort into any cognitive task, people must be sufficiently motivated. Whereas prior research has focused primarily on how the cognitive control required to complete these tasks is motivated by the potential rewards for success, it is also known that control investment can be equally motivated by the potential negative consequence for failure. Previous theoretical and experimental work has yet to examine how positive and negative incentives differentially influence the manner and intensity with which people allocate control. Here, we develop and test a normative model of control allocation under conditions of varying positive and negative performance incentives. Our model predicts, and our empirical findings confirm, that rewards for success and punishment for failure should differentially influence adjustments to the evidence accumulation rate versus response threshold, respectively. This dissociation further enabled us to infer how motivated a given person was by the consequences of success versus failure.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling interference between vectors of non-persistently transmitted plant viruses to identify effective control strategies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marta Zaffaroni, Loup Rimbaud, Ludovic Mailleret, Nik J. Cunniffe, Daniele Bevacqua</p>

Aphids are the primary vector of plant viruses. Transient aphids, which probe several plants per day, are considered to be the principal vectors of non-persistently transmitted (NPT) viruses. However, resident aphids, which can complete their life cycle on a single host and are affected by agronomic practices, can transmit NPT viruses as well. Moreover, they can interfere both directly and indirectly with transient aphids, eventually shaping plant disease dynamics. By mean of an epidemiological model, originally accounting for ecological principles and agronomic practices, we explore the consequences of fertilization and irrigation, pesticide deployment and roguing of infected plants on the spread of viral diseases in crops. Our results indicate that the spread of NPT viruses can be <i>i</i>) both reduced or increased by fertilization and irrigation, depending on whether the interference is direct or indirect; <i>ii</i>) counter-intuitively increased by pesticide application and <i>iii</i>) reduced by roguing infected plants. We show that a better understanding of vectors’ interactions would enhance our understanding of disease transmission, supporting the development of disease management strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A novel theoretical framework for simultaneous measurement of excitatory and inhibitory conductances</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel Müller-Komorowska, Ana Parabucki, Gal Elyasaf, Yonatan Katz, Heinz Beck, Ilan Lampl</p>

The firing of neurons throughout the brain is determined by the precise relations between excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and disruption of their balance underlies many psychiatric diseases. Whether or not these inputs covary over time or between repeated stimuli remains unclear due to the lack of experimental methods for measuring both inputs simultaneously. We developed a new analytical framework for instantaneous and simultaneous measurements of both the excitatory and inhibitory neuronal inputs during a single trial under current clamp recording. This can be achieved by injecting a current composed of two high frequency sinusoidal components followed by analytical extraction of the conductances. We demonstrate the ability of this method to measure both inputs in a single trial under realistic recording constraints and from morphologically realistic CA1 pyramidal model cells. Future experimental implementation of our new method will facilitate the understanding of fundamental questions about the health and disease of the nervous system.

Context dependency is a key feature in sequential structures of human language, which requires reference between words far apart in the produced sequence. Assessing how long the past context has an effect on the current status provides crucial information to understand the mechanism for complex sequential behaviors. Birdsongs serve as a representative model for studying the context dependency in sequential signals produced by non-human animals, while previous reports were upper-bounded by methodological limitations. Here, we newly estimated the context dependency in birdsongs in a more scalable way using a modern neural-network-based language model whose accessible context length is sufficiently long. The detected context dependency was beyond the order of traditional Markovian models of birdsong, but was consistent with previous experimental investigations. We also studied the relation between the assumed/auto-detected vocabulary size of birdsong (i.e., fine- vs. coarse-grained syllable classifications) and the context dependency. It turned out that the larger vocabulary (or the more fine-grained classification) is assumed, the shorter context dependency is detected.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Combination treatment optimization using a pan-cancer pathway model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Robin Schmucker, Gabriele Farina, James Faeder, Fabian Fröhlich, Ali Sinan Saglam, Tuomas Sandholm</p>

The design of efficient combination therapies is a difficult key challenge in the treatment of complex diseases such as cancers. The large heterogeneity of cancers and the large number of available drugs renders exhaustive <i>in vivo</i> or even <i>in vitro</i> investigation of possible treatments impractical. In recent years, sophisticated mechanistic, ordinary differential equation-based pathways models that can predict treatment responses at a <i>molecular</i> level have been developed. However, surprisingly little effort has been put into leveraging these models to find novel therapies. In this paper we use for the first time, to our knowledge, a large-scale state-of-the-art pan-cancer signaling pathway model to identify candidates for novel combination therapies to treat individual cancer cell lines from various tissues (e.g., minimizing proliferation while keeping dosage low to avoid adverse side effects) and populations of heterogeneous cancer cell lines (e.g., minimizing the maximum or average proliferation across the cell lines while keeping dosage low). We also show how our method can be used to optimize the drug combinations used in <i>sequential</i> treatment plans—that is, optimized sequences of potentially different drug combinations—providing additional benefits. In order to solve the treatment optimization problems, we combine the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm with a significantly more scalable sampling scheme for truncated Gaussian distributions, based on a Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo method. These optimization techniques are independent of the signaling pathway model, and can thus be adapted to find treatment candidates for other complex diseases than cancers as well, as long as a suitable predictive model is available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Asymmetric and transient properties of reciprocal activity of antagonists during the paw-shake response in the cat</a></h4>

Mutually inhibitory populations of neurons, half-center oscillators (HCOs), are commonly involved in the dynamics of the central pattern generators (CPGs) driving various rhythmic movements. Previously, we developed a multifunctional, multistable symmetric HCO model which produced slow locomotor-like and fast paw-shake-like activity patterns. Here, we describe asymmetric features of paw-shake responses in a symmetric HCO model and test these predictions experimentally. We considered bursting properties of the two model half-centers during transient paw-shake-like responses to short perturbations during locomotor-like activity. We found that when a current pulse was applied during the spiking phase of one half-center, let’s call it #1, the consecutive burst durations (BDs) of that half-center increased throughout the paw-shake response, while BDs of the other half-center, let’s call it #2, only changed slightly. In contrast, the consecutive interburst intervals (IBIs) of half-center #1 changed little, while IBIs of half-center #2 increased. We demonstrated that this asymmetry between the half-centers depends on the phase of the locomotor-like rhythm at which the perturbation was applied. We suggest that the fast transient response reflects functional asymmetries of slow processes that underly the locomotor-like pattern; e.g., asymmetric levels of inactivation across the two half-centers for a slowly inactivating inward current. We compared model results with those of in-vivo paw-shake responses evoked in locomoting cats and found similar asymmetries. Electromyographic (EMG) BDs of anterior hindlimb muscles with flexor-related activity increased in consecutive paw-shake cycles, while BD of posterior muscles with extensor-related activity did not change, and vice versa for IBIs of anterior flexors and posterior extensors. We conclude that EMG activity patterns during paw-shaking are consistent with the proposed mechanism producing transient paw-shake-like bursting patterns found in our multistable HCO model. We suggest that the described asymmetry of paw-shaking responses could implicate a multifunctional CPG controlling both locomotion and paw-shaking.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A systems genomics approach uncovers molecular associates of RSV severity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew N. McCall, Chin-Yi Chu, Lu Wang, Lauren Benoodt, Juilee Thakar, Anthony Corbett, Jeanne Holden-Wiltse, Christopher Slaunwhite, Alex Grier, Steven R. Gill, Ann R. Falsey, David J. Topham, Mary T. Caserta, Edward E. Walsh, Xing Qiu, Thomas J. Mariani</p>

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection results in millions of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths each year. Variations in the adaptive and innate immune response appear to be associated with RSV severity. To investigate the host response to RSV infection in infants, we performed a systems-level study of RSV pathophysiology, incorporating high-throughput measurements of the peripheral innate and adaptive immune systems and the airway epithelium and microbiota. We implemented a novel multi-omic data integration method based on multilayered principal component analysis, penalized regression, and feature weight back-propagation, which enabled us to identify cellular pathways associated with RSV severity. In both airway and immune cells, we found an association between RSV severity and activation of pathways controlling Th17 and acute phase response signaling, as well as inhibition of B cell receptor signaling. Dysregulation of both the humoral and mucosal response to RSV may play a critical role in determining illness severity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies interactors of the autophagy pathway as conserved coronavirus targets</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Annika Kratzel, Jenna N. Kelly, Philip V’kovski, Jasmine Portmann, Yannick Brüggemann, Daniel Todt, Nadine Ebert, Neeta Shrestha, Philippe Plattet, Claudia A. Staab-Weijnitz, Albrecht von Brunn, Eike Steinmann, Ronald Dijkman, Gert Zimmer, Stephanie Pfaender, Volker Thiel</p>

Over the past 20 years, 3 highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have emerged—Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, most recently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)—demonstrating that coronaviruses (CoVs) pose a serious threat to human health and highlighting the importance of developing effective therapies against them. Similar to other viruses, CoVs are dependent on host factors for their survival and replication. We hypothesized that evolutionarily distinct CoVs may exploit similar host factors and pathways to support their replication cycles. Herein, we conducted 2 independent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas-9 knockout (KO) screens to identify MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E host dependency factors (HDFs) required for HCoV replication in the human Huh7 cell line. Top scoring genes were further validated and assessed in the context of MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E infection as well as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strikingly, we found that several autophagy-related genes, including TMEM41B, MINAR1, and the immunophilin FKBP8, were common host factors required for pan-CoV replication. Importantly, inhibition of the immunophilin protein family with the compounds cyclosporine A, and the nonimmunosuppressive derivative alisporivir, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CoV replication in primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures, which recapitulate the natural site of virus replication. Overall, we identified host factors that are crucial for CoV replication and demonstrated that these factors constitute potential targets for therapeutic intervention by clinically approved drugs.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prior uncontrolled studies have reported seizure reductions following deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), but evidence from randomized controlled studies is lacking. We aimed to formally assess the efficacy and safety of DBS to the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) for the treatment of LGS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized study of continuous, cycling stimulation of CM-DBS, in patients with LGS. Following pre- and post-implantation periods, half received 3 months of stimulation (blinded phase), then all received 3 months of stimulation (unblinded phase). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with ≥50% reduction in diary-recorded seizures in stimulated versus control participants, measured at the end of the blinded phase. A secondary outcome was the proportion of participants with a ≥50% reduction in electrographic seizures on 24-hour ambulatory electroencephalography (EEG) at the end of the blinded phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between November 2017 and December 2019, 20 young adults with LGS (17–37 years;13 women) underwent bilateral CM-DBS at a single center in Australia, with 19 randomized (treatment, n = 10 and control, n = 9). Fifty percent of the stimulation group achieved ≥50% seizure reduction, compared with 22% of controls (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44–21.45, <i>p</i> = 0.25). For electrographic seizures, 59% of the stimulation group had ≥50% reduction at the end of the blinded phase, compared with none of the controls (OR= 23.25, 95% CI = 1.0–538.4, <i>p</i> = 0.05). Across all patients, median seizure reduction (baseline vs study exit) was 46.7% (interquartile range [IQR] = 28–67%) for diary-recorded seizures and 53.8% (IQR = 27–73%) for electrographic seizures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CM-DBS in patients with LGS reduced electrographic rather than diary-recorded seizures, after 3 months of stimulation. Fifty percent of all participants had diary-recorded seizures reduced by half at the study exit, providing supporting evidence of the treatment effect. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Regular aerobic exercise is positively associated with hippocampal structure and function in young and middle‐aged adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Regular exercise has numerous benefits for brain health, including the structure and function of the hippocampus. The hippocampus plays a critical role in memory function, and is altered in a number of psychiatric disorders associated with memory impairments (e.g., depression and schizophrenia), as well as healthy aging. While many studies have focused on how regular exercise may improve hippocampal integrity in older individuals, less is known about these effects in young to middle-aged adults. Therefore, we assessed the associations of regular exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness with hippocampal structure and function in these age groups. We recruited 40 healthy young to middle-aged adults, comprised of two groups (n = 20) who self-reported either high or low levels of exercise, according to World Health Organization guidelines. We assessed cardiorespiratory fitness using a graded exercise test (VO<sub>2</sub>max) and hippocampal structure via manual tracing of T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. We also assessed hippocampal function using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to derive estimates of <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate concentration and hippocampal-dependent associative memory and pattern separation tasks. We observed evidence of increased <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate concentration and associative memory performance in individuals engaging in high levels of exercise. However, no differences in hippocampal volume or pattern separation capacity were observed between groups. Cardiorespiratory fitness was positively associated with left and right hippocampal volume and <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate concentration. However, no associations were observed between cardiorespiratory fitness and associative memory or pattern separation. Therefore, we provide evidence that higher levels of exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with improved hippocampal structure and function. Exercise may provide a low-risk, effective method of improving hippocampal integrity in an early-to-mid-life stage.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">The lateral posterior clock neurons (LPN) of Drosophila melanogaster express three neuropeptides and have multiple connections within the circadian clock network and beyond</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Drosophila</i>’s lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) belong to a small group of circadian clock neurons that is so far not characterized in detail. Thanks to a new highly specific split-Gal4 line, here we describe LPNs’ morphology in fine detail, their synaptic connections, daily bimodal expression of neuropeptides, and propose a putative role of this cluster in controlling daily activity and sleep patterns. We found that the three LPNs are heterogeneous. Two of the neurons with similar morphology arborize in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum and most likely promote sleep. One unique, possibly wakefulness-promoting, neuron with wider arborizations extends from the superior lateral protocerebrum toward the anterior optic tubercle. Both LPN types exhibit manifold connections with the other circadian clock neurons, especially with those that control the flies‘ morning and evening activity (M- and E-neurons, respectively). In addition, they form synaptic connections with neurons of the mushroom bodies, the fan-shaped body, and with many additional still unidentified neurons. We found that both LPN types rhythmically express three neuropeptides, Allostatin A, Allostatin C, and Diuretic Hormone 31 with maxima in the morning and the evening. The three LPN neuropeptides may, furthermore, signal to the insect hormonal center in the <i>pars intercerebralis</i> and contribute to rhythmic modulation of metabolism, feeding, and reproduction. We discuss our findings in the light of anatomical details gained by the recently published hemibrain of a single female fly on the electron microscopic level and of previous functional studies concerning the LPN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Network Localization of Unconscious Visual Perception in Blindsight</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blindsight is a disorder where brain injury causes loss of conscious but not unconscious visual perception. Prior studies have produced conflicting results regarding the neuroanatomical pathways involved in this unconscious perception.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a systematic literature search to identify lesion locations causing visual field loss in patients with blindsight (n=34) and patients without blindsight (n=35). Resting state functional connectivity between each lesion location and all other brain voxels was computed using a large connectome database (n=1000). Connections significantly associated with blindsight (versus no blindsight) were identified.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Functional connectivity between lesion locations and the ipsilesional medial pulvinar was significantly associated with blindsight (FWE <i>p</i>=0.029). No significant connectivity differences were found to other brain regions previously implicated in blindsight. This finding was independent of methods (e.g. flipping lesions to the left or right) and stimulus type (moving versus static).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Connectivity to the ipsilesional medial pulvinar best differentiates lesion locations associated with blindsight versus those without blindsight. Our results align with recent data from animal models and provide insight into the neuroanatomical substrate of unconscious visual abilities in patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Moving bar of light evokes vectorial spatial selectivity in the immobile rat hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Visual cortical neurons encode the position and motion direction of specific stimuli retrospectively, without any locomotion or task demand. Hippocampus, a part of visual system, is hypothesized to require self-motion or cognitive task to generate allocentric spatial selectivity that is scalar, abstract, and prospective. To bridge these seeming disparities, we measured rodent hippocampal selectivity to a moving bar of light in a body-fixed rat. About 70% of dorsal CA1 neurons showed stable activity modulation as a function of the bar angular position, independent of behavior and rewards. A third of tuned cells also encoded the direction of revolution. In other experiments, neurons encoded the distance of the bar, with preference for approaching motion. Collectively, these demonstrate visually evoked vectorial selectivity (VEVS). Unlike place cells, VEVS was retrospective. Changes in the visual stimulus or its trajectory did not cause remapping but only caused gradual changes. Most VEVS-tuned neurons behaved like place cells during spatial exploration and the two selectivities were correlated. Thus, VEVS could form the basic building block of hippocampal activity. When combined with self-motion, reward, or multisensory stimuli, it can generate the complexity of prospective representations including allocentric space, time, and episodes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dendritic integration of sensory and reward information facilitates learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning goal-directed behaviours requires integration of separate information streams representing context, relevant stimuli and reward. Dendrites of pyramidal neurons are suitable sites for such integration, but it remains elusive how their responses adapt when an animal learns a new task. Here, we identify two distinct classes of dendritic responses that represent either contextual/sensory information or reward information and that differ in their task- and learning-related dynamics. Using longitudinal calcium imaging of apical dendritic tufts of L5 pyramidal neurons in mouse barrel cortex, we tracked dendritic activity across learning and analyzed both local dendritic branch signals and global apical tuft activity. During texture discrimination learning, sensory representations (including contextual and touch information) strengthened and converged on the reward-predicting tactile stimulus when mice became experts. In contrast, reward-associated responses were particularly strong in the naive condition and became less pronounced upon learning. When we blocked the representation of unexpected reward in naive animals with optogenetic inhibition, animals failed to learn until we released the block and learning proceeded normally. Our results suggest that reward signals in dendrites are essential for adjusting neuronal integration of converging inputs to facilitate adaptive behaviour.

                Eye tracking and other behavioral measurements collected from patient-participants in their hospital rooms afford a unique opportunity to study immersive natural behavior for basic and clinical-translational research, and also requires addressing important logistical, technical, and ethical challenges. Hospital rooms provide the opportunity to richly capture both clinically relevant and ordinary natural behavior. As clinical settings, they add the potential to study the relationship between behavior and physiology by collecting physiological data synchronized to behavioral measures from participants. Combining eye-tracking, other behavioral measures, and physiological measurements enables clinical-translational research into understanding the participants' disorders and clinician-patient interactions, as well as basic research into natural, real world behavior as participants eat, read, converse with friends and family, etc. Here we describe a paradigm in individuals undergoing surgical treatment for epilepsy who spend 1-2 weeks in the hospital with electrodes implanted in their brain to determine the source of their seizures. This provides the unique opportunity to record behavior using eye tracking glasses customized to address clinically-related ergonomic concerns, synchronized direct neural recordings, use computer vision to assist with video annotation, and apply multivariate machine learning analyses to multimodal data encompassing hours of natural behavior. We discuss the acquisition, quality control, annotation, and analysis pipelines to study the neural basis of real world social and affective perception during natural conversations with friends and family in participants with epilepsy. We also discuss clinical, logistical, and ethical and privacy considerations that must be addressed to acquire high quality multimodal data in this setting.

                A method to estimate phosphorus (31P) transversal relaxation times (T2) of coupled spin systems is demonstrated. Additionally, intracellular and extracellular pH (pHext, pHint) and relaxation corrected metabolite concentrations are reported. Echo time (TE) series of 31P metabolite spectra were acquired using STEAM localization. Spectra were fitted using LCModel with accurately modeled Vespa basis sets accounting for J-evolution of the coupled spin systems. T2s were estimated by fitting a single exponential two-parameter model across the TE series. Fitted inorganic phosphate frequencies were used to calculate pH, and relaxation times were used to determine the brain metabolite concentrations. The method was demonstrated in the healthy human brain at a field strength of 9.4T. T2 relaxation times of ATP and NAD are the shortest between 8 ms and 20 ms, followed by T2s of inorganic phosphate between 25 ms and 50 ms, and PCr with a T2 of 100 ms. Phosphomonoesters and -diesters have the longest T2s of about 130 ms. Measured T2s are comparable to literature values and fit in a decreasing trend with increasing field strengths. Calculated pHs and metabolite concentrations are also comparable to literature values

                This article presents a hybrid boundary element-finite element (BE-FE) method to solve the EEG forward problem and take advantages of both the boundary element method (BEM) and finite element method (FEM). Although realistic EEG forward problems with heterogeneous and anisotropic regions can be solved by FEM accurately, the FEM modeling of the brain with dipolar sources may lead to singularity. In contrast, the BEM can solve EEG forward problems with isotropic tissue regions and dipolar sources using a suitable integral formulation. This work utilizes both FEM and BEM strengths attained by dividing the regions into some homogeneous BE regions with sources and some heterogeneous and anisotropic FE regions. Furthermore, the BEM is applied for modeling the brain, including dipole sources and the FEM for other head layers. To validate the proposed method, inhomogeneous isotropic/anisotropic three- and four-layer spherical head models are studied. Moreover, a four&-layer realistic head model is investigated. Results for six different dipole eccentricities and two different dipole orientations are computed using the BEM, FEM, and hybrid BE-FE method together with statistical analysis and the related error criteria are compared. The proposed method is a promising new approach for solving realistic EEG forward problems.

                Animals must flexibly estimate the value of their actions to successfully adapt in a changing environment. The brain is thought to estimate action-value from two different sources, namely the action-outcome history (retrospective value) and the knowledge of the environment (prospective value). How these two different estimates of action-value are reconciled to make a choice is not well understood. Here we show that as a mouse learns the state-transition structure of a decision-making task, retrospective and prospective values become jointly encoded in the preparatory activity of neurons in the frontal cortex. Suppressing this preparatory activity in expert mice returned their behavior to a naive state. These results reveal the neural circuit that integrates knowledge about the past and future to support predictive decision-making.

                Circadian disturbances are early features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's Disease (HD), affecting the quality of life of patients and caregivers. Emerging evidence suggests that circadian decline feeds-forward to neurodegenerative symptoms, exacerbating them, highlighting a need for restoring circadian health. Therefore, we asked whether any of the known neurotoxic modifiers can suppress circadian dysfunction. We performed a screen of neurotoxicity-modifier genes to suppress circadian behavioural arrhythmicity in a Drosophila circadian HD model. Notably, the molecular chaperones HSP40 and HSP70 (Heat Shock Protein) emerged as significant suppressors in the circadian context, with HSP40 being the more potent mitigator of HD-induced deficits. Upon HSP40 overexpression in the Drosophila circadian ventrolateral neurons (LNv), the behavioural rhythm rescue was associated with neuronal rescue of loss in circadian proteins from small LNv soma. Specifically, there was a restoration of the molecular clock protein Period and its oscillations in young flies and a long-lasting rescue of the output neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor. Significantly, there was a reduction in the expanded Huntingtin inclusion load, concomitant with the appearance of a spot-like Huntingtin form. Thus, we provide evidence for the first time that implicates the neuroprotective chaperone HSP40 in circadian rehabilitation. Given the importance of proteostasis and circadian health in neurodegenerative diseases, the involvement of molecular chaperones in circadian maintenance has broader therapeutic implications.

                Recent studies suggested that microglia, the primary brain immune cells, can affect circuit connectivity and neuronal function. Microglia infiltrate the neuroepithelium early in embryonic development and are maintained in the brain throughout adulthood. Several maternal environmental factors, such as aberrant microbiome, immune activation, and poor nutrition, can influence prenatal brain development. Nevertheless, it is unknown how changes in the prenatal environment instruct the developmental trajectory of infiltrating microglia, which in turn affect brain development and function. Here we show that after maternal immune activation (MIA) microglia from the offspring have a long-lived decrease in immune reactivity (blunting) across the developmental trajectory. The blunted immune response was concomitant with changes in the chromatin accessibility and reduced transcription factor occupancy of the open chromatin. Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that MIA does not induce a distinct subpopulation but rather decreases the contribution to inflammatory microglia states. Prenatal replacement of MIA microglia with physiological infiltration of naive microglia ameliorated the immune blunting and restored a decrease in presynaptic vesicle release probability onto dopamine receptor type-two medium spiny neurons, indicating that aberrantly formed microglia due to an adverse prenatal environment impacts the long-term microglia reactivity and proper striatal circuit development.

                Preconditioning peripheral nerve injury enhances axonal regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in part by driving pro-regenerative perineuronal macrophage activation. How these regeneration-associated macrophages influence the neuronal capacity of axon regeneration remains elusive. The present study reports that oncomodulin (ONCM) is an effector molecule derived from the regeneration-associated macrophages. ONCM was highly upregulated in DRG macrophages following preconditioning injury and necessary for the preconditioning-induced neurite outgrowth. ONCM-deficient macrophages failed to generate neurite outgrowth activity of the conditioned medium in the in vitro model of neuron-macrophage interaction. CCL2/CCR2 signaling is an upstream regulator of ONCM since the ONCM upregulation was dependent on CCR2 and CCL2 overexpression-mediated conditioning effects were attenuated in ONCM-deficient mice. Direct application of ONCM potently increased neurite outgrowth in cultured DRG neurons by activating a distinct gene set, particularly neuropeptide-related genes. AAV-mediated overexpression of ONCM construct with the signal sequence increased neuronal secretion of ONCM and enhanced neurite outgrowth in an autocrine manner. For a clinically relevant approach, we developed a nanogel-mediated system for localized delivery of recombinant ONCM to DRG tissue. Electrostatic encapsulation of ONCM by a reducible epsilon-poly(L-lysine)-nanogel (REPL-NG) resulted in a slow release of ONCM allowing sustained bioactivity. Intraganglionic injection of REPL-NG/ONCM complex achieved a remarkable long-range axonal regeneration beyond spinal cord lesion, surpassing the extent expected from the preconditioning effects. The NG-mediated ONCM delivery could be exploited as a therapeutic strategy for promoting sensory axon regeneration following spinal cord injury.

                The size of the amyloid seeds is known to modulate their autocatalytic amplification and cellular toxicity. However, the seed size-dependent secondary nucleation mechanism, toxicity, and disease-associated biological processes mediated by -synuclein (-Syn) fibrils are largely unknown. Using the cellular model and in vitro reconstitution, we showed that the size of -Syn fibril seeds not only dictates its cellular internalization and associated cell death; but also the distinct mechanisms of fibril amplification pathways involved in the pathological conformational change of -Syn. Specifically, small-sized fibril seeds showed elongation possibly through monomer addition at the fibril termini; whereas longer fibrils template the fibril amplification by surface-mediated nucleation as demonstrated by super-resolution microscopy. The distinct mechanism of fibril amplification, and cellular uptake along with toxicity suggest that breakage of fibrils into different sizes of seeds determine the underlying pathological outcome of synucleinopathies.

                Response inhibition is a primary executive control function that allows the withholding of inappropriate responses, and requires appropriate perception of the external environment to achieve a behavioral goal. It remains unclear, however, how response inhibition is achieved when goal-relevant information involves perceptual uncertainty. Twenty-six human participants of both sexes performed a go/no-go task where visually presented random-dot motion stimuli involved perceptual uncertainties. The right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) was involved in response inhibition, and the middle temporal (MT) region showed greater activity when dot motions involved less uncertainty. A neocortical temporal region in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) specifically showed greater activity during response inhibition in more perceptually certain trials. In this STS region, activity was greater when response inhibition was successful than when it failed. Directional effective connectivity analysis revealed that in more coherent trials, the MT and STS regions showed enhanced connectivity to the rIFC, whereas in less coherent trials, the signal direction was reversed. These results suggest that a reversible fronto-temporal functional network guides response inhibition under perceptual uncertainty, and in this network, perceptual information in the MT is converted to control information in the rIFC via STS, enabling achievement of response inhibition.

                Astrocytes are abundant star-shaped glial cells in the mammalian brain, with essential roles in metabolism, development, homeostasis, response to injury, behavior, and learning. Surprisingly, most regions of the teleost brain are thought to lack astrocytes, based primarily on the use of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) as a marker. Here, drawing on recent evidence that astrocytes are molecularly heterogeneous, we propose that astrocytes exist in the teleost brain, albeit of the olig2 subtype. Highly branched cells are present throughout the zebrafish brain, as shown here in Tg(sox10:EGFP) fish and previously in Tg(olig2:GFP) fish. Transcriptome data indicates the presence of brain cells that are olig2 and sox10 positive, which also express the astrocyte markers sox9b, sparcl1 and slc1a2b but lack gfap and the oligodendrocyte marker mbp. In situ hybridization confirms that stellate sox10:EGFP cells express olig2 and sox9b, while immunofluorescence indicates that they lack HuC/D and GFAP. We suggest that these cells be classified as astrocytes as this may more accurately reflect their functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Functional Logic of Odor Information Processing in the Drosophila Antennal Lobe</a></h4>

              
                In the early olfactory pathway of Drosophila, Olfactory Sensory Neurons (OSNs) multiplicatively encode the odorant identity and the concentration profile. Projection Neurons (PNs) responses in the Antennal Lobe (AL), in turn, exhibit strong transients at odorant onset/offset and stable steady-state behavior. What is the functional logic the of diverse set of Local Neurons (LNs) in the AL Addressing this question may shed light on the key characteristics of odor information processing in the AL, and odorant recognition and olfactory associative learning in the downstream neuropils of the early olfactory system. To address the computation performed by each LN type, we exhaustively evaluated all circuit configurations of the Antennal Lobe. We found that, across model parameterizations, presynaptic inhibition of the OSN-to-PN synapse is essential for odorant identity recovery in steady-state, while postsynaptic excitation and inhibition facilitate on-/off-set event detection. The onset and offset events indicate changing odorant identities, and together with the identity recovery in steady-state, suggest that the AL is an event-based odorant identity recovery processor.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain Morphometry and Chronic Inflammation in Bangladeshi Children Growing up in Extreme Poverty</a></h4>

              
                Over 300 million children grow up in environments of extreme poverty, and the biological and psychosocial hazards endemic to these environments often expose these children to infection, disease, and consequent inflammatory responses. Chronic inflammation in early childhood has been associated with diminished cognitive outcomes and despite this established relationship, the mechanisms explaining how inflammation affects brain development are not well known. Importantly, chronic inflammation is very common in areas of extreme poverty, raising the possibility that it may serve as a mechanism explaining the known relationship between low socioeconomic status (SES) and atypical brain development. To examine these potential pathways, seventy-nine children growing up in an extremely poor, urban area of Bangladesh underwent structural MRI scanning at six years of age. Structural brain images were submitted to Mindboggle software, a Docker-compliant and high-reproducibility tool for tissue segmentation and regional estimations of volume, surface area, cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and mean curvature. Concentration of C-reactive protein was assayed at eight time points between infancy and five years of age and the frequency with which children had elevated concentrations of inflammatory marker served as the measure of chronic inflammation. SES was measured with years of maternal education and income-to-needs. Chronic inflammation predicted total brain volume, total white matter volume, average sulcal depth, and bilateral putamen volumes. Chronic inflammation also mediated the link between maternal education and bilateral putamen volumes. These findings suggest that chronic inflammation is associated with brain morphometry globally and in the putamen, and further suggests that inflammation may be a potential mechanism linking SES to brain development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Catch the star! Spatial information activates the manual motor system</a></h4>

              
                Previous research demonstrated a close bidirectional relationship between spatial attention and the manual motor system. However, it is unclear whether an explicit hand movement is necessary for this relationship to appear. A novel method with high temporal resolution - bimanual grip force registration - sheds light on this issue. Participants held two grip force sensors while being presented with lateralized stimuli (exogenous attentional shifts, Experiment 1), left- or right-pointing central arrows (endogenous attentional shifts, Experiment 2), or the words "left" or "right" (endogenous attentional shifts, Experiment 3). There was an early interaction between the presentation side or arrow direction and grip force: lateralized objects and central arrows led to an increase of the ipsilateral force and a decrease of the contralateral force. Surprisingly, words led to the opposite pattern: increased force in the contralateral hand and decreased force in the ipsilateral hand. The effect was stronger and appeared earlier for lateralized objects (60 ms after stimulus presentation) than for arrows (100 ms) or words (250 ms). Thus, processing visuospatial information automatically activates the manual motor system, but the timing and direction of this effect vary depending on the type of stimulus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulates mitochondrial mass and dendritic localization in distinct hippocampal circuits</a></h4>

              
                CA2 is an understudied subregion of the hippocampus that is critical for social memory. Previous studies identified multiple components of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex as selectively enriched in CA2, however the functional significance of this enrichment remains unclear. The MCU complex regulates calcium entry into mitochondria, which in turn regulates mitochondrial transport and localization to active synapses. We found that MCU is strikingly enriched in CA2 distal apical dendrites, precisely where CA2 neurons receive entorhinal cortical input carrying social information. Further, MCU-enriched mitochondria in CA2 distal dendrites are larger compared to mitochondria in CA2 proximal apical dendrites and neighboring CA1 apical dendrites. Genetic knockdown of MCU in CA2 resulted in smaller mitochondria in CA2 distal dendrites, indicating that MCU expression plays a role in regulating mitochondrial mass in CA2. MCU overexpression in neighboring CA1 led to larger mitochondria preferentially in proximal dendrites compared to distal dendrites and GFP controls. Our findings demonstrate that mitochondria are molecularly and structurally diverse across hippocampal cell types and circuits, and that MCU expression cell-autonomously regulates mitochondrial mass, but layer-specific dendritic localization depends on cell type. Our data support the idea that CA2 mitochondria are functionally distinct from CA1 mitochondria, which may confer unique synaptic and circuit properties underlying CA2 function in social memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Techniques for visualizing fibroblast-vessel interactions in the developing and adult CNS</a></h4>

              
                Fibroblasts are found associated with blood vessels in various locations across the CNS: in the meninges, the choroid plexus, and in the parenchyma within perivascular spaces. CNS fibroblasts have been characterized using transcriptional profiling and a Col1a1-GFP mouse line used to identify CNS fibroblasts in vivo. However, current methods for visualizing CNS fibroblasts are lacking and, in particular, prevent adequate assessment of fibroblast-vessel interactions. Here, we describe methods for whole mount visualization of meningeal and choroid plexus fibroblasts, and optical tissue clearing methods for visualization of parenchymal vessel-associated fibroblasts. Importantly, these techniques can be combined with immunohistochemistry methods for labeling different cell types in the meninges and blood vasculature as well as EdU-based cell proliferation assays. These methods are ideal for visualization of vessel-fibroblast interactions in these CNS structures and provide significant improvement over traditional sectioning and staining methods. We expect these methods will advance studies of CNS fibroblast development and functions in homeostasis, injury, and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Encoding of odors by mammalian olfactory receptors</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory receptors (ORs) constitute the largest multi-gene family in the mammalian genome, with hundreds to thousands of loci in humans and mice respectively. The rapid expansion of this massive family of genes has been generated by numerous duplication and diversification events throughout evolutionary history. This size, similarity, and diversity has made it challenging to define the principles by which ORs encode olfactory stimuli. Here, we performed a broad surveying of OR responses, using an in vivo strategy, against a diverse panel of odorants. We then used the resulting interaction profiles to uncover relationships between OR responses, odorants, odor molecular properties, and OR sequences. Our data and analyses revealed that ORs generally exhibited sparse tuning towards odorants and their molecular properties. Odor molecular property similarity between pairs of odorants was informative of odor response similarity. Finally, ORs sharing response to an odorant possessed amino acids at poorly conserved sites that exhibited both, predictive power towards odorant selectivity and convergent evolution. The localization of these residues occurred primarily at the interface of the upper halves of the transmembrane domains, implying that canonical positions govern odor selectivity across ORs. Altogether, our results provide a basis for translating odorants into receptor neuron responses for the unraveling of mammalian odor coding.

	<p>Persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have impaired mentalizing skills. In this study, a group of persons with ASD traits (high-AQ scores) initially received sham tDCS before completing a pre-test in two mentalizing tasks: false belief and self-other judgments. Over the next week, on four consecutive days, they received sessions of anodal electrical stimulation (a-tDCS) over the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ), a region frequently associated with the theory of mind. On the last day, after the stimulation session, they completed a new set of mentalizing tasks. A control group (with low-AQ scores) matched in age, education and intelligence received just sham stimulation and completed the same pre-test and post-test. The results showed that the high-AQ group improved their performance (faster responses), after a-tDCS, in the false belief and in the self-other judgments of mental features, whereas they did not change performance in the false photographs or the self-other judgments of physical features. These selective improvements cannot be attributed to increased familiarity with the tasks, because the performance of the low-AQ control group remained stable about one week later. Therefore, our study provides initial proof that tDCS could be used to improve mentalizing skills in persons with ASD traits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Differential effects of experimental glaucoma on intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve damage. Studies, including this study, support that RGCs degenerate and die in a type-specific manner following the disease insult. Here we specifically examined one RGC type, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC), and its associated functional deficits in a mouse model of experimental glaucoma. We induced chronic ocular hypertension (OHT) by laser photocoagulation and then characterized the survival of ipRGC subtypes. We found that ipRGCs suffer significant loss, similar to the general RGC population, but ipRGC subtypes are differentially affected following chronic OHT. M4 ipRGCs, which are involved in pattern vision, are susceptible to chronic OHT. Correspondingly, mice with chronic OHT experience reduced contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. By contrast, M1 ipRGCs, which project to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) to regulate circadian rhythmicity, exhibit almost no cell loss following chronic OHT. Accordingly, we observed that circadian re-entrainment and circadian rhythmicity are largely not disrupted in OHT mice. Our study demonstrates the link between subtype-specific ipRGC survival and behavioral deficits in glaucomatous mice. These findings provide insight into glaucoma-induced visual behavioral deficits and their underlying mechanisms.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temporal lobe epilepsy remains a common disorder with no cure and inadequate treatments, potentially because of an incomplete understanding of how seizures start. CA1 pyramidal cells and many inhibitory interneurons increase their firing rate in the seconds-minutes before a spontaneous seizure in epileptic rats. However, some interneurons fail to do so, including those identified as putative interneurons with somata in oriens and axons targeting lacunosum-moleculare (OLM cells). Somatostatin-containing cells, including OLM cells, are the primary target of inhibitory vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calretinin-expressing (VIP/CR) bipolar interneuron-selective interneurons, type 3 (ISI-3). The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that in epilepsy inhibition of OLM cells by ISI-3 is abnormally increased, potentially explaining the failure of OLM recruitment when needed most during the ramp up of activity preceding a seizure. Stereological quantification of VIP/CR cells in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrated that they survive in epileptic mice, despite a reduction in their somatostatin-expressing (Som) cell targets. Paired recordings of unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs) from ISI-3 to OLM cells did not show increased connection probability or increased connection strength, and failure rate was unchanged. When miniature postsynaptic currents in ISI-3 were compared, only mIPSC frequency was increased in epileptic hippocampi. Nevertheless, spontaneous and miniature postsynaptic potentials were unchanged in OLM cells of epileptic mice. These results are not consistent with the hypothesis of hyperinhibition from VIP/CR bipolar cells impeding recruitment of OLM cells in advance of a seizure.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It is well established that the hippocampus is critical for long-term episodic memory, but a growing body of research suggests that it also plays a critical role in supporting memory over very brief delays as measured in tests of working memory (WM). However, the circumstances under which the hippocampus is necessary for WM and the specific processes that it supports remain controversial. We propose that the hippocampus supports WM by binding together high-precision properties of an event, and we test this claim by examining the precision of color-location bindings in a visual WM task in which participants report the precise color of studied items using a continuous color wheel. Amnestic patients with hippocampal damage were significantly impaired at retrieving these colors after a 1-s delay, and these impairments reflected a reduction in the precision of those memories rather than increases in total memory failures or binding errors. Moreover, a parallel fMRI study in healthy subjects revealed that neural activity in the head and body of the hippocampus was directly related to the precision of visual WM decisions. Together, these results indicate that the hippocampus is critical in complex high-precision binding that supports memory over brief delays.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH, also known RFRP-3 in mammals) is an important regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and downstream reproductive physiology. Substantial species differences exist in the localization of cell bodies producing RFRP-3 and patterns of fiber immunoreactivity in the brain, raising the question of functional differences. Many temperate bat species exhibit unusual annual reproductive patterns. Male bats upregulate spermatogenesis in late spring which is asynchronous with periods of mating in the fall, while females have the physiological capacity to delay their reproductive investment over winter via sperm storage or delayed ovulation/fertilization. Neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating reproductive timing in male and female bats are not well-studied. We provide the first description of RFRP – precursor peptide of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone – expression and localization in the brain of any bat using a widespread temperate species (<i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, big brown bat) as a model. RFRP mRNA expression was detected in the hypothalamus, testes, and ovaries of big brown bats. Cellular RFRP-immunoreactivity was observed within the PVN, DMH, arcuate nucleus (Arc) and median eminence (ME). As in other vertebrates, RFRP fiber immunoreactivity was widespread, with greatest density observed in the hypothalamus, POA, ARC, ME, midbrain, and thalamic nuclei. Putative interactions between RFRP-ir fibers and gonadotropin-releasing hormone cell bodies were observed in 16% of GnRH-ir cells, suggesting direct regulation of GnRH via RFRP signaling. This characterization of RFRP distribution contributes to deeper understanding of bat neuroendocrinology which serves as foundation for manipulative approaches examining changes in reproductive neuropeptide signaling in response to environmental and physiological challenges within, and among, bat species.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental resilience of synaptome architecture</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders of genetic origin delay the acquisition of normal abilities and cause disabling phenotypes. Spontaneous attenuation and even complete amelioration of symptoms in early childhood and adolescence occur in many disorders1-10, suggesting that brain circuits possess an intrinsic capacity to repair themselves. We examined the molecular composition of almost a trillion excitatory synapses on a brain-wide scale between birth and adulthood in mice carrying a mutation in the homeobox transcription factor Pax6, a neurodevelopmental disorder model11. Pax6 haploinsufficiency had no impact on total synapse number at any age. By contrast, the postnatal expansion of synapse diversity and acquisition of normal synaptome architecture were delayed in all brain regions, interfering with network and cognitive functions. Specific excitatory synapse types and subtypes were affected in two key developmental age-windows. These phenotypes were reversed within 2-3 weeks of onset, restoring synaptome architecture to its normal developmental trajectory. Synapse subtypes with high rates of protein turnover mediated these events. These results show synaptome remodelling confers resilience to neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neocortical pyramidal neurons with axons emerging from dendrites are frequent in non-primates, but rare in monkey and human</a></h4>

              
                The canonical view of neuronal function is that inputs are received by dendrites and somata, become integrated in the somatodendritic compartment and upon reaching a sufficient threshold, generate axonal output with axons emerging from the cell body. The latter is not necessarily the case. Instead, axons may originate from dendrites. The terms "axon carrying dendrite" (AcD) and "AcD neurons" have been coined to describe this feature. Here, we report on the diversity of axon origins in neocortical pyramidal cells. We found that in non-primates (rodent, cat, ferret, pig), 10-21% of pyramidal cells of layers II-VI had an AcD. In marked contrast, in macaque and human, this proportion was lower, and it was particularly low for supragranular neurons. Unexpectedly, pyramidal cells in the white matter of postnatal cat and aged human cortex exhibit AcDs to much higher percentages. In rodent hippocampus, AcD cells are functionally  privileged, since inputs here can circumvent somatic integration and lead to immediate action potential initiation in the axon. Our findings expand the current knowledge regarding the distribution and proportion of AcD cells in neocortial regions of non-primate taxa, which strikingly differs from primates where these cells are mainly found in deeper layers and white matter.

	<p>Background: a type D personality is a factor in a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s susceptibility to general mental stress, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many studies were conducted on the relationships among stressful situations, an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s personality, depression, and the occurrence of various diseases, e.g., cardiovascular disease or cancer, there are no analogous data on people with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Aim: the assessment of TMDs and depression symptoms in students with type D personality. Material and Methods: the research was carried out with the participation of 240 physiotherapy students. The study group (G1) consisted of 120 participants with type D personalities, the control group (G2) consisted of the same number of participants, without &amp;amp;ldquo;stress&amp;amp;rdquo; personalities. All subjects were assessed for the occurrence of TMD symptoms, as well as for depression and anxiety symptoms, using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), based on the proprietary questionnaire. Results: in students with type D personality symptoms, TMDs occurred significantly more often and in greater number (p = 0.00) than in those without stress personalities. The exception was the symptom of increased muscle tension, which showed no statistical difference (p = 0.22). Among the 240 respondents, depression was found in 128 people (53.3%). In the group of students with type D personalities, depression was significantly more frequent than in the group without type D personalities (p = 0.00). In participants with depression, TMD symptoms were more common, i.e., headaches, neck, and shoulder girdle pain, TMJ acoustic symptoms, increased masticatory muscle tension, teeth clenching, and teeth grinding. There was no significant difference between the incidence of depression and TMJ pain and jaw locking. There was a significant interaction between the occurrence of headaches and acoustic symptoms and the occurrence of depression. For headache and depression interactions, the OR was &amp;amp;gt;1; based on the results, we may assume that a headache depends more on the occurrence of depression rather than it being a symptom of a TMJ disorder in people with type D personalities. Conclusion: type D personality and depression may contribute to the development of TMD symptoms.</p>

	<p>Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) appears in adolescence with myoclonic, absence, and generalized tonic clonic (GTC) seizures with paroxysmal activity of polyspike and slow wave (PSW), or spike and wave (SW) complexes in EEG. Our aim was to analyze the clinical characteristics, background EEG activity, and paroxysmal events in 41 patients with JME. Background EEG activity was analyzed with visual, quantitative (QEEG), and neurometric parameters. Our JME patients started with absence seizures at 11.4 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.5 years old, myoclonic seizures at 13.6 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.5 years, and GTC seizures at 15.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.8 years. The seizures presented in awakening at 7:39 h with sleep deprivation, alcoholic beverage intake, and stress as the most frequent precipitant factors. Paroxysmal activity was of PSW and fast SW complexes with 40.5 &amp;amp;plusmn; 62.6 events/hour and a duration of 1.7 s. Right asymmetric paroxysmal activity was present in 68.3% of patients. Background EEG activity was abnormal in 31.7% of patients with visual analysis. With QEEG beta AP (absolute power) increase and AP delta decrease were the most frequent abnormalities found. Spectral analysis showed that 48.7% of patients had normal results, and 26.83% and 24.4% had higher and lower frequencies than 10.156 Hz, respectively. We concluded that, with visual analysis, background EEG activity was abnormal in a few patients and the abnormalities increased when QEEG was used.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Variants in mitochondrial ATP synthase cause variable neurologic phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>ATP synthase (ATPase) is responsible for the majority of ATP production. Nevertheless, disease phenotypes associated with mutations in ATPase subunits are extremely rare. We aimed at expanding the spectrum of ATPase-related diseases.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing in cohorts with 2,962 mitochondrial-disease- and/or dystonia-diagnosed individuals and international collaboration were used to identify deleterious variants in ATPase-encoding genes. Findings were complemented by transcriptional and proteomic profiling of patient fibroblasts. ATPase integrity and activity were assayed using cells and tissues from five patients.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We present ten total individuals with biallelic or <i>de-novo</i> monoallelic variants in nuclear ATPase subunit genes. Three unrelated patients showed the same homozygous missense <i>ATP5F1E</i> mutation (including one published case). An intronic splice-disrupting alteration in compound heterozygosity with a nonsense variant in <i>ATP5PO</i> was found in one patient. Three patients had <i>de-novo</i> heterozygous missense variants in <i>ATP5F1A</i>, whereas another three were heterozygous for <i>ATP5MC3 de-novo</i> missense changes. Bioinformatics methods and populational data supported the variants` pathogenicity. Immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and/or immunoblotting revealed significantly reduced ATPase amounts in association to <i>ATP5F1E</i> and <i>ATP5PO</i> mutations. Diminished activity and/or defective assembly of ATPase was demonstrated by enzymatic assays and/or immunoblotting in cells bearing <i>ATP5F1A</i>-p.Arg207His, <i>ATP5MC3</i>-p.Gly79Val, and <i>ATP5MC3</i>-p.Asn106Lys. The associated clinical profiles were heterogeneous, ranging from hypotonia with spontaneous resolution (1/10) to epilepsy with early death (1/10) or variable persistent abnormalities including movement disorders, developmental delay, intellectual disability, hyperlactatemia, and other neurologic and systemic features. Although potentially reflecting an ascertainment bias, dystonia was common (7/10).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results establish evidence for a previously unrecognized role of ATPase nuclear-gene defects in phenotypes characterized by neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative features.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The influence of non-neural factors on BOLD signal magnitude</a></h4>

              
                To what extent is the size of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response influenced by factors other than neural activity? In a re-analysis of three neuroimaging datasets, we find large systematic inhomogeneities in the BOLD response magnitude in primary visual cortex (V1): stimulus-evoked BOLD responses, expressed in units of percent signal change, are up to 50% larger along the representation of the horizontal meridian than the vertical meridian. To assess whether this surprising effect can be interpreted as differences in local neural activity, we quantified several factors that potentially contribute to the size of the BOLD response. We find strong relationships between BOLD response magnitude and cortical thickness, cortical curvature, and the presence of large veins. These relationships are consistently found across subjects and suggest that variation in BOLD response magnitudes across cortical locations reflects, in part, differences in anatomy and vascularization. To compensate for these factors, we implement a regression-based correction method and show that after correction, BOLD responses become more homogeneous across V1. The correction reduces the horizontal/vertical difference by about half, indicating that some of the difference is likely not due to neural activity differences. Additionally, we find that while the cerebral sinuses overlap with the vertical meridian representation in V1, they do not explain the observed horizontal/vertical difference. We conclude that interpretation of variation in BOLD response magnitude across cortical locations should consider the influence of the potential confounding factors of cortical thickness, curvature, and vascularization.

Significance statementThe magnitude of the BOLD signal is often used as a surrogate of neural activity, but the exact factors that contribute to its strength have not been studied on a voxel-wise level. Here, we examined several anatomical and measurement-related factors to assess their relationship with BOLD magnitude. We find that BOLD magnitude correlates with cortical anatomy and macrovasculature. To remove the contribution of these factors, we propose a simple, data-driven model that can be used in any functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. After accounting for the confounding factors, BOLD magnitude becomes more spatially homogenous. Our correction method improves the ability to make more accurate inferences about local neural activity from fMRI data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EMX2 transcriptionally regulates Nfib expression in neural progenitor cells during early cortical development.</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear factor one (NFI) transcription factors play key roles in regulating the onset of both neuronal and glial differentiation during cortical development. Reduced NFI expression results in delayed differentiation, which is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans that include intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum and macrocephaly. Despite their importance, our understanding of how individual NFI family members are regulated during cortical development remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that in mice, the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 regulates Nfib expression in radial glial cells during cortical development. Using a combination of bioinformatics, molecular and histological approaches, we demonstrate that EMX2 is able to bind to the Nfib promoter to up-regulate Nfib expression. Unexpectedly, in vivo over-expression of EMX2 in wildtype animals does not further up-regulate NFIB but instead leads to its down-regulation. Therefore, our findings suggest that EMX2 is capable of both activating and repressing Nfib, in a context-dependent manner. This bi-directional control over Nfib expression enables fine-tuning of the total level of NFI proteins expressed and could be important for cell-type specific NFI functions.

	<p>Dyslexia, a specific reading disability, is a common (up to 10% of children) and highly heritable (~70%) neurodevelopmental disorder. Behavioral and molecular genetic approaches are aimed towards dissecting its significant genetic component. In the proposed review, we will summarize advances in twin and molecular genetic research from the past 20 years. First, we will briefly outline the clinical and educational presentation and epidemiology of dyslexia. Next, we will summarize results from twin studies, followed by molecular genetic research (e.g., genome-wide association studies (GWASs)). In particular, we will highlight converging key insights from genetic research. (1) Dyslexia is a highly polygenic neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex genetic architecture. (2) Dyslexia categories share a large proportion of genetics with continuously distributed measures of reading skills, with shared genetic risks also seen across development. (3) Dyslexia genetic risks are shared with those implicated in many other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., developmental language disorder and dyscalculia). Finally, we will discuss the implications and future directions. As the diversity of genetic studies continues to increase through international collaborate efforts, we will highlight the challenges in advances of genetics discoveries in this field.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic causes increased mental stress and decreased mobility, which may affect people with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). The study aimed to investigate the secondary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of activity, quality of life (QoL) and PD-related symptoms. The respondents completed an online survey in Polish in the period from December, 2020 to June, 2021. The questionnaire was completed by 47 participants aged 43 to 90 years (mean 72.1 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.3 years). A total of 94% reported reduced contact with family and friends. Over 90% remained active during the pandemic. However, 55% of people with PD showed subjectively lower level of activity then before the pandemic. Moreover, 36% of the respondents felt afraid to visit a doctor and reported problems with access to medication. Subjective QoL reduction was reported by 80%, and 83% declared worsening of PD symptoms. The post pandemic deterioration of motor symptoms in people with PD did not affect their QoL. However, the deterioration of contacts and feelings of isolation had a significant impact on the decline in quality of life (p = 0.022 and p = 0.009, respectively) and the presence of anxiety (p = 0.035 and p = 0.007, respectively). These results may indicate than greater importance of social and mental factors than fitness and health-related factors in the QoL self-assessment of the people with PD.</p>

	<p>Central pain disorders, such as central post-stroke pain, remain clinically challenging to treat, despite many decades of pharmacological advances and the evolution of neuromodulation. For treatment refractory cases, previous studies have highlighted some benefits of cortical stimulation. Recent advances in new targets for pain and the optimization of neuromodulation encouraged our group to develop a dual cortical target approach paired with Bayesian optimization to provide a personalized treatment. Here, we present a case report of a woman who developed left-sided facial pain after multiple thalamic strokes. All previous pharmacologic and interventional treatments failed to mitigate the pain, leaving her incapacitated due to pain and medication side effects. She subsequently underwent a single burr hole for placement of motor cortex (M1) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) paddles for stimulation with externalization. By using Bayesian optimization to find optimal stimulation parameters and stimulation sites, we were able to reduce pain from an 8.5/10 to a 0/10 during a 5-day inpatient stay, with pain staying at or below a 2/10 one-month post-procedure. We found optimal treatment to be simultaneous stimulation of M1 and dlPFC without any evidence of seizure induction. In addition, we found no worsening in cognitive performance during a working memory task with dlPFC stimulation. This personalized approach using Bayesian optimization may provide a new foundation for treating central pain and other functional disorders through systematic evaluation of stimulation parameters.</p>

	<p>Due to the significant functional repercussions suffered by patients with dual disorder, we must evaluate which ones can benefit from intensive rehabilitative therapies in medium-stay psychiatric units. This was a retrospective study of patient medical records which intended to analyze sociodemographic and clinical variables and parameters related to the hospitalization and discharge of patients admitted to the Medium-Stay Unit (MSU) at the Castell&amp;amp;oacute;n Provincial Hospital Consortium over 2 years (2017 and 2018), according to the presence or absence of dual disorders in these patients. Patients with a dual disorder represented 55.2% of the hospitalized patients. A higher proportion of them were male, were relatively younger, and had an earlier onset of mental illness, fewer associated medical pathologies, and shorter hospital admission times to the Short-Term Hospitalization Unit than those who did not present a dual disorder. A diagnosis on the schizophrenia spectrum with cannabis use or polyconsumption was the most common diagnosis; 98.2% of all the patients responded adequately to admission to the MSU. This work highlighted the need for higher doses of depot paliperidone in patients with dual disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Human oligodendrocyte myelination potential; relation to age and differentiation</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Myelin regeneration in the human central nervous system relies on progenitor cells within the tissue parenchyma, with possible contribution from previously myelinating oligodendrocytes. In multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating disorder, variables affecting remyelination efficiency include age, severity of initial injury, and progenitor cell properties. Our aim was to investigate the effects of age and differentiation on the myelination potential of human oligodendrocyte lineage cells.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We derived viable primary oligodendrocyte lineage cells from surgical resections of pediatric and adult brain tissue. Ensheathment capacity using nanofiber assays and transcriptomic profiles from RNA sequencing were compared between A2B5+ antibody-selected progenitors and mature oligodendrocytes (non-selected cells).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We demonstrate that pediatric progenitor and mature cells ensheathed nanofibers more robustly than did adult progenitor and mature cells respectively. Within both age groups, the percentage of fibers ensheathed and ensheathment length per fiber were greater for A2B5+ progenitors. Gene expression of oligodendrocyte progenitor markers <i>PDGFRA</i> and <i>PTPRZ1</i> were higher in A2B5+ vs A2B5- cells and in pediatric A2B5+ vs adult A2B5+ cells. p38 MAP kinases and actin cytoskeleton-associated pathways were upregulated in pediatric cells; both have been shown to regulate OL process outgrowth. Significant upregulation of “cell senescence” genes was detected in pediatric samples; this could reflect their role in development and the increased susceptibility of pediatric oligodendrocytes to activating cell death responses to stress.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings identify specific biological pathways relevant to myelination that are differentially enriched in human pediatric and adult oligodendrocyte lineage cells and suggest potential targets for remyelination enhancing therapies.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe cerebrovascular, neuropathic and autonomic features of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This retrospective study evaluated consecutive patients with chronic fatigue, brain fog and orthostatic intolerance consistent with PASC. Controls included postural tachycardia syndrome patients (POTS) and healthy participants. Analyzed data included surveys and autonomic (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, sudomotor and tilt tests), cerebrovascular (cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) monitoring in middle cerebral artery), respiratory (capnography monitoring) and neuropathic (skin biopsies for assessment of small fiber neuropathy) testing and inflammatory/autoimmune markers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine PASC patients were evaluated 0.7±0.3 years after a mild COVID-19 infection, treated as home observations. Autonomic, pain, brain fog, fatigue and dyspnea surveys were abnormal in PASC and POTS (n=10), compared to controls (n=15). Tilt table test reproduced the majority of PASC symptoms. Orthostatic CBFv declined in PASC (-20.0±13.4%) and POTS (-20.3±15.1%), compared to controls (-3.0±7.5%,p=0.001) and was independent of end-tidal carbon dioxide in PASC, but caused by hyperventilation in POTS. Reduced orthostatic CBFv in PASC included both subjects without (n=6) and with (n=3) orthostatic tachycardia. Dysautonomia was frequent (100% in both PASC and POTS) but was milder in PASC (p=0.013). PASC and POTS cohorts diverged in frequency of small fiber neuropathy (89% vs. 60%) but not in inflammatory markers (67% vs. 70%). Supine and orthostatic hypocapnia was observed in PASC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PASC following mild COVID-19 infection is associated with multisystem involvement including: 1) cerebrovascular dysregulation with persistent cerebral arteriolar vasoconstriction; 2) small fiber neuropathy and related dysautonomia; 3) respiratory dysregulation; 4) chronic inflammation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reward priming differentially modulates enhancement and inhibition in auditory decision-making</a></h4>

              
                In cognitive sciences, rewards, such as money and food, play a fundamental role in individuals daily lives and well-being. Moreover, rewards that are irrelevant to the task alter individuals behavior. However, it is unclear whether explicit knowledge of reward irrelevancy has an impact on reward priming enhancements and inhibition. In this study, an auditory change-detection task with task-irrelevant rewards was introduced. The participants were informed explicitly in advance that the rewards would be given randomly. The results revealed that while inhibition related to reward priming only occurred when the participants were explicitly informed about rewards, implicit instruction thereof resulted in enhancement and inhibition associated with reward priming. These findings highlight the contribution of explicit information about rewards associated with auditory decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cell-type specific neuromodulation of excitatory and inhibitory neurons via muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in layer 4 of rat barrel cortex</a></h4>

              
                The neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) plays an important role in arousal, attention, vigilance, learning and memory. ACh is released during different behavioural states and affects the brain microcircuit by regulating neuronal and synaptic properties. Here, we investigated how a low concentration of ACh (30 {micro}M) affects the intrinsic properties of electrophysiologically and morphologically identified excitatory and inhibitory neurons in layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex. ACh altered the membrane potential of L4 neurons in a heterogeneous manner. Nearly all L4 regular spiking (RS) neurons responded to bath-application of ACh with a M4 muscarinic ACh receptor-mediated hyperpolarisation. In contrast, in the majority of L4 fast spiking (FS) and non-fast spiking (nFS) interneurons 30 {micro}M ACh induced a depolarisation while the remainder showed a hyperpolarisation or no response. The ACh-induced depolarisation of L4 FS interneurons was much weaker than that in L4 nFS interneurons. There was no clear difference in the response to ACh for three morphological subtypes of L4 FS interneurons. However, in four morpho-electrophysiological subtypes of L4 nFS interneurons, VIP+-like interneurons showed the strongest ACh-induced depolarisation; occasionally, even action potential (AP) firing was elicited. The ACh-induced depolarisation in L4 FS interneurons was exclusively mediated by M1 muscarinic ACh receptors; in L4 nFS interneurons it was mainly mediated by M1 and/or M3/5 muscarinic ACh receptors. In a subset of L4 nFS interneurons, a co-operative activation of nicotinic ACh receptors was also observed. The present study demonstrates that low-concentrations of ACh affect the different L4 neurons types in a cell-type specific way. These effects result from a specific expression of different muscarinic and/or nicotinic ACh receptors on the somatodendritic compartments of L4 neurons. This suggests that even at low concentrations ACh may tune the excitability of L4 excitatory and inhibitory neurons and their synaptic microcircuits differentially depending on the behavioural state during which ACh is released.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in autism: the role of glutamate and GABA gene-sets in symptoms and cortical brain structure</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundThe excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance hypothesis posits that an imbalance between excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) mechanisms underlies the behavioral characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (autism). However, how E/I imbalance arises and how it may differ across autism symptomatology and brain regions is not well understood.

MethodsWe used innovative analysis methods - combining competitive gene-set analysis and gene-expression profiles in relation to cortical thickness (CT)- to investigate the relationship between genetic variance, brain structure and autism symptomatology of participants from the EU-AIMS LEAP cohort (autism=360, male/female=259/101; neurotypical control participants=279, male/female=178/101) aged 6 to 30 years. Competitive gene-set analysis investigated associations between glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling pathway gene-sets and clinical measures, and CT. Additionally, we investigated expression profiles of the genes within those sets throughout the brain and how those profiles relate to differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants in the same regions.

ResultsThe glutamate gene-set was associated with all autism symptom severity scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2) and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) within the autistic group, while the GABA set was associated with sensory processing measures (using the SSP subscales) across all participants. Brain regions with greater gene expression of both glutamate and GABA genes showed greater differences in CT between autistic and neurotypical control participants.

ConclusionsOur results suggest crucial roles for glutamate and GABA genes in autism symptomatology as well as CT, where GABA is more strongly associated with sensory processing and glutamate more with autism symptom severity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic scrambling of hippocampal theta oscillations alters working memory retrieval but not hippocampal spatiotemporal codes</a></h4>

              
                The precise temporal coordination of activity in the brain is thought to be fundamental for memory encoding and retrieval. The medial septum (MS) provides the largest source of innervation to the hippocampus (HPC), and its inhibitory neurons play a major role in controlling HPC theta ([~]8 Hz) oscillations. While pharmacological inhibition of the MS is associated with memory impairment, the exact role of MS inhibitory neurons in HPC function and memory is not fully understood. While HPC place cells were previously reported to not depend on MS inputs, the exact role of MS inputs on HPC temporal codes is still a matter of debate. Moreover, pharmacological manipulations do not have the temporal resolution to distinguish the role of MS activity on working memory encoding, retention and retrieval. Here we stimulated the MS with optogenetics to either pace or ablate theta, while recording large hippocampal assemblies over time using calcium imaging along with local field potentials to monitor theta control. Using scrambled light stimulation, we could robustly ablate theta signals, which was associated with direct modulation of a subpopulation of neurons in the HPC. We found that such stimulation led to decreased working memory retrieval, but not encoding in both a delayed non-match to sample task and a novel place object recognition task. Strikingly, scrambled stimulations were not associated with disrupted spatiotemporal codes. Importantly, we show that our opsin did not transfect cholinergic cells and stimulation did not disrupt HPC ripple activity or running speed, suggesting a specific role for MS GABAergic cells in memory maintenance and retrieval that is independent from these other potential confounding mechanisms. Our study suggests that theta signals play a specific and essential role in supporting working memory retrieval and maintenance while not being necessary for hippocampal spatiotemporal codes.

	<p>Contact and collision sports are believed to accelerate brain aging. Postmortem studies of the human brain have implicated tau deposition in and around the perivascular space as a biomarker of an as yet poorly understood neurodegenerative process. Relatively little is known about the effects that collision sport participation has on the age-related trajectories of macroscale brain structure and function, particularly in female athletes. Diffusion MRI and resting-state functional MRI were obtained from female collision sport athletes (n = 19 roller derby (RD) players; 23&amp;amp;ndash;45 years old) and female control participants (n = 14; 20&amp;amp;ndash;49 years old) to quantify structural coupling (SC) and decoupling (SD). The novel and interesting finding is that RD athletes, but not controls, exhibited increasing SC with age in two association networks: the frontoparietal network, important for cognitive control, and default-mode network, a task-negative network (permuted p = 0.0006). Age-related increases in SC were also observed in sensorimotor networks (RD, controls) and age-related increases in SD were observed in association networks (controls) (permuted p &amp;amp;le; 0.0001). These distinct patterns suggest that competing in RD results in compressed neuronal timescales in critical networks as a function of age and encourages the broader study of female athlete brains across the lifespan.</p>

     alt="Anesthesia in mice activates discrete populations of neurons throughout the brain"/>
<p>The use of transgenic TRAP*TB mice permitted visualization of neurons active during a first stage experimental condition (red) as well as neurons active during a second stage condition (green). Results varied by brain regions of interest. In PvH nearly all active neurons proved to be anesthesia-on. In PV the proportion was 11:8.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain undergoes rapid, dramatic, and reversible transitioning between states of wakefulness and unconsciousness during natural sleep and in pathological conditions such as hypoxia, hypotension, and concussion. Transitioning can also be induced pharmacologically using general anesthetic agents. The effect is selective. Mobility, sensory perception, memory formation, and awareness are lost while numerous housekeeping functions persist. How is selective transitioning accomplished? Classically a handful of brainstem and diencephalic “arousal nuclei” have been implicated in driving brain-state transitions on the grounds that their net activity systematically varies with brain state. Here we used transgenic targeted recombination in active populations mice to label neurons active during wakefulness with one reporter and neurons active during pentobarbital-induced general anesthesia with a second, contrasting reporter. We found ‘wake-on’ and ‘anesthesia-on’ neurons in widely distributed regions-of-interest, but rarely encountered neurons labeled with both reporters. Nearly all labeled neurons were either wake-on or anesthesia-on. Thus, anesthesia-on neurons are not unique to the few nuclei discovered to date whose activity appears to increase during anesthesia. Rather neuronal populations selectively active during anesthesia are located throughout the brain where they likely play a causative role in transitioning between wakefulness and anesthesia. The widespread neuronal suppression reported in prior comparisons of the awake and anesthetized brain in animal models and noninvasive imaging in humans reflects only net differences. It misses the ubiquitous presence of neurons whose activity increases during anesthesia. The balance in recruitment of anesthesia-on versus wake-on neuronal populations throughout the brain may be a key driver of regional and global vigilance states.</p>

     alt="Sub-second transient activated patterns to sad expressions in major depressive disorders discovered via hidden Markov model"/>
<p>We explored the comprehensive processing framework of negative emotional stimuli in patients with major depressive disorders. With a well-established hidden Markov model, the whole processing was segmented into three dynamic states via brain functions, and temporal–spatial dynamic dysfunction was found during different task stages in depression.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pathological mechanisms of major depressive disorders (MDDs) is associated with the overexpression of negative emotions, and the fast transient-activated patterns underlying overrepresentation in depression still remain to be revealed to date. We hypothesized that the aberrant spatiotemporal attributes of the process of sad expressions are related to the neuropathology of MDD and help to detect the depression severity. We enrolled a total of 96 subjects including 47 patients with MDD and 49 healthy controls (HCs), and recorded their magnetoencephalography data under a sad expression recognition task. A hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to separate the whole neural activity into several brain states, then to characterize the dynamics. To find the disrupted temporal–spatial characteristics, power estimations and fractional occupancy (FO) of each state were estimated and contrasted between MDDs and HCs. Three states were found over the period of emotional stimuli processing procedure. The early visual stage (0–270 ms) was mainly manifested by state 1, and the emotional information processing stage (270–600 ms) was manifested by state 2, while the state 3 remained a steady proportion across the whole period. MDDs activated statistically more in limbic system during state 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.0045) and less in frontoparietal control network during state 3 (<i>p =</i> 5.38 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) relative to HCs. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were significantly correlated with the predicted disorder severity using FO values (<i>p</i> = 0.0062, <i>r</i> = 0.3933). Relative to HCs, MDDs perceived the sad contents quickly and spent more time overexpressing the negative emotions. These phenomena indicated MDD patients might easily indulge in negative emotion and neglect other things. Furthermore, temporal descriptors built by HMM could be potential biomarkers for identifying the severity of depression disorders.</p>

     alt="Hemispheric cortical atrophy and chronic microglial activation following mild focal ischemic stroke in adult male rats"/>
<p>Localised injection of ET-1 to the motor cortex resulted in focal ischemic damage causing neuronal loss. Despite the asymptomatic nature of this model of stroke, lacking motor or cognitive impairment, chronic inflammation and hemispheric atrophy developed over time. These findings highlight that even mild stroke can result in long-term pathological outcomes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Animal modeling has played an important role in our understanding of the pathobiology of stroke. The vast majority of this research has focused on the acute phase following severe forms of stroke that result in clear behavioral deficits. Human stroke, however, can vary widely in severity and clinical outcome. There is a rapidly building body of work suggesting that milder ischemic insults can precipitate functional impairment, including cognitive decline, that continues through the chronic phase after injury. Here we show that a small infarction localized to the frontal motor cortex of rats following injection of endothelin-1 results in an essentially asymptomatic state based on motor and cognitive testing, and yet produces significant histopathological change including remote atrophy and inflammation that persists up to 1 year. While there is understandably a major focus in stroke research on mitigating the acute consequences of primary infarction, these results point to progressive atrophy and chronic inflammation as additional targets for intervention in the chronic phase after injury. The present rodent model provides an important platform for further work in this area.</p>

<p>The exercise during the adult life of the offspring, associated with iron supplementation during the pregnancies, proved to be of benefit. However, no relation was found between iron restriction in fetal programming and the occurrence of restless legs syndrome phenotype.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Iron restriction during pregnancy can lead to iron deficiency and changes in the dopaminergic system in the adulthood of offspring, and restless legs syndrome (RLS) is closely related to these changes. Objectives: Analyze whether iron restriction during pregnancy would cause changes in the behavior, sleep, and dopaminergic system of the male offspring. In addition, we aimed to assess whether exercise would be able to modulate these variables. The pregnant rats (Wistar) were divided into four groups with different concentrations of iron in the diet: standard (St), supplementation (Su), restriction since weaning (R1), and restriction only during pregnancy (R2). After birth, the offspring were assigned to their respective groups according to the dams diet (St, Su, R1, and R2) and distributed into sedentary (SD) and exercised (EX) (for 8 weeks of training), reaching eight groups of offspring (O): OSt SD, OSt EX, OSu SD, OSu EX, OR1 SD, OR1 EX, OR2 SD, and OR2 EX. Sleep, behavior, and analysis of key genes of dopaminergic system (D2, DAT) were performed after 8 weeks. The results for trained offspring that the mother received supplementation diet were the most expressive, with increased freezing and the OR1 SD group showed an increase in DAT protein content. These changes may have been due to the association between the dams diet during pregnancy and the practice of exercise by the offspring. The different concentrations of iron during pregnancy caused changes in the offspring, however, they were not associated with fetal programming in the context of RLS.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Much evidence has proved that excitotoxicity induced by excessive release of glutamate contributes largely to damage caused by ischemia. In view of the key role played by NMDA receptors in mediating excitotoxicity, compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways have become the most promising type of anti-stroke candidate compounds. However, the limited therapeutic time window for neuroprotection is a key factor preventing NMDA receptor-related compounds from showing efficacy in all clinical trials for ischemic stroke. In this perspective, the determination of therapeutic time windows of these kinds of compounds is useful in ensuring a therapeutic effect and accelerating clinical application. This mini-review discussed the therapeutic time windows of compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways, described related influence factors and the status of clinical studies. The purpose of this review is to look for compounds with wide therapeutic time windows and better clinical application prospect.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and affective disorders are frequently comorbid and share underlying mechanisms that could be targets for comprehensive treatment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has high comorbidity with AUD, but comprehensive models of this overlap are nascent. We recently characterized a model of comorbid AUD and PTSD-like symptoms, wherein stressed rats receive an inhibitory avoidance (IA)-related footshock on two occasions followed by two-bottle choice (2BC) voluntary alcohol drinking. Stressed rats received the second footshock in a familiar (FAM, same IA box as the first footshock) or novel context (NOV, single-chambered apparatus); the FAM paradigm more effectively increased alcohol drinking in males and the NOV paradigm in females. During abstinence, stressed males displayed avoidance-like PTSD symptoms, and females showed hyperarousal-like PTSD symptoms. Rats in the model had altered spontaneous action potential-independent GABAergic transmission in the central amygdala (CeA), a brain region key in alcohol dependence and stress-related signaling. However, PTSD sufferers may have alcohol experience prior to their trauma. Here, we therefore modified our AUD/PTSD comorbidity model to provide 3 weeks of intermittent extended alcohol access before footshock and then studied the effects of NOV and FAM stress on drinking and PTSD phenotypes. NOV stress suppressed the escalation of alcohol intake and preference seen in male controls, but no stress effects were seen on drinking in females. Additionally, NOV males had decreased action potential-independent presynaptic GABA release and delayed postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor kinetics in the CeA compared to control and FAM males. Despite these changes to alcohol intake and CeA GABA signaling, stressed rats showed broadly similar anxiogenic-like behaviors to our previous comorbid model, suggesting decoupling of the PTSD symptoms from the AUD vulnerability for some of these animals. The collective results show the importance of alcohol history and trauma context in vulnerability to comorbid AUD/PTSD-like symptoms.</p>

     alt="Mapping the corticoreticular pathway from cortex-wide anterograde axonal tracing in the mouse"/>
<p>The mouse corticoreticular pathway (CRP) originates from widespread parts of the cortex, including the primary motor (M1), secondary motor (M2), anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and primary somatosensory (S1) areas. Compared with the corticospinal tract, the CRP is more distributed and bilaterally projecting, suggesting greater resilience to complete disruption.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The corticoreticular pathway (CRP) has been implicated as an important mediator of motor recovery and rehabilitation after central nervous system damage. However, its origins, trajectory and laterality are not well understood. This study mapped the mouse CRP in comparison with the corticospinal tract (CST). We systematically searched the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (© 2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science) for experiments that used anterograde tracer injections into the right isocortex in mice. For each eligible experiment (<i>N</i> = 607), CRP and CST projection strength were quantified by the tracer volume reaching the reticular formation motor nuclei (RF<sub>motor</sub>) and pyramids, respectively. Tracer density in each brain voxel was also correlated with RF<sub>motor</sub> versus pyramids projection strength to explore the relative trajectories of the CRP and CST. We found significant CRP projections originating from the primary and secondary motor cortices, anterior cingulate, primary somatosensory cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. Compared with the CST, the CRP had stronger projections from each region except the primary somatosensory cortex. Ipsilateral projections were stronger than contralateral for both tracts (above the pyramidal decussation), but the CRP projected more bilaterally than the CST. The estimated CRP trajectory was anteromedial to the CST in the internal capsule and dorsal to the CST in the brainstem. Our findings reveal a widespread distribution of CRP origins and confirm strong bilateral CRP projections, theoretically increasing the potential for partial sparing after brain lesions and contralesional compensation after unilateral injury.</p>
