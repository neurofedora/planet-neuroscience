<p>The VGLUT2-expressing cardiac afferent fibers of spinal and vagal origin were mapped by using the VGLUT2::tdTomato double transgenic mouse model. The whole hearts were visualized both at the dorsal and ventral sides. A remarkable diversity of spinal afferent nerve ending morphologies of flower sprays, intramuscular endings, and end-net branches were shown to innervate distinct anatomical parts of the healthy and post-MI hearts. Remodeling of cardiac afferents post-MI was demonstrated for the first time at the border zone and scar area.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The sensory nervous system is critical to maintain cardiac function. As opposed to efferent innervation, less is known about cardiac afferents. For this, we mapped the VGLUT2-expressing cardiac afferent fibers of spinal and vagal origin by using the VGLUT2::tdTomato double transgenic mouse as an approach to visualize the whole hearts both at the dorsal and ventral sides. For comparison, we colabeled mixed-sex transgenic hearts with either TUJ1 protein for global cardiac innervation or tyrosine hydroxylase for the sympathetic network at the healthy state or following ischemic injury. Interestingly, the nerve density for global and VGLUT2-expressing afferents was found significantly higher on the dorsal side compared to the ventral side. From the global nerve innervation detected by TUJ1 immunoreactivity, VGLUT2 afferent innervation was detected to be 15–25% of the total network. The detailed characterization of both the atria and the ventricles revealed a remarkable diversity of spinal afferent nerve ending morphologies of flower sprays, intramuscular endings, and end-net branches that innervate distinct anatomical parts of the heart. Using this integrative approach in a chronic myocardial infarct model, we showed a significant increase in hyperinnervation in the form of axonal sprouts for cardiac afferents at the infarct border zone, as well as denervation at distal sites of the ischemic area. The functional and physiological consequences of the abnormal sensory innervation remodeling post-ischemic injury should be further evaluated in future studies regarding their potential contribution to cardiac dysfunction.</p>

	<p>The long-term burden of symptoms is an important outcome in bipolar disorder (BD). A method which has minimal burden of assessment uses a retrospective interview, the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Examination (LIFE), although this may be subject to problems with recall. This study examines the relationship between the retrospective LIFE scale and concurrently-rated mood rating scales in two clinical trials of 18 months of psychotherapy for patients with BD. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) were administered every eight to nine weeks and the LIFE was carried out every 6 months. Correlations between scores on mood rating scales and at equivalent times on the LIFE were examined, as well as of potential clinical moderators. There were significant correlations between LIFE depression ratings and concurrent MADRS score (r = 0.57) and between LIFE mania ratings and YMRS score (r = 0.40). In determining &amp;amp;ldquo;mild depression&amp;amp;rdquo; on the MADRS, a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed an AUC of 0.78 for LIFE scores. Correlations, particularly for depression scores, were high even when the LIFE rating was several months before the interview, suggesting that the LIFE has validity in examining the burden of mood symptoms over time, with relatively little burden of assessment. Future research should examine the relationship between symptom burden and quality of life measured in this way.</p>

	<p>There are multiple forms of knowledge about people. Whether diverse person-related data interact is of interest regarding the more general issue of integration of multi-source information about the world. Our goal was to examine whether perception of a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s face or voice enhanced the encoding of their biographic data. We performed three experiments. In the first experiment, subjects learned the biographic data of a character with or without a video clip of their face. In the second experiment, they learned the character&amp;amp;rsquo;s data with an audio clip of either a generic narrator&amp;amp;rsquo;s voice or the character&amp;amp;rsquo;s voice relating the same biographic information. In the third experiment, an audiovisual clip of both the face and voice of either a generic narrator or the character accompanied the learning of biographic data. After learning, a test phase presented biographic data alone, and subjects were tested first for familiarity and second for matching of biographic data to the name. The results showed equivalent learning of biographic data across all three experiments, and none showed evidence that a character&amp;amp;rsquo;s face or voice enhanced the learning of biographic information. We conclude that the simultaneous processing of perceptual representations of people may not modulate the encoding of biographic data.</p>

	<p>Skin erosion is a hardware-related complication commonly described after deep brain stimulation (DBS). Hardware exposure is often associated with the development of infection that can lead to implant removal. However, in selected cases, it is possible to manage skin erosion without having to remove the hardware. This article presents the case of a patient with recurrent skin erosions above the IPG, who underwent multiple surgeries. Given the failure of less invasive approaches, a more complex surgery with the employment of a pedunculated flap of pectoralis major in order to cover the IPG was attempted. Nevertheless, the IPG removal was finally unavoidable, resulting in a rapid decline in clinical performance. This illustrative case suggests how, in patients with sustained stimulation who benefit from a good degree of autonomy, it may be useful to use invasive surgical techniques to resolve skin erosions and save the DBS system. In spite of everything, sometimes complete or partial removal of the implant still becomes unavoidable, but this can lead to a severe worsening of PD symptoms. Definitive removal of the system should therefore be considered only in cases of frank infection or after failure of all other approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Protective Effect of Social Reward on Opioid and Psychostimulant Reward and Relapse: Behavior, Pharmacology, and Brain Regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Until recently, most modern neuroscience research on addiction using animal models did not incorporate manipulations of social factors. Social factors play a critical role in human addiction: social isolation and exclusion can promote drug use and relapse, while social connections and inclusion tend to be protective. Here, we discuss the state of the literature on social factors in animal models of opioid and psychostimulant preference, self-administration, and relapse. We first summarize results from rodent studies on behavioral, pharmacological, and circuit mechanisms of the protective effect of traditional experimenter-controlled social interaction procedures on opioid and psychostimulant conditioned place preference, self-administration, and relapse. Next, we summarize behavioral and brain-mechanism results from studies using newer operant social-interaction procedures that inhibit opioid and psychostimulant self-administration and relapse. We conclude by discussing how the reviewed studies point to future directions for the addiction field and other neuroscience and psychiatric fields, and their implications for mechanistic understanding of addiction and development of new treatments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this review, we propose that incorporating social factors into modern neuroscience research on addiction could improve mechanistic accounts of addiction and help close gaps in translating discovery to treatment. We first summarize rodent studies on behavioral, pharmacological, and circuit mechanisms of the protective effect of both traditional experimenter-controlled and newer operant social-interaction procedures. We then discuss potential future directions and clinical implications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Brief Opioid Exposure Paradoxically Augments Primary Afferent Input to Spinal Excitatory Neurons via {alpha}2{delta}-1-Dependent Presynaptic NMDA Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Treatment with opioids not only inhibits nociceptive transmission but also elicits a rebound and persistent increase in primary afferent input to the spinal cord. Opioid-elicited long-term potentiation (LTP) from TRPV1-expressing primary afferents plays a major role in opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance. Here, we determined whether opioid-elicited LTP involves vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGluT2) or vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn of male and female mice and identified underlying signaling mechanisms. Spinal cord slice recordings revealed that &micro;-opioid receptor (MOR) stimulation with DAMGO initially inhibited dorsal root&ndash;evoked EPSCs in 87% VGluT2 neurons and subsequently induced LTP in 49% of these neurons. Repeated morphine treatment increased the prevalence of VGluT2 neurons displaying LTP with a short onset latency. In contrast, DAMGO inhibited EPSCs in 46% VGAT neurons but did not elicit LTP in any VGAT neurons even in morphine-treated mice. Spinal superficial laminae were densely innervated by MOR-containing nerve terminals and were occupied by mostly VGluT2 neurons and few VGAT neurons. Furthermore, conditional <I>Grin1</I> knockout in dorsal root ganglion neurons diminished DAMGO-elicited LTP in lamina II neurons and attenuated hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance induced by repeated treatment with morphine. In addition, DAMGO-elicited LTP in VGluT2 neurons was abolished by protein kinase C inhibition, gabapentin, <I>Cacna2d1</I> knockout, or disrupting the &alpha;2-1&ndash;NMDA receptor interaction with an &alpha;2-1 C terminus peptide. Thus, brief MOR stimulation distinctively potentiates nociceptive primary afferent input to excitatory dorsal horn neurons via &alpha;2-1&ndash;coupled presynaptic NMDA receptors, thereby causing hyperalgesia and reducing analgesic actions of opioids.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Opioid drugs are potent analgesics for treating severe pain and are commonly used during general anesthesia. However, opioid use often induces pain hypersensitivity, rapid loss of analgesic efficacy, and dose escalation, which can cause dependence, addiction, and even overdose fatality. This study demonstrates for the first time that brief opioid exposure preferentially augments primary sensory input to genetically identified glutamatergic excitatory, but not GABAergic/glycinergic inhibitory, neurons in nociceptive dorsal horn circuits. This opioid-elicited synaptic plasticity is cell type specific and mediated by protein kinase C&ndash;dependent and &alpha;2-1&ndash;dependent activation of NMDA receptors at primary sensory nerve terminals. These findings elucidate how intraoperative use of opioids for preemptive analgesia paradoxically aggravates postoperative pain and increases opioid consumption and suggest new strategies to improve opioid analgesic efficacy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Recovery of Submodality Touch Neurons and Interareal Communication in Sensory Input-Deprived Area 3b and S2 Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical reactivation and regain of interareal functional connections have been linked to the recovery of hand grasping behavior after loss of sensory inputs in primates. We investigated contributions of neurons in two hierarchically organized somatosensory areas, 3b and S2, by characterizing local field potential (LFP) and multiunit spiking activity in five states (rest, stimulus-on, sustained, stimulus-off, and induced) and interareal communication after grasping behavior of dorsal column lesioned male squirrel monkeys had mostly recovered. Compared with normal cortex, fMRI, LFP, and spiking response magnitudes to step indentations were significantly weaker. The sustained component of the spiking recovered much better than the stimulus-off response. Correlation between overall spiking and  LFP remained strong within each recovered areas 3b and S2. The interareal correlations of  LFP were severely disrupted, except in the resting and stimulus-on periods. Interareal correlation of spiking was disrupted in the stimulus-off period only. In summary, submodality of low threshold mechanoreceptive neurons recovered differentially in input-deprived area 3b and S2 when impaired global hand grasping behavior returned. Slow-adapting-like neurons recovered, whereas rapid-adapting-like neurons did not. Interareal communications were also severely compromised. We propose that slow-adapting-like neurons and afferents in recovered area 3b and S2 mediate recovery of impaired grasping behavior after dorsal column tract lesion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory feedback is essential for execution of hand grasping behavior in primates. Reactivations of somatosensory cortices have been attributed to recovery of such behavior after loss of sensory inputs via largely unknown mechanisms. In input-deprived area 3b and S2 cortex, after hand grasping behavior mostly recovered, we found slow-adapting-like neurons were greatly recovered, whereas rapid-adapting-like neurons did not. Communications between area 3b and S2 neurons were severely compromised. We suggest that recovery of slow-adapting-like neurons in input-deprived area 3b and S2 may mediate the recovery of hand grasping behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Accounting for Bias in the Estimation of r2 between Two Sets of Noisy Neural Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Pearson correlation coefficient squared, <I>r</I><sup>2</sup>, is an important tool used in the analysis of neural data to quantify the similarity between neural tuning curves. Yet this metric is biased by trial-to-trial variability; as trial-to-trial variability increases, measured correlation decreases. Major lines of research are confounded by this bias, including those involving the study of invariance of neural tuning across conditions and the analysis of the similarity of tuning across neurons. To address this, we extend an estimator, <f></f>, that was recently developed for estimating model-to-neuron correlation, in which a noisy signal is compared with a noise-free prediction, to the case of neuron-to-neuron correlation, in which two noisy signals are compared with each other. We compare the performance of our novel estimator to a prior method developed by Spearman, commonly used in other fields but widely overlooked in neuroscience, and find that our method has less bias. We then apply our estimator to demonstrate how it avoids drastic confounds introduced by trial-to-trial variability using data collected in two prior studies (macaque, both sexes) that examined two different forms of invariance in the neural encoding of visual inputs&mdash;translation invariance and fill-outline invariance. Our results quantify for the first time the gradual falloff with spatial offset of translation-invariant shape selectivity within visual cortical neuronal receptive fields and offer a principled method to compare invariance in noisy biological systems to that in noise-free models.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Quantifying the similarity between two sets of averaged neural responses is fundamental to the analysis of neural data. A ubiquitous metric of similarity, the correlation coefficient, is attenuated by trial-to-trial variability that arises from many irrelevant factors. Spearman recognized this problem and proposed corrected methods that have been extended over a century. We show this method has large asymptotic biases that can be overcome using a novel estimator. Despite the frequent use of the correlation coefficient in neuroscience, consensus on how to address this fundamental statistical issue has not been reached. We provide an accurate estimator of the correlation coefficient and apply it to gain insight into visual invariance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Faster Detection of "Darks" than "Brights" by Monkey Superior Colliculus Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Visual processing is segregated into ON and OFF channels as early as in the retina, and the superficial (output) layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) are dominated by neurons preferring dark stimuli. However, it is not clear how the timing of neural processing differs between "darks" and "brights" in general, especially in light of psychophysical evidence; it is also equally not clear how subcortical visual pathways that are critical for active orienting represent stimuli of positive (luminance increments) and negative (luminance decrements) contrast polarity. Here, we recorded from all visually-responsive neuron types in the superior colliculus (SC) of two male rhesus macaque monkeys. We presented a disk (0.51&deg; radius) within the response fields (RFs) of neurons, and we varied, across trials, stimulus Weber contrast relative to a gray background. We also varied contrast polarity. There was a large diversity of preferences for darks and brights across the population. However, regardless of individual neural sensitivity, most neurons responded significantly earlier to dark than bright stimuli. This resulted in a dissociation between neural preference and visual response onset latency: a neuron could exhibit a weaker response to a dark stimulus than to a bright stimulus of the same contrast, but it would still have an earlier response to the dark stimulus. Our results highlight an additional candidate visual neural pathway for explaining behavioral differences between the processing of darks and brights, and they demonstrate the importance of temporal aspects in the visual neural code for orienting eye movements.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Objects in our environment, such as birds flying across a bright sky, often project shadows (or images darker than the surround) on our retina. We studied how primate superior colliculus (SC) neurons visually process such dark stimuli. We found that the overall population of SC neurons represented both dark and bright stimuli equally well, as evidenced by a relatively equal distribution of neurons that were either more or less sensitive to darks. However, independent of sensitivity, the great majority of neurons detected dark stimuli earlier than bright stimuli, evidenced by a smaller response latency for the dark stimuli. Thus, SC neural response latency can be dissociated from response sensitivity, and it favors the faster detection of dark image contrasts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pattern Motion Direction Is Encoded in the Population Activity of Macaque Area MT</a></h4>

              
                <p>Direction selective neurons in macaque primary visual cortex are narrowly tuned for orientation, and are thus afflicted by the aperture problem. At the next stage of motion processing, in the middle temporal (MT) area, some cells appear to solve this problem, responding to the pattern motion direction of plaids. Models have been proposed to account for this computation, but they do not replicate the diversity of responses observed in MT. We recorded from 386 cells in area MT of two male macaques, while presenting a wide range of random-line stimuli and their compositions into noise plaids. As we broadened the range of stimuli used to probe the cells, yielding ever more challenging conditions for extracting pattern motion, the diversity of the responses observed increased, and the fraction of cells that faithfully encoded pattern motion direction shrank. However, we show here that a pattern motion signal is present at the population level. We identified four mechanisms, one never proposed before, that together might account for the observed diversity in single-cell responses. Pattern motion is thus extracted in area MT, but it is encoded across the population, and not in a small subset of pattern neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Some neurons in the middle temporal area of macaques solve the aperture problem, signaling the direction of motion of complex patterns. As the number of pattern types used to probe this mechanism is increased, fewer and fewer cells retain this capability. We show here that different cells fail in different ways, and that simply summing their responses averages away their failures, yielding a clear pattern motion signal. Similar encodings, which unequivocally violate the "neuron as a feature detector" hypothesis that has dominated sensory processing theories for the past 50 years, might apply throughout the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Deterministic and Stochastic Components of Cortical Down States: Dynamics and Modulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Slow oscillations are an emergent activity of the cerebral cortex network consisting of alternating periods of activity (Up states) and silence (Down states). Up states are periods of persistent cortical activity that share properties with that of underlying wakefulness. However, the occurrence of Down states is almost invariably associated with unconsciousness, both in animal models and clinical studies. Down states have been attributed relevant functions, such as being a resetting mechanism or breaking causal interactions between cortical areas. But what do Down states consist of? Here, we explored in detail the network dynamics (e.g., synchronization and phase) during these silent periods <I>in vivo</I> (male mice), <I>in vitro</I> (ferrets, either sex), and <I>in silico</I>, investigating various experimental conditions that modulate them: anesthesia levels, excitability (electric fields), and excitation/inhibition balance. We identified metastability as two complementary phases composing such quiescence states: a highly synchronized "deterministic" period followed by a low-synchronization "stochastic" period. The balance between these two phases determines the dynamical properties of the resulting rhythm, as well as the responsiveness to incoming inputs or refractoriness. We propose detailed Up and Down state cycle dynamics that bridge cortical properties emerging at the mesoscale with their underlying mechanisms at the microscale, providing a key to understanding unconscious states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cerebral cortex expresses slow oscillations consisting of Up (active) and Down (silent) states. Such activity emerges not only in slow wave sleep, but also under anesthesia and in brain lesions. Down states functionally disconnect the network, and are associated with unconsciousness. Based on a large collection of data, novel data analysis approaches and computational modeling, we thoroughly investigate the nature of Down states. We identify two phases: a highly synchronized "deterministic" period, followed by a low-synchronization "stochastic" period. The balance between these two phases determines the dynamic properties of the resulting rhythm and responsiveness to incoming inputs. This finding reconciles different theories of slow rhythm generation and provides clues about how the brain switches from conscious to unconscious brain states.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Impact of Multivesicular Release on the Transmission of Sensory Information by Ribbon Synapses</a></h4>

              
                <p>The statistics of vesicle release determine how synapses transfer information, but the classical Poisson model of independent release does not always hold at the first stages of vision and hearing. There, ribbon synapses also encode sensory signals as events comprising two or more vesicles released simultaneously. The implications of such coordinated multivesicular release (MVR) for spike generation are not known. Here we investigate how MVR alters the transmission of sensory information compared with Poisson synapses using a pure rate-code. We used leaky integrate-and-fire models incorporating the statistics of release measured experimentally from glutamatergic synapses of retinal bipolar cells in zebrafish (both sexes) and compared these with models assuming Poisson inputs constrained to operate at the same average rates. We find that MVR can increase the number of spikes generated per vesicle while reducing interspike intervals and latency to first spike. The combined effect was to increase the efficiency of information transfer (bits per vesicle) over a range of conditions mimicking target neurons of different size. MVR was most advantageous in neurons with short time constants and reliable synaptic inputs, when less convergence was required to trigger spikes. In the special case of a single input driving a neuron, as occurs in the auditory system of mammals, MVR increased information transfer whenever spike generation required more than one vesicle. This study demonstrates how presynaptic integration of vesicles by MVR can increase the efficiency with which sensory information is transmitted compared with a rate-code described by Poisson statistics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons communicate by the stochastic release of vesicles at the synapse and the statistics of this process will determine how information is represented by spikes. The classical model is that vesicles are released independently by a Poisson process, but this does not hold at ribbon-type synapses specialized to transmit the first electrical signals in vision and hearing, where two or more vesicles can fuse in a single event by a process termed coordinated multivesicular release. This study shows that multivesicular release can increase the number of spikes generated per vesicle and the efficiency of information transfer (bits per vesicle) over a range of conditions found in the retina and peripheral auditory system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Conserved Population Dynamics in the Cerebro-Cerebellar System between Waking and Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite the importance of the cerebellum for motor learning, and the recognized role of sleep in motor memory consolidation, surprisingly little is known about neural activity in the sleeping cerebro-cerebellar system. Here, we used wireless recording from primary motor cortex (M1) and the cerebellum in three female monkeys to examine the relationship between patterns of single-unit spiking activity observed during waking behavior and in natural sleep. Across the population of recorded units, we observed similarities in the timing of firing relative to local field potential features associated with both movements during waking and up state during sleep. We also observed a consistent pattern of asymmetry in pairwise cross-correlograms, indicative of preserved sequential firing in both wake and sleep at low frequencies. Despite the overall similarity in population dynamics between wake and sleep, there was a global change in the timing of cerebellar activity relative to motor cortex, from contemporaneous in the awake state to motor cortex preceding the cerebellum in sleep. We speculate that similar population dynamics in waking and sleep may imply that cerebellar internal models are activated in both states, despite the absence of movement when asleep. Moreover, spindle frequency coherence between the cerebellum and motor cortex may provide a mechanism for cerebellar computations to influence sleep-dependent learning processes in the motor cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that sleep can lead to improved motor performance. One possibility is that off-line learning results from neural activity during sleep in brain areas responsible for the control of movement. In this study we show for the first time that neuronal patterns in the cerebro-cerebellar system are conserved during both movements and sleep up-states, albeit with a shift in the relative timing between areas. Additionally, we show the presence of simultaneous M1-cerebellar spike coherence at spindle frequencies associated with up-state replay and postulate that this is a mechanism whereby a cerebellar internal model can shape plasticity in neocortical circuits during sleep.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Midbrain-Hippocampus Structural Connectivity Selectively Predicts Motivated Memory Encoding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motivation is a powerful driver of learning and memory. Functional MRI studies show that interactions among the dopaminergic midbrain substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are critical for motivated memory encoding. However, it is not known whether these effects are transient and purely functional, or whether individual differences in the structure of this circuit underlie motivated memory encoding. To quantify individual differences in structure, diffusion-weighted MRI and probabilistic tractography were used to quantify SN/VTA&ndash;striatum and SN/VTA&ndash;hippocampus pathways associated with motivated memory encoding in humans. Male and female participants completed a motivated source memory paradigm. During encoding, words were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, reward ($1.00), control ($0.00), or punishment (&ndash;$1.00). During retrieval, participants were asked to retrieve item and source information of the previously studied words and were rewarded or penalized according to their performance. Source memory for words assigned to both reward and punishment conditions was greater than those for control words, but there were no differences in item memory based on value. Anatomically, probabilistic tractography results revealed a heterogeneous, topological arrangement of the SN/VTA. Tract density measures of SN/VTA&ndash;hippocampus pathways were positively correlated with individual differences in reward-and-punishment-modulated memory performance, whereas density of SN/VTA&ndash;striatum pathways showed no association. This novel finding suggests that pathways emerging from the human SV/VTA are anatomically separable and functionally heterogeneous. Individual differences in structural connectivity of the dopaminergic hippocampus&ndash;VTA loop are selectively associated with motivated memory encoding.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Functional MRI studies show that interactions among the SN/VTA, hippocampus, and NAc are critical for motivated memory encoding. This has led to competing theories that posit either SN/VTA&ndash;NAc reward prediction errors or SN/VTA&ndash;hippocampus signals underlie motivated memory encoding. Additionally, it is not known whether these effects are transient and purely functional or whether individual differences in the structure of these circuits underlie motivated memory encoding. Using diffusion-weighted MRI and probabilistic tractography, we show that tract density measures of SN/VTA&ndash;hippocampus pathways are positively correlated with motivated memory performance, whereas density of SN/VTA&ndash;striatum pathways show no association. This finding suggests that anatomic individual differences of the dopaminergic hippocampus&ndash;VTA loop are selectively associated with motivated memory encoding.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatiotemporal Atlas of the Fetal Brain Depicts Cortical Developmental Gradient</a></h4>

              
                <p>The fetal brains experience rapid and complex development <I>in utero</I> during the second and third trimesters. <I>In utero</I> MRI of the fetal brain in this period enables us to quantify normal fetal brain development in the spatiotemporal domain. In this study, we established a high-quality spatiotemporal atlas between 23 and 38 weeks gestational age (GA) from 90 healthy Chinese human fetuses of both sexes using a pairwise and groupwise registration pipeline. We quantified the fetal cortical morphology indices and characterized their spatiotemporal developmental pattern. The cortical thickness exhibited a biphasic pattern that first increased and then decreased; the curvature fitted well into the Gompertz growth model; sulcal depth increased linearly, while surface area expanded exponentially. The cortical thickness and curvature trajectories consistently pointed to a characteristic time point around GA of 31 weeks. The characteristic GA and growth rate obtained from individual cortical regions suggested a central-to-peripheral developmental gradient, with the earliest development in the parietal lobe, and we also observed a superior-to-inferior gradient within the temporal lobe. These findings may be linked to biophysical events, such as dendritic arborization and thalamocortical fibers ingrowth. The proposed atlas was also compared with an existing fetal atlas from a white/mixed population. Finally, we examined the structural asymmetry of the fetal brains and found extensive asymmetry that dynamically changed with development. The current study depicted a comprehensive profile of fetal cortical development, and the established atlas could be used as a normative reference for neurodevelopmental and diagnostic purposes, especially in the Chinese population.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We generated a high-quality 4D spatiotemporal atlas of the normal fetal brain development from 23 to 38 gestational weeks in a Chinese population and characterized the spatiotemporal developmental pattern of cortical morphology. According to the cortical development trajectories, the fetal cerebral cortex development follows a central-to-peripheral developmental gradient that may be related to the underlying cellular events. The majority of cortical regions already exhibit significant asymmetry during the fetal period.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of NF1 in Drosophila Larvae Causes Tactile Hypersensitivity and Impaired Synaptic Transmission at the Neuromuscular Junction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition in which the mechanisms underlying its core symptomatology are largely unknown. Studying animal models of monogenic syndromes associated with ASD, such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), can offer insights into its etiology. Here, we show that loss of function of the <I>Drosophila NF1</I> ortholog results in tactile hypersensitivity following brief mechanical stimulation in the larva (mixed sexes), paralleling the sensory abnormalities observed in individuals with ASD. Mutant larvae also exhibit synaptic transmission deficits at the glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ), with increased spontaneous but reduced evoked release. While the latter is homeostatically compensated for by a postsynaptic increase in input resistance, the former is consistent with neuronal hyperexcitability. Indeed, diminished expression of <I>NF1</I> specifically within central cholinergic neurons induces both excessive neuronal firing and tactile hypersensitivity, suggesting the two may be linked. Furthermore, both impaired synaptic transmission and behavioral deficits are fully rescued via knock-down of Ras proteins. These findings validate <I>NF1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> <I>Drosophila</I> as a tractable model of ASD with the potential to elucidate important pathophysiological mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1&ndash;2% of the overall population and can considerably impact an individual's quality of life. However, there are currently no treatments available for its core symptoms, largely because of a poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved. Examining how loss of function of the ASD-associated <I>NF1</I> gene affects behavior and physiology in <I>Drosophila</I> may shed light on this. In this study, we identify a novel, ASD-relevant behavioral phenotype in <I>NF1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae, namely an enhanced response to mechanical stimulation, which is associated with Ras-dependent synaptic transmission deficits indicative of neuronal hyperexcitability. Such insights support the use of <I>Drosophila</I> neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) models in ASD research and may provide outputs for genetic or pharmacological screens in future studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Intracellular Accumulation of {alpha}-Synuclein Aggregates Promotes S-Nitrosylation of MAP1A Leading to Decreased NMDAR-Evoked Calcium Influx and Loss of Mature Synaptic Spines</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cortical synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, collectively known as Lewy body dementia, are characterized by the aberrant aggregation of misfolded &alpha;-synuclein (&alpha;-syn) protein into large inclusions in cortical tissue, leading to impairments in proteostasis and synaptic connectivity and eventually resulting in neurodegeneration. Here, we show that male and female rat cortical neurons exposed to exogenous &alpha;-syn preformed fibrils accumulate large, detergent-insoluble, PS129-labeled deposits at synaptic terminals. Live-cell imaging of calcium dynamics coupled with assessment of network activity reveals that aberrant intracellular accumulation of &alpha;-syn inhibits synaptic response to glutamate through NMDARs, although deficits manifest slowly over a 7 d period. Impairments in NMDAR activity temporally correlated with increased nitric oxide synthesis and S-nitrosylation of the dendritic scaffold protein, microtubule-associated protein 1A. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis via the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor <scp>l</scp>-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester blocked microtubule-associated protein 1A S-nitrosylation and normalized NMDAR-dependent inward calcium transients and overall network activity. Collectively, these data suggest that loss of synaptic function in Lewy body dementia may result from synucleinopathy-evoked nitrosative stress and subsequent NMDAR dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work shows the importance of the redox state of microtubule-associated protein 1A in the maintenance of synaptic function through regulation of NMDAR. We show that &alpha;-syn preformed fibrils promote nitric oxide synthesis, which triggers S-nitrosylation of microtubule-associated protein 1A, leading to impairment of NMDAR-dependent glutamate responses. This offers insight into the mechanism of synaptic dysfunction in Lewy body dementia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Vaccine approach for human monkeypox over the years and current recommendations to prevent the outbreak: a rapid review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The World Health Organization has declared human monkeypox as a global health emergency on 23 July 2022. This indicates that the outbreak poses a serious risk to global health and requires a united worldwide response to stop the virus from spreading and possibly turning into a pandemic. Vaccines can play a vital role in this context, contributing to pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. Methods: The aim of our rapid review was to go through the background of the vaccine approach for human monkeypox over the years and to find out what current guidelines are highlighting relating to it. A rapid review with a systematic search and manual searching have been performed here. Results: 22 relevant published articles from MEDLINE bibliographic database and 8 vaccine recommendations from manual searching have been deliberated here. Conclusion: The significant synopsis of this review is that the smallpox vaccine is the only immunization option for monkeypox so far, and it is up to 85% effective to prevent the infection. Third-generation smallpox vaccines are advised over first and second generations due to their minimal side effects. Healthcare providers and lab professionals at risk are on the priority list to get vaccinated, as well as pregnant women or lactating mothers, and immunocompromised or chronically ill patients can get vaccinated if they are surely exposed to the monkeypox infection. Lastly, JYNNEOS/IMVAMUNE is the current most preferable smallpox vaccine that is highly advised for the latest outbreak of human monkeypox but more clinical trials on humans should be conducted to evaluate its safety, efficacy, and adverse events.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CONGA: Copy number variation genotyping in ancient genomes and low-coverage sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arda Söylev, Sevim Seda Çokoglu, Dilek Koptekin, Can Alkan, Mehmet Somel</p>

To date, ancient genome analyses have been largely confined to the study of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Copy number variants (CNVs) are a major contributor of disease and of evolutionary adaptation, but identifying CNVs in ancient shotgun-sequenced genomes is hampered by typical low genome coverage (<1×) and short fragments (<80 bps), precluding standard CNV detection software to be effectively applied to ancient genomes. Here we present CONGA, tailored for genotyping CNVs at low coverage. Simulations and down-sampling experiments suggest that CONGA can genotype deletions >1 kbps with F-scores >0.75 at ≥1×, and distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous states. We used CONGA to genotype 10,002 outgroup-ascertained deletions across a heterogenous set of 71 ancient human genomes spanning the last 50,000 years, produced using variable experimental protocols. A fraction of these (21/71) display divergent deletion profiles unrelated to their population origin, but attributable to technical factors such as coverage and read length. The majority of the sample (50/71), despite originating from nine different laboratories and having coverages ranging from 0.44×-26× (median 4×) and average read lengths 52-121 bps (median 69), exhibit coherent deletion frequencies. Across these 50 genomes, inter-individual genetic diversity measured using SNPs and CONGA-genotyped deletions are highly correlated. CONGA-genotyped deletions also display purifying selection signatures, as expected. CONGA thus paves the way for systematic CNV analyses in ancient genomes, despite the technical challenges posed by low and variable genome coverage.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sequence-sensitive elastic network captures dynamical features necessary for miR-125a maturation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Olivier Mailhot, Vincent Frappier, François Major, Rafael J. Najmanovich</p>

The Elastic Network Contact Model (ENCoM) is a coarse-grained normal mode analysis (NMA) model unique in its all-atom sensitivity to the sequence of the studied macromolecule and thus to the effect of mutations. We adapted ENCoM to simulate the dynamics of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, benchmarked its performance against other popular NMA models and used it to study the 3D structural dynamics of human microRNA miR-125a, leveraging high-throughput experimental maturation efficiency data of over 26 000 sequence variants. We also introduce a novel way of using dynamical information from NMA to train multivariate linear regression models, with the purpose of highlighting the most salient contributions of dynamics to function. ENCoM has a similar performance profile on RNA than on proteins when compared to the Anisotropic Network Model (ANM), the most widely used coarse-grained NMA model; it has the advantage on predicting large-scale motions while ANM performs better on B-factors prediction. A stringent benchmark from the miR-125a maturation dataset, in which the training set contains no sequence information in common with the testing set, reveals that ENCoM is the only tested model able to capture signal beyond the sequence. This ability translates to better predictive power on a second benchmark in which sequence features are shared between the train and test sets. When training the linear regression model using all available data, the dynamical features identified as necessary for miR-125a maturation point to known patterns but also offer new insights into the biogenesis of microRNAs. Our novel approach combining NMA with multivariate linear regression is generalizable to any macromolecule for which relatively high-throughput mutational data is available.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Sparse RNNs can support high-capacity classification</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Denis Turcu, L. F. Abbott</p>

Feedforward network models performing classification tasks rely on highly convergent output units that collect the information passed on by preceding layers. Although convergent output-unit like neurons may exist in some biological neural circuits, notably the cerebellar cortex, neocortical circuits do not exhibit any obvious candidates for this role; instead they are highly recurrent. We investigate whether a sparsely connected recurrent neural network (RNN) can perform classification in a distributed manner without ever bringing all of the relevant information to a single convergence site. Our model is based on a sparse RNN that performs classification dynamically. Specifically, the interconnections of the RNN are trained to resonantly amplify the magnitude of responses to some external inputs but not others. The amplified and non-amplified responses then form the basis for binary classification. Furthermore, the network acts as an evidence accumulator and maintains its decision even after the input is turned off. Despite highly sparse connectivity, learned recurrent connections allow input information to flow to every neuron of the RNN, providing the basis for distributed computation. In this arrangement, the minimum number of synapses per neuron required to reach maximum memory capacity scales only logarithmically with network size. The model is robust to various types of noise, works with different activation and loss functions and with both backpropagation- and Hebbian-based learning rules. The RNN can also be constructed with a split excitation-inhibition architecture with little reduction in performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interpreting tree ensemble machine learning models with endoR</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Albane Ruaud, Niklas Pfister, Ruth E. Ley, Nicholas D. Youngblut</p>

Tree ensemble machine learning models are increasingly used in microbiome science as they are compatible with the compositional, high-dimensional, and sparse structure of sequence-based microbiome data. While such models are often good at predicting phenotypes based on microbiome data, they only yield limited insights into how microbial taxa may be associated. We developed endoR, a method to interpret tree ensemble models. First, endoR simplifies the fitted model into a decision ensemble. Then, it extracts information on the importance of individual features and their pairwise interactions, displaying them as an interpretable network. Both the endoR network and importance scores provide insights into how features, and interactions between them, contribute to the predictive performance of the fitted model. Adjustable regularization and bootstrapping help reduce the complexity and ensure that only essential parts of the model are retained. We assessed endoR on both simulated and real metagenomic data. We found endoR to have comparable accuracy to other common approaches while easing and enhancing model interpretation. Using endoR, we also confirmed published results on gut microbiome differences between cirrhotic and healthy individuals. Finally, we utilized endoR to explore associations between human gut methanogens and microbiome components. Indeed, these hydrogen consumers are expected to interact with fermenting bacteria in a complex syntrophic network. Specifically, we analyzed a global metagenome dataset of 2203 individuals and confirmed the previously reported association between <i>Methanobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Christensenellales</i>. Additionally, we observed that <i>Methanobacteriaceae</i> are associated with a network of hydrogen-producing bacteria. Our method accurately captures how tree ensembles use features and interactions between them to predict a response. As demonstrated by our applications, the resultant visualizations and summary outputs facilitate model interpretation and enable the generation of novel hypotheses about complex systems.

                <p>by Thibault Tubiana, Ian Sillitoe, Christine Orengo, Nathalie Reuter</p>

Peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs) include a wide variety of proteins that have in common to bind transiently to the chemically complex interfacial region of membranes through their interfacial binding site (IBS). In contrast to protein-protein or protein-DNA/RNA interfaces, peripheral protein-membrane interfaces are poorly characterized. We collected a dataset of PMP domains representative of the variety of PMP functions: membrane-targeting domains (Annexin, C1, C2, discoidin C2, PH, PX), enzymes (PLA, PLC/D) and lipid-transfer proteins (START). The dataset contains 1328 experimental structures and 1194 AphaFold models. We mapped the amino acid composition and structural patterns of the IBS of each protein in this dataset, and evaluated which were more likely to be found at the IBS compared to the rest of the domains’ accessible surface. In agreement with earlier work we find that about two thirds of the PMPs in the dataset have protruding hydrophobes (Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, Trp and Met) at their IBS. The three aromatic amino acids Trp, Tyr and Phe are a hallmark of PMPs IBS regardless of whether they protrude on loops or not. This is also the case for lysines but not arginines suggesting that, unlike for Arg-rich membrane-active peptides, the less membrane-disruptive lysine is preferred in PMPs. Another striking observation was the over-representation of glycines at the IBS of PMPs compared to the rest of their surface, possibly procuring IBS loops a much-needed flexibility to insert in-between membrane lipids. The analysis of the 9 superfamilies revealed amino acid distribution patterns in agreement with their known functions and membrane-binding mechanisms. Besides revealing novel amino acids patterns at protein-membrane interfaces, our work contributes a new PMP dataset and an analysis pipeline that can be further built upon for future studies of PMPs properties, or for developing PMPs prediction tools using for example, machine learning approaches.

Alzheimer’s disease is marked by brain damage from tau and amyloid aggregates, particularly to the hippocampus and the default network. A new study in PLOS Biology shows sex differences in the patterns of damage and in their association with risk and protective factors.

Alzheimer’s disease is marked by brain damage from tau and amyloid aggregates, especially to the hippocampus and its default network. This Primer explores a new study in PLOS Biology which reveals differences between men and women in the patterns of damage and in its association with risk and protective factors.

                <p>by Cody J. Smith</p>

The responsibility for promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) too often falls on scientists from minority groups. Here, I provide a list of potential strategies that members of the majority can easily do to step up and get involved in DEIB.

Interesting in including diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging in your lab but not sure how to start? This Perspective speaks to everyone, including those in the "majority", about how to get involved.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Harassment of game makers: Prevalence and impact [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Online harassment is a relatively commonplace occurrence in the video gaming industry and player communities. A lack of diversity has unquestionably contributed to the high levels of such incidences. Methods: In this paper, we take an exploratory approach, via a cross-sectional observational study, to evaluate the harassment of game industry professionals on social media. In this new sphere of growing concern, there is evidence of significant harm for game makers and their radius of impact. We will discuss the prevalence rates, nature of harassment, and the ways in which a lack of diversity has contributed to this phenomenon. Results: In total, 282 video game industry professionals completed the survey in its entirety. More than half of all participants reported experiencing harassment on social media (59.6%) and nearly all reported witnessing harassment happening to other members of the videogames industry via social media (92.2%). This harassment can have a significant impact on well-being, including increased anxiety (62.1%), feelings of isolation (37.6%) and increased depression (36.2%). Almost one quarter (23.8%) reported symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder. One out of 10 participants reported suicidal thoughts because of online harassment. A significant number of respondents (37.3%) reported that had to take steps to reduce their physical safety due to online harassment. Over half of all respondents saying they were targets of hate because of some aspect of their identity. Conclusions: The results indicate high rates of online harassment, both direct and indirect, among members of the gaming industry at all levels. Responses also pointed to substantial mental health and behavioral impacts of both experiencing and witnessing online harassment. Without large-scale action, this problem will continue to reinforce the lack of diversity inside game studios, pushing out marginalized employees due to a hostile work environment.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">A distinct impact of repeated morphine exposure on synaptic plasticity at Schaffer collateral‐CA1, temporoammonic‐CA1, and perforant pathway‐dentate gyrus synapses along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We aimed to study how morphine affects synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions along the hippocampal long axis. For this, recording and measuring of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were utilized to test the effects of repeated morphine exposure on paired-pulse evoked responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 (Sch-CA1), temporoammonic-CA1 (TA-CA1) and perforant pathway-dentate gyrus (PP-DG) synapses in transverse slices from the dorsal (DH), intermediate (IH), and ventral (VH) hippocampus in adult male rats. After repeated morphine exposure, the expression of opioid receptors and the α1 and α5 GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits were also examined. We found that repeated morphine exposure blunt the difference between the DH and the VH in their basal levels of synaptic transmission at Sch-CA1 synapses that were seen in the control groups. Significant paired-pulse facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission was observed at Sch-CA1 synapses in slices taken from all three hippocampal segments as well as at PP-DG synapses in slices taken from the VH segment in the morphine-treated groups as compared to the control groups. Interestingly, significant paired-pulse inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission was observed at TA-CA1 synapses in the DH slices from the morphine-treated group as compared to the control group. While primed-burst stimulation (a protocol reflecting normal neuronal firing) induced a robust LTP in hippocampal subfields in all control groups, resulting in a decaying LTP at TA-CA1 synapses in the VH slices and at PP-DG synapses in both the IH and VH slices taken from the morphine-treated rats. In the DH of morphine-treated rats, we found increased levels of the mRNAs encoding the α1 and α5 GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits as compared to the control group. Taken together, these findings suggest the potential mechanisms through which repeated morphine exposure causes differential changes in circuit excitability and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions along the hippocampal long axis.</p>

                The dynamics of living organisms are organized across many spatial scales. However, current cost-effective imaging systems can measure only a subset of these scales at once. We have created a scalable multi-camera array microscope (MCAM) that enables comprehensive high-resolution recording from multiple spatial scales simultaneously, ranging from structures that approach the cellular scale to large-group behavioral dynamics. By collecting data from up to 96 cameras, we computationally generate gigapixel-scale images and movies with a field of view over hundreds of square centimeters at an optical resolution of 18 µm. This allows us to observe the behavior and fine anatomical features of numerous freely moving model organisms on multiple spatial scales, including larval zebrafish, fruit flies, nematodes, carpenter ants, and slime mold. Further, the MCAM architecture allows stereoscopic tracking of the z-position of organisms using the overlapping field of view from adjacent cameras. Overall, by removing the bottlenecks imposed by single-camera image acquisition systems, the MCAM provides a powerful platform for investigating detailed biological features and behavioral processes of small model organisms across a wide range of spatial scales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The conserved centrosomin motif, γTuNA, forms a dimer that directly activates microtubule nucleation by the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC)</a></h4>

              
                To establish the microtubule cytoskeleton, the cell must tightly regulate when and where microtubules are nucleated. This regulation involves controlling the initial nucleation template, the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC). Although γTuRC is present throughout the cytoplasm, its activity is restricted to specific sites including the centrosome and Golgi. The well-conserved γ-tubulin nucleation activator (γTuNA) domain has been reported to increase the number of microtubules (MTs) generated by γTuRCs. However, previously we and others observed that γTuNA had a minimal effect on the activity of antibody-purified <i>Xenopus</i> γTuRCs <i>in vitro</i> (Thawani et al., <i>eLife</i>, 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Here we instead report, based on improved versions of γTuRC, γTuNA, and our TIRF assay, the first real-time observation that γTuNA directly increases γTuRC activity <i>in vitro</i>, which is thus a <i>bona fide</i> γTuRC activator. We further validate this effect in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extract. Via mutation analysis, we find that γTuNA is an obligate dimer. Moreover, efficient dimerization as well as γTuNA's L70, F75, and L77 residues are required for binding to and activation of γTuRC. Finally, we find that γTuNA's activating effect opposes inhibitory regulation by stathmin. In sum, our improved assays prove that direct γTuNA binding strongly activates γTuRCs, explaining previously observed effects of γTuNA expression in cells and illuminating how γTuRC-mediated microtubule nucleation is regulated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Homeostatic regulation through strengthening of neuronal network-correlated synaptic inputs</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic regulation is essential for stable neuronal function. Several synaptic mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity have been described, but the functional properties of synapses involved in homeostasis are unknown. We used longitudinal two-photon functional imaging of dendritic spine calcium signals in visual and retrosplenial cortices of awake adult mice to quantify the sensory deprivation-induced changes in the responses of functionally identified spines. We found that spines whose activity selectively correlated with intrinsic network activity underwent TNF-α dependent homeostatic increases in their response amplitudes, but spines identified as responsive to sensory stimulation did not. We observed an increase in the global sensory-evoked responses following sensory deprivation, despite the fact that the identified sensory inputs did not strengthen. Instead, global sensory-evoked responses correlated with the strength of network-correlated inputs. Our results suggest that homeostatic regulation of global responses is mediated through changes to intrinsic network-correlated inputs rather than changes to identified sensory inputs thought to drive sensory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A coordinated transcriptional switching network mediates antigenic variation of human malaria parasites</a></h4>

              
                Malaria parasites avoid immune clearance through their ability to systematically alter antigens exposed on the surface of infected red blood cells. This is accomplished by tightly regulated transcriptional control of individual members of a large, multicopy gene family called <i>var</i> and is the key to both the virulence and chronic nature of malaria infections. Expression of <i>var</i> genes is mutually exclusive and controlled epigenetically, however how large populations of parasites coordinate <i>var</i> gene switching to avoid premature exposure of the antigenic repertoire is unknown. Here we provide evidence for a transcriptional network anchored by a universally conserved gene called <i>var2csa</i> that coordinates the switching process. We describe a structured switching bias that shifts overtime and could shape the pattern of <i>var</i> expression over the course of a lengthy infection. Our results provide an explanation for a previously mysterious aspect of malaria infections and shed light on how parasites possessing a relatively small repertoire of variant antigen encoding genes can coordinate switching events to limit antigen exposure, thereby maintaining chronic infections.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Injured Sciatic Nerve Atlas (iSNAT), insights into the cellular and molecular basis of neural tissue degeneration and regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Upon trauma, the adult murine PNS displays a remarkable degree of spontaneous anatomical and functional regeneration. To explore extrinsic mechanisms of neural repair, we carried out single cell analysis of naïve mouse sciatic nerve, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and crushed sciatic nerves at 1-day, 3-days, and 7- days following injury. During the first week, monocytes and macrophages (Mo/Mac) rapidly accumulate in the injured nerve and undergo extensive metabolic reprogramming. Proinflammatory Mo/Mac in the injured nerve show high glycolytic flux compared to Mo/Mac in blood and dominate the early injury response. They subsequently give way to inflammation resolving Mac, programmed toward oxidative phosphorylation. Nerve crush injury causes partial leakiness of the blood-nerve-barrier, proliferation of endoneurial and perineurial stromal cells, and accumulation of select serum proteins. Micro-dissection of the nerve injury site and distal nerve, followed by single-cell RNA-sequencing, identified distinct immune compartments, triggered by mechanical nerve wounding and Wallerian degeneration, respectively. This finding was independently confirmed with Sarm1-/- mice, where Wallerian degeneration is greatly delayed. Experiments with chimeric mice showed that wildtype immune cells readily enter the injury site in Sarm1-/- mice, but are sparse in the distal nerve, except for Mo. We used CellChat to explore intercellular communications in the naïve and injured PNS and report on hundreds of ligand-receptor interactions. Our longitudinal analysis represents a new resource for nerve regeneration, reveals location specific immune microenvironments, and reports on large intercellular communication networks. To facilitate mining of scRNAseq datasets, we generated the injured sciatic nerve atlas (iSNAT): https://cdb-rshiny.med.umich.edu/Giger_iSNAT/

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A remarkable adaptive paradigm of heart performance and protection emerges in response to the constitutive challenge of marked cardiac-specific overexpression of adenylyl cyclase type 8</a></h4>

              
                Adult (3 month) mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of adenylyl cyclase (AC) type VIII (TG<sup>AC8</sup>) adapt to an increased cAMP-induced cardiac workload (~30% increases in heart rate, ejection fraction and cardiac output) for up to a year without signs of heart failure or excessive mortality. Here, we show classical cardiac hypertrophy markers were absent in TG<sup>AC8</sup>, and that total left ventricular (LV) mass was not increased: a reduced LV cavity volume in TG<sup>AC8</sup> was encased by thicker LV walls harboring an increased number of small cardiac myocytes, and a network of small interstitial proliferative non-cardiac myocytes compared to wild type (WT) littermates; Protein synthesis, proteosome activity, and autophagy were enhanced in TG<sup>AC8</sup> vs WT, and Nrf-2, Hsp90α, and ACC2 protein levels were increased. Despite increased energy demands <i>in vivo</i> LV ATP and phosphocreatine levels in TG<sup>AC8</sup> did not differ from WT. Unbiased omics analyses identified more than 2,000 transcripts and proteins, comprising a broad array of biological processes across multiple cellular compartments, which differed by genotype; compared to WT, in TG<sup>AC8</sup> there was a shift from fatty acid oxidation to aerobic glycolysis in the context of increased utilization of the pentose phosphate shunt and nucleotide synthesis. Thus, marked overexpression of AC8 engages complex, coordinate adaptation 'circuity' that has evolved in mammalian cells to defend against stress that threatens health or life (elements of which have already been shown to be central to cardiac ischemic pre-conditioning and exercise endurance cardiac conditioning) that may be of biological significance to allow for proper healing in disease states such as infarction or failure of the heart.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Retinoic acid-gated BDNF synthesis in neuronal dendrites drives presynaptic homeostatic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a non-Hebbian synaptic mechanism that adjusts synaptic strength to maintain network stability while achieving optimal information processing. Among the molecular mediators shown to regulate this form of plasticity, synaptic signaling through retinoic acid (RA) and its receptor, RARα, has been shown to be critically involved in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic transmission in both hippocampus and sensory cortices. In this study, we explore the molecular mechanism through which postsynaptic RA and RARα regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release during prolonged synaptic inactivity at mouse glutamatertic synapses. We show that RARα binds to a subset of dendritically sorted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<i>Bdnf</i>) mRNA splice isoforms and represses their translation. The RA-mediated translational de-repression of postsynaptic BDNF results in the retrograde activation of presynaptic Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptors, facilitating presynaptic homeostatic compensation through enhanced presynaptic release. Together, our study illustrates a RA-mediated retrograde synaptic signaling pathway through which postsynaptic protein synthesis during synaptic inactivity drives compensatory changes at the presynaptic site.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The missing link between genetic association and regulatory function</a></h4>

              
                The genetic basis of most traits is highly polygenic and dominated by non-coding alleles. It is widely assumed that such alleles exert small regulatory effects on the expression of <i>cis</i>-linked genes. However, despite the availability of gene expression and epigenomic data sets, few variant-to-gene links have emerged. It is unclear whether these sparse results are due to limitations in available data and methods, or to deficiencies in the underlying assumed model. To better distinguish between these possibilities, we identified 220 gene-trait pairs in which protein-coding variants influence a complex trait or its Mendelian cognate. Despite the presence of expression quantitative trait loci near most GWAS associations, by applying a gene-based approach we found limited evidence that the baseline expression of trait-related genes explains GWAS associations, whether using colocalization methods (8% of genes implicated), transcription-wide association (2% of genes implicated), or a combination of regulatory annotations and distance (4% of genes implicated). These results contradict the hypothesis that most complex trait-associated variants coincide with homeostatic eQTLs, suggesting that better models are needed. The field must confront this deficit, and pursue this 'missing regulation'.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Piezo1 as a force-through-membrane sensor in red blood cells</a></h4>

              
                Piezo1 is the stretch activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in red blood cells that mediates homeostatic volume control. Here, we study the organization of Piezo1 in red blood cells using a combination of super-resolution microscopy techniques and electron microscopy. Piezo1 adopts a non-uniform distribution on the red blood cell surface, with a bias toward the biconcave ‘dimple’. Trajectories of diffusing Piezo1 molecules, which exhibit confined Brownian diffusion on short timescales and hopping on long timescales, also reflect a bias toward the dimple. This bias can be explained by ‘curvature coupling’ between the intrinsic curvature of the Piezo dome and the curvature of the red blood cell membrane. Piezo1 does not form clusters with itself, nor does it colocalize with F-actin, Spectrin, or the Gardos channel. Thus, Piezo1 exhibits the properties of a force-through-membrane sensor of curvature and lateral tension in the red blood cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The regional distribution of resident immune cells shapes distinct immunological environments along the murine epididymis</a></h4>

              
                The epididymis functions as transition zone for post-testicular sperm maturation and storage and faces contrasting immunological challenges, i.e. tolerance towards spermatozoa vs. reactivity against pathogens. Thus, normal organ function and integrity relies heavily on a tightly controlled immune balance. Previous studies described inflammation-associated tissue damage solely in the distal regions (corpus, cauda), but not in the proximal regions (initial segment, caput). To understand the observed region-specific immunity along the epididymal duct, we have used an acute bacterial epididymitis mouse model and analyzed the disease progression. Whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq 10 days post infection showed a pro-inflammatory environment within the cauda, while the caput exhibited only minor transcriptional changes. High-dimensional flow cytometry analyses revealed drastic changes in the immune cell composition upon infection with uropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i>. A massive influx of neutrophils and monocytes was observed exclusively in distal regions and was associated with bacterial appearance and tissue alterations. In order to clarify the reasons for the region-specific differences in the intensity of immune responses, we investigated the heterogeneity of resident immune cell populations under physiological conditions by scRNASeq analysis of extravascular CD45+ cells. Twelve distinct immune cell subsets were identified, displaying substantial differences in distribution along the epididymis as further assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Macrophages constituted the majority of resident immune cells and were further separated in distinct subgroups based on their transcriptional profile, tissue location and monocyte-dependence. Crucially, the proximal and distal regions showed striking differences in their immunological landscapes. These findings indicate that resident immune cells are strategically positioned along the epididymal duct, potentially providing different immunological environments required for addressing the contrasting immunological challenges and thus, preserving tissue integrity and organ function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural circuit-wide analysis of gene expression during deafening-induced destabilization ofbirdsong</a></h4>

              
                Sensory feedback is required for stable execution of learned motor skills, and its loss can severely disrupt motor performance. The neural mechanisms that mediate sensorimotor stability have been extensively studied at systems and physiological levels, yet relatively little is known about how disruptions to sensory input alter the molecular properties of associated motor systems. Songbird courtship song, a model for skilled behavior, is a learned and highly structured vocalization that is destabilized following deafening. Here, we sought to determine how the loss of auditory feedback modifies gene expression and its coordination across the birdsong sensorimotor circuit. To facilitate this system-wide analysis of transcriptional responses, we developed a gene expression profiling approach that enables the construction of hundreds of spatially-defined RNA-sequencing libraries. Using this method, we found that deafening preferentially alters gene expression across birdsong neural circuitry relative to surrounding areas, particularly in premotor and striatal regions. Genes with altered expression are associated with synaptic transmission, neuronal spines, and neuromodulation and show a bias toward expression in glutamatergic neurons and Pvalb/Sst-class GABAergic interneurons. We also found that connected song regions exhibit correlations in gene expression that were reduced in deafened birds relative to hearing birds, suggesting that song destabilization alters the inter-region coordination of transcriptional state. Finally, lesioning LMAN, a forebrain afferent of RA required for deafening-induced song plasticity, had the largest effect on groups of genes that were also most affected by deafening. Combined, this integrated transcriptomics analysis demonstrates that the loss of peripheral sensory input drives a distributed gene expression response throughout associated sensorimotor neural circuitry and identifies specific candidate molecular and cellular mechanisms that support stability and plasticity of learned motor skills.

	<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of simple jaw opening and closing task of chewing movements on the activities of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from the viewpoint of stress reduction. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the PFC during a block-tapping task of the jaw in healthy participants. Eleven young healthy individuals with normal dentition (7 males and 4 females, mean age 28.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 3.7 years) volunteered for this study. CBF was measured using a wearable, functional near-infrared spectroscopy device. Measurements were taken using the central incisors and first molars at interocclusal distances of 5 and 10 mm. The participants were asked to bite a hard/soft block. CBF in all conditions showed limited variability or decreasing trend compared to resting state before the task. The main effect was observed for interocclusal distance (p = 0.008), and there were no significant differences for measurement area of the PFC, tooth type, and material type. An interaction was found between tooth type and material type. In conclusion, these results suggest that simple and rhythmical chewing motion has an effect of reducing CBF in the PFC and resting the PFC, which is an especially notable aspect of periodontal sensory information in the molar.</p>

	<p>Introduction: Individual real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI NF) might be a promising adjuvant in treating depressive symptoms. Further studies showed functional variations and connectivity-related changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the insular cortex. Objectives: The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether individualized connectivity-based rtfMRI NF training can improve symptoms in depressed patients as an adjunct to a psychotherapeutic programme. The novel strategy chosen for this was to increase connectivity between individualized regions of interest, namely the insula and the dlPFC. Methods: Sixteen patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD, ICD-10) and 19 matched healthy controls (HC) participated in a rtfMRI NF training consisting of two sessions with three runs each, within an interval of one week. RtfMRI NF was applied during a sequence of negative emotional pictures to modulate the connectivity between the dlPFC and the insula. The MDD REAL group was divided into a Responder and a Non-Responder group. Patients with an increased connectivity during the second NF session or during both the first and the second NF session were identified as &amp;amp;ldquo;MDD REAL Responder&amp;amp;rdquo; (N = 6). Patients that did not show any increase in connectivity and/or a decreased connectivity were identified as &amp;amp;ldquo;MDD REAL Non-Responder&amp;amp;rdquo; (N = 7). Results: Before the rtfMRI sessions, patients with MDD showed higher neural activation levels in ventromedial PFC and the insula than HC; by contrast, HC revealed increased hemodynamic activity in visual processing areas (primary visual cortex and visual association cortex) compared to patients with MDD. The comparison of hemodynamic responses during the first compared to during the last NF session demonstrated significantly increased BOLD-activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) in patients and HC, and additionally in the lateral OFC in patients with MDD. These findings were particularly due to the MDD Responder group, as the MDD Non-Responder group showed no increase in this region during the last NF run. There was a decrease of neural activation in emotional processing brain regions in both groups in the last NF run compared to the first: HC showed differences in the insula, parahippocampal gyrus, basal ganglia, and cingulate gyrus. Patients with MDD demonstrated deceased responses in the parahippocampal gyrus. There was no significant reduction of BDI scores after NF training in patients. Conclusions: Increased neural activation in the insula and vmPFC in MDD suggests an increased emotional reaction in patients with MDD. The activation of the mOFC could be associated with improved control-strategies and association-learning processes. The increased lOFC activation could indicate a stronger sensitivity to failed NF attempts in MDD. A stronger involvement of visual processing areas in HC may indicate better adaptation to negative emotional stimuli after repeated presentation. Overall, the rtfMRI NF had an impact on neurobiological mechanisms, but not on psychometric measures in patients with MDD.</p>

	<p>Aim: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature to evaluate the incidence of cranial ultrasound abnormalities (CUAs) amongst moderate to late preterm (MLPT) and term infants, affected by fetal growth restriction (FGR) or those classified as small for gestational age (SGA). Methods: A systematic review methodology was performed, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was utilised. Descriptive and observational studies reporting cranial ultrasound outcomes on FGR/SGA MLPT and term infants were included. Primary outcomes reported was incidence of CUAs in MLPT and term infants affected by FGR or SGA, with secondary outcomes including brain structure development and growth, and cerebral artery Dopplers. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed. Risk of Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for case&amp;amp;ndash;control and cohort studies, and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for studies reporting prevalence data. GRADE was used to assess for certainty of evidence. Results: Out of a total of 2085 studies identified through the search, seventeen were deemed to be relevant and included. Nine studies assessed CUAs in MLPT FGR/SGA infants, seven studies assessed CUAs in late preterm and term FGR/SGA infants, and one study assessed CUAs in both MLPT and term FGR/SGA infants. The incidence of CUAs in MLPT, and late preterm to term FGR/SGA infants ranged from 0.4 to 33% and 0 to 70%, respectively. A meta-analysis of 7 studies involving 168,136 infants showed an increased risk of any CUA in FGR infants compared to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants (RR 1.96, [95% CI 1.26&amp;amp;ndash;3.04], I2 = 68%). The certainty of evidence was very low due to non-randomised studies, methodological limitations, and heterogeneity. Another meta-analysis looking at 4 studies with 167,060 infants showed an increased risk of intraventricular haemorrhage in FGR/SGA infants compared to AGA infants (RR 2.40, [95% CI 2.03&amp;amp;ndash;2.84], I2 = 0%). This was also of low certainty. Conclusions: The incidence of CUAs in MLPT and term growth-restricted infants varied widely between studies. Findings from the meta-analyses suggest the risk of CUAs and IVH may indeed be increased in these FGR/SGA infants when compared with infants not affected by FGR, however the evidence is of low to very low certainty. Further specific cohort studies are needed to fully evaluate the benefits and prognostic value of cranial ultrasonography to ascertain the need for, and timing of a cranial ultrasound screening protocol in this infant population, along with follow-up studies to ascertain the significance of CUAs identified.</p>

	<p>P3b is an event-related potential (ERP) that may be abnormal in patients with tic disorders (TD), but evidence has been inconsistent. Given the possible association between P3b and TD and the need for biomarkers for TD, the primary objective of this meta-analysis was to characterize P3b in patients with TD in comparison to healthy controls (HCs). Methods: By searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Medline, and Google Scholar, we identified studies that compared P3b between TD patients and HCs. The amplitude and latency of P3b were then analyzed. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of different experimental factors on P3b indices. Result: Overall, 19 articles involving 388 cases and 414 controls were evaluated. There were no significant abnormalities in P3b amplitude and latency in TD patients. The P3b amplitude of the TD patients was significantly decreased during the oddball task, and the P3b amplitude of the adult TD patients was also significantly decreased. Conclusion: TD patients may have an abnormal P3b compared to HCs under specified conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Beyond tradition: using systemic functional linguistics in TED talks [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is an internationally based open access platform where professionals from various fields are invited to give speeches, and to share ideas with like-minded people. In recent years, topics related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) or the COVID-19 pandemic have become the most popular speech topics on TED. This paper selects speech-related topics on TED during the pandemic, by using systemic functional linguistics to study how discourses are expressed on the platform. Unlike traditional textual analyses, content on TED are normally verbalized, requiring original texts to be presented in an understandable format. As a result, this paper focuses on the functional innovation of new forms of expression on TED. In other words, the functional perspective of the presentation in relation to COVID-19 based topics may rely on the explanation of the meta-meaning of the keywords, posting images and other techniques as auxiliary means for expression, to some extent. These auxiliary techniques offer traditional systemic functional linguistics new meanings in terms of ideational and interpersonal aspects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Community-based case studies of vaccine hesitancy and the COVID-19 response in South Africa - study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In 2021 the South African government launched a large COVID-19 immunization campaign with the goal of reaching more than 40 million individuals. Nonetheless, certain international largely internet-based surveys at the time showed a significant proportion of vaccine hesitancy in South Africa. This study aims to determine and co-create with local stakeholders a comprehensive understanding of vaccine hesitancy and opportunities to support the promotion of other COVID-19 health-promoting behaviours at community level. Methods: A mixed-methods multiple case-study design; informed by the socio-ecological model of behaviour change. Four socio-economically diverse communities across South Africa will be selected and data collection will take place concurrently through three iterative phases. Phase 1 will provide insights into community experiences of COVID-19 (response) through desktop mapping exercises, observations, in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions (FGDs) designed as expression sessions with local stakeholders. Phase 2 will explore the extent and drivers of community acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. This phase will comprise a survey based on WHO’s Behavioural and Social Drivers of Vaccination tool as well as further FGDs with community members. Phase 3 will involve cross-case study syntheses and presentation of findings to national role-players. Discussion: This study will provide ground up, locally responsive, and timeous evidence on the factors influencing COVID-19 health-seeking behaviours to inform ongoing management and mitigation of COVID-19 in South Africa. It will also provide insights into the applicability of a novel vaccine hesitancy model in Africa.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Scoping review on population pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in non-critically ill [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vancomycin is an effective first-line therapy in MRSA infection, however, achieving an appropriate serum concentration is challenging. Population pharmacokinetics can assist the clinician in the selection of better regimen dosing and improve effectiveness and safety outcomes. Methods: This scoping review aims to outline the evidence in population pharmacokinetic models in non-critical adults hospitalized from 1980 to 2021 and describe the principal software and covariables used in this. A total of 209 papers were fully screened. Finally, we included 17 articles conducted in different locations around the world. Results: This review identified 13 retrospective articles and 4 prospective, 5 describing the use in a general population with gram-positive bacterial infection, 11 evaluated special populations (older, obese, and cancer patients), and 1 mixed population. The main parameters in the models were renal clearance and volume of distribution. The principal covariables that affected the models were creatinine clearance and weight. All studies use internal validation methods, and three of them used an external validation group. This scoping review highlights the principal information of different population pharmacokinetic models and the heterogeneity in the parameters and methods of evaluation. Conclusions: These methods can be used to guide the dosing regimen in different subpopulations. However, it is imperative to define the best fit in every population and conduct an experiment due to the high variability in the present studies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma amine profiles in interictal migraine</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Impaired amine metabolism has been associated with the etiology of migraine, i.e. why patients continue to get migraine attacks. However, evidence from CSF is lacking. Here we evaluated individual amine levels, global amine profiles and amine pathways in CSF and plasma of interictal migraine patients and healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>CSF and plasma were sampled between 08:30 and 13:00, randomly and interchangeably over the time span to avoid any diurnal and seasonal influences, from healthy volunteers and interictal migraine patients, matched for age, sex and sampling time. The study was approved by the Local Medical Ethics Committee. Individual amines (n=31), global amine profiles, and specific amine pathways were analyzed using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry platform.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We analyzed n=99 participants with migraine with aura, n=98 with migraine without aura, and n=96 healthy volunteers. Univariate analysis with Bonferroni correction indicated that CSF L-Arginine was reduced in migraine with aura (10.4%; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and without aura (5.0%; <i>p</i>=0.03). False discovery rate corrected CSF L-Phenylalanine was also lower in migraine with aura (6.9%; <i>p</i>=0.011) and without aura (8.1%; <i>p</i>=0.001; <i>p</i>=0.088 after Bonferroni correction). Multivariate analysis revealed that CSF global amine profiles were similar for both types of migraine (<i>p</i>=0.64), but distinct from controls (<i>p</i>=0.009). Global profile analyses were similar in plasma. Strongest associated pathways with migraine were related to L-Arginine metabolism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>L-Arginine was decreased in the CSF (but not in plasma) of interictal patients with migraine with or without aura, and associated pathways were altered. This suggests that dysfunction of nitric oxide signaling is involved in susceptibility to getting migraine attacks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Limbic connectivity underlies pain treatment response in small‐fiber neuropathy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is characterized by neuropathic pain due to degeneration of small-diameter nerves in the skin. Given that brain reorganization occurs following chronic neuropathic pain, this study investigated the structural and functional basis of pain-related brain changes after skin nerve degeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional MRI data were acquired from 53 pathologically confirmed SFN patients, and the structural and functional connectivity of the pain-related network was assessed using network-based statistic (NBS) analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with age- and sex-matched controls, the SFN patients exhibited a robust and global reduction of functional connectivity, mainly across the limbic and somatosensory systems. Furthermore, lower functional connectivity was associated with skin nerve degeneration measured by reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density and better therapeutic response to anti-neuralgia medications, particularly for the connectivity between the insula and the limbic areas including the anterior and middle cingulate cortices. Similar to the patterns of functional connectivity changes, the structural connectivity was robustly reduced among the limbic and somatosensory areas, and the cognition-integration areas including the inferior parietal lobule. There was shared reduction of structural and functional connectivity among the limbic, somatosensory, striatal, and cognition-integration systems: (1) between the middle cingulate cortex and inferior parietal lobule and (2) between the thalamus and putamen. These observations indicate the structural basis underlying altered functional connectivity in SFN.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide imaging evidence linking structural and functional brain dysconnectivity to sensory deafferentation caused by peripheral nerve degeneration and therapeutic responses for neuropathic pain in SFN.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of the evolution of resistance to multiple antibiotics enables prediction of the Escherichia coli phenotype-based fitness landscape</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Junichiro Iwasawa, Tomoya Maeda, Atsushi Shibai, Hazuki Kotani, Masako Kawada, Chikara Furusawa</p>

The fitness landscape represents the complex relationship between genotype or phenotype and fitness under a given environment, the structure of which allows the explanation and prediction of evolutionary trajectories. Although previous studies have constructed fitness landscapes by comprehensively studying the mutations in specific genes, the high dimensionality of genotypic changes prevents us from developing a fitness landscape capable of predicting evolution for the whole cell. Herein, we address this problem by inferring the phenotype-based fitness landscape for antibiotic resistance evolution by quantifying the multidimensional phenotypic changes, i.e., time-series data of resistance for eight different drugs. We show that different peaks of the landscape correspond to different drug resistance mechanisms, thus supporting the validity of the inferred phenotype-fitness landscape. We further discuss how inferred phenotype-fitness landscapes could contribute to the prediction and control of evolution. This approach bridges the gap between phenotypic/genotypic changes and fitness while contributing to a better understanding of drug resistance evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">APOE alleles are associated with sex-specific structural differences in brain regions affected in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chloé Savignac, Sylvia Villeneuve, AmanPreet Badhwar, Karin Saltoun, Kimia Shafighi, Chris Zajner, Vaibhav Sharma, Sarah A. Gagliano Taliun, Sali Farhan, Judes Poirier, Danilo Bzdok</p>

Alzheimer’s disease is marked by intracellular tau aggregates in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and extracellular amyloid aggregates in the default network (DN). Here, we examined codependent structural variations between the MTL’s most vulnerable structure, the hippocampus (HC), and the DN at subregion resolution in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). By leveraging the power of the approximately 40,000 participants of the UK Biobank cohort, we assessed impacts from the protective <i>APOE</i> ɛ2 and the deleterious <i>APOE</i> ɛ4 Alzheimer’s disease alleles on these structural relationships. We demonstrate ɛ2 and ɛ4 genotype effects on the inter-individual expression of HC-DN co-variation structural patterns at the population level. Across these HC-DN signatures, recurrent deviations in the CA1, CA2/3, molecular layer, fornix’s fimbria, and their cortical partners related to ADRD risk. Analyses of the rich phenotypic profiles in the UK Biobank cohort further revealed male-specific HC-DN associations with air pollution and female-specific associations with cardiovascular traits. We also showed that <i>APOE</i> ɛ2/2 interacts preferentially with HC-DN co-variation patterns in estimating social lifestyle in males and physical activity in females. Our structural, genetic, and phenotypic analyses in this large epidemiological cohort reinvigorate the often-neglected interplay between <i>APOE</i> ɛ2 dosage and sex and link <i>APOE</i> alleles to inter-individual brain structural differences indicative of ADRD familial risk.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Illusory responses across the Lewy body disease spectrum</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To study pareidolias, or perceived meaningful objects in a meaningless stimulus, in patients across the Lewy body (LB) disease spectrum, where most do not report hallucinations or delusions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task in 300 participants [38 cognitively-impaired LB, 65 cognitively-unimpaired LB, 51 Alzheimer's disease-spectrum (AD-s), 146 Controls]. Pairwise between-group comparisons examined how diagnosis impacts the number of illusory responses. Ordinal regression analysis compared the number of illusory responses across diagnosis groups, adjusting for age, sex, and education. Analyses were repeated after removing participants with reported hallucinations or delusions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cognitively-impaired LB participants were 12.3, 4.9, and 4.6 times more likely than Control, cognitively-unimpaired LB, and AD-s participants, respectively, to endorse illusory responses. After adjusting for age, sex and education, the probability of endorsing one or more illusory response was 61% in the cognitively-impaired LB group, compared to 26% in AD-s, 25% in cognitively-unimpaired LB, and 12% in Control participants. All results were similar after repeated analysis only in participants without hallucinations or delusions. In LB without hallucinations or delusions, 52% with mild cognitive impairment and 66.7% with dementia endorsed at least one illusory response.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found illusory responses are common in cognitively impaired LB patients, including those without any reported psychosis. Our data suggest that, prior to the onset of hallucinations and delusions, the Noise Pareidolia Task can easily be used to screen for unobtrusive pareidolias in all LB patients.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify MR metrics that are most sensitive to early changes in the brain in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and type 3 (SCA3) using an advanced multi-modal MRI protocol in the multi-site trial setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>SCA1 or SCA3 mutation carriers and controls (<i>n</i>=107) underwent MR scanning in the US-European READISCA study to obtain structural, diffusion MRI and MR spectroscopy data using an advanced protocol at 3T. Morphometric, microstructural, and neurochemical metrics were analyzed blinded to diagnosis and compared between preataxic (<i>n</i>=11 SCA1, 28 SCA3), ataxic (<i>n</i>=14 SCA1, 37 SCA3) SCA and control (<i>n</i>=17) groups using non-parametric testing accounting for multiple comparisons. MR metrics that were most sensitive to preataxic abnormalities were identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Atrophy and microstructural damage in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles and neurochemical abnormalities in the pons were prominent in both preataxic groups, when patients did not differ from controls clinically. MR metrics were strongly associated with ataxia symptoms, activities of daily living and estimated ataxia duration. A neurochemical measure was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA1 (ROC area under the curve (AUC) =0.95) and a microstructural metric was the most sensitive metric to preataxic changes in SCA3 (AUC =0.92).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Changes in cerebellar afferent and efferent pathways underlie the earliest symptoms of both SCAs. MR metrics collected with a harmonized advanced protocol in the multi-site trial setting allow detecting disease effects in individuals before ataxia onset with potential clinical trial utility for subject stratification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Ludwig's angina - 'The Dangerous Space' [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ludwig's angina is a potentially life-threatening disease characterized by diffuse bilateral cellulitis with an odontogenic origin. This unique infection is now rare owing to the antibiotic era. Case: This patient presented to the emergency room with trismus, jaw and neck swelling, mild respiratory distress with tachypnea, hyperthermia, and panic. Clinical examination and radiographic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of Ludwig's angina. As it is a quickly spreading infection, the patient was taken up for immediate surgical decompression leading to pus drainage, removal of the offending tooth, bacterial culture and sensitivity, and administration of empirical antibiotics. As we had operated promptly, there was no need for emergency airway intervention, and the patient had immediate relief from airway distress. Conclusions: Early accurate diagnosis with conservative surgical decompression, thereby negating the need for airway intervention, was vital to avoiding mortality which is always possible in such an expeditious infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Areas of research interest: joining the dots between government and research at last? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: With the aim of making it easier for researchers to produce policy-relevant research, the UK Government now requires all departments and arms-length bodies to publish annually-updated statements of their evidence needs, called ‘Areas of Research Interest’ (ARIs).  We describe how ARIs are produced, and how they are used to support this aim. Aims and objectives: In this paper we offer a description of ARIs and their development by UK governmental departments, and an assessment of how different stakeholders, including academia and funders, have responded to or otherwise used the ARIs. Key conclusions: ARIs are a mechanism for organisations to share their research interests with external audiences in the form of a published document. In addition to this primary aim, they also have a much broader set of uses, including connecting departments with each other and helping intermediaries shape engagement plans. All groups would benefit from more robust evidence to choose effective engagement mechanisms, and more can be done to make the ARIs discoverable and useable. Overall, the ARIs are a useful tool to illuminate, and begin to connect different parts of the research-policy system.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal effects of asymptomatic C9orf72 carriership on brain morphology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated effects of <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion and gene expression on longitudinal cerebral changes before symptom onset.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled 79 asymptomatic family members (AFM) from nine families with <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion. Twenty-eight AFM carried the mutation (C9+). Participants had up to three MRI scans, after which we compared motor cortex and -tracts between AFM C9+ and AFM C9- using mixed-effects models, incorporating kinship to correct for familial relations and lessen effects of other genetic factors. We also compared cortical, subcortical, cerebellar and connectome structural measurements in a hypothesis-free analysis. We correlated regional <i>C9orf72</i> expression in donor brains with the pattern of cortical thinning in AFM C9+ using meta-regression. For comparison, we included 42 C9+ and 439 C9- patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in this analysis.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AFM C9+ motor cortex had less gyrification and was thinner than C9-, without differences in motor tracts. Whole-brain analysis revealed thinner cortex and less gyrification in parietal, occipital and temporal regions, smaller thalami and right hippocampus, and affected frontotemporal connections. Thinning of bilateral precentral, precuneus and left superior parietal cortex was faster in AFM C9+ than in C9-. Higher C9orf72 expression correlated with thinner cortex in both AFM C9+ and ALS C9+.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> repeat expansion carriers, brain MRI reveals widespread features suggestive of impaired neurodevelopment, along with faster decline of motor and parietal cortex than found in normal aging. C9orf72 expression might play a role in cortical development, and consequently explain the specific brain abnormalities of mutation carriers.</p>

A higher AD-GRS based on 25 previously identified loci (excluding <i>APOE</i>) was associated with worse Montreal Cognitive Assessment (-0.14 SD[95% CI:-0.26,-0.02]), older machine learning predicted brain age (2.35 years[95%CI:0.01,4.69]), and white matter hyperintensity volume (0.35 SD [95% CI:0.00,0.71), but not with a composite cognitive outcome, total brain, or hippocampal volume. <i>APOE</i> ε4 allele was not associated with any outcomes. AD risk genes beyond <i>APOE</i> may contribute to subclinical differences in cognition and brain health in midlife.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effectiveness of a sexual assault nurse examiner-grounding program (SANE-GP) on knowledge, skill and practice regarding sexual assault examination (SAE) among nurses working in a tertiary care hospital in Udupi district, India: A study protocol [versi</a></h4>

              
                The medico-legal care of victims of sexual assault is very challenging, and requires specific knowledge and skills. Professionals in the emergency departments of hospitals might not have specialised training in forensic science. Nurses have a very significant role in these settings, but they lack any formal forensic training. This study aims to develop a sexual assault nurse examiner-grounding program (SANE-GP) for Indian nurses to inculcate knowledge and skill regarding sexual assault examination. The study adopts a three-stage Delphi technique to develop the training module and uses a time-series design to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. A questionnaire on nurses’ knowledge on sexual assault examination (KQSANE-I) will be developed in phase-I and subsequently used in phase-II. The protocol of SANE-GP will help the medical community to implement the program across India. The implementation of SANE-GP can also help to start a sexual assault nurse examiner network.

                Myeong and Klyachko report an astrocyte-dependent form of synaptic facilitation triggered by a single glutamate release event and operating at subsecond timescales. Astrocyte-driven facilitation dynamically amplifies multi-vesicular release and induces release events with distinctive spatial organization. The rapid timescale of this modulation suggests that astrocytes may contribute to synaptic computations.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Chromatin-associated YTHDC1 coordinates heat-induced reprogramming of gene expression</a></h4>

              
                Timcheva et al. show that human m6A reader YTHDC1 is a key player in heat-induced gene expression reprogramming. Upon heat stress, YTHDC1 co-transcriptionally promotes expression of HSPs and regulates intron retention of hundreds of transcripts. Later, as these two YTHDC1-dependent activities diminish, YTHDC1 relocates to nuclear stress bodies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Species-specific rewiring of definitive endoderm developmental gene activation via endogenous retroviruses through TET1-mediated demethylation</a></h4>

              
                Wu et al. report that specific endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are within accessible chromatin and expressed in definitive endoderm cells. These ERVs are derepressed by TET1 and perform as enhancers containing binding sites for FOXA2 and GATA4 to regulate genes. This ERV-based regulatory network drives species-specific transcription in mammals.

                Weiner et al. find that ΔNp63 is required for dysplastic remodeling of the distal lung after severe pulmonary injuries. Without ΔNp63, the basal-like cells responsible for this remodeling either terminally differentiate into airway cells or undergo a fate change into AT2s, thereby promoting functional regeneration of the alveolar epithelium.

                Potts et al. show that STAT3 inhibition is a conserved vulnerability for splicing factor heterozygous mutant hematopoietic cells due to its impact on splicing. These findings suggest that STAT3 inhibitors could be used alone or in combination with splicing modulators to selectively ablate splicing-defective cells in blood cancers.

                Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer.

                ZEB1 is heterogeneously expressed in cancer cells. Characterizing sub-populations with high ZEB1 levels (ZEB1hi), Schuhwerk et al. show that ZEB1 induces G1/S transition via CDK6 to launch an adaptive MRE11-involving response promoting chemoresistance. Targeting of ZEB1hi cells by MRE11 inhibition allows chemosensitization, reinforcing the translational impact of the EMT-DDR interface.

                Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease characterized by synovial hyperplasia. <i>Mir204</i> and <i>Mir211</i> are homologous miRNAs with the same gene targeting spectrum. It is known that <i>Mir204/211</i> play an important role in protecting osteoarthritis development; however, the roles of <i>Mir204/211</i> in RA disease have not been determined. In the present study, we investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of <i>Mir204/211</i> on synovial inflammation and hyperproliferation in RA. The effects of <i>Mir204/211</i> on the inflammation and abnormal proliferation in primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were examined by <i>Mir204/211</i> gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in vitro and in vivo. We identified the structure-specific recognition protein 1 (<i>Ssrp1</i>) as a downstream target gene of <i>Mir204/211</i> based on the bioinformatics analysis. We overexpressed <i>Ssrp1</i>and <i>Mir204/211</i> in FLS to determine the relationship between <i>Ssrp1</i> and <i>Mir204/211</i> and their effects on synovial hyperplasia. We created a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in wild-type as well as <i>Mir204/211</i> double knockout (dKO) mice to induce RA phenotype and administered adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated <i>Ssrp1</i>-<i>shRNA</i> (AAV-<i>shSsrp1</i>) by intra-articular injection into <i>Mir204/211</i> dKO mice. We found that <i>Mir204/211</i> attenuated excessive cell proliferation and synovial inflammation in RA. <i>Ssrp1</i> was the downstream target gene of <i>Mir204/211. Mir204/211</i> affected synovial proliferation and decelerated RA progression by targeting <i>Ssrp1</i>. CIA mice with <i>Mir204/211</i> deficiency displayed enhanced synovial hyperplasia and inflammation. RA phenotypes observed in <i>Mir204/211</i> deficient mice were significantly ameliorated by intra-articular delivery of AAV-<i>shSsrp1</i>, confirming the involvement of <i>Mir204/211</i>-<i>Ssrp1</i>signaling during RA development. In this study, we demonstrated that <i>Mir204/211</i> antagonize synovial hyperplasia and inflammation in RA by regulation of <i>Ssrp1</i>. <i>Mir204/211</i> may serve as novel agents to treat RA disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Emergent color categorization in a neural network trained for object recognition</a></h4>

              
                Color is a prime example of categorical perception, yet it is unclear why and how color categories emerge. On the one hand, prelinguistic infants and several animals treat color categorically. On the other hand, recent modeling endeavors have successfully utilized communicative concepts as the driving force for color categories. Rather than modeling categories directly, we investigate the potential emergence of color categories as a result of acquiring visual skills. Specifically, we asked whether color is represented categorically in a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to recognize objects in natural images. We systematically trained new output layers to the CNN for a color classification task and, probing novel colors, found borders that are largely invariant to the training colors. The border locations were confirmed using an evolutionary algorithm that relies on the principle of categorical perception. A psychophysical experiment on human observers, analogous to our primary CNN experiment, shows that the borders agree to a large degree with human category boundaries. These results provide evidence that the development of basic visual skills can contribute to the emergence of a categorical representation of color.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tuning of motor outputs produced by spinal stimulation during voluntary control of torque directions in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Spinal stimulation is a promising method to restore motor function after impairment of descending pathways. While paresis, a weakness of voluntary movements driven by surviving descending pathways, can benefit from spinal stimulation, the effects of descending commands on motor outputs produced by spinal stimulation are unclear. Here, we show that descending commands amplify and shape the stimulus-induced muscle responses and torque outputs. During the wrist torque tracking task, spinal stimulation, at a current intensity in the range of balanced excitation and inhibition, over the cervical enlargement facilitated and/or suppressed activities of forelimb muscles. Magnitudes of these effects were dependent on directions of voluntarily produced torque and positively correlated with levels of voluntary muscle activity. Furthermore, the directions of evoked wrist torque corresponded to the directions of voluntarily produced torque. These results suggest that spinal stimulation is beneficial in cases of partial lesion of descending pathways by compensating for reduced descending commands through activation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections to motoneurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spinal premotor interneurons controlling antagonistic muscles are spatially intermingled</a></h4>

              
                Elaborate behaviours are produced by tightly controlled flexor-extensor motor neuron activation patterns. Motor neurons are regulated by a network of interneurons within the spinal cord, but the computational processes involved in motor control are not fully understood. The neuroanatomical arrangement of motor and premotor neurons into topographic patterns related to their controlled muscles is thought to facilitate how information is processed by spinal circuits. Rabies retrograde monosynaptic tracing has been used to label premotor interneurons innervating specific motor neuron pools, with previous studies reporting topographic mediolateral positional biases in flexor and extensor premotor interneurons. To more precisely define how premotor interneurons contacting specific motor pools are organized, we used multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches in mice to minimize systematic biases associated with each method. Contrary to expectations, we found that premotor interneurons contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains like motor neurons. Thus, premotor spinal neurons controlling different muscles process motor instructions in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor circuit components.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">T cells modulate the microglial response to brain ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation after stroke is characterized by the activation of resident microglia and the invasion of circulating leukocytes into the brain. Although lymphocytes infiltrate the brain in small number, they have been consistently demonstrated to be the most potent leukocyte subpopulation contributing to secondary inflammatory brain injury. However, the exact mechanism of how this minimal number of lymphocytes can profoundly affect stroke outcome is still largely elusive. Here, using a mouse model for ischemic stroke, we demonstrated that early activation of microglia in response to stroke is differentially regulated by distinct T cell subpopulations – with T<sub>H1</sub> cells inducing a type I INF signaling in microglia and regulatory T cells (T<sub>REG</sub>) cells promoting microglial genes associated with chemotaxis. Acute treatment with engineered T cells overexpressing IL-10 administered into the cisterna magna after stroke induces a switch of microglial gene expression to a profile associated with pro-regenerative functions. Whereas microglia polarization by T cell subsets did not affect the acute development of the infarct volume, these findings substantiate the role of T cells in stroke by polarizing the microglial phenotype. Targeting T cell-microglia interactions can have direct translational relevance for further development of immune-targeted therapies for stroke and other neuroinflammatory conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Meta-Research: The need for more research into reproductive health and disease</a></h4>

              
                Reproductive diseases have a significant impact on human health, especially on women’s health: endometriosis affects 10% of all reproductive-aged women but is often undiagnosed for many years, and preeclampsia claims over 70,000 maternal and 500,000 neonatal lives every year. Infertility rates are also rising. However, relatively few new treatments or diagnostics for reproductive diseases have emerged in recent decades. Here, based on analyses of PubMed, we report that the number of research articles published on non-reproductive organs is 4.5 times higher than the number published on reproductive organs. Moreover, for the two most-researched reproductive organs (breast and prostate), the focus is on non-reproductive diseases such as cancer. Further, analyses of grant databases maintained by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the National Institutes of Health in the United States show that the number of grants for research on non-reproductive organs is 6-7 times higher than the number for reproductive organs. Our results suggest that there are too few researchers working in the field of reproductive health and disease, and that funders, educators and the research community must take action to combat this longstanding disregard for reproductive science.

                Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are key for brain development and function. Here, we link CRMP1 to a neurodevelopmental disorder. We report heterozygous <i>de novo</i> variants in the <i>CRMP1</i> gene in three unrelated individuals with muscular hypotonia, intellectual disability and/or autism spectrum disorder. Based on <i>in silico</i> analysis these variants are predicted to affect the CRMP1 structure. We further analyzed the effect of the variants on the protein structure/levels and cellular processes. We showed that the human <i>CRMP1</i> variants impact the oligomerization of CRMP1 proteins. Moreover, overexpression of the <i>CRMP1</i> variants affect neurite outgrowth of murine cortical neurons. While altered CRMP1 levels have been reported in psychiatric diseases, genetic variants in <i>CRMP1</i> gene have never been linked to human disease. We report for the first-time variants in the <i>CRMP1</i> gene and emphasize its key role in brain development and function by linking directly to a human neurodevelopmental disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Defining cellular population dynamics at single-cell resolution during prostate cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                Advanced prostate malignancies are a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men, in large part due to our incomplete understanding of cellular drivers of disease progression. We investigate prostate cancer cell dynamics at single-cell resolution from disease onset to the development of androgen independence in an in vivo murine model. We observe an expansion of a castration-resistant intermediate luminal cell type that correlates with treatment resistance and poor prognosis in human patients. Moreover, transformed epithelial cells and associated fibroblasts create a microenvironment conducive to pro-tumorigenic immune infiltration, which is partially androgen responsive. Androgen-independent prostate cancer leads to significant diversification of intermediate luminal cell populations characterized by a range of androgen signaling activity, which is inversely correlated with proliferation and mRNA translation. Accordingly, distinct epithelial populations are exquisitely sensitive to translation inhibition, which leads to epithelial cell death, loss of pro-tumorigenic signaling, and decreased tumor heterogeneity. Our findings reveal a complex tumor environment largely dominated by castration-resistant luminal cells and immunosuppressive infiltrates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cell cycle-specific loading of condensin I is regulated by the N-terminal tail of its kleisin subunit</a></h4>

              
                Condensin I is a pentameric protein complex that plays an essential role in mitotic chromosome assembly in eukaryotic cells. Although it has been shown that condensin I loading is mitosis-specific, it remains poorly understood how the robust cell cycle regulation of condensin I is achieved. Here we set up a panel of <i>in vitro</i> assays to demonstrate that cell cycle-specific loading of condensin I is regulated by the N-terminal tail (N-tail) of its kleisin subunit CAP-H. Deletion of the N-tail accelerates condensin I loading and chromosome assembly in <i>Xenopus</i> egg mitotic extracts. Phosphorylation-deficient and phosphorylation-mimetic mutations in the CAP-H N-tail decelerate and accelerate condensin I loading, respectively. Remarkably, deletion of the N-tail enables condensin I to assemble mitotic chromosome-like structures even in interphase extracts. Together with other extract-free functional assays <i>in vitro</i>, our results uncover one of the multilayered mechanisms that ensure cell cycle-specific loading of condensin I onto chromosomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single amino acid residue mediates reciprocal specificity in two mosquito odorant receptors</a></h4>

              
                The southern house mosquito, <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, utilizes two odorant receptors, CquiOR10 and CquiOR2, narrowly tuned to oviposition attractants and well conserved among mosquito species. They detect skatole and indole, respectively, with reciprocal specificity. We swapped the transmembrane (TM) domains of CquiOR10 and CquiOR2 and identified TM2 as a specificity determinant. With additional mutations, we showed that CquiOR10A73L behaved like CquiOR2. Conversely, CquiOR2L74A recapitulated CquiOR10 specificity. Next, we generated structural models of CquiOR10 and CquiOR10A73L using RoseTTAFold and AlphaFold and docked skatole and indole using RosettaLigand. These modeling studies suggested space-filling constraints around A73. Consistent with this hypothesis, CquiOR10 mutants with a bulkier residue (Ile, Val) were insensitive to skatole and indole, whereas CquiOR10A73G retained the specificity to skatole and showed a more robust response than the wildtype receptor CquiOR10. On the other hand, Leu to Gly mutation of the indole receptor CquiOR2 reverted the specificity to skatole. Lastly, CquiOR10A73L, CquiOR2, and CquiOR2L74I were insensitive to 3-ethylindole, whereas CquiOR2L74A and CquiOR2L74G gained activity. Additionally, CquiOR10A73G gave more robust responses to 3-ethylindole than CquiOR10. Thus, we suggest the specificity of these receptors is mediated by a single amino acid substitution, leading to finely tuned volumetric space to accommodate specific oviposition attractants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral Tegmental Area Glutamate Neurons establish a mu-opioid receptor gated circuit to mesolimbic dopamine neurons and regulate prescription opioid-seeking behavior</a></h4>

              
                A two-neuron model of ventral tegmental area (VTA) opioid function classically involves VTA GABA neuron regulation of VTA dopamine neurons via a mu-opioid receptor dependent inhibitory circuit. However, this model predates the discovery of a third major type of neuron in the VTA: glutamatergic neurons. We find that about one-quarter of VTA neurons expressing the mu-opioid receptor are glutamate neurons without molecular markers of GABA co-release. Glutamate-Mu opioid receptor neurons are topographically distributed in the anterior VTA. The majority of remaining VTA mu-opioid receptor neurons are GABAergic neurons that are largely within the posterior VTA and do not express molecular markers of glutamate co-release. Optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons results in monosynaptic excitatory currents recorded from VTA dopamine neurons that are reduced by presynaptic activation of the mu-opioid receptor ex vivo, establishing a local mu-opioid receptor dependent excitatory circuit from VTA glutamate neurons to VTA dopamine neurons. This VTA glutamate to VTA dopamine pathway regulates dopamine release to the nucleus accumbens through mu-opioid receptor activity in vivo. Behaviorally, VTA glutamate calcium-related neuronal activity increased following oxycodone consumption and response-contingent oxycodone-associated cues during self-administration and abstinent reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Further, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA glutamate neurons reduced abstinent oxycodone-seeking behavior in male but not female mice. These results establish 1) a three-neuron model of VTA opioid function involving a mu-opioid receptor gated VTA glutamate neuron pathway to VTA dopamine neurons that controls dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens, and 2) that VTA glutamate neurons participate in prescription opioid-seeking behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Emergence of counting in the brains of 3- to 5-year-old children</a></h4>

              
                Learning to map number words onto their ordinal and quantitative meanings is a key step in the acquisition of formal mathematics. Previous neuroimaging work suggests that the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the fronto-temporal language network may be involved in representing number words. However, the contribution of early-developing numerosity representations to the acquisition of counting has not been tested in children. If regions that support numerosity processing are important for the acquisition of counting, then there should be functional overlap between numerosity representations and number word representations in the brain, before children have mastered counting. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identified numerosity processing regions in 3- to 5-year-old children during a numerosity comparison task. To identify neural representations of number words, we measured changes in neural amplitudes while those same children listened to number words and color words and while they listened to counting and alphabet sequences. Across multiple whole-brain analyses, we found that the bilateral IPS consistently supported representations of numerosities, number words, and counting sequences. Functional overlap between numerosities and unknown counting sequences was also evident in the left IFG, and in some cases number word representations emerged in the left hemisphere fronto-temporal language network. These results provide new evidence from children that primitive numerosity processing regions of the brain interface with the language network to ground the acquisition of verbal counting.

                Background: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a common condition that frequently transitions to chronic symptoms. Experimental pain models that mimic the symptoms of clinical TMD may be useful in understanding the mechanisms, and sex differences, present in this disorder. Here we aimed to comprehensively characterise the nature and time-course of pain, functional impairment and hyperalgesia induced by repeated intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the masseter muscle, and to investigate sex differences in the NGF-induced pain experience. Methods: 94 healthy individuals participated in a longitudinal observational study with 30-day follow-up. NGF was injected into the right masseter muscle on Day 0 and Day 2. Participants attended laboratory sessions to assess pain (Numerical Rating Scale; NRS), functional limitation (mouth opening distance, Jaw Functional Limitation Scale; JFLS) and mechanical sensitization (pressure pain thresholds; PPTs) on Days 0, 2 and 5 and completed twice daily electronic pain dairies from Day 0 to day 30. Results: Peak pain averaged 2.0/10 (95 % CI: 1.6-2.4) at rest and 4.3/10 (95 % CI: 3.9-4.8) on chewing. Pain-free mouth opening distance reduced from 5.0 cm (95 % CI: 4.8-5.1 cm) on Day 0 to 3.7 cm (95 % CI: 3.5-3.9 cm) on Day 5. The greatest reduction in PPTs was observed over the masseter muscle. Females experienced higher pain, greater functional impairment, and greater sensitivity to mechanical stimuli than males. Conclusion: Intramuscular injection of NGF is a useful model with which to explore the mechanisms, and sex differences, present in clinical TMD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetic Substrates of Brain Vulnerability and Resilience in APOE2 Mice Transitioning from Midlife to Old Age</a></h4>

              
                The interplay between genotype, age, and sex may play an important role in determining successful versus pathological aging. Predicting brain networks vulnerable to age associated decline, or conversely identifying brain networks and associated molecular pathways that promote resilience will inform on treatment and prevention strategies. APOE allelic variation modulate brain vulnerability and cognitive resilience during aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APOE4 allele confers the most risk and has been intensely studied with respect to the control APOE3 allele. The APOE2 allele has been less studied, and the mechanisms by which it confers cognitive resilience and neuroprotection remain largely unknown. Mouse models with targeted replacement of the murine APOE gene with the human major APOE2 alleles provide useful tools to address such questions. Our goals were to identify changes during a critical period of middle to old age transition, and to examine whether female sex confers specific vulnerability. Our results support that age, but not female sex was important in modulating learning and memory estimates based on Morris water maze metrics, including the total distance swam to a target, the distance in the target quadrant, and the absolute winding number characterizing the shape of the swim trajectory. Diffusion weighted MRI provided estimates for atrophy, microstructural changes through fractional anisotropy, and cellularity changes through the return to origin probability from ensemble average diffusion propagators. We detected a small but significant 3% global brain atrophy due to aging, reflected by regional atrophy in the hippocampal commissure (15%), fornix, and cingulate cortex 24 (9%). Females had larger regional volumes relative to males for the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, subbrachial nucleus, postsubiculum ({approx}10%), and claustrum (>5%), while males had larger volumes for the brachium of the superior colliculus, orbitofrontal cortex, frontal association cortex, and the longitudinal fasciculus of pons (>9%). Age promoted atrophy in both white matter (anterior commissure, corpus callosum, etc.), and gray matter, in particular in olfactory cortex, frontal association area 3, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum. A negative age by sex interaction was noted for the olfactory areas, piriform cortex, amygdala, ventral hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum, suggesting faster decline in females. We used vertex screening to find associations between connectome and traits, and sparse multiple canonical correlation analysis to integrate our analyses over connectomes, traits, and RNA-seq. Brain subgraphs favored in males included the secondary motor cortex and superior cerebellar peduncle, while those for females included hippocampus and primary somatosensory cortex. Connectivity loss during transition from middle to old age affected the hippocampus and primary somatosensory cortex. We validated these subgraphs using neural networks showing increased accuracy for sex prediction from 81.9% when using the whole connectome, to 94.28% when using the subgraph estimated through vertex screening. We hypothesized that blood gene expression may help track brain and behavior changes with age and sex. The largest fold change for age related genes was for Cpt1c (log2FC = 7.1), involved in oxidation, transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, lipid metabolic processes. Arg1, a critical regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses (log2FC = 4.9) also showed age specific changes. Amongst the sex related genes, the largest FC were observed for Maoa (log2FC = 4.9) involved in the degradation of the neurotransmitters serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and implicated in response to stress. Four genes were common for age and sex related vulnerability: Myo1e (log2FC = -1.5), Creld2 (log2FC = 1.4), Ptprt (log2FC = 2.9), and Pex1 (log2FC = 3.6). Genes with the highest weight after connectome filtering included Ankzfp1, Pex1, Cep250, Nat14, Arg1, and Rangrf. Connectome filtered genes pointed to pathways relate to stress response, transport, and metabolic processes. We propose modeling approaches using sparse canonical correlation analysis to relate quantitative traits to vulnerable brain networks, and blood markers for biological processes. Our study investigated the APOE2 impact on neurocognition, brain networks, and biological pathways during aging. Identifying such brain and gene networks may help reveal targets for therapies that support successful aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A subcortical origin for rapid, target-oriented corticospinal excitability changes during visually guided reaching</a></h4>

              
                During visually guided reaching, proximal limb muscles can be activated within 80 ms of target appearance. Such 'express' visuomotor responses are temporally aligned with target appearance rather than movement onset, and invariably tuned towards the direction of the visual target regardless of the instructed reach direction. These features prompt the hypothesis that express visuomotor responses are driven by a subcortical pathway. We tested this by measuring the changes in Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) following Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) or Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) of the motor cortex as participants reached either towards or away from visual targets. We found that 70-80 ms after target presentation, MEPs in primary shoulder flexor muscle (pectoralis major) were oriented towards the target direction regardless of whether the participant subsequently reached towards or away from the target. Similar target-oriented MEP modulations were seen in posterior deltoid and biceps brachii, whereas MEPs in a finger muscle were affected neither by target nor reach direction. Critically, there were no significant differences in modulation of responses to TMS and TES across all reaching conditions, which suggests that the target-oriented modulation occurs downstream of the motor cortex output neurons. Combined, our results show that rapid target-oriented corticospinal excitability changes are tuned to the location of the visual target and at least partly driven by a subcortical pathway. A prime candidate for such subcortical modulation involves the superior colliculus and reticular formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conditional deletion of LRRC8A in the brain protects against stroke damage independently of effect on swelling-activated glutamate release</a></h4>

              
                The ubiquitous volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs), which are composed of LRRC8 proteins, facilitate cell volume homeostasis, and contribute to many other physiological processes. Prior studies demonstrated that treatment with non-specific VRAC blockers, or brain-specific deletion of the essential VRAC subunit LRRC8A, are highly protective in rodent stroke. In this work, we tested the widely accepted idea that harmful effects of VRACs in the brain are mediated by pathological release of the excitatory transmitter glutamate. We used two molecular genetic strategies to ablate LRRC8A expression in either brain astrocytes only (inducible deletion of Lrrc8a(flox/flox) with Aldh1l1-CreERT2) or the majority of brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes with Nestin-Cre). To produce stroke, genetically modified mice were subjected to a 40-minute occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. The inducible deletion of astrocytic LRRC8A yielded no histological or behavioral protection. In contrast, the brain-wide LRRC8A knockout reduced ischemic infarction by ~50% in both heterozygotes (Het) and the full Lrrc8a knockout (KO) as compared to the control Lrrc8a(flox/+) genotype. However, despite identical brain damage, Het and KO mice dramatically differed in their VRAC activities. Het mice had full swelling-activated glutamate release, while KO animals showed its virtual absence. These new findings refute the notion that VRAC-mediated glutamate release plays significant role in ischemic brain injury.

                Predictive coding as a theoretical framework that has received much attention in recent years is often used to explain the mechanisms underlying various cognitive functions, especially during motor observation when prediction of others' behavior is crucial for successful social interactions. The action observation network(AON) has been extensively studied and confirmed, but the interactions between the main regions of AON are still not well understood. Here we made use of the high spatial and temporal resolution of intracranial Electrocorticography (ECoG), to test the functions and interactions of the key nodes of AON including precentral, supramarginal and visual areas. We found more top-down beta oscillation from precentral to supramarginal during the observation of predictable actions while more bottom-up gamma oscillation from visual to supramarginal for unpredictable action s.These provide strong evidence to illustrate how our brain perceive and understand other people's actions in a predictive manner.

                Chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis (OA) remains an intractable problem with few effective treatment options. New approaches are needed to model the disease biology and to drive discovery of therapeutics. Here, we present an in vitro model of OA pain, where dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons were sensitized by a defined mixture of disease-relevant inflammatory mediators, here called Sensitizing PAin Reagent Composition or SPARC. OA-SPARC components showed synergistic or additive effects when applied in combination and induced pain phenotypes in vivo. To measure the effect of OA-SPARC on neural firing in a scalable format for drug discovery, we used a custom system for high throughput all-optical electrophysiology. This system enabled light-based membrane voltage recordings from hundreds of neurons in parallel with single cell resolution and a throughput of up to 500,000 neurons per day, with patch clamp-like single action potential resolution. A computational framework was developed to construct a multiparameter OA-SPARC neuronal phenotype and to quantitatively assess phenotype reversal by candidate pharmacology with different mechanisms of action. We screened ~3000 approved drugs and mechanistically focused compounds, yielding data from over 1.2 million individual neurons with detailed assessment of both functional OA-SPARC phenotype rescue and orthogonal 'off-target' effects. Analysis of confirmed hits revealed diverse potential analgesic mechanisms including well-known ion channel modulators as well as less characterized mechanisms including MEK inhibitors and tyrosine kinase modulators, providing validation of the platform for pain drug discovery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diverse beta burst waveform motifs characterize movement-related cortical dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Classical analyses of induced, frequency-specific neural activity typically average band-limited power over trials. More recently, it has become widely appreciated that in individual trials, beta band activity occurs as transient bursts rather than amplitude-modulated oscillations. Most studies of beta bursts treat them as unitary, and having a stereotyped waveform. However, we show there is a wide diversity of burst shapes. Using a biophysical model of burst generation, we demonstrate that waveform variability is predicted by variability in the synaptic drives that generate beta bursts. We then use a novel, adaptive burst detection algorithm to identify bursts from human MEG sensor data recorded during a joystick-based reaching task, and apply principal component analysis to burst waveforms to define a set of dimensions, or motifs, that best explain waveform variance. Finally, we show that bursts with a particular range of waveform motifs, ones not fully accounted for by the biophysical model, differentially contribute to movement-related beta dynamics. Sensorimotor beta bursts are therefore not homogeneous events and likely reflect distinct computational processes.

                The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a model animal that is being increasingly used in neuroscience research. A decade ago, the first study on unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) in zebrafish was published, inspired by protocols established for rodents in the early 1980's. Since then, several studies have been published by different groups, in some cases with conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies evaluating the effects of UCS in zebrafish and meta-analytically synthetized the data of neurobehavioral outcomes and relevant biomarkers. Literature searches were performed in three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) and a two-step screening process based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. The included studies underwent extraction of qualitative and quantitative data, as well as risk of bias assessment. Outcomes of included studies (n = 38) were grouped into anxiety/fear-related behaviour, locomotor function, social behaviour, or cortisol level domains. UCS increased anxiety/fear-related behaviour and cortisol levels while decreased locomotor function, but a significant summary effect was not observed for social behaviour. Despite including a significant number of studies, the high heterogeneity and the methodological and reporting problems evidenced in the risk of bias analysis make it difficult to assess the internal validity of most studies and the overall validity of the model. Our review thus evidences the need to conduct well-designed experiments to better evaluate the effects of UCS on the behaviour of zebrafish.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modelling Spontaneous Firing Activity of the Motor Cortex in a Spiking Neural Network with Random and Local Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Computational models of cortical activity can provide insight into the mechanisms of higher-order processing in the human brain including planning, perception and the control of movement. Activity in the cortex is ongoing even in the absence of sensory input or discernable movements and is thought to be linked to the topology of the underlying cortical circuitry (Ringach2009). However, the connectivity and its functional role in the generation of spatio-temporal firing patterns and cortical computations are still vastly unknown. Movement of the body is a key function of the brain, with the motor cortex the main cortical area implicated in the generation of movement. We built a spiking neural network model of the motor cortex which incorporates a laminar structure and circuitry based on a previous cortical model by (Potjans2014). A local connectivity scheme was implemented to introduce more physiological plausbility to the cortex model, and the effect on the rates, distributions and irregularity of neuronal firing, was compared to the original random connectivity method and experimental data. Local connectivity increased the distribution of and overall rate of neuronal firing. It also resulted in the irregularity of firing being more similar to those observed in experimental measurements, and a reduction in the variability in power spectrum measures. The larger variability in dynamical behaviour of the local connectivity model suggests that the topological structure of the connections in neuronal population plays a significant role in firing patterns during spontaneous activity. This model aims to take steps towards replicating the macroscopic network of the motor cortex, replicating realistic firing in order to shed light on information coding in the cortex. Large scale computational models such as this one can capture how structure and function relate to observable neuronal firing behaviour, and investigates the underlying computational mechanisms of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dendritic morphology affects the neuronal excitability type and the network state</a></h4>

              
                Neurons can produce a number of qualitatively different spiking dynamics, determined by external conditions like temperature and internal properties such as ion channel composition. The dynamical excitability type can impact the activity of the network, particularly its (de)synchronisation state. Neurons with an onset of spiking via a saddle homoclinic orbit (HOM) bifurcation tend to synchronise inhibitory networks while they organise the spiking activity of excitatory networks into a splay state, where firing phases differ across neurons such that they are regularly distributed in time. Based on mathematical neuron models with dendrites, we here demonstrate that the extent of dendritic arborisation can switch the excitability type to a HOM spiking onset and hence can induce (de)synchronised network states. Our analysis is applicable to a general class of spike-generating neuron models (from ball-and-stick models to anatomically reconstructed neuron models) and highlights the importance of neuronal morphology for the susceptibility of neural tissue to synchronisation in health and disease.

                Neurodegeneration and its concomitant loss of cognitive function is associated with inflammation and an accumulation of lipids, in particular cholesterol. In the brain, cholesterol is made in astrocytes and transported to surrounding cells by apolipoprotein E (apoE). Elevated cholesterol promotes inflammation in peripheral tissues, but whether astrocyte cholesterol can drive inflammation in the brain is unclear. Here we show that pro-inflammatory cytokines induce cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes. The astrocytes release the cholesterol and immune cells take it up, which causes clustering of proinflammatory receptors in lipid rafts, perpetuating the inflammatory signal. Knockout of cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes blocks the production of inflammatory cytokines in an AD mouse brain and reduces neuroinflammation induced by peripheral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the mouse. We conclude that astrocyte cholesterol is a paracrine signal to microglia and tissue-resident macrophages, resulting in increased neuroinflammation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating hippocampal replay without a ground truth</a></h4>

              
                During rest and sleep, memory traces replay in the brain. The dialogue between brain regions during replay is thought to stabilize labile memory traces for long-term storage. However, because replay is an internally-driven, spontaneous phenomenon, it does not have a ground truth - an external reference that can validate whether a memory has truly been replayed. Instead, replay detection is based on the similarity between the sequential neural activity comprising the replay event and the corresponding template of neural activity generated during active locomotion. If the statistical likelihood of observing such a match by chance is sufficiently low, the candidate replay event is inferred to be replaying that specific memory. However, without the ability to evaluate whether replay detection methods are successfully detecting true events and correctly rejecting non-events, the evaluation and comparison of different replay methods is challenging. To circumvent this problem, we present a new framework for evaluating replay, tested using hippocampal neural recordings from rats exploring two novel linear tracks. Using this two-track paradigm, our framework selects replay events based on their temporal fidelity (sequence-based detection), and applies a cross-validation using each event's trajectory discriminability, where cross-track sequenceless decoding is used to quantify whether the track replaying is also the most likely track being reactivated.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interactive auditory task reveals complex sensory-action integration in mouse primary auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Predictive coding theory postulates that the brain achieves perception by actively making predictions about the incoming sensory information and correcting them if errors signals arise. These signals are likely the most relevant when the individual is actively interacting with the environment and where the sensory outcome determines the ongoing action. In addition, the cerebral cortex is thought to play a key role in generating these signals. Thus, to study the representation of error signals in the primary sensory cortex, we trained mice to perform an interactive auditory task that coupled their actions to the generated sound and perturbed this coupling to evoke putative error responses. We imaged Layer 2/3 (L2/3) and Layer 4 (L4) neurons in the mouse primary auditory cortex, and we identified not only neurons that mainly encoded action related information but also neurons encoding the mismatch between the action and the sound. These results show that a subset of A1 neurons encode the nonlinear interactions between the sound and the action. Furthermore, more L2/3 neurons encoded action related information than L4, indicating that action-sound integration emerges hierarchically in A1 circuits. Together, our results show that complex interactions between action and sound happen in A1 and that some A1 neurons responses reflect the violation of the learnt relationship between the action and sound feedback. Thus, primary sensory cortices not only encode sensory driven activity but also represent the complex interplay between sensory inputs, expectations, and errors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterizing habit learning in the human brain at the individual and group levels: a multi-modal MRI study</a></h4>

              
                The dual-process theory of action control postulates that there are two competitive and complementary mechanisms that control our behavior: a goal-directed system that executes deliberate actions, explicitly aimed toward a particular outcome, and a habitual system that autonomously execute well-learned actions, typically following an encounter with a previously associated cue. In line with dual-process theory, animal studies have provided convincing evidence for dissociable neural mechanisms, mainly manifested in cortico-striatal regions, involved in goal-directed and habitual action control. While substantial progress has been made in characterizing the neural mechanism underlying habit learning in animals, we still lack knowledge on how habits are formed and maintained in the human brain. Thus far only one study, conducted more than a decade ago by Tricomi et al. (2009), has been able to induce habitual behavior in humans via extensive training. This study also implicated the posterior putamen in the process, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, recent attempts to replicate the behavioral results of this study were not successful. This leaves the research of human habits, and particularly the research of their formation through extensive repetition, as well as their neural basis, limited and far behind the animal research in the field. This motivated us to (1) attempt to replicate the behavioral and imaging main findings of Tricomi et al., (2) identify further functional and microstructural neural modifications associated with habit formation and manifestation, and (3) investigate the relationships between functional and structural plasticity and individual differences in habit expression. To this end, in this registered report we used Tricomi et al.'s free-operant task along with multi-modal MRI methods in a well-powered sample (n=123). In this task participants' sensitivity to outcome devaluation (an index of goal-directed/habitual action control) is tested following either short or extensive training. In contrast to our hypothesis, we were not able to demonstrate habit formation as a function of training duration nor were we able to relate any functional or microstructural plasticity in the putamen with individual habit expression. We found that a pattern of increased activations in the left head of caudate that re-occurred across each day's training is associated with goal directed behavior and that increased processing of devalued cues in low-level visual regions was indicative of goal-directed behavior (and vice versa). In a follow-up exploratory analysis comparing habitual and goal-directed subgroups within each experimental group, we found that elevated activations in frontoparietal regions during early stages of training, as well as increased reactivity towards still-valued cues in somatosensory and superior parietal regions were found in individuals that were more inclined to perform goal-directed behavior (compared with more habitual individuals). Taken together, regions commonly implicated in goal-directed behavior were most predictive of individual habit expression. Finally, we also found that differential patterns of training-related microstructural plasticity, as measured with diffusion MRI, in midbrain dopaminergic regions were associated with habit expression. This work provides new insights into the neural dynamics involved in individual habit formation/expression and encourages the development and testing of new, more sensitive, procedures for experimental habit induction in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A universal workflow for creation, validation and generalization of detailed neuronal models</a></h4>

              
                Detailed single neuron modeling is widely used to study neuronal functions. While cellular and functional diversity across the mammalian cortex is vast, most of the available computational tools are dedicated to the reproduction of a small set of specific features characteristic of a single neuron. Here, we present a generalized automated workflow for the creation of robust electrical models and illustrate its performance by building cell models for the rat somatosensory cortex (SSCx). Each model is based on a 3D morphological reconstruction and a set of ionic mechanisms specific to the cell type. We use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize passive and active ionic parameters to match the electrophysiological features extracted from whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. To shed light on which parameters are constrained by experimental data and which could be degenerate, we perform a parameter sensitivity analysis. We also validate the optimized models against additional experimental stimuli and assess their generalizability on a population of morphologies with the same morphological type. With this workflow, we generate SSCx neuronal models producing the variability of neuronal responses. Due to its versatility, our workflow can be used to build robust biophysical models of any neuronal type.

                The effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive function are not always predictable based on the direction of the current and therefore remain widely debated. Contrary to the optimism of studies using transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) over the motor cortex, cognitive domain research demonstrates great ambiguity and diversity of stimulation-related effects. Here, we investigated such a controversial impact of tDCS over the posterior medial prefrontal cortex in a monetary incentive delay (MID) task with which one can study reward-based learning or reward processing a. We found that in tMID) task where subject anticipated small or big losses in different monetary contexts, cathodal stimulation suppressed plastic changes in sensory auditory P2 event-related potential and increased feedback-related negativity (FRN) implicated in reward-prediction error processing thus revealing multidirectional effect of tDCS in the same subject group performing the same experimental task. Our finding of multidirectionality of tDCS compromise the use of tES as a ready-to-use method to test brain causality in the neurocognitive events of high complexity such as decision-making.

                Mutations within various N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits are tightly associated with severe pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders and encephalopathies (here denoted GRINopathies), for which there are no treatments. NMDARs are tetrameric receptors and can be found at the membrane of neurons in various compositions, namely in di- or tri-heteromeric forms. The GluN2B subunit appears very early in development and, therefore, prenatally this subunit is predominantly found within di-heteromeric receptors, exclusively composed of the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits. Postnatally, however, the GluN2A subunit undergoes rapid increase in expression, giving rise to the appearance of tri-heteromers containing the GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B-subunits. The latter are emerging as the principal receptor-type postnatally. Despite more than a decade of research of numerous GRINopathies, not much is known regarding the effect of GRIN variants when these are assembled within tri-heteromers. Here, we have systematically examined how two de novo GRIN2B variants (G689C and G689S) affect the function of di- and tri-heteromers. We show that whereas a single mutated subunit readily instigates a dominant negative effect over glutamate affinity of tri-heteromers, it does not dominate other features of the receptor, notably potentiation by pregnanolone-sulfate (PS). This led us to explore PS as a potential treatment for these two severe loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in cultured neurons, in which case we indeed find that the neurosteroid rescues current amplitudes. Together, we present the first report to examine LoF GRIN2B mutations in the context of di- and tri-heteromeric receptors. We also provide the first demonstration of the positive outcome of the use of a GRIN2B-relevant potentiator in the context of tri-heteromers. Our results highlight the importance of examining how different mutations affect features in various receptor subtypes, as these could not have been deduced from observations performed on purely di-heteromers. Together, our study contributes to the ongoing efforts invested towards understanding the pathophysiology of GRINopathies as well as provides insights towards a potential treatment.

                Perceptual biases are widely regarded as a window into the computational principles underlying human perception. To understand these biases, previous work has proposed a number of conceptually different and even seemingly contradicting ingredients, including attraction to a Bayesian prior, repulsion from the prior due to efficient coding, and central tendency effects on a bounded range. We present a unifying Bayesian theory of biases in perceptual estimation. We theoretically demonstrate an additive decomposition of perceptual biases into attraction to a prior, repulsion away from regions with high encoding precision, and regression away from the boundary. The results reveal a simple and universal rule for predicting the direction of perceptual biases. Our theory accounts for, and leads to new understanding of biases in the perception of a variety of stimulus attributes, including orientation, color, and magnitude.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Internal limiting membrane disruption facilitates engraftment of transplanted human stem cell derived retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death causes irreversible vision loss in patients with glaucoma and other forms of optic neuropathy because the mammalian retina and optic nerve lack endogenous regenerative capacity. RGC transplantation and optic nerve regeneration represent a potential translational approach to vision restoration in glaucoma secondary to RGC loss. Functional RGC replacement requires that 1) donor RGCs integrate into the recipient retina and receive synaptic input from afferent bipolar and amacrine cells and that 2) donor RGCs extend their axons and establish synaptic connections to appropriate neurons in the brain. Here, in an effort to address retinal integration, we demonstrate that the internal limiting membrane (ILM) acts as a physical barrier to the integration of transplanted human stem cell-derived RGCs (hRGCs) into the recipient retina following intravitreal transplantation in vivo. To circumvent the ILM barrier, we intravitreally injected the nonspecific protease pronase-E in immunosuppressed adult C57BL/6J mice prior to transplantation of hRGCs. Separately, we also transplanted hRGCs into adult Lama1nmf223 mice, which harbor a point mutation in their Lama-1 gene that causes developmental ILM dysgenesis. We assessed donor hRGC survival and engraftment using 3D reconstructions of confocal z-stacks in retinal flatmounts. Migration of surviving donor RGC somas into the recipient RGC layer significantly increased after proteolytic or developmental ILM disruption. Moreover, lamination of dendritic arbors into the recipient inner plexiform layer was observed exclusively following ILM disruption. To assess the clinical translatability of this finding, we transplanted hRGCs onto postmortem organotypic human retinal explant cultures and observed significantly increased engraftment following proteolytic ILM digestion. These findings enhance our understanding of the barriers faced by transplanted hRGCs in the adult murine and human retina and provide an avenue for clinically translatable regenerative medicine approaches to vision restoration in optic neuropathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speaker-induced suppression in EEG during a naturalistic reading and listening task</a></h4>

              
                Speaking elicits a suppressed neural response when compared to listening to others' speech, a phenomenon known as speaker-induced suppression (SIS). Previous research has focused on investigating SIS at constrained levels of linguistic representation, such as the individual phoneme and word level. Here we present scalp EEG data from a dual speech perception and production task where participants read sentences aloud then listened to playback of themselves reading those sentences. Playback was separated into predictable repetition of the previous trial and unpredictable, randomized repetition of a former trial to investigate the role predictive processing plays in SIS. Concurrent EMG was recorded to control for movement artifact during speech production. In line with previous research, event-related potential analyses at the sentence level demonstrated suppression of early auditory components of the EEG for production compared to perception. To evaluate whether specific neural representations contribute to SIS (in contrast with a global gain change), we fit linear encoding models that predicted scalp EEG based on phonological features, EMG activity, and task condition. We found that phonological features were encoded similarly between production and perception. However, this similarity was only observed when controlling for movement by using the EMG response as an additional regressor. Our results suggest SIS is at the representational level a global gain change between perception and production, not the suppression of specific characteristics of the neural response. We also detail some important considerations when analyzing EEG during continuous speech production.

                Background: Current clinical assessments of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rely solely on subjective symptoms and experiences reported by the patient, rather than objective biomarkers of the illness. Recent advances in data-driven computational approaches have been helpful in devising tools to objectively diagnose psychiatric disorders. Here we aimed to classify individuals with PTSD versus controls using heterogeneous brain datasets from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD Working group. Methods: We analyzed brain MRI data from 3,527 structural-MRI; 2,502 resting state-fMRI; and 1,953 diffusion-MRI. First, we identified the brain features that best distinguish individuals with PTSD from controls (TEHC and HC) using traditional machine learning methods. Second, we assessed the utility of the denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE) and evaluated its classification performance. Third, we assessed the generalizability and reproducibility of both models using leave-one-site-out cross-validation procedure for each modality. Results: We found lower performance in classifying PTSD vs. controls with data from over 20 sites (60% test AUC for s-MRI, 59% for rs-fMRI and 56% for d-MRI), as compared to other studies run on single-site data. The performance increased when classifying PTSD from HC without trauma history across all three modalities (75% AUC). The classification performance remained intact when applying the DVAE framework, which reduced the number of features. Finally, we found that the DVAE framework achieved better generalization to unseen datasets compared with the traditional machine learning frameworks, albeit performance was slightly above chance. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the promise offered by machine learning methods for the diagnosis of patients with PTSD. The utility of brain biomarkers across three MRI modalities and the contribution of DVAE models for improving generalizability offers new insights into neural mechanisms involved in PTSD.

                Mutations in TDP-43 are known to cause Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). TDP-43 binds to and regulates splicing of several RNA including Zmynd11. Zmynd11 is a transcriptional repressor and a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase family member, known for its role in neuron and muscle differentiation. Mutations in Zmynd11 have been associated with autism with significant developmental motor delays, intellectual disability, and ataxia. Here, we show that Zmynd11 is aberrantly spliced in the brain and spinal cord of transgenic mice overexpressing a mutant human TDP-43 (A315T), and that these changes occur before the onset of motor symptoms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural computations in prosopagnosia</a></h4>

              
                We aimed to identify neural computations underlying the loss of face identification ability by modelling the brain activity of brain-lesioned patient PS, a well-documented case of acquired pure prosopagnosia. We collected a large dataset of high-density electrophysiological (EEG) recordings from PS and neurotypicals while they completed a one-back task on a stream of face, object, animal and scene images. We found reduced neural decoding of face identity around the N170 window in PS, and conjointly revealed normal non-face identification in this patient. We used Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to correlate human EEG representations with those of deep neural network (DNN) models of vision and caption-level semantics, offering a window into the neural computations at play in patient PS's deficits. Brain representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) were computed for each participant at 4 ms steps using cross-validated classifiers. PS's brain RDMs showed significant reliability across sessions, indicating meaningful measurements of brain representations with RSA even in the presence of significant lesions. Crucially, computational analyses were able to reveal PS's representational deficits in high-level visual and semantic brain computations. Such multi-modal data-driven characterisations of prosopagnosia highlight the complex nature of processes contributing to face recognition in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Computational mechanisms underlying thalamic regulation of prefrontal signal-to-noise ratio in decision making</a></h4>

              
                The mediodorsal (MD) thalamus is a critical partner for the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in cognitive flexibility. Animal experiments have shown that the MD enhances prefrontal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decision making under uncertainty. However, the computational mechanisms of this cognitive process remain unclear. Here we use performance-optimized computational models to dissect these mechanisms. We find that the inclusion of an MD-like feedforward module increases robustness to sensory noise and enhances working memory maintenance in the recurrent PFC network performing a context-dependent decision-making task. Incorporating genetically identified thalamocortical pathways that regulate signal amplification and noise reduction further improves performance and replicates key neurophysiological findings of neuronal tuning. Our model reveals a key computational mechanism of context-invariant, cell-type specific regulation of sensory uncertainty in a task-phase specific manner. Additionally, it makes experimentally testable predictions that connect disrupted thalamocortical connectivity with classical theories of prefrontal excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance and dysfunctional inhibitory cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Awake Hippocampal-Cortical Co-reactivation Is Associated with Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                Systems consolidation theories posit that consolidation occurs primarily through a coordinated communication between hippocampus and neocortex (McClelland and O'Reilly 1995; Kumaran et al., 2016; Moscovitch and Gilboa, 2022). Recent sleep studies in rodents have shown that hippocampus and visual cortex replay the same information at temporal proximity ("co-replay") (Ji & Wilson, 2007; Lansink et al., 2009; Wierzynski et al., 2009; Peyrache et al., 2009). We developed a novel TR-based co-reactivation (TRCR) analysis method to study hippocampal-cortical co-replays in humans using functional MRI. Thirty-six young adults completed an image (face or scene)-location paired associate encoding task in the scanner, which were preceded and followed by resting state scans. We identified post-encoding rest TRs (+/- 1) that showed neural reactivation of each image-location trials in both hippocampus (HPC) and category-selective cortex (fusiform face area, FFA). This allowed us to characterize temporally proximal coordinated reactivations ("co-reactivations") between HPC and FFA. Moreover, we found that increased HPC-FFA co-reactivations were associated with incorrectly recognized trials after a 1-week delay (p = 0.004). Finally, we found that these HPC-FFA co-reactivations were also associated with trials that were initially correctly recognized immediately after encoding but were later forgotten in 1-day (p = 0.043) and 1-week delay period (p = 0.031). We discuss these results from a trace transformation perspective (Winocur and Moscovitch, 2011; Sekeres et al., 2018) and speculate that HPC-FFA co-reactivations may be integrating related events, at the expense of disrupting event-specific details, hence leading to forgetting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel histological staging of hippocampal sclerosis that is evident in grey matter loss in vivo.</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS) is defined by end-stage histological findings, strongly associated with limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). We aimed to characterize features of early HS to refine the understanding of its role within combined pathology. METHODS: We studied 159 brain donations from the multimodal Vallecas Alzheimers Center Study. A staging system (0 to IV) was developed to account for HS progression and analyzed in relation to pre-mortem cognitive and MRI data. RESULTS: Our HS staging system displayed a significant correlation with disease duration, cognitive performance and combined neuropathologies, especially with LATE. Two-level assessment along the hippocampal longitudinal axis revealed an anterior-posterior gradient of HS severity. In vivo MRI showed focally reduced hippocampal grey matter density as a function of HS staging. DISCUSSION: The association of this staging system with clinical progression and structural differences supports its utility in the characterization and potential in vivo monitoring of HS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alpha-band lateralization and microsaccades elicited by exogenous cues do not track attentional orienting</a></h4>

              
                We explore the world by constantly shifting our focus of attention towards salient stimuli, and then disengaging from them in search of new ones. The alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) has been suggested as a pivotal neural substrate of these attentional shifts, due to its local synchronization and desynchronization that suppresses irrelevant cortical areas and facilitates relevant areas, a phenomenon called alpha lateralization. Whether alpha lateralization tracks the focus of attention from orienting toward a salient stimulus to disengaging from it is still an open question. In this study, we addressed this question by leveraging the well-established phenomenon of Inhibition of Return (IOR), consisting of an initial facilitation in response times (RTs) for target stimuli appearing at an exogenously cued location, followed by a suppression of that location. Our behavioral data showed a typical IOR effect with both early facilitation and subsequent inhibition. By contrast, alpha was lateralized only in the cued direction, but never re-lateralized in a manner compatible with the behavioral inhibition effect. Importantly, also the initial lateralization towards the cue ocurred too late to account for the behavioral facilitation effect. Furthermore, we analyzed the interaction between alpha lateralization and microsaccades: at the same time when alpha was lateralized towards the cued location, microsaccades were mostly oriented away from the cued location. Crucially, the two phenomena showed a significant positive correlation. These results indicate that alpha lateralization reflects primarily the processing of salient stimuli, challenging the view that alpha lateralization is directly involved in exogenous attentional orienting per se. We discuss the relevance of the present findings for an oculomotor account of alpha lateralization as a modulator of cortical excitability in preparation of a saccade.

                Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are devices designed for communication between the central nervous system and a computer. The communication can occur through different sensory modalities, and most commonly visual and auditory systems are used. We suggest that BCIs can be expanded by the incorporation of olfactory modality. To probe the modulation of EEG activity by odorants, we implemented two olfactory tasks: one that required attention to perception of odors, and the second one where participants discriminated consecutively presented odors. EEG recordings were conducted in 13 healthy participants while they performed the tasks following computer-generated verbal instructions. Respiratory activity was recorded to relate EEG modulations to the breath cycle. Theta activity responses were observed over the frontal EEG leads approximately 2 s after the inhalation. This theta activity was different depending on whether or not the inhaled air contained an odorant, and cognitive load also had an effect. We conclude that the frontal theta rhythm is reflective of the neural processing of odors. As such, it could be incorporated in the olfactory-based BCIs which take odors either as inputs or outputs. These BCIs could improve olfactory training needed for conditions like anosmia and hyposmia, and mild cognitive impairment.

                Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the earliest changes in AD is endosomal enlargement in neurons, which was reported as enhanced in ApoE4 carriers. ApoE is thought to be internalized into endosomes of neurons, while {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) accumulates within neuronal endosomes early in AD. However, it remains unknown whether ApoE and A{beta} intersect intracellularly. We show that internalized astrocytic ApoE localizes mostly to lysosomes in neuroblastoma cells and astrocytes, while in neurons it preferentially localizes to endosomes-autophagosomes of neurites. In AD transgenic neurons, astrocyte-derived ApoE intersects intracellularly with amyloid precursor protein (APP)/A{beta}. Moreover, ApoE4 increases the levels of endogenous and internalized A{beta}42 in neurons. Taken together, we demonstrate differential localization of ApoE in neurons, astrocytes and neuron-like cells, and show that internalized ApoE intersects with APP/A{beta} in neurons, which may be of considerable relevance to AD.

	<p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown elevations in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal associated with, but insensitive for, seizure. Rather than evaluating absolute BOLD signal elevations, assessing rhythmic oscillations in the BOLD signal with fMRI may improve the accuracy of seizure mapping. We report a case of a patient with non-convulsive, right hemispheric seizures who underwent fMRI. Unbiased processing methods revealed a map of rhythmically oscillating BOLD signal over the cortical region affected by seizure, and synchronous BOLD signal in the contralateral cerebellum. High-resolution fMRI may help identify the spatial topography of seizure and provide insights into seizure physiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Neural crest cell-placodal neuron interactions are mediated by Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin during early chick trigeminal ganglion assembly [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Arising at distinct positions in the head, the cranial ganglia are crucial for integrating various sensory inputs. The largest of these ganglia is the trigeminal ganglion, which relays pain, touch and temperature information through its three primary nerve branches to the central nervous system. The trigeminal ganglion and its nerves are composed of derivatives of two critical embryonic cell types, neural crest cells and placode cells, that migrate from different anatomical locations, coalesce together, and differentiate to form trigeminal sensory neurons and supporting glia. While the dual cellular origin of the trigeminal ganglion has been known for over 60 years, molecules expressed by neural crest cells and placode cells that regulate initial ganglion assembly remain obscure. Prior studies revealed the importance of cell surface cadherin proteins during early trigeminal gangliogenesis, with Cadherin-7 and neural cadherin (N-cadherin) expressed in neural crest cells and placode cells, respectively. Although cadherins typically interact in a homophilic (i.e., like) fashion, the presence of different cadherins expressed in neural crest cells and placode cells raises the question as to whether heterophilic cadherin interactions may also be occurring. Given this, the aim of the study was to understand whether Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin were interacting during initial trigeminal ganglion formation. Methods: To assess potential interactions between Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin, we used biochemistry and innovative imaging assays conducted in vitro and in vivo, including in the forming chick trigeminal ganglion. Results: Our data revealed a physical interaction between Cadherin-7 and N-cadherin. Conclusions: These studies identify a new molecular basis by which neural crest cells and placode cells can aggregate in vivo to build the trigeminal ganglion during embryogenesis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">General anaesthetics reduce acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell migration and homing in vitro and in vivo via CXCR4 and osteopontin mediated mechanisms [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common type of cancer in children. General anaesthetics are often used on patients undergoing painful procedures during ALL treatments but their effects on ALL malignancy remain unknown. Herein, we aim to study the effect of two commonly used general anaesthetics, intravenous propofol and inhalational sevoflurane, on the migration and homing of ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: NALM-6 cells were treated with propofol (5 and 10 μg/ml) or sevoflurane (3.6%) in vitro for six hours. Then, cells were harvested for flow cytometry analysis. For in vitro migration experiments, NALM-6 cells were pre-treated with propofol and sevoflurane for six hours before being loaded onto the upper chamber of a migration chamber and cells were collected in the lower chamber after six hours of migration. For in vivo adhesion assays, NALM-6 cells were pre-treated with propofol and sevoflurane before an adhesion assay was carried out. In in vitro experiments, GFP-NALM-6 cells were pre-treated with propofol (10 μg/ml) or sevoflurane (3.6%) for six hours. Then, cells were injected intravenously to C57BL/6 female mice followed by intravital microscopy. Results: Both anaesthetics reduced in vitro migration, in vivo migration and in vivo homing as exemplified by 1) the reduction in the number of cells entering the bone marrow and 2) the disturbance in homing location in relation to the nearest endosteal surface. Our results indicated that general anaesthetics reduced the surface CXCR4 expression. In addition, the adhesion of leukaemia cells to thrombin cleaved osteopontin (OPN) was reduced by general anaesthetics. Those changes might result in the alterations in migration and homing. Conclusion: Together, our data suggest that both propofol and sevoflurane could reduce ALL migration and homing in vivo and in vitro via CXCR4 and OPN mediated mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluating the effect of digital technology on the learning of orthodontic cephalometric measurement [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of applying digital technology in cephalometric measurement teaching and students’ acceptance towards it. Methods: In total, 94 undergraduates of stomatology were recruited and randomly allocated to two groups. According to the cross-over design, both groups completed cephalometric measurements through the traditional hand-drawn method and digital technology (the Dolphin software) in different orders. By traditional hand-drawn method, students need to depict the outlines of the craniofacial anatomical structures on the sulfuric transfer paper first, then marked the measurement points and completed the measurement of line spacings and angles. By digital technology, they should mark the points in the software and adjust the automatically generated outlines of the structures and obtained the results. Besides, an online questionnaire was designed to investigate students' attitudes toward the digital technology. Two professional orthodontists were invited as instructors. They measured a lateral cranial radiograph by two methods with one week’s interval, and their intra- and inter-class correlation coefficient were measured. The means of their measurements were set as standards. Results: The inter- and intra-ICC of two instructors surpassed 90%, and there were no significant differences between their measurements, and the measurements by two methods. There were significant differences of students’ measurements (P1-SNA<0.01, P1-SNB=0.01 and P1-L1-NB (mm)<0.01; SNA: sella-nasion-subspinale angle, SNB: sella-nasion-supramental angle, L1-NB (mm): the distance from the lower central incisor tip to the nasion-supramental plane) between the traditional method and digital technology. Besides, the most results of digital technology were closer to the standards than those of traditional method, including five items with statistical significance (P2-SNB<0.05, P2-L1-NB (mm)<0.01, P2-FMA<0.05, P2-FMIA<0.05, P2-IMPA<0.01), while three items were the opposite (P2-SNA<0.05, P2-ANB (mm)<0.01, P2-NA-PA<0.01). The questionnaire showed more students preferred digital technology (33%) compared with traditional method (2%) and 72% of participants mastered 50-80% of cephalometric knowledge after the course.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sense of personal agency towards mitigating the threat of antibiotic resistance: a focus group study with parents of children under 5 years old, conducted mid-pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Most antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care, largely in children under 5 years old, and often inappropriately. This study investigated knowledge, attitudes and behaviours (KABs) towards common childhood infections, antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), among parents of children under 5 years old. The concept of individual sacrifice (forgoing antibiotics—a selective pressure for AMR) to mitigate future societal risk of AMR and how the COVID-19 pandemic shaped views were explored. Methods: This qualitative study included three, one-hour, virtual focus groups with mothers from parenting networks across inner-city London and semi-rural England, held mid-pandemic (2020). All had ≥1 child <5 years old. The Framework Method of analysis was used. Parents' KABs towards antibiotic use/AMR formed the primary outcome, with emphases on their sense of personal agency towards mitigating the threat of AMR for society, plus how the pandemic influenced views on infection prevention and care. Results: Fourteen mothers (groups of six, four, four) participated, with mixed ethnicities, education and employment status. Parent perceptions of their individual child's immediate need for antibiotics outweighed concerns for any possible future threat of AMR to society. Four key themes were identified: uncertainty around symptoms; impact of socio-cultural background on KAB; poor understanding of how antibiotics/AMR work; and opportunities within the doctor–patient dialogue to shape mindset around AMR. The pandemic influenced views across themes. Conclusion: Parents prioritising their child's perceived, immediate, individual 'need' for antibiotics over any future impact of AMR on society highlights a continuing need to engage parents in how to mitigate AMR through appropriate antibiotic use, reducing threat to both their child and others. Framing point-of-care dialogue around antibiotic use/AMR in the present (versus future), drawing on pandemic insights and tailoring according to nuanced socio-cultural influences, may encourage a greater sense of personal agency towards taking action to mitigate antibiotic resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Circadian stabilization loop: the regulatory hub and therapeutic target promoting circadian resilience and physiological health [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock is a fundamental biological mechanism that orchestrates essential cellular and physiological processes to optimize fitness and health. The basic functional unit is the cell-autonomous oscillator, consisting of intersecting negative feedback loops. Whereas the core loop is primarily responsible for rhythm generation, auxiliary loops, most notably the secondary or stabilization loop, play pivotal roles to confer temporal precision and molecular robustness. The stabilization loop contains opposing nuclear receptor subfamilies REV-ERBs and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs), competing to modulate rhythmic expression of the basic helix-loop-helix ARNT like 1 (Bmal1) genes in the core loop as well as other clock-controlled genes. Therefore, REV-ERBs and RORs are strategically located to interface the oscillator and the global transcriptomic network, promoting cellular homeostasis and physiological fitness throughout lifespan. Disruption of REV-ERB and ROR functions has been linked with diseases and aging, and pharmacological manipulation of these factors has shown promise in various mouse disease models. Nobiletin is a natural compound that directly binds to and activates RORα/γ, modulating circadian rhythms, and shows robust in vivo efficacies to combat clock-associated pathophysiologies and age-related decline. Results from several studies demonstrate an inverse relation between nobiletin efficacy and clock functional state, where nobiletin elicits little effect in young and healthy mice with growing efficacy as the clock is perturbed by environmental and genetic challenges. This mode of action is consistent with the function of the stabilization loop to promote circadian and physiological resilience. Future studies should further investigate the function and mechanism of REV-ERBs and RORs, and test strategies targeting these factors against disease and aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The conditional effect of family resilience on family quality of life during the Covid-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges, both economically and psychologically, to most families across the world. Yet, little study has been done on this topic in Indonesia, even after the second year of the pandemic. This study examines how the Covid-19 economic impact and parental stress are related to the family quality of life (FQOL) and how the relation is moderated by family resilience. Methods: To this end, we employed previously tested measures to assess the level of parental stress, family resilience and FQOL. Especially for the latter, we modified the measure, developed by Beach Center on Disability, by including only four domains (i.e., family interaction, parenting, emotional well-being, and material well-being) to adjust to our research context. Results: Based on 169 participants, our CFA displays that all employed measures in the study are valid and reliable. Our regression analysis shows that there are significant direct relations of parental stress & family resilience with family quality of life. However, we find that family resilience only positively moderates the relation between the Covid-19 economic impact and family quality of life. Discussion: This study presents a view on how the Covid-19 pandemic affects the way families live and hence, their quality of life. In addition, the findings suggest the importance of family relationship and support in times of crisis, not limited to the Covid-19 pandemic.

                Background: It is important and challenging to distinguish between acute myocardial infarction and Wellens syndrome due to its time to intervention. Difficulties in differentiating between subtypes could mean the patients are overtreated or receive undertreatment. Case report: A 57-year-old man was referred to our emergency ward with acute onset of chest pain. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were suggestive of Wellens syndrome type A. Nitroglycerin was administrated, the patient's chest pain disappeared, and we planned an early invasive strategy. He had a previous documented ECG before he went for catheterization and based on the second ECG changes were suggestive of an ST elevation. As the result of the invasive strategy, it was found that there was single-vessel disease, near total occlusion in the middle of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with collateral from the right coronary artery. After two days of observation in the Intensive Cardiovascular Care Unit (ICCU), the patient improved and was transferred to the Low Care Unit. Conclusions: The case highlights Wellens syndrome in acute total occlusion with collateral artery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Importance of social support for Indonesian stroke patients with depression [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Approximately one-third of stroke survivors experience depression at some point, which is linked to poor functional results and high mortality rate. Social support from family, friends, and the community is an intervening variable in stroke outcomes aside from the rehabilitation treatments that patients receive. This study assessed the importance of social support for stroke patients with depression and its relationship with patient rehabilitation. Methods: This quantitative study used a cross-sectional approach on stroke patients and their families based on data from the Social Security Administrator for Health (BPJS Kesehatan). One hundred and four participants were recruited using purposive sampling by including stroke patients who have used National Health Insurance (JKN) for stroke medications. Results: We found that instrumental, emotional, interactive, and information support contribute to lowering depressive symptoms. Instrumental support in the form of food availability, money, goods, and services had the highest coefficient value for reducing depression. Emotional support in the form of care and compassion had the second highest value in reducing depression. Further, interaction and informational support remain critical components of social support in reducing depression.   Conclusion: The support system plays a key role in decreasing the depression level in stroke survivors. The family and neighborhood have a significant impact on accelerating the rehabilitation process of stroke patients by providing support.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among dental healthcare providers: A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are common in dentistry due to the prolonged static work involved during patient care, making dental health care personnel vulnerable to musculoskeletal complaints. We aimed to pool the prevalence estimates of MSD among various dental healthcare providers, including dentists, dental students, dental hygienists, and auxiliaries. Methods: A systematic search of five databases was performed (Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source). The studies that reported the prevalence of MSD among dental healthcare workers and those written in English were selected. Screening and data extraction were performed by two review authors independently. Discrepencies were resolved by another review author. Risk of bias assessment was done using a nine-item questionnaire developed by Hoy et al. Pooled estimates were calculated using meta-analysis of proportions (random effects model). Results: Among the 3090 publications screened, 234 publications were included for full-text screening. Meta-analysis was performed for 89 estimates from 88 publications. Females showed significantly higher prevalence [OR = 1.42 (95% CI = 1.09–1.84); I2 = 66.02; N = 32]. The analysis yielded a pooled estimate of 78.4% (95% CI = 74.8–82). The meta-regression showed similar prevalence over the years (Coefficient: 0.001; P-value: 0.762). Conclusions: A high prevalence of MSD was noted among dental healthcare providers, with about seven out of ten having experienced MSD in the past. This emphasizes the need for awareness and adoption of appropriate ergonomic postures by dental healthcare providers from early in their careers to minimize work-related MSD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of gender, age, and body mass index for spatiotemporal parameters of bilateral gait pattern [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Studies on the gaits parameters have been identified on the patient population. Most researchers confirm that the patients walk differently than normal people and they may have a greater risk of falls. Consistent finding and description of gender, age, and body mass index differences in gait studies is rare in healthy subjects.  This research was performed to compare spatiotemporal parameters of gait between gender, as per their age and body mass index level.   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with forty-five young adults (F=20, M=25). Stadiometer and Physilog 4 inertial sensors were used for data collection. A gait analyzer 5.2 software (GaitUp, S.A. Lausanne, Switzerland) was used to determine spatiotemporal parameters.   Results:  Females were found with higher mean score of total double support and cadence than males. Cadence also increases with age. Obese people showed lower gait speed, cadence, and total double support. No statistically significant differences were found in any bilateral foot gait parameters with respect to gender, age, and body mass index. Conclusion: The findings of the study may be beneficial to those who have abnormal gait pattern due to age, body mass index differences, decreased muscle strength, spasticity, and joint mobility. This important information should be considered to rehabilitate patients with abnormal gait patterns to controlling dynamic balance and risk of falling.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Leveraging biochemical reactions to unravel functional impacts of cancer somatic variants affecting protein interaction interfaces [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Considering protein mutations in their biological context is essential for understanding their functional impact, interpretation of high-dimensional datasets and development of effective targeted therapies in personalized medicine. Methods: We combined the curated knowledge of biochemical reactions from Reactome with the analysis of interaction-mediating 3D interfaces from Mechismo. In addition, we provided a software tool for users to explore and browse the analysis results in a multi-scale perspective starting from pathways and reactions to protein-protein interactions and protein 3D structures. Results: We analyzed somatic mutations from TCGA, revealing several significantly impacted reactions and pathways in specific cancer types. We found examples of genes not yet listed as oncodrivers, whose rare mutations were predicted to affect cancer processes similarly to known oncodrivers. Some identified processes lack any known oncodrivers, which suggests potentially new cancer-related processes (e.g. complement cascade reactions). Furthermore, we found that mutations perturbing certain processes are significantly associated with distinct phenotypes (i.e. survival time) in specific cancer types (e.g. PIK3CA centered pathways in LGG and UCEC cancer types), suggesting the translational potential of our approach for patient stratification. Our analysis also uncovered several druggable processes (e.g. GPCR signalling pathways) containing enriched reactions, providing support for new off-label therapeutic options. Conclusions: In summary, we have established a multi-scale approach to study genetic variants based on protein-protein interaction 3D structures. Our approach is different from previously published studies in its focus on biochemical reactions and can be applied to other data types (e.g. post-translational modifications) collected for many types of disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Close-kin mark-recapture methods to estimate demographic parameters of mosquitoes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yogita Sharma, Jared B. Bennett, Gordana Rašić, John M. Marshall</p>

Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters such as census population size and survival for fish of interest to fisheries and conservation. These methods have advantages over traditional mark-recapture methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with parameter estimation. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and novel biocontrol strategies. Here, we extend CKMR methods to the life history of mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for mother-offspring, father-offspring, full-sibling and half-sibling pairs, where an individual in each pair may be a larva, pupa or adult. A pseudo-likelihood approach is used to combine the marginal probabilities of all kinship pairs. To test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating mosquito demographic parameters, we develop an individual-based model of mosquito life history incorporating egg, larva, pupa and adult life stages. The simulation labels each individual with a unique identification number, enabling close-kin relationships to be inferred for sampled individuals. Using the dengue vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i> as a case study, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased estimates of adult census population size, adult and larval mortality rates, and larval life stage duration for logistically feasible sampling schemes. Considering a simulated population of 3,000 adult mosquitoes, estimation of adult parameters is accurate when ca. 40 adult females are sampled biweekly over a three month period. Estimation of larval parameters is accurate when adult sampling is supplemented with ca. 120 larvae sampled biweekly over the same period. The methods are also effective at detecting intervention-induced increases in adult mortality and decreases in population size. As the cost of genome sequencing declines, CKMR holds great promise for characterizing the demography of mosquitoes and comparable insects of epidemiological and agricultural significance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mixed mechanism of conformational selection and induced fit as a molecular recognition process in the calreticulin family of proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ashalatha Sreshty Mamidi, Avadhesha Surolia</p>

The fundamental question on the mechanism of molecular recognition during ligand binding has attracted a lot of scientific scrutiny. The two competing theories of ligand binding–“induced fit” and “conformational selection” have been proposed to explain biomolecular recognition. Since exploring a family of proteins with similar structural architectures and conserved functional roles can provide valuable insight into the significance of molecular structure and function, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on the calreticulin family of proteins, which specifically recognize monoglucosylated N-glycan during the protein folding process. Atomistic simulations of lectins in free and bound forms demonstrated that they exist in several conformations spanning from favorable to unfavorable for glycan binding. Our analysis was confined to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of these lectins to demonstrate the degree of conservation in protein sequence and structure and relate them with their function. Furthermore, we computed the lectin-glycan binding affinity using the mmPBSA approach to identify the most favorable lectin conformation for glycan binding and compared the molecular interaction fields in terms of noncovalent bond interactions. We also demonstrated the involvement of Tyr and Trp residues in the CRD with the non-reducing end glucose and central mannose residues, which contribute to some of the specific interactions. Furthermore, we analyzed the conformational changes in the CRD through SASA, RMSFs and protein surface topography mapping of electrostatic and hydrophobic potentials. Our findings demonstrate a hybrid mechanism of molecular recognition, initially driven by conformational selection followed by glycan-induced fluctuations in the key residues to strengthen the glycan binding interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Metabolic reprogramming in Rheumatoid Arthritis Synovial Fibroblasts: A hybrid modeling approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sahar Aghakhani, Sylvain Soliman, Anna Niarakis</p>

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a highly invasive pannus formation consisting mainly of Synovial Fibroblasts (RASFs). This pannus leads to cartilage, bone, and soft tissue destruction in the affected joint. RASFs’ activation is associated with metabolic alterations resulting from dysregulation of extracellular signals’ transduction and gene regulation. Deciphering the intricate mechanisms at the origin of this metabolic reprogramming may provide sign insight into RASFs’ involvement in RA’s pathogenesis and offer new therapeutic strategies. Qualitative and quantitative dynamic modeling can address some of these features, but hybrid models represent a real asset in their ability to span multiple layers of biological machinery. This work presents the first hybrid RASF model: the combination of a cell-specific qualitative regulatory network with a global metabolic network. The automated framework for hybrid modeling exploits the regulatory network’s trap-spaces as additional constraints on the metabolic network. Subsequent flux balance analysis allows assessment of RASFs’ regulatory outcomes’ impact on their metabolic flux distribution. The hybrid RASF model reproduces the experimentally observed metabolic reprogramming induced by signaling and gene regulation in RASFs. Simulations also enable further hypotheses on the potential reverse Warburg effect in RA. RASFs may undergo metabolic reprogramming to turn into "metabolic factories", producing high levels of energy-rich fuels and nutrients for neighboring demanding cells through the crucial role of HIF1.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to examine the comparative safety of antiseizure medication (ASM) monotherapy in pregnancy with respect to risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs), overall and by MCM subtype.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a population-based cohort study using national health register data from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (1996–2020). We compared pregnancies with first trimester exposure to lamotrigine monotherapy to ASM-unexposed, carbamazepine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate to lamotrigine monotherapy, and stratified monotherapy groups by dose. The outcome was nongenetic MCM and specific subtypes. We estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with log-binomial regression and propensity score weights.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was a higher crude risk of any MCM in pregnancies exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy (n = 8,339) compared to ASM-unexposed pregnancies (n = 4,866,362), but not after confounder adjustment (aRR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.87–1.08). Compared to lamotrigine, there was an increased risk of malformations associated with valproate (n = 2,031, aRR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.70–2.46) and topiramate (n = 509, aRR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.26–2.60), which increased in a dose-dependent manner. We found no differences in malformation risk for carbamazepine (n = 2,674, aRR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.72–1.15), oxcarbazepine (n = 1,313, aRR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.83–1.44), or levetiracetam (n = 1,040, aRR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.53–1.13). Valproate was associated with several malformation subtypes, including nervous system, cardiac, oral clefts, clubfoot, and hypospadias, whereas lamotrigine and carbamazepine were not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Topiramate is associated with an increased risk of MCM similar to that associated with valproate, but lower doses may mitigate the risks for both drugs. Conversely, we found no increased risks for lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam, which is reassuring. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Prospective studies of encephalitis are rare in regions where encephalitis is prevalent, such as low middle-income Southeast Asian countries. We compared the diagnostic yield of local and advanced tests in cases of pediatric encephalitis in Myanmar.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Children with suspected subacute or acute encephalitis at Yangon Children's Hospital, Yangon, Myanmar, were prospectively recruited from 2016–2018. Cohort 1 (n = 65) had locally available diagnostic testing, whereas cohort 2 (n = 38) had advanced tests for autoantibodies (ie, cell-based assays, tissue immunostaining, studies with cultured neurons) and infections (ie, BioFire FilmArray multiplex Meningitis/Encephalitis multiplex PCR panel, metagenomic sequencing, and pan-viral serologic testing [VirScan] of cerebrospinal fluid).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 20 cases (13 in cohort 1 and 7 in cohort 2) were found to have illnesses other than encephalitis. Of the 52 remaining cases in cohort 1, 43 (83%) had presumed infectious encephalitis, of which 2 cases (4%) had a confirmed infectious etiology. Nine cases (17%) had presumed autoimmune encephalitis. Of the 31 cases in cohort 2, 23 (74%) had presumed infectious encephalitis, of which one (3%) had confirmed infectious etiology using local tests only, whereas 8 (26%) had presumed autoimmune encephalitis. Advanced tests confirmed an additional 10 (32%) infections, 4 (13%) possible infections, and 5 (16%) cases of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody encephalitis.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pediatric encephalitis is prevalent in Myanmar, and advanced technologies increase identification of treatable infectious and autoimmune causes. Developing affordable advanced tests to use globally represents a high clinical and research priority to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of encephalitis. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>
