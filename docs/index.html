                Background Ternary ABX2 semiconductors, in which A represents silver, B denotes indium, and X signifies tellurium, have garnered growing interest for optoelectronic applications owing to their advantageous optical band gaps and carrier transport characteristics. Among these materials, AgInTe2 has proven to be a promising absorber for high-efficiency thin-film photovoltaic applications. Layer thickness optimization is a critical factor that impacts device efficiency. Methods Numerical simulations were conducted utilizing the Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator in One Dimension (SCAPS-1D) to assess the influence of layer thickness on the efficacy of an AgInTe2-based solar cell. The device architecture comprised an aluminum antimonide window layer, an AgInTe2 absorber layer, and a barium silicide rear layer. The thicknesses of the window, absorber, and rear layers were methodically varied. Key photovoltaic parameters, such as open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency, were derived from the simulations. Results The simulation results indicate that the efficacy of the device is highly contingent upon the thickness of each individual layer. An optimized configuration with window, absorber, and back layer thicknesses of 0.1 micrometers, 0.6 micrometers, and 0.2 micrometers, respectively, resulted in a maximal power conversion efficiency of 32.6%. This enhancement is ascribed to improved carrier generation and collection, coupled with diminished recombination losses within the device. Conclusions The study illustrates that meticulous optimization of layer thickness substantially improves the efficiency of AgInTe2-based solar cells. The proposed device architecture offers valuable design principles for the development of high-efficiency thin-film photovoltaic devices.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-25/v1?src=rss">Uncovering fertility potential: Clinical and histopathological insights from testicular biopsies in azoospermic men in a large Indonesian cohort [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective This study aims to evaluate spermatogenic failure in azoospermic men by characterizing patterns in Modified Johnsen Scores from testicular biopsies, examining their correlation with clinical and hormonal parameters, and determining the probability of live sperm retrieval. Novelty As the largest dataset on azoospermia in Indonesia, this study provides a comprehensive histopathological and hormonal profile of azoospermic patients, while also emphasizing the diagnostic value of bilateral testicular biopsies—an area often underexplored in Southeast Asian populations. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on azoospermic patients who underwent bilateral testicular biopsies between April 2011 and July 2024. Testicular tissue samples were assessed using the Modified Johnsen scoring system (range: 1 to 10), and classified histopathologically from tubular fibrosis to complete spermatogenesis. Clinical parameters including age, body mass index, sperm retrieval outcomes, and serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone were collected and analyzed. Statistical associations between these parameters and histopathological subtypes were determined using significance testing. Results A total of 409 testicular biopsies were evaluated. The most frequent Modified Johnsen Scores were 7 (20%) and 5 (16.6%). Histopathological analysis showed that 40.3% of cases exhibited spermatogenic arrest, while only 7% demonstrated normal spermatogenesis. Discordant histopathological patterns between the two testes were observed in 18.5% of patients. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels showed statistically significant associations with histopathological subtypes (p < 0.001). Age, body mass index, and testosterone levels did not correlate significantly. Conclusion Spermatogenic arrest is the predominant abnormality in azoospermic men, with hormonal variations—particularly in follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone—strongly associated with testicular pathology. The presence of discordant histology between testes underscores the importance of bilateral biopsies. Higher Modified Johnsen Scores were positively correlated with the likelihood of successful sperm retrieval.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-23/v1?src=rss">Building Institutional Legitimacy: Elites, Markets, and Inequality Through the Voice–Choice–Transparency–Trust (VCTT) Framework [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Institutional legitimacy—the belief that authorities are just and deserving of compliance—depends on the interplay of participation, pluralism, transparency, and trust. This study applies the Voice–Choice–Transparency–Trust (VCTT) framework to construct a composite institutional quality index (INST) and to identify how elite behaviour, market structure, inequality, and development jointly shape legitimacy across countries. The analysis bridges the conceptual divide between extractive and value-creating power by empirically testing how elite quality and market concentration interact to affect institutional outcomes. Methods Using an unbalanced panel of 22 countries from 2000 to 2004, the study combines hierarchical multiple imputation with panel econometrics. Institutional quality (INST) was derived from standardised VCTT pillars. Core regressors include the Elite Quality Index (EQx), market power (mark-up), the Gini coefficient, and GDP per capita. Two complementary estimators were applied: a fixed-effects (pooled OLS) model and a Mundlak correlated random-effects model, both corrected for heteroskedasticity and cross-sectional dependence using Driscoll–Kraay robust standard errors. Results The fixed-effects model shows that higher Elite index values strongly improve institutional quality (p < 0.01), whereas greater market concentration significantly reduces it (p < 0.01). Moderate inequality displays a small but positive association with institutional stability (p < 0.05). The Mundlak model confirms a positive within-country effect of elite quality (p = 0.004) and a negative effect of rising domestic inequality (p = 0.046). Between-country averages reveal that nations with productive elites and moderate inequality sustain stronger institutions, while persistent market dominance undermines them. Conclusions Across the sample, institutional legitimacy strengthens where elites are value-creating and markets remain competitive. Concentrated market power erodes institutional quality, and inequality’s influence is context-dependent—detrimental when it widens domestically but neutral or stabilising when moderate. Balanced power relations, therefore, underpin transparent, accountable, and trusted institutions within the VCTT framework.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02606">gPC-based robustness analysis of neural systems through probabilistic recurrence metrics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal systems often preserve their characteristic functions and signalling patterns, also referred to as regimes, despite parametric uncertainties and variations. For neural models having uncertain parameters with a known probability distribution, probabilistic robustness analysis (PRA) allows us to understand and quantify under which uncertainty conditions a regime is preserved in expectation. We introduce a new computational framework for the efficient and systematic PRA of dynamical systems in neuroscience and we show its efficacy in analysing well-known neural models that exhibit multiple dynamical regimes: the Hindmarsh-Rose model for single neurons and the Jansen-Rit model for cortical columns. Given a model subject to parametric uncertainty, we employ generalised polynomial chaos to derive mean neural activity signals, which are then used to assess the amount of parametric uncertainty that the system can withstand while preserving the current regime, thereby quantifying the regime's robustness to such uncertainty. To assess persistence of regimes, we propose new metrics, which we apply to recurrence plots obtained from the mean neural activity signals. The overall result is a novel, general computational methodology that combines recurrence plot analysis and systematic persistence analysis to assess how much the uncertain model parameters can vary, with respect to their nominal value, while preserving the nominal regimes in expectation. We summarise the PRA results through probabilistic regime preservation (PRP) plots, which capture the effect of parametric uncertainties on the robustness of dynamical regimes in the considered models.

                arXiv:2601.03117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do transformers learn like brains? A key challenge in addressing this question is that transformers and brains are trained on fundamentally different data. Brains are initially "trained" on prenatal sensory experiences (e.g., retinal waves), whereas transformers are typically trained on large datasets that are not biologically plausible. We reasoned that if transformers learn like brains, then they should develop the same structure as newborn brains when exposed to the same prenatal data. To test this prediction, we simulated prenatal visual input using a retinal wave generator. Then, using self-supervised temporal learning, we trained transformers to adapt to those retinal waves. During training, the transformers spontaneously developed the same structure as newborn visual systems: (1) early layers became sensitive to edges, (2) later layers became sensitive to shapes, and (3) the models developed larger receptive fields across layers. The organization of newborn visual systems emerges spontaneously when transformers adapt to a prenatal visual world. This developmental convergence suggests that brains and transformers learn in common ways and follow the same general fitting principles.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02636">Credit Assignment via Neural Manifold Noise Correlation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit assignment--how changes in individual neurons and synapses affect a network's output--is central to learning in brains and machines. Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale.

                arXiv:2601.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defining agency is an extremely important challenge for cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between them and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism has been debated. Although we have already proposed a physical "agent determinism" model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, a sequence of indices that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans.

Abstract: Understanding how receptive fields emerge and organize within brain networks and how neural dynamics couple with stimuli space is fundamental to neuroscience. Models often rely on fine-tuning connectivity to match empirical data, which may limit biological plausibility. Here we propose a physiologically grounded alternative where receptive fields and population-level attractor dynamics arise naturally from the effective hyperbolic geometry of scale-free networks. By associating stimulus space with the boundary of a hyperbolic embedding, we simulate neural dynamics using rate-based and spiking models, revealing localized activity patterns that reflect stimulus space structure without synaptic fine-tuning. The resulting receptive fields follow experimentally observed statistics and properties, and their sizes depends on neuron's connectivity degree. The model generalizes across stimuli dimensionalities and various modalities, such as orientation and place selectivity. Experimental analyses of hippocampal place fields recorded on a linear track support these findings. This framework offers a novel organizing principle linking network structure, stimulus space encoding, and neural dynamics, providing insights into receptive field formation across diverse brain areas.

                arXiv:2506.02164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have compared neural activities in the visual cortex to representations in deep neural networks trained on image classification. Interestingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the image-by-image correlation between the decoded decisions based on the internal neural representations in a classification task. Thus, it can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate DVC using monkey V4/IT recordings and network models trained on image classification tasks. We find that model-model similarity is comparable to monkey-monkey similarity, whereas model-monkey similarity is consistently lower. Strikingly, DVC decreases with increasing network performance on ImageNet-1k. Adversarial training does not improve model-monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions assessed using DVC, although it markedly increases the model-model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model-monkey similarity. These results suggest a divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.

                arXiv:2601.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cognition integrates information across nested timescales. While the cortex exhibits hierarchical Temporal Receptive Windows (TRWs), local circuits often display heterogeneous time constants. To reconcile this, we trained biologically constrained deep networks, based on scale-invariant hippocampal time cells, on a language classification task mimicking the hierarchical structure of language (e.g., 'letters' forming 'words'). First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales. These results suggest the brain employs scale-invariant, sequential priors - coding "what" happened "when" - making recurrent networks with such priors particularly well-suited to describe human cognition.

                arXiv:2601.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic nonzero sum games are widely used to model multi agent decision making in control, economics, and related fields. Classical methods for computing Nash equilibria, especially in linear quadratic settings, rely on strong structural assumptions and become impractical for nonlinear dynamics, many players, or long horizons, where multiple local equilibria may exist. We show through examples that such methods can fail to reach the true global Nash equilibrium even in relatively small games. To address this, we propose two population based evolutionary algorithms for general dynamic games with linear or nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary objective functions: a co evolutionary genetic algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization scheme. Both approaches search directly over joint strategy spaces without restrictive assumptions and are less prone to getting trapped in local Nash equilibria, providing more reliable approximations to global Nash solutions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02401">Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world graphs or networks are usually heterogeneous, involving multiple types of nodes and relationships. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) can effectively handle these diverse nodes and edges, capturing heterogeneous information within the graph, thus exhibiting outstanding performance. However, most methods of HGNNs usually involve complex structural designs, leading to problems such as high memory usage, long inference time, and extensive consumption of computing resources. These limitations pose certain challenges for the practical application of HGNNs, especially for resource-constrained devices. To mitigate this issue, we propose the Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (SpikingHAN), which incorporates the brain-inspired and energy-saving properties of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into heterogeneous graph learning to reduce the computing cost without compromising the performance. Specifically, SpikingHAN aggregates metapath-based neighbor information using a single-layer graph convolution with shared parameters. It then employs a semantic-level attention mechanism to capture the importance of different meta-paths and performs semantic aggregation. Finally, it encodes the heterogeneous information into a spike sequence through SNNs, simulating bioinformatic processing to derive a binarized 1-bit representation of the heterogeneous graph. Comprehensive experimental results from three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that SpikingHAN delivers competitive node classification performance. It achieves this with fewer parameters, quicker inference, reduced memory usage, and lower energy consumption. Code is available at https://github.com/QianPeng369/SpikingHAN.

                arXiv:2601.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard simulations of the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma (IPD) operate in deterministic, noise-free environments, producing strategies that may be theoretically optimal but fragile when confronted with real-world uncertainty. This paper addresses two critical gaps in evolutionary game theory research: (1) the absence of realistic environmental stressors during strategy evolution, and (2) the Interpretability Gap, where evolved genetic strategies remain opaque binary sequences devoid of semantic meaning. We introduce a novel framework combining stochastic environmental perturbations (God Mode) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based behavioral profiling to transform evolved genotypes into interpretable character archetypes. Our experiments demonstrate that strategies evolved under chaotic conditions exhibit superior resilience and present distinct behavioral phenotypes, ranging from Ruthless Capitalists to Diplomatic Enforcers. These phenotypes are readily classified by LLMs but remain nearly impossible to interpret through manual genome inspection alone. This work bridges evolutionary computation with explainable AI and provides a template for automated agent characterization in multi-agent systems.

                arXiv:2601.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting often operates under tight power and latency budgets in fields like traffic management, industrial condition monitoring, and on-device sensing. These applications frequently require near real-time responses and low energy consumption on edge devices. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power by exploiting temporal sparsity and multiplication-free computation. Yet existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often inherit complex transformer blocks, thereby losing much of the efficiency benefit. To solve the problem, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via selective scanning. Further, we replace dense SSM updates with sparse spike trains and execute selective scans only on spike events, thereby avoiding dense multiplications while preserving the SSM's structured memory. Because complex operations such as exponentials and divisions are costly on neuromorphic chips, we introduce simplified approximations of SiLU and Softplus to enable a neuromorphic-friendly model architecture. In matched settings, SpikySpace reduces estimated energy consumption by 98.73% and 96.24% compared to two state-of-the-art transformer based approaches, namely iTransformer and iSpikformer, respectively. In standard time series forecasting datasets, SpikySpace delivers competitive accuracy while substantially reducing energy cost and memory traffic. As the first full spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, marking a practical and scalable path toward efficient time series forecasting systems.

                arXiv:2601.03098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a direct neural interface for decoding muscle activity and offers a promising foundation for keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems. Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments.

Abstract: We numerically demonstrate a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long- term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short- term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.

                Background Reducing maternal and neonatal deaths in low- and middle-income countries requires a comprehensive understanding of the challenges within the healthcare system. Effective upward referral systems play a crucial role in ensuring timely emergency care for obstetric complications in the healthcare system. The aim of this study is to understand the factors (antecedents) and defining characteristics (attributes) that influence upward referrals of obstetric emergencies. from Community Health Centres to higher-level hospitals in the OR Tambo district, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods Data were collected through document analysis, observations, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, consisting of 59 participants, using a qualitative grounded theory approach. Results The study reveals a complex web of interrelated antecedents and attributes that influence the effectiveness of upward referrals in obstetric emergencies. While formal protocols exist, referral decisions are often undermined by systemic barriers. The findings suggest that the lack of coordination between referring and receiving facilities, coupled with fragmented feedback systems, hampers continuity of care. Despite these challenges, instances of effective referral were observed in settings where interprofessional collaboration, timely information sharing, and adequate preparation of patients were prioritised. Conclusion Effective upward referral of obstetric emergencies depends on timely decision-making, adequate patient preparation, clear communication, and inter-facility collaboration. This highlights the need for an integrated approach that strengthens health system functions, which are essential to reducing preventable maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in resource-constrained settings like South Africa.

                Background The acardiac fetus is a rare malformation specific to multiple monozygotic pregnancies. Two main theories have been proposed regarding the etiology of this malformation: the vascular theory, and the second supposes a defect in the embryogenesis of the heart. Diagnosis is typically suspected and confirmed based on ultrasound findings. Case presentation We present the case of a 36-year-old woman, G3P4, with a bi-scarred uterus. The last pregnancy was a monochorionic monoamniotic twin pregnancy complicated by an acardiac fetus suspected in the first trimester and confirmed by ultrasound at 23 weeks of gestation. She gave birth by an emergency cesarean section at 34 weeks + 4 days to two babies: a normal female baby and an acardiac fetus. Conclusion Acardiac twin pregnancies present challenges and require careful management to optimize outcomes for both the acardiac and the healthy twins. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this condition is crucial to provide effective prenatal care and support.

                Background This experimental study evaluates the structural behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams incorporating walnut shell fine aggregate (WFA) and 15% powdered waste glass (PWG). Method Eight simply-supported RC beams were cast and tested in two series: Group 1 (beams with transverse stirrups i.e. flexure-dominated) and Group 2 (beams without stirrups i.e. shear-dominated). Mixes included a control (0% WFA) and three WFA replacement levels (10%, 20%, 30% by volume of sand), with PWG fixed at 15% of cement in all mixes. Tests included 28-day compressive strength, density measurements, and two-point bending load–deflection tests. Results Results show that 10% WFA replacement enhanced compressive strength by 3–5%, flexural capacity by ~6%, and ductility by 64%, while reducing density by 6–8%. Higher WFA contents reduced stiffness but improved energy absorption and crack distribution. Conclusions The findings confirm that moderate WFA replacement (≤10%) combined with PWG yields eco-efficient RC beams with improved ductility and reduced dead load.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>While the hippocampus has intrigued generations of neuroscientists for its contributions to cognitive and emotional processing, functional specialization along its longitudinal axis confers particular importance to the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) in affective regulation under normal and pathological conditions. In particular, vHPC is extensively linked to the encoding, expression, and extinction of fear memories, which mediate behavioral adaptation to environmental threats. Despite decades of research, however, many questions remain about precisely what is encoded among specific populations of vHPC neurons and what brain systems cooperate in processing this information during fear regulation. Furthermore, as insights accumulate into the function of discrete afferent projections of vHPC, an important area of focus is how vHPC circuitry might be organized to support different output patterns through synaptic integration. Here, we summarize the current understanding of these issues based on contemporary circuit-based approaches and highlight potential clues to the anatomical and functional organization of synaptic networks that may help reconceptualize vHPC as a system of interacting modules.</p>

                Background Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an established intervention for COPD, but the added value of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) within PR remains uncertain. This systematic review examined whether IMT plus PR provides benefits beyond PR alone in adults with moderate to severe COPD. Methods PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2023. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IMT+PR with PR alone in adults with moderate to severe COPD were included. Primary outcomes were inspiratory muscle strength (PImax), dyspnea, health related quality of life (HRQoL), exercise capacity [six minute walk test (6MWT)], and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Results Nine RCTs (n=295) met the inclusion criteria. IMT+PR improved PImax in 6/9 studies, with gains of 5.2 to 22.9 cmH2O. Dyspnea improved in 6/8 studies, often exceeding the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). HRQoL improved in all studies assessing this outcome (6/6), although superiority of IMT+PR over PR or control conditions was not consistently demonstrated. Exercise capacity findings were mixed, with significant within-group 6MWT gains in 4 of 7 studies but inconsistent between-group differences. PFTs (FEV1, FVC) were generally unchanged, while limited data from single-center trials suggest reductions in dynamic hyperinflation and small increases in inspiratory capacity. Conclusion Adding IMT to PR meaningfully improves PImax and HRQoL in moderate to severe COPD, with frequent but less consistent benefits for dyspnea and 6MWT performance and minimal effect on spirometry. IMT may be most appropriate for patients with inspiratory muscle weakness (PImax <60 cmH2O or <50% predicted). Further RCTs should define optimal IMT protocols and clarify which COPD phenotypes derive the greatest benefit.

                Background Peristaltic or undulating flow plays a significant role in various biomedical and industrial processes, where it provides an efficient mechanism for transporting fluids through flexible conduits such as catheters and endoscopic channels. Understanding such flow behavior is essential for improving medical devices and industrial applications involving non-Newtonian fluids. Methods This study investigates the peristaltic motion of a Carreau fluid whose viscosity varies with both temperature and concentration within a flexible, axisymmetric channel composed of two overlapping cylindrical tubes. The outer wall of the channel exhibits a sinusoidal wave pattern, simulating a realistic endoscopic configuration. The governing nonlinear, nonhomogeneous partial differential equations were formulated in cylindrical coordinates under the assumption of a long wavelength and low Reynolds number. The equations were transformed into a dimensionless form and solved using the uniform perturbation method. Graphical analyses were performed using Mathematica software. Results The results illustrate the combined effects of temperature-dependent and concentration-dependent viscosity on the velocity distribution and pressure gradient within the channel. Increasing temperature and solute concentration were found to enhance fluid velocity and reduce flow resistance. Conclusions The study provides a comprehensive understanding of peristaltic transport in variable-viscosity Carreau fluids under realistic physiological conditions. These findings may contribute to optimizing the design and performance of endoscopic and biomedical fluid transport systems.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Metacontrol refers to the ability to dynamically adjust cognitive-control strategies, ensuring a balance between persistence and flexibility. Empirical findings point to a strong link between metacontrol and emotion, but the mechanistic underpinnings of this link remain unknown. Here, we had two goals. First, we hypothesized that metacontrol and emotion are mechanistically linked through aperiodic EEG activity, in the sense that both positive emotion and metacontrol flexibility come with increases, and both negative emotion and metacontrol persistence with decreases of aperiodic activity. Second, we tested whether and to what degree emotional stimuli affect behavior and aperiodic activity automatically. In a large sample (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 120), we examined EEG and behavioral data from three tasks in which we systematically varied the task-relevance of the emotional information presented to participants. As hypothesized, positive pictures resulted in higher aperiodic activity than negative pictures. Task context and, more specifically, the relevance of emotional stimuli significantly influenced overt behavior but had no effect on aperiodic activity. We conclude that positive and negative emotions may represent the phenomenal “feel” of metacontrol biases towards flexibility and persistence, respectively, and that the degree to which processes are affected by emotional content automatically depends on the process under consideration.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Auditory evoked responses undergo notable changes during childhood, likely reflecting modifications in synaptic signaling in the auditory cortex. Particularly robust response, observed around 200 to 300 ms post stimulus (N/M250), has been consistently reported in children but is absent in adults. This long-latency response, evoked even in passive listening conditions, may indicate heightened sensory pathway responsiveness, facilitating experience-driven cortical plasticity. However, it remains unclear whether this delayed activation pattern is an intrinsic, species-general feature of brain development. We recorded cortical auditory evoked responses to monaural sine-wave tones/click sounds in 3 age groups (preadolescents, adolescents, and young adults) of human subjects and rats. Following short-lived early responses, both species exhibited a long-latency (150 to 450 ms) response in the auditory cortex. In both species, the relative amplitude of the long-latency response, compared to early responses, was increased in younger individuals. In human children, single-trial analysis demonstrated more consistent trial-by-trial timing of the response in this later time window than in the adult-typical 100-ms response in the earlier time window. Given its emergence in purely passive conditions, and across species, the robust current activity in late time window could represent a distinct synaptic event and may serve as a marker of the maturational stage, particularly in GABAergic cortical circuits.</span>

However, the causal contribution of these systems in human habit formation and expression remains unclear.

Two groups of participants (IPL/PMC) received real or sham-rTMS on separate days prior to habit training. We found that TMS did not induce significant learning-related changes during habit learning. Importantly, we found a significantly increased habit expression during goal-habit competition following IPL stimulation. In contrast, while numerically, habit expression decreased following PMC stimulation, this effect did not reach statistical significance. Thereby, the current study provides direct causal evidence suggesting that habit expression is significantly influenced by the release of control from the goal-directed system, while evidence regarding the influence of the habit-related system remains less conclusive.</span>

                Background Impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The pineapple core (Ananas comosus L. Merr. var. Queen) has been reported to contain various bioactive compounds, including bromelain and flavonoids, which possess antibacterial properties effective against Staphylococcus aureus. This study aimed to compare the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes to fusidic acid and pineapple core extract (PCE) in patients diagnosed with impetigo. Methods An in vitro experimental study using a post-test only control group design, conducted between January and March 2025. A total of 60 bacterial isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were collected from patients with impetigo who met the inclusion criteria. The isolates were divided into five treatment groups, with each bacterial group receiving interventions in concentrations of 50%, 70%, and 100% PCE, 10 μg fusidic acid (positive control), and a negative control. The inhibition zone diameters were measured using the disk diffusion method. Results There was a significant difference in susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to the 50%, 70%, and 100% concentrations of PCE compared to fusidic acid. However, Streptococcus pyogenes showed no statistically significant difference in susceptibility between the 100% pineapple extract and 10 μg fusidic acid. The descending order of inhibition zone diameter observed in both bacteria was as follows: 10 μg fusidic acid, 100% PCE, 70% PCE, 50% PCE, and negative control. Conclusion Streptococcus pyogenes isolates from impetigo patients demonstrated susceptibility to both 100% PCE and fusidic acid, indicating the potential of PCE as a natural antibacterial agent

                Background The growing incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education presents significant ethical challenges, particularly regarding the critical and responsible use of these technologies by students. In this context, the present study aimed to analyze responsible practices and ethical behaviors in the use of AI among students at the State University of Milagro. Methods A quantitative, explanatory-level approach was applied, employing a non-experimental and cross-sectional design, with a validated questionnaire administered to 716 participants from various academic programs. The analysis was conducted through structural equation modeling to explore the influence of affective, behavioral, and cognitive learning dimensions on the ethical dimension. Results The affective and cognitive dimensions exert a significant and positive impact on the development of learning ethics, while the behavioral component did not show statistically relevant effects. Additionally, the study evidenced high reliability and validity of the instrument, as well as a medium level of AI appropriation among students, with predominant use of tools such as ChatGPT. Conclusions Ethical training cannot be dissociated from emotional attitudes and technical knowledge about AI. The study acknowledges as limitations the non-probabilistic nature of the sample and the cross-sectional design.

                Background The cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor is the primary target of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis sativa (commonly known as “kif” in Morocco). Methods Here, we identified novel CB1 agonists using virtual screening approaches. First, we developed a pharmacophore model based on the known CB1 agonist AM11542 and screened a database of over three million compounds. Molecular docking using AutoDock Vina identified 61 hits with binding affinities of less than -9.00 Kcal/mol. Subsequent ADME-Tox (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) analysis narrowed the selection to 18 promising candidates. Results Among these, three agonists exhibited strong characteristics, including a favorable inhibition constant (Ki) and key hydrogen-bond interactions with critical residues in the CB1 binding pocket: PUBChem157251136 (Ki=2.09 nM), ZINC64438485 (Ki= 0.262 nM) and ZINC64438506 (Ki =0.244 nM). These agonists formed stable hydrogen bonds with CB1 binding pocket residues (Ser383, Ser173, His178 and Thr197). Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns, GROMACS) demonstrated structural stability (RMSD < 1 nm) and low conformational flexibility (RMSF < 1 nm) for all complexes. MM-GBSA binding free energy calculations further confirmed the thermodynamic stability of all complexes, with interaction energies ranging from -30.59 to -49.98 kcal/mol. These comprehensive simulations confirm that all identified agonist complexes maintain stable binding conformations with optimal interaction profiles characteristic of CB1 receptor activation. Conclusion These results could pave the way for researching and developing new quinazolinz-2, 4(1H, 3H)-Dione derivatives as a new class of CB1 receptor agonists.

                Background Pediatric glioma surgery poses significant anesthetic challenges due to raised intracranial pressure (ICP), neurodevelopmental vulnerability, and the need to achieve optimal brain relaxation without delaying postoperative recovery. Intravenous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), through NMDA receptor antagonism and analgesic- and hemodynamic-sparing effects, may support propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) within pediatric ERAS pathways. Case Presentation A 10-year-old girl with a left temporoparietal glioma presented with seizures, progressive right hemiparesis, and papilledema. She underwent craniotomy under propofol-based TIVA augmented with MgSO4 (loading 30 mg/kg; maintenance 10–15 mg/kg/h). Individualized cerebral physiology was guided using real-time optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements. After induction and MgSO4 infusion, ONSD values and middle cerebral artery pulsatility indices decreased toward more favorable ranges, consistent with improved intracranial compliance. Intraoperatively, brain relaxation was excellent, hemodynamics were stable, and only minimal rescue opioids and neuromuscular blockers were required. The patient was extubated within 24 hours, demonstrated low postoperative pain scores without agitation or PONV, and had no magnesium-related toxicity. A transient episode of diabetes insipidus occurred postoperatively, attributed to tumor-related hypothalamic–pituitary involvement, and resolved with vasopressin therapy. Discussion This case highlights the feasibility of MgSO4 as an adjunct to propofol-based TIVA in pediatric neuro-oncologic surgery. Real-time ONSD and TCD monitoring provided a practical, non-invasive method to tailor ICP and cerebral perfusion management. Conclusion MgSO4 may be a safe and effective adjuvant during pediatric glioma resection when combined with vigilant monitoring and ultrasound-guided cerebral physiology assessment. Prospective studies are needed to validate standardized dosing and ultrasound-guided ICP management protocols.

                Background Identifying research gaps and priorities guides evidence-informed decision-making in health and social sciences. Although scoping reviews are widely used to map evidence and highlight gaps, but definitions, conceptualizations, and methods for identifying gaps and priorities vary considerably, resulting in inconsistent methodological approaches. Aim This study synthesized methodological frameworks in published scoping reviews and mapped how research gaps and priorities were reported across health disciplines (2000–2025). It also aimed to develop an integrated framework to enhance future scoping review methodology. Methods A scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework, enhanced by the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Comprehensive searches of electronic databases and grey literature were performed for English-language publications from January 2000 and May 2025. Eligible studies explicitly reported methodological approaches for identifying research gaps or research priorities. Study selection followed a three-stage screening process, and data were charted and synthesized using descriptive statistics and inductive content analysis. Results Among the twenty included studies, (45%) employed general scoping review approaches. Key themes were methodology and research (65%), education & training (15%), stakeholder engagement (10%), and Practice & Care (10%). Across the reviews, eleven categories of research gaps spotlights population underrepresentation, methodological inconsistency, and specialty-specific limitations. Additionally, seven research priorities centered on methodological rigor, innovation, stakeholder engagement, as the most emphasized areas. Conclusion This study provides the first comprehensive synthesis of how research gaps and priorities are identified within scoping reviews. Findings highlight under representation of human-centered, equity-focused, and practice-oriented domains, emphasizing the need for stakeholders to ensure research is inclusive, relevant, and impactful. The Integrated Framework provides guidance for future scoping reviews to enhance methodological rigor and impact.

                Abstract* Background In 2023, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia mandated all mining companies to assess their Mining Safety and Health Performance Maturity Level (MSHPML) as a basis for formulating Occupational Safety and Health (OHS) incident prevention programs. One year into its implementation, official data from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (2025) recorded 42 mining accidents and 8 worker fatalities due to illness within the nickel mining sector, highlighting a notable gap between policy expectations and actual outcomes. This study aims to examine the relationship between MSHPML and lagging OHS indicators in nickel mining, with the goal of informing strategies to enhance implementation effectiveness. Methods The study population comprised nickel mining companies operating in Indonesia, with a final sample of 77 companies. The dependent variables were OHS performance out-comes, while the independent variable was the MSHPML score. Quantitative analysis was conducted across three stages: univariate, bivariate, and multivariate, supported by assumption testing Results Results revealed that higher MSHPML achievement was significantly associated with improvements in occupational safety outcomes. However, no statistically significant relationship was found between MSHPML and occupational health indicators. Conclusions These findings suggest that while MSHPML is a useful predictor of safety performance, further refinement is needed to adequately capture occupational health dimensions.

                Background For many applications such as photovoltaic system planning, grid stability, and renewable energy integration, accurate forecasting of solar irradiation is essential. Solar irradiation exhibits strong nonlinearity and variability driven by atmospheric conditions, seasonal cycles, and site-specific meteorological factors, making reliable short-term prediction challenging for conventional statistical models. Methods We propose a hybrid solar irradiation forecasting framework that combines machine learning regression models with genetic algorithm (GA)–based model optimization. Multiple predictive models, including linear regression and gradient-boosted decision trees, are trained using meteorological variables such as zenith angle, temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric indices. The GA is employed to identify optimal feature subsets by maximizing predictive accuracy while minimizing redundancy, treating feature selection as a combinatorial optimization problem. Model performance is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), variance, and percentage accuracy derived from mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results The GA-optimized models demonstrate improved forecasting accuracy and stability compared to baseline machine learning approaches using full feature sets. Empirical results show that GA-based feature selection reduces prediction error, enhances robustness across seasonal regimes, and yields interpretable feature importance patterns aligned with known physical drivers of solar irradiation. Comparative evaluation across training and validation datasets confirms consistent gains in predictive performance. Conclusions The proposed genetic algorithm–enhanced forecasting framework provides an effective and interpretable approach for modeling solar irradiation under complex atmospheric conditions. By integrating evolutionary optimization with machine learning, the methodology supports more reliable solar energy forecasting and can be readily extended to real-time energy management systems and large-scale renewable deployment scenarios.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-760/v3?src=rss">A bibliometric review of research on resilience, motivation and prisoners, 1912-2024 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Research on resilience and motivation among incarcerated populations has expanded substantially over the past century, reflecting a broader shift in penal philosophy from punitive control toward rehabilitation and reintegration. However, this literature remains fragmented across disciplines, conceptually heterogeneous, and geographically uneven, with a strong concentration in Western contexts. This limits theoretical integration and constrains the global applicability of existing models. Methods A bibliometric analysis was conducted on 1,309 publications indexed between 1912 and 2024. Co-occurrence, citation, collaboration, and temporal overlay analyses were performed using VOSviewer to map thematic structures, intellectual influences, and patterns of knowledge production. Inclusion criteria targeted peer-reviewed and scholarly works addressing resilience and/or motivation in correctional settings. Results and Discussion The analysis reveals a temporal shift from early psychological adjustment and behavioral control models toward integrated frameworks emphasizing resilience, motivation, rehabilitation, and post-release reintegration. Emerging themes include trauma-informed care, addiction recovery, human rights, and reentry processes, while gender-specific, cross-cultural, and socioeconomic reintegration perspectives remain underdeveloped. Citation and collaboration networks demonstrate strong institutional concentration in North America and Western Europe, reflecting structural and epistemic asymmetries that shape dominant theoretical paradigms. Although interdisciplinary integration has increased, comparative and culturally grounded research remain limited. Conclusions This review synthesizes a century of research into a coherent intellectual map, identifying key trends, gaps, and structural imbalances in the field. The findings highlight the need for more inclusive, culturally responsive, and structurally informed research frameworks that integrate psychological, institutional, and social dimensions of rehabilitation. Advancing this agenda is essential for developing correctional policies and interventions that are both empirically robust and globally relevant.

                <p>Perinatal exposure to the organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is associated with an increased incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder. While these behavioral detriments have been modeled in rodents, the underlying functional alterations in the developing brain are largely unknown. Previous reports using a rat model have identified alterations to both inhibitory synaptic transmission and serotonergic (5-HT) receptor binding in the cortex following developmental CPF exposure. Here, we use a rat model of gestational CPF exposure to investigate whether this altered inhibitory activity is driven by increased spontaneous firing of inhibitory interneurons and altered 5-HT receptor expression. Using cell-attached ex vivo electrophysiology in young rats of both sexes, we identified a significant increase in the number of spontaneously firing neurons in the somatosensory cortex of CPF-exposed offspring. Analysis of action potential metrics identified a subset of these neurons as fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. Immunohistochemical labeling of c-Fos, a marker of neuronal activity, further revealed a pronounced increase in activity of neurons of the somatosensory cortex in both juvenile and adult rats that had been gestationally exposed to CPF. Finally, RNAscope in situ hybridization showed an increase in the expression of the inhibitory receptor 5-HT<SUB>1B</SUB> in PV neurons of male offspring. The preliminary data reported here suggest that gestational exposure to CPF may result in persistent hyperexcitation of the somatosensory cortex. These neurophysiological effects may contribute to the established behavioral outcomes resulting from gestational exposure to CPF and offer guidance for novel preventative interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-690/v2?src=rss">Examining types of Organizational Structure in Private Chartered Universities in Western Uganda and their Impact on Academic Staff Performance [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the types of organizational structures in privately chartered universities in Western Uganda and how these structures impact academic staff performance. Grounded in Henri Fayol’s Administrative Management Theory and Vroom’s Expectancy Theory, this study integrates structural and motivational perspectives to explore the impact of institutional design on academic operations. Method A concurrent triangulation research design was employed to combine quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data were collected from 186 academic staff members using structured questionnaires and 10 academic deans through in-depth interviews. Results Quantitative findings revealed that functional and hierarchical structures were the most common, with 55.4% of respondents reporting highly centralized decision-making and 42.5% reporting poor communication flow. A significant positive correlation was observed between organizational structure and academic staff performance (r = 0.512, p < 0.01). Regression analysis showed that organizational structure explained 26.2% of the variance in academic staff performance (R2 = 0.262, F (1, 184) = 65.46, p < 0.001). Qualitative data supported these results, with participants highlighting that rigid and bureaucratic structures limit flexibility, innovation, and collaboration, whereas excessive centralization undermines academic autonomy (Yusoff & Isa, 2021). Conclusion The study concludes that, while traditional structures dominate private chartered universities, they often hinder academic performance. To enhance staff effectiveness, universities should adopt adaptive and participatory structures (Berkowitz, 2023). Aligning Fayol’s principles of work specialization, centralization, and communication flow with Vroom’s motivational framework offers a strategic path for organizational improvement.

                Background The Fekete–Szegö inequality and coefficient bounds play a fundamental role in the study of Bazilevič-type functions, a subclass of univalent functions with significant applications in complex analysis and related mathematical fields. These functions have been extensively studied for their geometric properties and coefficient behavior, yet there remains a need to explore subclasses defined via differential operators and subordination techniques to obtain sharper and more general bounds. Understanding the coefficient structure of these functions provides insight into their analytic behavior and extends classical results in the theory of univalent functions. Methods This study focuses on a specific subclass of Bazilevič-type functions and investigates its properties using differential subordination and differential operators. These mathematical tools are employed to derive explicit coefficient estimates and establish the Fekete–Szegö inequalities. The analysis involves careful application of operator techniques to obtain bounds that reflect the influence of the subclass parameters on the analytic functions under consideration. Results The derived inequalities demonstrate the effectiveness of differential operators in obtaining precise coefficient constraints. The results highlight how variations in the defining parameters of the subclass influence the function behavior, providing clear and explicit bounds for the coefficients. These findings extend existing results in the literature and offer new insights into the structure of Bazilevič-type functions. Conclusions Overall, this study provides a systematic approach to understanding the coefficient structure of Bazilevič-type functions. The findings establish a foundation for further theoretical research on univalent functions and offer tools that can be applied in both theoretical investigations and practical problems in complex analysis. The results contribute to the broader understanding of analytic functions and their applications in mathematical modeling.

                Background Climate change is expanding arid regions globally, intensifying drought, salinity, and heat stress that threaten ecosystem stability and food security. Desert plants of the Arabian Peninsula have evolved physiological and microbial adaptations that enable survival under such extremes. This study investigates the endophytic microbial communities of four representative xerophytic species; Zygophyllum mandavillei, Tribulus zeyheri, Limeum arabicum, and Cyperus conglomeratus, to identify functional traits that promote their climatic resilience. These perennial species were selected because they inhabit similar arid environments and share xerophytic traits such as reduced leaf area, fibrous root systems, and high drought tolerance, making them ideal models for examining interactions between plants and their associated microbes in desert ecosystems. Methods High-throughput environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing was performed on 27 plant samples, generating 3,660,664 high-quality reads. Taxonomic clustering resolved the sequences into 30 phyla, 15 classes, 20 orders, 27 families, and 21 genera. Diversity analyses were conducted to evaluate microbial richness and community structure, and functional inference was performed using PICRUSt2. Results Dominant microbial taxa included Alphaproteobacteria, Actinomycetia, Cyanophyceae, and Gammaproteobacteria, groups known for nitrogen fixation, carbon cycling, and resistance to desiccation and heat. Alpha-diversity analyses revealed significant variation in species richness among the host plants, while beta-diversity metrics showed distinct clustering patterns, indicating host-specific microbial assembly shaped by plant genotype and microhabitat. Functional prediction suggested enrichment of pathways related to amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, DNA repair, and secondary-metabolite biosynthesis, supporting metabolic versatility and stress adaptation. Conclusions These findings provide a comprehensive genomic overview of endophytic bacterial communities associated with key desert plants of the Arabian Peninsula and establish a foundation for future functional validation and sustainable applications of desert microbiomes under climate change.

                Abstract* Background Coastal ecosystems, including mangrove forests, are at the core of the socio-economic life of the local communities. Conversely, these ecosystems remain highly sensitive to the increasing impacts of climate change. Against such a backdrop, bamboo has been an important material, especially for construction and tool-making in coastal areas like East Lampung Regency. Despite the importance, such bamboo demands have yet to be met by local supplies or by the development of downstream value-added processing. Policy and Implications This study illustrates the strategic potential of bamboo as an economic and ecological resource, contributing to coastal resilience in East Lampung. If integrated into the Nature-based Solutions (NbS) framework, bamboo utilization can enhance livelihoods while restoring and protecting coastal ecosystems in communities. The study has revealed that sustainable management of bamboo provides a means to link environmental conservation to inclusive local development and climate adaptation. Recommendations The study outlines four strategies designed to advance the sustainable use of bamboo in East Lampung, including (a) empowering community-based bamboo cultivation focuses on facilitating regeneration activities that restore ecosystems and provide economic benefits to local communities, (b) investing in capacity building to equip local communities and key stakeholders with essential knowledge and skills in sustainable bamboo management and utilization, (c) driving policy advocacy that aims to champion the cause of sustainable bamboo utilization across multiple sectors, and (d) strengthening institutional frameworks that strengthen upstream bamboo resource management and optimize downstream processing and marketing systems, establish a robust industry infrastructure. Conclusions Bamboo utilization in East Lampung has the potential to change from a traditional subsistence material to a strategic instrument toward coastal sustainability. Bamboo-based initiatives can support ecological resilience, help boost the economy along the coast, and inspire a stronger socio-cultural regeneration toward a more sustainable future for East Lampung through the NbS approach.

                Abstract* Background Several studies have investigated internet-based interventions, demonstrating that they are an effective resource, including the use of gamification, which can enhance engagement in psychological interventions. This study explores the efficacy of gamified internet-based intervention programs in enhancing self-awareness among early adults. Methods This research used a pretest-posttest design to determine the effectiveness of the program. A dual-phase approach was adopted: the first phase involved a blend of online interventions and regular offline meetings with 25 participants, while the second was purely online, involving 40 participants. Participants, aged 18-22 years, engaged with a mental health application over a 30-day period. This study utilizing the Self Awareness Outcomes Questionnaire (SAOQ) for assessment. Results The Results indicated a statistically significant enhancement in self-awareness in both setups, with face-to-face interactions yielding a larger effect size (0.76) compared to online-only interventions (0.48). Conclusions Gamification offers a promising alternative for supporting participants in developing self-awareness as a means to improve mental health. Gamification programs have the ability to help individuals process independently or simultaneously get guidance from professionals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-5/v1?src=rss">A Systematic Literature Review on Biometric Authentication in Mobile Banking [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                As mobile banking continues to grow at an exponential rate, the financial industry is faced with a critical challenge: How to keep user credentials secure without compromising on efficiency. Password-based authentication is still dominant but has major limitations which compromise both security and user experience. These systems are susceptible to the most common attack vectors such as phishing, malware and man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if users are using weak passwords or sharing passwords. Additionally, mobile devices have limited input interfaces that are frequently sources of frustration and error. As a result, there is increasing interest in other more secure and convenient alternatives such as biometric and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to mitigate the inherent weaknesses of password-based systems. This systematic literature review, which covers studies from 2020 to 2025, provides a critical review of biometric authentication methods used in mobile banking. It analyses existing approaches, security risks and implementation practices adopted by major banks across the world. While biometric systems are more secure and user friendly than traditional systems, they also introduce new challenges in terms of privacy, spoofing and regulatory compliance. The review gives a detailed overview of the current advances, key issues, and emerging research directions, which will give valuable insight to the development of secure and easy-to-use authentication systems in mobile banking.

                Abstract* Objectives To determine the overall survival and immunophenotypes of patients with acute leukemia from a hospital in Chiclayo, Peru, during the period 2015-2019. Methods Observational research was conducted, analysing a total of 168 samples from patients diagnosed with acute leukemia, evaluating overall survival in the different types of leukemia at 5 years of follow-up using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results The overall survival for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) was found to be 52.7% at 5 years of follow-up, while for T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL), it was 50% at 2 years. The overall survival for non-promyelocytic Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) was 53.3% at 3 years of follow-up, and for promyelocytic leukemia, it was 66.7% at 3 years. The predominant immunophenotype was B-ALL, which represented 77.38%, while AML represented the remaining cases. Conclusions The overall survival of lymphoid leukemia was superior to that of myeloid leukemia. The most frequent aberration in B-ALL was the hyperexpression of CD10, while the absence of antigens was noted in T-ALL. The most frequent aberration in promyelocytic leukemia was the hyperexpression of CD13, and for non-promyelocytic leukemia, asynchronisms and lineage infidelity were observed.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103725">Decoding the biogenesis of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and their fusion with nuclear speckles</a></h4>

              
                Viruses rely on host cellular machinery for replication. After entering the nucleus, the HIV genome accumulates in nuclear niches where it undergoes reverse transcription and integrates into neighbouring chromatin, promoting high transcription rates and new virus progeny. Despite antiretroviral treatment, viral genomes can persist in these nuclear niches and reactivate upon treatment interruption, raising the possibility that they could play a role in the establishment of viral reservoirs. The post-nuclear entry dynamics of HIV remain unclear, and understanding these steps is critical for revealing how viral reservoirs are established. In this study, we elucidate the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and the domains of CPSF6 essential for this process. We also explore the roles of nuclear speckle (NS) scaffold factors, SON and SRRM2, in the biogenesis of these puncta. Through genetic manipulation and depletion experiments, we demonstrate the key role of the intrinsically disordered region of SRRM2 in enlarging NSs in the presence of the HIV capsid. We identify the FG domain of CPSF6 as essential for both puncta formation and binding to the viral core, which serves as the scaffold for CPSF6 puncta. While the low-complexity regions modulate CPSF6 binding to the viral capsid, they do not contribute to puncta formation, nor do the disordered mixed charge domains of CPSF6. Interestingly, the FG peptide facilitates viral replication. These results demonstrate how HIV evolved to hijack host nuclear factors, enabling its persistence in the host. Of note, this study provides new insights into the underlying interactions between host factors and viral components, advancing our understanding of HIV nuclear dynamics and offering potential therapeutic targets for preventing viral persistence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108882">Heterogeneity of genetic sequence within quasi-species of influenza virus revealed by single-molecule sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Influenza viruses exhibit high mutation rates and extensive genetic diversity, which hinder effective vaccine development and facilitate immune evasion (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Barr et al., 2010). These mutations arise from the error-prone viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts that conform to the quasi-species model of a cloud of related genomes evolving under selection (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and improving vaccine design, yet conventional RNA sequencing often fails to detect low-frequency variants because of technical errors during sample preparation and sequencing. Here, we implement a single unique molecular identifier strategy that reduces sequencing artifacts and achieves an error rate of ~10⁻⁵, enabling single-particle–level quantification of quasi-species diversity. Mutation frequencies greatly exceeding background error confirm their biological origin, while information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen–Shannon divergence reveal non-random mutation distributions under selective constraints. This framework supports detailed studies of intra-host viral evolution and may inform artificial intelligence-driven prediction of mutational trajectories and more effective influenza vaccine strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94835">Neural coding of multiple motion speeds in visual cortical area MT</a></h4>

              
                Motion speed is a salient cue for visual segmentation, yet how the visual system represents and differentiates multiple speeds remains unclear. Here, we investigated the encoding and decoding of multiple speeds. We first characterized the perceptual capacity of human and macaque subjects to segment overlapping stimuli moving at different speeds. We then determined how neurons in area MT of macaque monkeys represent multiple speeds. We found that the responses of MT neurons to two speeds showed a robust bias toward the faster speed component. This faster-speed bias occurred when both speeds were slow (≤20°/s) and diminished as stimulus speed increased. Our findings can be explained by a modified divisive normalization model, in which the weights for the speed components are proportional to the responses of a population of neurons (the weighting pool) with a broad range of speed preferences, elicited by the individual speeds. Regarding decoding, a classifier could distinguish MT responses to two speeds from those to a corresponding log-mean speed. We further found that it was possible to decode two speeds from the MT population response, supporting the theoretical framework of coding multiplicity in neuronal populations. The decoded speeds can account for perceptual performance in segmenting two speeds with a large (4x) but not a small (2x) separation. Our findings help define the neural coding rule of multiple speeds. The faster-speed bias in MT could benefit important behavioral tasks, such as figure-ground segregation, as figural objects tend to move faster than the background in the natural environment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103255">Dependence of contextual modulation in macaque V1 on interlaminar signal flow</a></h4>

              
                In visual cortex, neural correlates of subjective perception can be generated by modulation of activity from beyond the classical receptive field (CRF). In macaque V1, activity generated by nonclassical receptive field (nCRF) stimulation involves different intracortical circuitry than activity generated by CRF stimulation, suggesting that interactions between neurons across V1 layers differ under CRF and nCRF stimulus conditions. Using Neuropixels probes, we measured border ownership modulation within large, local populations of V1 neurons. We found that neurons in single columns preferred the same side of objects located outside of the CRF. In addition, we found that cross-correlations between pairs of neurons situated across feedback/horizontal and input layers differed between CRF and nCRF stimulation. Furthermore, independent of the comparison with CRF stimulation, we observed that the magnitude of border ownership modulation increased with the proportion of information flow from feedback/horizontal layers to input layers. These results demonstrate that the flow of signals between layers covaries with the degree to which neurons integrate information from beyond the CRF.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88132">Rice stripe virus utilizes a Laodelphax striatellus salivary carbonic anhydrase to facilitate plant infection by direct molecular interaction</a></h4>

              
                Plant viruses typically rely on insect vectors for transmission between plants, with insect salivary proteins playing critical roles in this process. In this study, we demonstrate how <i>Laodelphax striatellus</i> salivary carbonic anhydrase (LssaCA) promotes rice stripe virus (RSV) infection in plants. We discovered that LssaCA directly binds to RSV nucleocapsid protein (NP) in insect salivary glands. This LssaCA-NP complex interacts with a rice thaumatin-like protein (OsTLP) that possesses endo-β-1,3-glucanase activity potentially degrading callose. Upon binding, the LssaCA-NP complex significantly enhances OsTLP enzymatic activity. We further clarify that both <i>L. striatellus</i> feeding and RSV infection induce callose deposition. The tripartite LssaCA-NP-OsTLP interaction enhances callose degradation, thereby facilitating RSV infection via its insect vector. This study provides new insights into complex virus-insect-plant tripartite interactions mediated by insect salivary proteins, with broad implications for numerous plant viruses transmitted by insect vectors.

">Disrupted maternal care alters neural-microglia interactions in the primate paralaminar (PL) nucleus of the amygdala.</a></h4>

              
                Prolonged postnatal maturation of the primate amygdala is thought to be driven, at least partially, by continued neural maturation within the paralaminar nucleus (PL). At birth, the PL is densely populated with post-mitotic glutamatergic neurons that gradually mature throughout postnatal life. This active process is likely supported by microglia, which promotes synaptic maturation. Our previous work showed that early life stress associated with maternal separation alters microglia development across the infant to adolescent transition. Here, we examined whether these morphologic microglial changes are associated with alterations in the numbers of pre-synaptic terminals (SYN1+ puncta), post-synaptic terminals (PSD95+ puncta), and putative excitatory contacts (SYN1-PSD95 colocalization), and whether these synaptic elements are engulfed by phagocytic microglia. In maternally reared animals, SYN1+ puncta, PSD95+ puncta, and putative synaptic contacts decreased, while microglial (IBA1+) volume, CD68+ content, and engulfment of synaptic elements increased, between infancy and adolescence. These findings suggest greater pruning of all synaptic elements by adolescence. Maternal separation altered this trajectory, resulting in increased phagocytic activity and engulfment of synaptic elements in infancy, but not in adolescence. Maternal separation also resulted in a 50% reduction in mature PL neurons by adolescence, suggesting maturational failure, cell loss, or both by adolescence. These findings demonstrate that early life stress disrupts normative synaptic pruning and microglia-synapse interactions in the developing primate PL. Increased synaptic engulfment in infants with disrupted care is associated with premature, aberrant pruning, and highlights a potential cellular mechanism through which early environmental insults could change PL neural development by adolescence.

">Microglial Lag3 Drives α-Synuclein--induced Neurotoxic Activated (A1) Astrocytes and Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Background Neuroinflammation and pathologic -synuclein (-syn) aggregation cooperate to drive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, but the glial receptors that couple extracellular -syn to inflammatory cascades remain incompletely defined. Microglia express higher levels of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3) than neurons, yet the contribution of microglial Lag3 to -syn recognition, glial crosstalk, and neurodegeneration is unknown. Methods Biochemical binding assays, live-cell imaging, cytokine profiling, and neuron-microglia-astrocyte co-culture paradigms were used to define Lag3-dependent -syn preformed fibril (PFF) binding, uptake, and microglial activation. To interrogate in vivo function, microglia-specific Lag3 conditional knockout mice (Lag3L/L-Cx3cr1CreER) and littermate controls received unilateral intrastriatal -syn PFF injections, followed by histological, biochemical, and behavioral assessments of -syn pathology, gliosis, nigrostriatal integrity, and motor performance. Results -syn PFFs bound microglial Lag3 with high specificity and nanomolar affinity and required Lag3 for efficient fibril internalization and induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Microglial Lag3 deficiency markedly blunted -syn PFF-evoked microglial activation, prevented cytokine-driven conversion of astrocytes into neurotoxic reactive A1 astrocytes, and abolished astrocyte-dependent neuronal death in vitro. In vivo, microglia-specific Lag3 deletion reduced cortical, striatal, and substantia nigra pS129 -syn pathology, suppressed microgliosis and A1 astrocyte induction, preserved substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine transporter/tyrosine hydroxylase expression, and ameliorated -syn PFF-induced motor deficits. Conclusions This study identifies microglial Lag3 as a key receptor linking extracellular -syn PFF recognition to inflammatory amplification, neurotoxic reactive A1 astrocyte conversion, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Together with prior work on neuronal Lag3, these findings support a cell-type-specific dual-axis model in which neuronal Lag3 mediates -syn propagation while microglial Lag3 drives glia-dependent neurotoxicity, positioning Lag3 as a promising precision therapeutic target in -synucleinopathies.

">Cortical deviance detection represents a canonical difference signal</a></h4>

              
                Context modulates neural processing of sensory stimuli. Neural responses are suppressed to stimuli that are typical in their context and augmented to stimuli that deviate from their context. The latter has been conceptualized as a prediction error, which can serve to enhance the salience, direct attention, or support learning about behaviorally relevant events. Predictive coding theories posit that prediction errors act to signal the difference between internal predictions and actual sensory input, yet most paradigms simultaneously alter both predictions and input, so cannot test for a true difference signal. Increased neural responses to deviants could, instead, encode generalized surprise or augmented bottom-up signaling. Here we compare neural responses to auditory stimuli across oddball paradigm variants. We found that responses of putative excitatory neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) to auditory deviants contain frequency change information and a memory trace of contextual information. Interestingly, in a fixed-deviant oddball paradigm where predictions are altered but deviant input remains constant, neural response patterns encoded standard-to-deviant frequency difference. These results support the interpretation that A1 deviance detection can be interpreted as a sensory prediction error that represents the difference between prediction and sensory input, a corollary of the predictive coding framework.

">Placental Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Deficiency Drives Autism-Relevant Behavioral Changes with Sex-Specific Vulnerabilities</a></h4>

              
                Preterm birth and other perinatal adversities lead to loss of placental support including critical hormones, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), required for neurodevelopment. Decreased IGF1 and preterm birth are associated with neurodevelopmental disorder risk, including autism spectrum disorder. Whether placental Igf1 insufficiency impacts these neurodevelopmental risks is not understood. To understand these mechanisms, placental-targeted CRISPR manipulation in mice was employed to create placental Igf1 insufficiency. Subsequently, embryonic forebrain development was assessed sex-specifically to identify structural and transcriptomic changes. Postnatal offspring were used to determine neurobehavioral trajectories relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders as assessed through learning, motor, and affective behavioral tasks and neurostereology. Placental Igf1 insufficiency reduced embryonic forebrain growth, including decreased cell population across males and females. Embryonic forebrain transcriptomics revealed sex-specific alterations. Autism relevant developmental pathways were downregulated in male forebrain, driven by genes including Reln and Lama1. Altered genes in female forebrain were enriched for autism-risk genes including Grin2b and Dync1h1. Following these transcriptomic differences, postnatal neurobehavioral trajectories were sex specific. Male offspring uniquely showed reduced motor learning, increased stereotyped behaviors, altered reversal learning, and reduced forebrain neuronal number. Female offspring displayed opposite behavioral changes as males and few changes in forebrain structure. The provision of Igf1 specifically from placenta is critical for offspring forebrain development. This temporary early deficit has persistent sex-specific neurobehavioral effects. These outcomes have relevance for autism risk and highlight mechanisms that could facilitate intervention development for adverse outcomes after early loss of placental hormone support in perinatal adversity.

">Arousal modulates functional connectivity through structured and hemispherically asymmetric community architecture during wakefulness</a></h4>

              
                Arousal fluctuates continuously during wakefulness, yet how these moment-to-moment variations shape large-scale functional connectivity (FC) remains unclear. Here, we combined 7T fMRI with concurrent pupillometry to quantify, for every functional connection, how time-varying FC covaries with spontaneous arousal in the awake human brain. Rather than exerting a uniform influence across the connectome, arousal organized FC into a low-dimensional set of seven connectivity communities, each defined by characteristic network compositions. These communities exhibited systematic but community-specific hemispheric asymmetries, revealing distinct patterns of lateralized arousal modulation. Notably, the ventral attention network showed a pronounced division of labor: left-hemisphere nodes participated flexibly across multiple arousal-sensitive communities, whereas right-hemisphere nodes formed a cohesive, segregated arousal-responsive module. Importantly, hemispheric asymmetry did not arise from global shifts in connectivity strength, but instead reflected structured spatial heterogeneity embedded within community architecture. This modular and asymmetric organization was highly preserved during naturalistic movie watching, indicating that arousal-related modulation of FC reflects intrinsic principles that generalize across awake cognitive contexts. Together, these findings demonstrate that moment-to-moment arousal fluctuations shape large-scale FC through structured, hemispherically asymmetric network organization during wakefulness.

">Long-lasting astrocyte remodeling in Dravet Syndrome Scn1a+/- mouse model.</a></h4>

              
                Background. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a prototypical developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by SCN1A gene mutations leading to NaV1.1 loss of function. The latter causes early-onset drug-resistant seizures and enduring cognitive and behavioral deficits. In this pathological context, the implication of astrocytes remains insufficiently explored. Methods. Using a heterozygous Scn1a knock-out (Scn1a+/-) mouse model that recapitulates the DS-human phenotype, we examine astrocyte remodeling at landmark disease stages, as defined by video-EEG and behavioral read-outs. Results. From initial disease aggravation (PN20-35) to long-term stabilization (up to PN90), Scn1a+/- mice showed increased hippocampal and cortical GFAP transcript and protein levels, compared to age-matched control littermates and to an earlier pre-symptomatic (<PN20) time point. During the aggravation phase in Scn1a+/- mice, astrocyte branching, revealed by GFAP histological analysis and by intracellular delivery of Alexa Fluor 488 in hippocampal slices was increased but not sustained long-term. These disease-stage-dependent astrocyte modifications were not associated with macroscopic hippocampal sclerosis or cortical atrophy. To further study astrocyte remodeling during disease progression, we used biocytin diffusion following single-astrocyte loading to reveal an expanded astrocyte-astrocyte network in Scn1a+/- mice long-term, along with increased Cx30 and Cx43 protein levels. An ethidium bromide uptake assay indicated impaired astrocytic hemichannel function in Scn1a+/- mice long-term. Regionally, these long-term cellular and network astrocyte modifications coincided with augmented post-tetanic synaptic potentiation. Discussion. In DS, astrocytes undergo a long-lasting network remodeling. We discuss how this astrocyte remodeling may be related to seizures as well as synaptic and cognitive deficits.

">Sparkling Water Co-Consumption Enhances Oxytocin-Linked HR Synchrony and Social Connection in Live Sports Spectatorship</a></h4>

              
                Live sport spectatorship can promote social connection, yet scalable, low-burden strategies to strengthen bonding in real-world spectator settings remain limited. We here tested the hypothesis that co-consuming sparkling water during spectating attenuates hunger and fatigue and strengthens enjoyment and perceived unity, potentially via HR synchrony linked to oxytocin dynamics. In an individually randomized field experiment at a collegiate women basketball home game (sparkling water: n = 21; plain water: n = 19), spectators consumed 200 mL of sparkling water or plain water in synchrony before tip-off and before the end of halftime, with additional ad libitum intake of the assigned beverage permitted thereafter. We assessed acute freshness and hunger, repeated fatigue and enjoyment, interpersonal HR synchrony from the first half to 15-min post-game, perceived unity toward players and fellow spectators, and salivary oxytocin levels. Relative to plain water, sparkling water increased freshness and reduced hunger after intake, attenuated post-game fatigue, and enhanced enjoyment and perceived unity. HR synchrony was preserved in association with attenuated post-game fatigue after the game, and sustained synchrony was associated with higher perceived unity. Oxytocin decreased more in the sparkling-water group, and this decrease was associated with preserved HR synchrony as well as with changes in unity toward fellow fans. These findings support our hypothesis and suggest that co-consuming sparkling water serves as an alcohol-free, low-burden ritual to enhance social connection during and after live sport events.

">SCREWx: A Screwless, Chronic, Recoverable, and Lightweight Neuropixels fixture for freely-moving rodents</a></h4>

              
                High-density Neuropixels probes enable the study of large neural populations with single-cell and sub-millisecond resolution. While single-probe and acute head-fixed experiments have yielded critical scientific insights, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying many complex behaviors requires simultaneous multi-region recordings in freely moving, chronically implanted animals. Various probe fixtures have been developed to enable high-density recording, but existing designs impose critical limitations: their substantial weight restricts the maximum probe count that smaller animals can support, their bulky dimensions constrain the proximity of targeted brain regions, and their complex assembly risks damaging the probe during insertion and recovery. In this paper, we present a lightweight, fully 3D-printable, compact, and screwless fixture for chronic Neuropixels implants in freely moving rodents that features simple mechanisms for stable implantation and safe extraction. Our fixture design enables stable, high-yield single-unit recordings for months-long experiments, along with an 83% successful probe extraction rate. This fixture design provides a robust and accessible solution for long-term, multi-probe chronic Neuropixels recordings, increasing experimental throughput and enabling more complex experimental designs to investigate brain-wide neural dynamics.

">Neuro-metabolic pathways of high-protein meal reducing food craving</a></h4>

              
                Across species, high-protein foods have been shown to reduce appetite throughout the day. Although higher protein intake alters multiple metabolic responses, the exact neuro-metabolic mechanisms underlying food craving remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether a protein-rich diet modulates plasma tyrosine dynamics, the precursor of dopamine, thereby altering dopaminergic brain activity and reducing food craving in humans. In this within-subject, cross-over study, 30 healthy participants (age, Mean=23.63, SD=3.23 years) were provided with either a high- or low-protein/carbohydrate breakfast. Three and a half hours after breakfast, participants viewed high-or low caloric food images while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their subjective food craving was assessed using the validated Food Craving Questionnaire- State version. Through the experimental procedure, plasma tyrosine levels were continuously monitored. Our results show that the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast significantly enhanced plasma tyrosine levels, which were negatively associated with subjective food craving several hours after meal intake. Importantly, we observed significantly stronger midbrain activity following the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast, which was associated with greater reduction in subjective food craving. Furthermore, we analyzed brain gradients that characterize spatial patterns of large-scale neural activity, allowing us to examine the entire process underlying dietary choices at the whole-brain level. Compared with the low-protein/carbohydrate breakfast, the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast reduced whole-brain functional reorganization, indicating lower neural sensitivity to high- versus low-caloric food stimuli. Notably, the degree of this high-protein/carbohydrate induced brain-state shift was related to the reduction in food craving. Together, these results provide strong evidence that high-protein/carbohydrate meals modulate dopaminergic mechanisms and large-scale whole-brain neural reorganization, contributing to reduced food craving throughout the day in humans.

">Molecular signatures of maladaptive plasticity in the amygdala in a rat model of chronic neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain, a complex multidimensional disorder, remains a major health care issue and a therapeutic challenge. Neuropathic pain is a chronic pain condition that results from damage or dysfunction in the nervous system. While mechanisms of neuropathic pain at the peripheral and spinal cord level have been extensively studied, pain mechanisms in the brain remain underexplored. The amygdala, a limbic brain region, has emerged as a critical brain area for the emotional-affective dimension of pain and pain modulation. Amygdala neuroplasticity has been associated with pain states, but exact molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these states and the transition from acute to chronic pain are not well understood. Here, we used the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain in male rats to investigate changes in gene expression in the amygdala at the chronic pain stage using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Two amygdala nuclei, basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA), were investigated in a hemisphere-dependent manner. We used an integrative approach that focuses on functional significance and cell type specificity of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to nominate mechanistic targets for central regulation of chronic pain. Our integrative transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses identified individual genes (e.g., Cxcl10, Cxcl12, Mbp, Plp1, Mag, Mog, Slc17a6, Gad1, Sst), molecular pathways (e.g., cytokine-mediated signaling pathway), biological processes (e.g., myelination, synaptic transmission), and specific cell types (e.g., oligodendrocytes, glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurons) affected by chronic pain. Our results also provide evidence for the emerging concept of hemispheric lateralization of pain processing in the amygdala. Overall, our study proposes oligodendrocyte dysfunction in the amygdala, neuroimmune signaling in CeA, and glutamatergic neurotransmission in BLA as mechanistic determinants of and potential therapeutic targets for the management of chronic neuropathic pain.

                Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of reproductive-age women worldwide and is associated with substantial pain and mental health burden, yet its neurobiological correlates remain poorly characterized. Neuroimaging studies of endometriosis are particularly limited. Here we present a comprehensive, multidimensional investigation of the neurobiology of endometriosis, integrating structural and diffusion neuroimaging, biofluid measures, neuropsychological testing, and detailed health and psychosocial phenotyping in individuals with and without endometriosis. Compared with controls, individuals with endometriosis exhibited higher levels of pain, depression, and anxiety and performed worse across multiple cognitive domains. Global and regional brain morphometric measures did not differ between groups; however, endometriosis-specific pain was associated with altered gray matter volume and white matter microstructure across distributed pain-related neural circuits. These findings identify pain-related neurobiological signatures of endometriosis and establish a foundation for mechanistic and translational studies of its central nervous system effects.

">Cortical Thickness and Curvature in Autism and ADHD: A Mega-Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Background: Existing evidence suggests cortical morphometric alterations occur in people with autism and ADHD. However, these findings remain tentative due to small sample sizes, heterogeneous imaging pipelines, varied statistical approaches, and limited harmonization across acquisition sites. Few studies have applied standardized processing to large, clinically enriched datasets or addressed site-related batch effects. Methods: We leveraged six large-scale brain imaging datasets (n = 9,647; male=5,835; female=3,812; ages 5-64 years), including 1,533 individuals with ADHD, 1,080 with autism spectrum disorder, and 7,034 matched controls. All imaging data were processed using the validated ABCD-HCP pipeline, with cortical parcellation into 360 regions based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) atlas, and ComBat harmonization was applied to account for variability across 67 acquisition sites. Group-level differences in cortical thickness and sulcal curvature were examined with ANCOVAs, controlling for covariates and using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results: Our analyses revealed distinct neuroanatomical signatures for both autism and ADHD. Individuals with autism exhibited regionally thinner cortex and curvature alterations particularly in the Cingulo-Opercular network. In contrast, individuals with ADHD displayed regionally thicker cortex, particularly in the default mode and somatomotor networks, alongside curvature differences. Control participants showed intermediate patterns, suggesting that autism and ADHD may represent diverging extremes of cortical maturation. Conclusions: Cortical thickness and curvature emerge as potential biomarkers that can advance understanding of neurodevelopmental conditions and disentangle heterogeneity across diagnostic groups. These findings highlight the value of harmonized, large-scale, standardized analyses for resolving inconsistencies in the literature.

">Atypical somatosensory adaptation in adults on the autism spectrum: a high-density electrophysiological (EEG) mapping study.</a></h4>

              
                Adaptation to repetitive sensory inputs promotes efficient neural processing by attenuating responses to redundant information and reallocating resources to novel stimuli. Reduced adaptation has been proposed to contribute to atypical sensory reactivity in autism, but the physiological mechanisms underlying tactile adaptation remain poorly understood. Here, we examined short-term adaptation to repetitive vibrotactile stimulation in autistic and neurotypical adults using high-density electrophysiological recordings. Fifty participants (18-44 years; 25 autistic; 25 neurotypical), received sequences of four brief vibrations to the index fingertip while viewing silent videos. Neural responses were analyzed for an early negative deflection (N1, ~100 milliseconds) indexing basic stimulus recognition, and a later positive deflection (P2, ~200-300 milliseconds) indexing higher-order contextual and attentional processing. Adaptation was quantified as changes in response magnitude across the four vibrations. The N1 did not differ between groups, showing minimal change across repetitions, indicating comparable processing of basic tactile features. In contrast, the P2 was significantly larger overall in the autistic group. Across both groups, responses to the first vibration in each sequence were greater than responses to subsequent vibrations, reflecting re-sensitization following the inter-sequence interval. Autistic participants exhibited consistently amplified P2 responses to initial vibrations, suggesting heightened re-sensitization rather than impaired within-sequence adaptation. Associations between neural responses and clinical measures of autistic traits and tactile sensitivity were modest. These findings indicate that autistic adults show amplified higher-order neural responses to tactile input alongside preserved short-term adaptation. Heightened re-sensitization to repeated touch may reflect shortened refractory periods, contributing to sensory hyper-reactivity and increased perceptual load.

">Vicarious trauma primes innate immunity and reconfigures human brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Vicarious trauma-witnessing serious harm to others-produces systemic neuroimmune effects in animal models. However, its brain, autonomic, and immune consequences in humans remain unclear. We scanned 88 participants with fMRI during a naturalistic movie-viewing paradigm depicting either industrial cruelty to farm animals (Vicarious Trauma, VT) or positive human-animal interactions (Vicarious Community, VC) with concurrent autonomic physiology and gene expression in circulating monocytes. VT, compared to VC, evoked sustained sympathetic arousal lasting 40 minutes post-viewing and primed innate immune cells to elicit elevated pro-inflammatory (upregulating IL1B and CXCL8) and reduced anti-inflammatory (TGFB1) responses. VT reduced integration in a frontoparietal control system and increased coupling between a salience/action-mode system with paralimbic, basal ganglia, and sensorimotor regions. Disrupted negative coupling between frontoparietal/default-mode and hippocampal systems predicted VT-related CXCL8 increases. These findings shed light on how the brain translates vicarious trauma into the priming of innate immunity.

                <p>Sulf1<I></I> is an extracellular sulfatase that regulates cell signaling by removing 6-<I>O</I>-sulfates from heparan sulfate. Although the roles of <I>Sulf1</I> in neural development have been studied extensively, its functions in the adult brain remain largely unknown. Here, we report the effects of <I>Sulf1</I> disruption on the neuronal properties of the medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, one of the regions highly expressing <I>Sulf1</I>. We separately labeled MSNs expressing dopamine D1 receptors (D1-MSNs) or D2 receptors (D2-MSNs) by injecting adult male <I>Drd1-Cre</I> and <I>Drd2-Cre</I> mice with a Cre-dependent AAV vector expressing a red fluorescent protein, mCherry, and examined their electrophysiological properties by means of whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recording. In the D2-MSNs, <I>Sulf1</I> disruption led to drastic changes in neural firing responses to depolarizing current injections: in the <I>Sulf1</I> knock-out mice, the rheobase was smaller than in the wild-type mice, but the number of action potentials elicited by depolarization did not increase at larger current injections. In the D1-MSNs, <I>Sulf1</I> disruption resulted in more depolarized resting membrane potentials and increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio. These results suggest that <I>Sulf1</I> is essential for regulation of neuronal excitability and glutamatergic transmission of NAc MSNs in adult mice and implicate the potential roles of <I>Sulf1</I> in NAc circuit activity, reward-aversion behaviors, and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and drug addiction.</p>

                <p>We studied the role of movement and outcome information in forming metacognitive representations of agency. Human participants (<I>N</I> = 40; 25 female, 15 male, 0 diverse) completed a goal-oriented task: a semivirtual version of a ball-throwing game. In two conditions, we manipulated either the visual representation of the throwing movement or its proximal outcome (the resulting ball trajectory). We measured participants&rsquo; accuracy in a discrimination agency task, as well as confidence in their responses and tested for differences in the electrophysiological (EEG) signal using mass linear mixed-effect modeling. We found no mean differences between participants&rsquo; metacognitive efficiency between conditions. However, through exploratory analyses, we found that metacognitive sensitivity did not correlate between the two conditions and that the EEG signal differed between the two conditions during the agency discrimination task. We cautiously interpret these results as suggesting that although both movement and outcome information contribute to participants&rsquo; sense of agency, they may do so through distinct processes. These findings highlight the need for further research examining the potential neurophysiological differences corresponding to the conceptual distinction between bodily and external agency.</p>

                Background This study validates the Korean Movement Culture Perception (KMCP) scale, a tool designed to assess Korea's 'Movement Culture' (e.g., K-pop dance, Taekwondo), a key element of the 'Shin Hallyu' (New Korean Wave) characterized by participatory consumption. Using the Rasch model, this study analysed the validity of the scale among 1,240 participants from Korea and China, a major market for Hallyu. Methods Participants responded to the 21-item KMCP scale, which comprises three sub-factors ('Korean attractiveness,' 'correct knowledge information,' and 'content diversification'), using a five-point Likert scale. Results The scale demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .954), and all 21 items showed an adequate model fit (Infit range: 0.86–1.11), confirming its overall construct validity. However, the item-person map revealed that item difficulty was clustered in the middle, indicating a limited capacity to measure diverse perception levels. Furthermore, significant differential item functioning (DIF) was found in five items (4, 6, 7, 12, and 31) based on nationality, with three of this exhibiting cultural bias unfavourable to foreigners. Conclusions In conclusion, while the KMCP scale is a generally valid tool, the revision of culturally biased items is urgently needed to ensure cross-cultural equivalence. By improving the scale, this study will contribute to a more objective evaluation of Hallyu content's value and support the global dissemination of Korean movement culture as a health promotion tool through education.

                <p>The risk allele rs10191329*A is associated with disease severity and brain atrophy in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). We investigated the association of rs10191329 with age-related brain atrophy in a population-based cohort using 10,308 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 4,815 participants aged ≥ 45 years without MS in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. We observed associations between the rs10191329*A allele and lower total brain volume and gray matter volume in middle-aged (&lt; 55 years of age), but not in older participants. These data suggest that rs10191329*A contributes to earlier onset of atrophy in the general population, and that mediating mechanisms of accelerated neurodegeneration extend beyond MS.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78134?af=R">Does Missing Medication Acutely Change Seizure Risk? A Prospective Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine whether missing individual doses of anti-seizure medications (ASMs) elevate short-term seizure risk in people with drug-resistant epilepsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a prospective, community-based cohort, adults with drug-resistant epilepsy (≥ 3 seizures/month) or their caregivers recorded seizures and ASM intake with smartphone applications for 10 months each. Individual level analysis modeled the relationships between ASM adherence with seizure occurrence, as well as with a simplified seizure forecast via a 90-day moving average (“Napkin method”). Group-level analysis with a mixed-effects model was performed to examine the relationship between ASM adherence and simplified forecasts, while controlling for differences in individual seizure frequency via random effects.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty-seven participants (median age = 29 years) contributed 7,853 person-days. Individual analysis showed that only a small (n = 2) number of participants had a weak relationship between ASM adherence with seizure occurrence. Group-level analysis showed that seizure occurrence was highly linked to the Napkin method, but not ASM adherence.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Among individuals with frequent, drug-resistant epilepsy, occasional missed ASM doses did not measurably raise immediate seizure risk. Whereas sustained nonadherence remains a clinical concern, clinicians may reassure patients that infrequent brief lapses are unlikely to trigger seizures acutely, yet they should continue emphasizing overall adherence for long-term seizure control.

                Abstract* Introduction One-lung ventilation (OLV) is used to isolate one lung during thoracic surgery, but manipulation and positioning can affect heart-lung interaction. Cardiomegaly may exacerbate these changes, especially in the left lateral decubitus (LLD) position. Objectives To investigate the effect of cardiomegaly on heart-lung interaction during OLV, particularly in the LLD position. Case presentation A 20-year-old male with recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax was scheduled for right-sided bronchopleural fistula repair via thoracotomy. The patient presented with cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio 75%) and echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular and atrial dilation. In the LLD position, OLV led to desaturation when both lungs were ventilated, but oxygenation improved when only the left lung was ventilated. Results Cardiomegaly alters heart-lung interaction during OLV, particularly in the LLD position. The enlarged heart exerts pressure on the left lung, impairing ventilation. When both lungs are ventilated in this position, ventilation is directed toward the right lung, reducing oxygenation and causing desaturation. However, restricting ventilation to the left lung improved oxygenation due to better lung compliance and less interference from the enlarged heart. Conclusions Cardiomegaly affects heart-lung interaction during OLV in the LLD position. Oxygenation improves when only the left lung is ventilated, likely due to less compression of the left lung. The supine position may further enhance oxygenation even with bilateral ventilation. This case highlights the importance of considering cardiomegaly in OLV management. This section should be written as per the CARE checklist item 3.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93994">Population analyses reveal heterogenous encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex during naturalistic foraging</a></h4>

              
                Foraging in the wild requires coordinated switching of critical functions, including goal-oriented navigation and context-appropriate action selection. Nevertheless, few studies have examined how different functions are represented in the brain during naturalistic foraging. To address this question, we recorded multiple single-unit activities from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats seeking a sucrose reward in the presence of an unpredictable attack posed by a robotic predator (Lobsterbot). Simultaneously recorded ensemble activities from neurons were analyzed in reference to various behavioral indices as the animal moved freely across the foraging area (F) between the nest (N) and the goal (E) area. An artificial neural network, trained with simultaneously recorded neural activity, estimated the rat’s current distance from the Lobsterbot. The accuracy of distance estimation was the highest in the middle F-zone in which the dominant behavior was active navigation. The spatial encoding persisted in the N-zone when non-navigational behaviors such as grooming, rearing, and sniffing were excluded. In contrast, the accuracy decreased as the animal approached the E-zone, when the activity of the same neuronal ensembles was more correlated with events related to dynamic decision-making between food procurement and Lobsterbot evasion. A population-wide analysis confirmed highly heterogeneous encoding by the region. To further assess the decision-related activity in the E-zone, a naive Bayesian classifier was trained to predict the success and failure of avoidance behavior. The classifier predicted the avoidance outcome as much as 6 s before the head withdrawal. In addition, two sub-populations of recorded units with distinct temporal dynamics contributed differently to the prediction. These findings suggest that an overlapping population of mPFC neurons may switch between two heterogeneous modes, encoding relevant locations for goal-directed navigation or an imminent situational challenge.

                Insects rely on plants’ visual, chemical, tactile, and electrical cues when making various decisions. A recent study demonstrated that dehydrated plants emit ultrasonic sounds within the auditory sensitivity range of many moth species. In this study, we sought to determine whether insects also rely on plant acoustic signals when making decisions. We investigated whether female moths rely on ultrasonic clicks which are typically produced by dehydrated plants when deciding where to oviposit. In the absence of an actual plant, the moths indeed preferred to lay their eggs in proximity to acoustic signals which represent dehydrating plants. Tracking the moths’ behavior prior to the decision showed that they examined both sides of the arena and gradually spent more time on the acoustic-playback side. Interestingly, when actual plants were added to the arena, the oviposition preference was reversed and the moths preferred silent plants, which is in accordance with their a priori preference for hydrated plants. Deafening the moths eliminated their preference, confirming that the choice was based on hearing. Moreover, the presence of male moths, including their auditory signals, did not affect their oviposition decision, suggesting that the response was specific to plant sound emissions. We reveal evidence for a first acoustic interaction between moths and plants, but as plants emit various sounds, our findings hint at the existence of more currently unknown insect-plant acoustic interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107039">CCDC32 stabilizes clathrin-coated pits and drives their invagination</a></h4>

              
                Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for maintaining homeostasis in mammalian cells. Previous studies have reported more than 50 CME accessory proteins; however, the mechanism driving the invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) remains elusive. We show by quantitative live cell imaging that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCDC32, a poorly characterized endocytic accessory protein, leads to the accumulation of unstable flat clathrin assemblies. CCDC32 interacts with the α-appendage domain (AD) of AP2 in vitro and with full-length AP2 complexes in cells. Deletion of aa78-98 in CCDC32, corresponding to a predicted α-helix, abrogates AP2 binding and CCDC32’s early function in CME. Furthermore, clinically observed nonsense mutations in CCDC32, which result in C-terminal truncations that lack aa78-98, are linked to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS). Overall, our data demonstrate the function of a novel endocytic accessory protein, CCDC32, in regulating CCP stabilization and invagination, critical early stages of CME.

">Non-Canonical ERP Patterns in Second-language Sentence Processing: Evidence from Syntactic, Semantic, and Phonological Violations in Japanese Learners of English</a></h4>

              
                Background/Objectives: Despite notable advances in the neural mechanisms of second-language (L2) processing, few studies have systematically compared syntactic, semantic, and phonological processing of L2 within a single experimental design. We investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying L2 sentence processing in native Japanese speakers with intermediate English proficiency. By integrating behavioral measures and event-related potentials (ERPs), we examined how syntactic, semantic, and phonological information influenced sentence comprehension. Methods: Twenty-seven participants completed an auditory sentence judgment task involving English sentences with a syntactic, semantic, or phonological error. Results: Behavioral results revealed the highest accuracy in the control and semantic conditions, while syntactic and phonological violations led to significantly lower performance, indicating greater processing difficulty in these domains. Among the three linguistic violation types, phonological violations elicited the robust ERP negativities across both time 300-500 ms and 500-800 ms time windows, while syntactic and semantic violations evoked less consistent neural responses in this L2 auditory sentence judgment task. These results suggest that mismatches in expected phonological forms hinder lexical activation, triggering a negativity that resembles an N400 but reflects different underlying processes. Conclusion: We found non-canonical neural response patterns in L2 learners, characterized by sensitivity to phonological anomalies but minimal neural disruption for semantic or syntactic anomalies. The current study contributes to our understanding of L2 sentence processing in native Japanese speakers, particularly by aligning real-time neural responses with behavioral performance. This work offers implications for pedagogical practices and assessment strategies tailored to neurodiverse bilingual populations.

">INS-fMRI reveals a mesoscale limbic organization associated with medial pulvinar in primates</a></h4>

              
                The experience of emotion comprises not only the feelings (happiness, sadness), but also behavioral expression, internal awareness, and the body's physiological response. However, it remains unclear how the brain integrates these disparate aspects of emotion. Here, to examine functional connectivity in the limbic system of macaque monkeys, we combined focal Infrared Neural Stimulation of a sensory gateway (medial pulvinar PM), with ultra-high-field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (INS-fMRI). We find connected sites are mesoscale (millimeter-scale) in size and arranged in patchy patterns across cingulate, insula, and amygdala. Non-overlapping connections evoked from three sequential stimulation sites in PM form clusters of multi-site integration, and appear related to known functional organization within these limbic regions. We suggest these mesoscale functional connections link the limbic axes of motor expression (cingulate), interoception (insula), and emotion-related processing (amygdala), and that, much like visual system, the limbic system is fundamentally quite orderly at mesoscale. Our results underscore the importance of millimeter-scale precision and organization in diagnosis and treatment of affective disorders.

">Multitimescale Computation by Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The basic computational unit of the brain has long been defined as the neuron. However, mounting evidence suggests that other cells, especially astrocytes, also perform computation. Here we demonstrate that cerebellar astrocytes decompose norepinephrine input into slow and fast calcium activities through differential adrenergic receptor engagement. During reward learning in mice, slow and fast activities selectively target distinct synaptic pathways. Causal manipulations reveal that slow 1-adrenergic signals maintain behavioral states and coordinate transitions, while fast 2-adrenergic signals govern event-triggered responses and reinforcement learning. Remarkably, an actor-critic neural network trained on a similar sequence task spontaneously recapitulates these multitimescale dynamics, suggesting astrocytes implement critic-like computations that evaluate states and modulate neuronal learning. These findings establish astrocytes as multilevel processors that transform univariate neuromodulatory inputs into multivariate, pathway-specific circuit control operating in parallel with neuronal processing.

">HONeD-in on Brain Activity: Deconvolving Passive Diffusion on the Structural Network from Functional Brain Signals</a></h4>

              
                Brain regions perform distinct computations, and their signals propagate through the whole-brain white matter network. Yet, mathematical models that describe this signal propagation via purely passive diffusion can predict a considerable amount of the observed functional connectivity between regions. This raises a critical question: if so much functional connectivity can be explained by a passive process, how can we isolate the active process? Here, we calculate in closed-form an estimate for such an active signal in functional MRI by spatially deconvolving the effect of passive signal spread over the brain's structural connectivity using a higher-order network diffusion (HONeD) model. Across 770 Human Connectome Project subjects, we show that the resulting HONeD-innovation (HONeD-in) signal 1) sparsifies functional connectivity while retaining a well-connected network, 2) remodels resting-state networks (RSNs), 3) mixes the unimodal--multimodal hierarchical organization of RSNs into a circle with no clear hierarchy, and 4) deblurs task-activation maps. Together, our results highlight HONeD deconvolution as a generalizable new way to study resting-state and task fMRI brain signals.

">Zebrin molecular identity and cerebellar location determine Purkinje cell vulnerability in Christianson syndrome mice</a></h4>

              
                Ataxia is a major characteristic feature in Christianson syndrome, where Purkinje cells in the anterior cerebellar vermis are vulnerable to degeneration while those in the posterior vermis are resilient. Here, we provide a temporal study of changes in Purkinje cell function, cell vulnerability and innervation of cerebellar nuclei in a mouse model of Christianson syndrome. Purkinje cells express certain molecules in a patterned manner across the cerebellum, such as aldolase C/zebrin-II (zebrin). We show that zebrin patterning appears normal before disease onset in Christianson syndrome mice with no apparent cell death, similar to what has been reported in patients. We observe rapid Purkinje cell death in the anterior lobe of Christianson syndrome mice that is exclusive to zebrin-negative Purkinje cells, with zebrin-positive Purkinje cells showing resilience. Intrinsic firing deficits exclusively in the anterior cerebellum are observed at the same time as the first observed cell death in the anterior cerebellum. In contrast, posterior Purkinje cells degenerated later, but zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive cells were equally susceptible to degeneration. Purkinje cells innervation in the cerebellar nuclei was also lost in Christianson syndrome mice in a region-specific manner: neurons in the anterior cerebellar nuclei, with predominantly zebrin-negative Purkinje cells inputs, displayed dramatic loss of Purkinje cells innervation, while neurons in the posterior cerebellar nuclei, innervated by both zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive terminals, showed greater resiliency. Together, our results highlight that cerebellar location and zebrin molecular identity appear important to the vulnerability of Purkinje cells and their innervation in the cerebellar nuclei in Christianson syndrome.

">Shaped by meaning, weighted by reliability: New insights into multisensory integration</a></h4>

              
                In everyday perception, sensory information is rarely interpreted in isolation. Instead, observers generate expectations about what is likely to occur next, using contextual information to guide decisions, particularly when sensory input is weak, ambiguous, or uncertain. These expectations can facilitate behaviour when they align with incoming evidence, but impose costs when they conflict, shaping how information from different senses contributes to behaviour. However, it remains unclear what kind of multisensory process is engaged when meaning guides decisions, and whether multisensory facilitation and non-independence reflect a single integrative mechanism or distinct routes shaped by context. Here, we examined how semantic context, visual clarity, and the relationship between auditory and visual signals jointly shape behaviour in a semantic correspondence task using dynamic, naturalistic events. Participants judged whether a target matched a preceding concept prime, establishing an expectation at the level of meaning. Targets were auditory-only, visual-only (clear or blurry), or audiovisual (AV), with AV components conveying either the same or different meanings across modalities. AV facilitation was not a general consequence of stimulus redundancy. When the prime accurately predicted the target and auditory and visual signals conveyed the same meaning, degrading visual input increased the contribution of auditory information, leading to faster responses and violations of the race-model inequality. By contrast, when the prime indicated the target but auditory and visual signals conveyed competing meanings, AV stimulation produced robust behavioural costs relative to vision. When the prime did not match the target, congruent and incongruent audiovisual events produced comparable effects, and race-model violations were observed even when auditory and visual signals encoded different concepts, indicating convergence at the level of the response rather than shared perceptual content. Finally, exploratory clustering revealed two participant subgroups with comparable overall response speed but systematically different multisensory profiles when semantic expectations did not allow reliable anticipation of the upcoming event. Together, these findings show that multisensory effects in semantic decisions are shaped by meaning and arise through two functionally distinct routes: one in which reduced sensory reliability promotes joint use of congruent audiovisual information, and another in which perceptually different signals converge on the same response when semantic expectations are not met.

">Alpha oscillations and aperiodic neural dynamics jointly predict visual temporal resolution, confidence, and dependence on prior experience</a></h4>

              
                Perception requires integrating sensory input over time to construct coherent experiences. Alpha oscillations have been proposed to define the temporal resolution of perception, yet empirical evidence remains inconsistent. Here we combined a sustained visual integration paradigm with resting-state EEG to investigate how oscillatory and aperiodic neural dynamics jointly shape temporal perception. Participants (n=83) viewed alternating gratings that varied in alternation speed, producing the perception of either a fused plaid (integration) or two interchanging gratings (segregation). Faster individual alpha rhythms were associated with narrower temporal integration windows, and a steeper aperiodic spectrum predicted greater perceptual precision. Moreover, individuals with slower alpha frequencies and flatter spectra showed stronger reliance on prior judgments, suggesting reduced sensory precision and increased weighting of recent experience. Subjective confidence increased with faster alpha rhythms, reflecting the clarity of sensory evidence and its consistency with prior responses. Together, these findings show that the perceptual interpretation, confidence and previous experience effects in temporal integration reflect the joint influence of alpha rhythms and aperiodic neural activity. Mechanistically, faster alpha rhythms and lower neural noise may enhance perceptual resolution by generating more precise sampling frames per time unit, leading to finer temporal perception, reduced reliance on prior experience, and greater confidence.

">The individuality of single-frame functional brain connectivity</a></h4>

              
                AbstractConverging evidence from studies on brain network "fingerprinting" and precision functional mapping suggest that brain networks are highly individualized in functionally meaningful ways. Concurrently with a growth in studies on this topic, there has been a rise in interest on dynamics (approximately second-to-second changes) in brain networks within scan sessions. While analyses of traditional static networks have increasingly grown towards emphasizing the importance of individual differences in brain network topology, studies of dynamic networks typically follow methodology that require brain states to be considered at a group level. Recent studies have begun to assess the individuality of recurring dynamic brain "states". In this work, we extend this recent work by exploring the extent to which functional connectivity fingerprinting is feasible at single-frame temporal resolution. We estimate connectivity at individual volumes using phase coherence. We find that the identity of participants can be classified based on single volumes given sufficient database scan data and that having more highly parcellated atlases facilitates identification. Finally, we find that tasks can be identified more readily within subjects than between subjects. We conclude that participant identity may be an important driver of observed single-volume connectivity patterns. Further, the single-volume neural correlates of a task appear to be more consistent within subjects than between subjects. This highlights the importance of considering individual variability in studies of brain network dynamics.

">The IKC-leptin axis functions as a molecular bridge between neurodevelopment and endocrine signaling</a></h4>

              
                Kcnb1, a voltage-gated K channel widely expressed in brain, assembles with integrins to form integrin-K channel complexes (IKCs) in cortex and hypothalamus. Pathogenic KCNB1 variants cause Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy (DEE), and Kcnb1-null (Null) mice reproduce core neurodevelopmental defects alongside chronic hypoleptinemia, suggesting a leptin-IKC signaling axis. We find that Kcnb1, integrins, and the leptin receptor (LepR) co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize in cortical neurons. Perinatal leptin supplementation in Null mice improves cognition, corrects cortical anatomy, and restores neuronal migration, dendritic arborization, and synaptic functionality. In primary Null cortical neurons, leptin normalizes dendritic growth and actin remodeling via integrin-dependent mechanisms. By contrast, leptin has modest effects in WT animals and neurons; sensitivity is unmasked by pharmacological manipulation of integrins, and, strikingly, LepR blockade in the absence of exogenous leptin is sufficient to induce Null-like defects in WT neurons. These findings argue that hypoleptinemia alone does not drive the Null phenotype.

Instead, they reveal a previously unrecognized, dual-mode model in which LepR signaling is regulated by both its ligand and IKCs. This conceptual advance links IKC-LepR coupling to neurodevelopment and DEE and pinpoints their interface as a tractable therapeutic target.

">PKMζ-KIBRA interactions, molecular turnover, and memory</a></h4>

              
                How can the molecules that strengthen synaptic connections maintain memory in the face of molecular turnover? Our previous work showed that persistent interaction between the postsynaptic scaffolding protein, KIBRA, and the autonomously active PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is crucial for maintaining synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory for at least a month. This duration is longer than the lifespans of individual KIBRA and PKM{zeta} molecules. Biophysical modeling of the interaction suggests oligomers of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} dimers, but not individual dimers or monomers, can overcome molecular turnover by continually incorporating newly synthesized KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, replacing those that have degraded. Here we used AlphaFold 3 to predict the structures of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} heterodimers and heterohexamers and to examine the sites of action of two structurally distinct inhibitors of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} interaction that disrupt established late-LTP and long-term memory. The structures predict that the peptide K-ZAP blocks formation of heterodimers, whereas the small molecule {zeta}-stat prevents PKM{zeta} of one heterodimer from binding a second KIBRA and PKM{zeta}, essential for forming larger oligomeric structures. We show that {zeta}-stat, like K-ZAP, disrupts 1-month-old spatial memory. Thus, continual formation of KIBRA-PKM{zeta} oligomers can be a core molecular mechanism driving the persistence of long-term memory in the face of molecular turnover.

">Differential modulation of aversive signaling by expectation across the cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Pain-related aversion is an affective-motivational state driven by sensory experience that promotes learning and recruits widespread cortical networks, yet how distinct cingulate subregions contribute to its adaptive utility remains poorly understood. Here we used longitudinal one-photon calcium imaging in mice to compare dynamics in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) across repeated unsignaled foot-shocks and fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Both regions contained relatively stable ensembles that responded robustly to shocks, indicating shared encoding of acute nociceptive events. However, only the RSC flexibly re-organized its population activity when shocks were preceded by predictive cues. These anticipatory dynamics in the RSC predicted the rate of fear learning across individuals and subsequent extinction. By contrast, the ACC maintained shock-responsive ensembles with limited cue modulation. Instead, its dynamics encoded decisions to freeze, aligning with its role in encoding ongoing nociception and driving immediate defensive behavior. Together, these results reveal a division of labor in which the ACC emphasizes ongoing nociceptive processing, while the RSC transforms sensory signals into predictive codes that shape learning and memory. This specialization highlights how distributed cortical computations cooperate to generate the adaptive value of aversion. More broadly, our findings suggest that these regions assume complementary roles to address immediate sensory-motivational responses while flexibly reconfiguring to support long-term behavioral adaptation.

Significance statementPain engages widespread cortical circuits, yet how distinct cingulate subregions collaborate to shape its experience and utility remains unknown. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in mice, we demonstrate that both the anterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex contain stable shock-responsive ensembles, but only the retrosplenial cortex flexibly remodels its activity when shocks are predicted by cues. These anticipatory dynamics not only predict fear learning but influence extinction. Our findings uncover a division of labor in which the anterior cingulate encodes ongoing nociception and immediate defensive actions, while the retrosplenial cortex transforms these signals into temporally structured representations that support learning and memory. This work highlights how specialized cortical computations interact to generate the adaptive value of pain.

">Neural Integration of Affective Prosodic and Semantic Cues in Non-literal Forms of Speech Understanding</a></h4>

              
                Emotions in speech are conveyed through both semantics and prosody--voice  melody, yet how listeners integrate these cues in the brain remains unclear. We investigated non-literal forms of speech, such as irony and sarcasm, where understanding beyond literal meaning relies on the dynamic interplay between affective prosodic and semantic cues, alongside theory of mind (ToM). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants listened to short dialogues between two characters, which varied in prosody and semantics to convey either literal or non-literal meanings. Behaviorally, semantics and prosody interacted in shaping participants evaluations, although the data suggest a prosody dominance effect. Non-literal speech engaged the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, temporal speech regions, and ToM areas, while integration-demanding tasks (e.g., irony, sarcasm, ToM) evoked stronger ToM-network activation than prosody or semantics tasks. Taken together, our data clarify the behavioral and neural underpinnings of the integration of prosody and semantics in non-literal speech and open new venues in this field.

">Regional Hypothalamic Responses to Light Vary Across Developmental Stages but Remain Stable with Time of Day</a></h4>

              
                Background: Light plays a significant role in regulating various non-visual biological processes, such as stimulating alertness and cognition. However, the precise subcortical neural pathways are not fully established, including within the hypothalamus. In particular, how the hypothalamus processes are modulated by time-of-day and developmental stages, remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine in vivo the impact of different light illuminance (0.16, 37, 92, and 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance: mel-EDI lux) on the activity of the hypothalamus of healthy young adults (N=33; 20 women; 24.3 {+/-}3.2y) and adolescents (N=16; 5 women; 16.8 {+/-}1.1y) while they completed an auditory executive task, in the morning or in the evening. Results: Performance to the task improved with increasing illuminance irrespective of time of day and age group. When focusing on time-of-day differences in young adults, we found that the regional impact of light illuminance on the activity of the hypothalamus was consistent between the morning and the evening, with the posterior and anterior hypothalamus, respectively, showing increased and decreased activity with increasing illuminance. When focusing on developmental stages differences, during the evening session only, we found similar regional patterns in adolescents and young adult. The magnitude of the response at the highest illuminance was, however, larger in adolescents, with a larger deactivation of the superior-anterior and inferior-tubular hypothalamus. Conclusions: These findings reveal a complex and non-uniform impact of light on hypothalamus activity and provide novel insights into how light influences vary with developmental stages.

">Controllable Point-Light Displays Implemented in a game engine for biological motion research</a></h4>

              
                Biological motion perception plays a critical role in survival and social communication across species. Point-light displays (PLDs), which represent body movement using only a small set of joint markers, have long served as an effective tool for isolating motion cues from other visual features. However, existing methods for generating PLDs, ranging from filmed actors with reflective markers to markerless motion extraction and motion-capture datasets, present limitations in cost, accessibility, flexibility, or ecological validity. In particular, many laboratories lack the resources to create customizable stimuli that allow systematic manipulation of movement parameters. In this article, we introduce a practical and easily modifiable method for producing fully controllable 3D PLDs using freely available animation rigs and the Unity game engine. Our approach enables real-time control of depth cues and directional motion without the need for motion capture equipment or specialized filming environments. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we conducted a psychophysical experiment comparing the perception of biological and non-biological motion. The results replicate the well-documented forward-motion perceptual bias for biological stimuli and highlight differences in how observers interpret motion direction across stimulus classes. This method offers a convenient, accessible, and adaptable tool for research on motion perception and social cognition.

">Gliomas preferentially develop within the action-mode network</a></h4>

              
                Gliomas tend to arise in specific brain regions and may integrate into functional circuits, suggesting they could be regulated by brain activity. However, it remains unclear whether glioma growth is related to system-level brain networks. Analyzing neuroimaging data from three datasets including 1,310 patients with cerebral gliomas, we identified and replicated a functionally connected glioma network, which overlaps with the action-mode network (AMN), somatomotor network (SMN), and action-related subcortical regions. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the AMN successfully predicted the location of glioma occurrence in two independent datasets with complex tumor distributions. Remarkably, no patient had a glioma entirely outside the AMN, and over 89% of patients exhibited gliomas with at least 50% overlap with the network. Moreover, the spatial overlap between glioma location and the AMN demonstrated significant prognostic value in survival analyses, with higher AMN-tumor overlap associated with poorer overall survival. Notably, the acetylcholine transporter, a key player in glioma pathogenesis that drives transcriptional reprogramming, showed an expression pattern overlapping with the AMN. Meta-analytic annotations further linked the glioma network to processes of action initiation, execution, and feedback. These findings indicate that gliomas preferentially arise in circuits involved in action and highlight the central role of the AMN in glioma pathophysiology and growth.

">Context-Dependent Motor Feedback Underlies Choice-Related signals in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Choice-related neural activity, reflecting trial-by-trial correlation with subjects perceptual choice, is commonly observed in sensory cortices and has been implied in sensory readout. Recent studies suggest an alternative source from motor-reporting, yet its precise nature remain elusive due to limitations in conventional experimental paradigms. Here we quantitatively identified motor component by training macaques to discriminate visual motion directions via making saccade to spatial-independent, colored choice targets appeared under two contexts: at stimulus onset, or after its offset. Neural recordings in visual areas MT/MST revealed a dominant motor-related choice signal when the saccade goal was known in advance; this signal vanished with delayed target onset. By comparing with downstream sensory-motor transformation areas and employing a recurrent network model, we demonstrated that this motor component reflected feedback. Our work clarifies that a major portion of "decision" activity in sensory neurons is attributable to motor-reporting processes, highlighting the profound influence of behavioral context.

<p>This paper describes my history of exposure and contributions to behavioral neuroscience, especially to the role of the hippocampus in learning and memory. Through a series of accidents and opportunities, and after priming in the graduate student environment of hippocampus and memory at Dalhousie University in the Department of Psychology, my work on the topic started at the University of Lethbridge, evaluating place navigation in Richard Morris' swimming pool task with Bryan Kolb and Ian Whishaw. We made a number of experimental and theoretical contributions, most important among these was the evaluation of the deficits caused by hippocampal damage on place learning and memory, recent versus remote memory, configural associations, and extensions to human memory. We describe some missteps and how we picked ourselves up and continued on.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This article is a personal history of the background, ideas, and motivations behind the major discoveries from my lab in the past 27 years. Tracing the main themes back to my training as a graduate student and a postdoc, I discuss how all of our work has been influenced by a desire to use anatomical and computational literature to inspire and constrain the experimental questions we have addressed. The backstory of two fundamental discoveries made in the early days on my independent research program are described: (a) differences between DG, CA3, and CA1 population dynamics in relation to computational theories of pattern separation and pattern completion and (b) differences in the types of information conveyed to the hippocampus from its lateral and medial entorhinal cortex inputs. Also described are how these initial findings set the foundation for numerous subsequent discoveries as we followed the data from one experiment to the next, with the goals of understanding how information is represented and transformed through the hippocampal formation in support of spatial learning and episodic memory.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to characterize the neurodevelopment and risk factors for impairment at age 5 to 6 years after acute provoked neonatal seizures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Multicenter study of neonates with acute provoked seizures. Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence IV (WPPSI-IV), Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Scales, Behavior Assessment System for Children, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Social Responsiveness Scale, cerebral palsy (CP), and epilepsy were assessed at age 5 to 6 years. Latent class analysis defined outcome profiles. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to determine outcome predictors.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We characterized 3 latent classes among 164 children: (1) Typical Development (63%); (2) Behavioral Dysregulation (13%; low likelihood of physical impairment or severely impaired cognition, high likelihood of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]); and (3) Multi-Domain Impairment (24%; high likelihood of epilepsy and impairment across all domains). Among 144 children with standardized testing, mean WPPSI-IV was 91 ± 25 and Vineland-3 Adaptive Behavior Composite 90 ± 20. Twenty-nine percent had ADHD or elevated attention/hyperactivity scores; 19% had autism or elevated Social Responsiveness scores; 20% had epilepsy, and 19% had CP. Risk factors for Multi-Domain Impairment were abnormal neonatal neurologic examination (odds ratio [OR] = 3.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.74–8.95), impaired functional development at age 24 months (OR = 3.82, 95% CI = 1.25–11.66), and CP (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.74–7.90). No neonatal or infant characteristics were significantly associated with Behavioral Dysregulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of 5 to 6-year-old children with provoked neonatal seizures had typical development. Yet, executive and behavioral dysregulation were prevalent, even with preserved cognitive and physical function. These findings can inform outcome discussions and interventions to promote neurodevelopment. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, presenting significant clinical challenges due to poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Understanding the metabolic reprogramming that drives this disease is crucial for identifying new therapeutic targets and improving patient outcomes. We developed a novel computational framework integrating genome-scale metabolic modeling with machine learning to identify metabolic signatures and therapeutic vulnerabilities in pancreatic cancer. To address the inherent class imbalance in cancer datasets, we generated synthetic healthy samples using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty, implementing a rigorous three-step biological filtration process to ensure their validity. This approach enabled the creation of a balanced dataset for robust comparison of healthy versus cancerous metabolic states. Our machine learning classifier achieved 94.83% accuracy in distinguishing between these states, demonstrating the effectiveness of our integrated approach. Systems-level analysis revealed three key dysregulated pathways: heparan sulfate degradation, O-glycan metabolism, and heme degradation. We identified impaired lysosomal degradation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans as a potential contributor to disease pathogenesis, providing a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed association between lysosomal storage disorders and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, nervonic acid transport emerged as the most discriminative reaction between healthy and cancerous states, with gene-level analysis highlighting fatty acid binding proteins, fatty acid transporters, and acyl-CoA synthetases as key molecular drivers of metabolic reprogramming. Our multi-level approach connected genetic drivers to functional metabolic consequences, revealing coordinated upregulation of fatty acid transport and activation processes. These findings enhance our understanding of pancreatic cancer metabolism and present potential therapeutic targets, demonstrating the value of integrated computational approaches in cancer research.

Motivation <p>The interaction between peptides and human leukocyte antigen class II (HLA-II) molecules plays a pivotal role in adaptive immune responses, as HLA-II mediates the recognition of exogenous antigens and initiates T cell activation through peptide presentation. Accurate prediction of peptide-HLA-II binding serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular immune responses, and is essential for guiding the optimization of antibody therapeutics. Researchers have developed several computational approaches to identify peptide-HLA-II interaction and presentation. However, most computational approaches exhibit inconsistent predictive performance, poor generalization ability and limited biological interpretability.</p> Results <p>In this study, we present DSCA-HLAII, a novel predictive framework for peptide-HLA-II interactions and presentation based on a dual-stream cross-attention architecture. The framework proposes a dual-stream cross-attention (DSCA) mechanism to integrate pre-trained semantic embedding ESMC with sequence-level ONE-HOT features. The DSCA mechanism effectively models the interaction dynamics between peptides and HLA-II molecules, enabling the precise identification of key binding sites. Experimental results demonstrate that DSCA-HLAII consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness in predicting peptide-HLA-II interactions and presentation. We further demonstrate the capability of DSCA-HLAII for predicting peptide binding cores and assessing antibody immunogenicity, which is expected to advance artificial intelligence-based peptide drug discovery.</p>

                <p>by Yan Liu, Yu Xia, He Yan, Long-Chen Shen, Yiheng Zhu, Ji-Peng Qiang, Guo Wei</p>

Accurate cell type annotation is fundamental to single-cell analysis, yet remains challenging across heterogeneous datasets and modalities. In particular, transferring labels between scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data poses unique difficulties due to discrepancies in sequencing protocols and feature spaces. Existing methods typically handle only a subset of these challenges, often requiring scenario-specific adjustments and offering limited interpretability. Here, we present CellPredX, a structurally unified but adaptively parameterized, semi-supervised cross-modality framework for label transfer across scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and cross-protocol datasets. While maintaining a unified model architecture and optimization strategy, CellPredX allows adaptive tuning of loss-weight hyperparameters to account for the varying degree of similarity or discrepancy between different reference–query dataset pairs. CellPredX integrates domain adaptation and deep metric learning to align heterogeneous embeddings, and introduces a sparse center loss with an attention mechanism to enhance discriminative representations while suppressing noise. Moreover, an integrated interpreter module based on gradient attribution enables biological interpretability by identifying key markers and feature dimensions driving model predictions. Through extensive benchmarking across scRNA to scATAC, scATAC to scATAC, and scRNA to scRNA transfers, CellPredX consistently outperforms state-of-the-art annotation methods in both accuracy and robustness. The interpreter module further reveals biologically meaningful marker patterns that are consistent with known cell hierarchies. Together, these results demonstrate that CellPredX provides an interpretable and scalable solution for cross-modality cell type annotation in single-cell multi-omic integration.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The direct pathway from the lateral hypothalamus to the mouse olfactory bulb (OB) includes neurons that express the neuropeptide orexin-A and others that do not. The OB-projecting neurons that do not express orexin-A are located in an area of the lateral hypothalamus known to contain neurons that express the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). We used virally mediated anterograde tract tracing and immunohistochemistry for orexin-A and MCH to demonstrate that the OB is broadly innervated by axon projections from both populations of neurons with expression in each OB layer across the anterior-to-posterior axis and which overlapped with synaptophysin. Both orexin-A and MCH neurons are genetically heterogeneous, with subsets that co-express an isoform of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT). We used confocal imaging to test whether the projections from orexin-A and MCH neurons to the OB reflect this glutamatergic heterogeneity. The majority of putative orexin-A axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with smaller proportions that co-expressed VGLUT1 or that did not overlap with either VGLUT1 or VGLUT2. In contrast, a smaller proportion of MCH axon terminals overlapped with VGLUT2, with the majority being non-glutamatergic. Therefore, the projections from the lateral hypothalamus to the OB are genetically heterogeneous and include neurons that can release two different neuropeptides. The projections from orexin-A and MCH neuron populations are each genetically heterogeneous, with differing proportions of glutamatergic and non-glutamatergic axon terminals.</p>

                Background Astaxanthin, a red xanthophyll carotenoid, is a powerful antioxidant, anticancer, and glucose and lipid homeostasis regulator. Some pigmented yeasts belonging to the genus Rhodotorula, the well-known yeast for beta-carotene production, have been reported as natural astaxanthin producers. However, the lack of genomic data on astaxanthin-producing strains within these species hinders the identification of biosynthetic routes, molecular characterization of these pathways, and gene editing applications. Methods This study explored the diversity and astaxanthin production capability of cultivable pigmented yeast in flower samples. The astaxanthin production ability was inspected by three consecutive methods, including thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for the preliminary step, followed by quantitative spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for qualitative validation. The draft genome sequence and astaxanthin-producing genes of astaxanthin-producing yeasts were examined. Results Twelve of 23 yeasts from floral samples exhibited natural pigmentation, with colors ranging from pinkish-orange to red, and exhibited the potential for astaxanthin synthesis. These yeasts were Rhodotorula paludigena (three strains) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (nine strains). Among R. mucilaginosa strains, HL26-1 had the greatest astaxanthin content (104.98 ± 0.13 μg/g DCW) and yield (0.9280 ± 0.0012 mg/L). Strain LL69-1 has the greatest astaxanthin content (251.78 ± 0.27 μg/g DCW) and yield (1.8632 ± 0.0023 mg/L) among R. paludigena strains. The 18.78 Mbp R. mucilaginosa HL26-1 genome includes 5,711 protein-coding genes. Conversely, the R. paludigena LL69-1 genome was 20.99 Mbp, encompassing 6,782 predicted genes. A comprehensive investigation of draft genome sequences of these two strains identified CrtE, CrtYB, CrtI, CrtS, and CrtR as potential astaxanthin transcription genes. Conclusion Here, our results highlight the outstanding potential of two naturally pigmented yeasts, R. mucilaginosa HL26-1 and R. paludigena LL69-1, for astaxanthin production. Furthermore, our findings provide information on the whole genome and protein-encoded genes associated with astaxanthin production, which serve as valuable biological resources for various biotechnological applications.

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Female urethral adenocarcinoma (FUA) is an exceptionally rare and aggressive malignancy, accounting for less than 0.02% of all cancers in women. Its nonspecific symptoms often lead to delayed diagnosis, with many cases detected at advanced stages. The rarity of FUA, particularly when presenting with a large mass, underscores the challenges in developing standardized treatment protocols. Case Presentation A 65-year-old woman presented with urinary retention. Clinical examination revealed a large mass obstructing the urethral orifice. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a malignant mass involving the entire length of urethra, with no signs of metastasis. Percutaneous cystostomy was performed, and cystoscopy through the cystostomy access revealed tumor infiltration into the anterior bladder wall, approximately 2 cm from the bladder neck. A radical urethrectomy with partial cystectomy and bladder outlet reconstruction was performed via a transurethral approach, with antegrade cystoscopy guidance. The bladder outlet was reconstructed using a segment of the anterior bladder wall to facilitate voiding through the orthotopic site with a Foley catheter. Pathology confirmed pT4 urethral adenocarcinoma with enteric subtype and clear surgical margins. Neither radiation nor chemotherapy was administered. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient was in continuous incontinence status. This condition is expected since the sphincter was also resected during the surgery as the tumor already infiltrated the anterior bladder. But with the use of silicone catheter, we can avoid any leak and patient still can void timely through regularly clamp catheter. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient reported satisfaction with her quality of life and showed no signs of recurrence or metastasis. Conclusion This case highlights the feasibility of bladder-preserving surgical techniques in giant FUA with bladder infiltration. The approach achieved oncological control while maintaining the patient’s quality of life. Bladder outlet reconstruction provided satisfactory functional outcomes and eliminated the need for suprapubic urinary diversion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-1/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Suspected Valentino’s Syndrome mimicking acute appendicitis: a case report and literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Valentino’s Syndrome is a rare affliction caused by the perforation of a peptic ulcer which simulates deviously a picture of acute appendicitis. The diagnosis of this condition is not simple (often intraoperative) and requires a high degree of suspicion. Case presentation A 90-year-old man arrived at the Emergency Room with abdominal pain mainly localized in the right iliac fossa (Blumberg +, McBurney +). The patient had a history of previous perforated peptic ulcer treated with surgery. A diagnosis of suspected perforated acute appendicitis was made based on clinical and radiological findings and the patient underwent urgent surgical intervention. Laparoscopic exploration revealed a picture of diffuse choleperitonitis due to a probable perforation of a duodenal ulcer. Considering the patient’s age and the severity of the clinical and surgical picture, characterized by the presence of indissociable intra-abdominal adhesions, it was decided to forgo further surgical procedures, except drainage of the abdominal cavity and palliative medical treatment, due to a poor prognosis. Conclusion This syndrome, although very rare, should always be suspected in cases of right iliac fossa pain in the presence of certain risk factors for perforated peptic ulcer. Patient’s ethnicity: Italian.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of brain-computer interface (BCI)-controlled exoskeleton training on lower-limb functional recovery, psychological outcomes, and neural plasticity in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind pilot trial (ChiCTR2300074503) including 21 patients with SCI. Participants were randomized to a BCI-exoskeleton group (B + E, n = 10) or an exoskeleton-only group (E, n = 11) for lower-limb training. Both groups received conventional rehabilitation plus 30 minutes of training, 6 days per week, for 4 weeks. The primary outcomes were Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI II) scoring. Secondary outcomes included Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), Spinal Cord Independence Measure version III (SCIM III), International Association of Neurorestoratology Spinal Cord Injury Functional Rating Scale (IANR-SCIFRS), 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT), 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Cortical plasticity was assessed by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The B + E group showed a significant improvement in LEMS (<i>p</i> = 0.003), whereas both groups improved in IANR-SCIFRS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The B + E group demonstrated significant within-group gains in walking speed (10MWT, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and endurance (6MWT, <i>p</i> = 0.031), although between-group differences were not significant. Compared with the E group, the B + E group had larger reductions in HADS scores (<i>p</i> = 0.003). EEG analyses revealed stronger μ/β desynchronization and increased network efficiency, whereas MRI showed no structural changes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BCI-controlled exoskeleton training enhanced motor function, walking performance, and depressive symptoms more than exoskeleton training alone, likely through cortical reorganization. Extended training may further consolidate these benefits, supporting BCI-exoskeleton integration as a promising rehabilitation strategy for SCI. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>
