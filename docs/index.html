              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05284">Irreversible behavior drives neural flows in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the brain, neural activity undergoes directed flows between states, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry. At the same time, animals also exhibit irreversible flows between behavioral states. Yet it remains unclear whether -- and how -- irreversibility in the brain relates to irreversibility in behavior. Here, we explore this connection in the hippocampus, where neural activity encodes physical location. We show that hippocampal irreversibility can be quantified using the time-delayed cross-correlations between neurons. As a mouse moves along a virtual track, we find that physical flows through the animal's environment generate neural flows through its cognitive map. Strikingly, this neural irreversibility is explained by a minimal model with only three parameters: the average velocity of the mouse, the variance in this velocity, and the resolution of the neural encoding. Together, these results provide a mechanistic understanding of irreversibility in the hippocampus and shed light on the links between symmetry breaking in the brain and behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05893">An outlook on extracellular waveforms produced by the three neuronal compartments</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.05893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain is composed of billions of neurons with virtually endless morphologies and ion channel compositions, resulting in unique extracellular waveforms. Nevertheless, almost all neuronal morphologies can be reduced to a simple architecture made of three principal compartments: 1) the soma and nearby axonal hillock, 2) axonal projections ending in arbors or single synaptic contacts, and 3) dendrites. This review offers a perspective on how these three ubiquitous neuronal compartments can be identified and how they shape the extracellularly recorded waveforms, when spatial considerations are taken into account. This outlook utilizes biophysical modelling to complement existing experimental observations. Modeling has predicted a rich landscape of putative extracellular waveforms based on morphology, channel density, and sequential temporal activation. Recent advances in extracellular in vivo recording, combining low noise with high spatial density of recording sites, have improved the precision of extracellular waveform measurements, particularly in capturing waveforms beyond the classical somatic spikes, and in some cases, combinations originating from different compartments. This review aims to reorganize extracellular waveform heterogeneity by separating signals stemming from three neuronal compartments using three dimensions: amplitude, duration, and spatial extent or footprint. In doing so, we argue for a change of perspective, looking beyond somatic spikes to include spatiality and waveform combinations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02606">gPC-based robustness analysis of neural systems through probabilistic recurrence metrics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neuronal systems often preserve their characteristic functions and signalling patterns, also referred to as regimes, despite parametric uncertainties and variations. For neural models having uncertain parameters with a known probability distribution, probabilistic robustness analysis (PRA) allows us to understand and quantify under which uncertainty conditions a regime is preserved in expectation. We introduce a new computational framework for the efficient and systematic PRA of dynamical systems in neuroscience and we show its efficacy in analysing well-known neural models that exhibit multiple dynamical regimes: the Hindmarsh-Rose model for single neurons and the Jansen-Rit model for cortical columns. Given a model subject to parametric uncertainty, we employ generalised polynomial chaos to derive mean neural activity signals, which are then used to assess the amount of parametric uncertainty that the system can withstand while preserving the current regime, thereby quantifying the regime's robustness to such uncertainty. To assess persistence of regimes, we propose new metrics, which we apply to recurrence plots obtained from the mean neural activity signals. The overall result is a novel, general computational methodology that combines recurrence plot analysis and systematic persistence analysis to assess how much the uncertain model parameters can vary, with respect to their nominal value, while preserving the nominal regimes in expectation. We summarise the PRA results through probabilistic regime preservation (PRP) plots, which capture the effect of parametric uncertainties on the robustness of dynamical regimes in the considered models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05277">Evolving Cognitive Architectures</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2601.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a research and development direction that would lead to the creation of next-generation intelligent technical systems. A distinctive feature of these systems is their ability to undergo evolutionary change. Cognitive architectures are now one of the most promising ways to create Artificial General Intelligence systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition.

                arXiv:2601.05095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide, and poses significant risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conventional unimodal approaches, primarily reliant on electroencephalography (EEG), face several key challenges, including low SNR, nonstationarity, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, portability, and real-time applicability in clinical settings. To address these issues, a comprehensive survey highlights the concept of advanced multimodal learning for epileptic seizure detection and prediction (AMLSDP). The survey presents the evolution of epileptic seizure detection (ESD) and prediction (ESP) technologies across different eras. The survey also explores the core challenges of multimodal and non-EEG-based ESD and ESP. To overcome the key challenges of the multimodal system, the survey introduces the advanced processing strategies for efficient AMLSDP. Furthermore, this survey highlights future directions for researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will advance neurotechnology toward wearable and imaging-based solutions for epilepsy monitoring, serving as a valuable resource for future innovations in this domain.

                arXiv:2505.16716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-47/v1?src=rss">Single-Machine Scheduling with Multi-Criteria and Due- Windows [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This paper investigates the Single-Machine Scheduling Problem under a multi-criteria optimization framework with due-window constraints, a class of NP-hard problems. The research introduces a mathematical formulation that integrates three performance measures—maximum earliness, maximum tardiness, and maximum late work—into a unified scheduling model. The due date of each job is represented as a flexible time interval bounded by minimum and maximum limits, providing a more realistic representation of production and service systems. To address the complexity of the problem, several special cases are analyzed, and a set of dominance rules is proposed to identify efficient sequences that minimize computational effort while maintaining optimality. These rules extend classical sequencing principles such as the Minimum Slack Time and Earliest Due Date rules to multi-objective contexts. So, in Results and Discussion the comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed dominance-based approach provides reliable and efficient solutions consistent with those obtained by the Complete Enumeration Method (CEM), but with significantly reduced computational complexity. The theoretical contributions of this study offer a solid foundation for understanding trade-offs between different scheduling criteria within due-window environments. Practical implications arise in Just-in-Time (JIT) systems, where minimizing both early and late job completions directly impacts cost efficiency and workflow stability. Although the analysis is restricted to a deterministic single-machine setup, the proposed framework can be extended to multi-machine, stochastic, or dynamic scheduling environments. Future research may focus on developing heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms to solve larger instances efficiently. Overall, the study contributes to the advancement of multi-criteria scheduling theory by combining mathematical rigor with practical relevance for real-world manufacturing and service operations.

">Neuronal Toll-like Receptor-4 regulation of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Activity Mediates Dentate Circuit Dysfunction after Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammatory pathways activated by traumatic brain injury (TBI) are critical mediators of long-term neurological dysfunction and represent promising therapeutic targets. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an innate immune receptor, was previously shown to contribute to seizure susceptibility and cognitive deficits in rats after lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying TLR4-mediated circuit dysfunction early after brain injury is not fully understood. In this study, we define a cell- and circuit- specific neuroimmune-extracellular matrix signaling axis that mediates early post-TBI circuit dysfunction in the hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG). Using ex vivo electrophysiology in rat and mouse models one-week after brain injury, we demonstrate that neuronal TLR4 signaling regulates both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to dentate granule cells (DGC). Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 in rats within 24 hours post-injury and cell-type-specific deletion of TLR4 in glutamatergic neurons in mice demonstrated that injury-driven excitatory circuit dysfunction is mediated by neuronal TLR4 and relies on downstream activation of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an enzyme critical for extracellular matrix remodeling. In contrast, TLR4-dependent alterations in inhibitory inputs occurred independent of MMP-9, revealing a mechanistic divergence. Early inhibition of either TLR4 signaling or MMP-9 activity in rats within 24 hours post-injury reduced network hyperexcitability, improved long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus measured in vivo one-week after injury, and attenuated long-term deficits in spatial memory one-month post-injury. Furthermore, we demonstrate a context-dependent role for TLR4 signaling contributing to circuit homeostasis in the uninjured brain and driving circuit dysfunction in the injured brain. Together, these results identify a novel TLR4 -MMP-9 axis as a key driver of early post-TBI dentate gyrus circuit dysfunction and behavioral deficits.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hippocampal Area CA2, with some exceptions, had long been neglected in in vivo studies, due largely to its small size, and in in vitro studies because of its general similarity to CA3 and CA1. Increasing evidence showing that CA2 was molecularly distinct led to the increased appreciation of CA2 as a separate region, and as such, that it likely had functions that were dissimilar from its neighboring CA subfields that were worth studying. Indeed, it was the molecules that are enriched in CA2 that provided inspiration for many of the functional studies. In this article, I provide a personal account of how I got interested in CA2 and describe how I viewed our discoveries in the context of the others in the field. As it happened, much of my earlier work on synaptic plasticity in hippocampus and visual cortex had everything to do with why I felt compelled to ask the question, “are CA2 synapses resistant to long-term potentiation?.” In fact, we are a product of our training and our environment when we are considering research directions.</p>

     alt="The Mechanosensory Subgenual Organ Complex in the Stick Insect Bacillus rossius (Phasmatodea): Neuroanatomy and Functional Morphology"/>
<p>The subgenual organ complex in orthopteroid insects consists of few mechanosensory organs. In the stick insect <i>Bacillus rossius</i>, the subgenual organ and distal organ include ∼70 sensilla, and both organs are located in the hemolymph channel with several connections to the leg cuticle. The neuroanatomy and functional morphology of the sensory organs resemble that of other stick insects and support a shared vibrosensory function. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The subgenual organ complex is an elaborate mechanosensory complex in the insect leg containing chordotonal organs. In stick and leaf insects (Phasmatodea), it includes the subgenual organ and the distal organ. This study documents the neuroanatomy and functional morphology of the subgenual organ complex in the stick insect <i>Bacillus rossius</i> (Bacillidae: Bacillinae) by axonal tracing and micro-computed tomography. It also considers the first report on the subgenual organ complex in stick insects that reported a relatively simple organization of the sensory organ and its nerves on the basis of histological sections. Our findings show the neuroanatomy and nerve pattern of the subgenual organ complex in <i>B. rossius</i> with a subgenual organ and a distal organ. The subgenual organ is placed in the hemolymph channel. The distal organ is also located in the hemolymph channel, and it has several attachment elements, linking it to the cuticle of the tibia, the tibial tracheae, and the subgenual organ. The connections to the tibia may form an input pathway for vibrations transmitted over the cuticle, whereas the position in the hemolymph channel and the connection to the subgenual organ indicate a mechanical activation by vibrations transmitted via the hemolymph. Overall, the axonal tracing preparations document neuroanatomical details for <i>B. rossius</i> and resolve the numbers of sensilla in the sensory organs, the length of the distal organ, and confirm a single nerve branch for the subgenual organ. The data provide support for a consistent organization of the subgenual organ complex within stick insects.</p>

     alt="Changes in Action Potential Properties in the Ferret Prefrontal Cortex During Adolescence"/>
<p>Ferrets have been used as a model and contributed to our scientific knowledge in multiple fields of neuroscience such as visual development, sensory processing, executive function and TBI. Here we describe the electrophysiological changes in neuronal intrinsic properties in the prefrontal cortex of the ferret during the adolescence. We described electrophysiological changes, particularly in spike frequency adaptation, in a span of 3 months.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Ferrets have a gyrencephalic brain with an organization that resembles more to humans than rodents. This animal model has been used in studies of visual cortex development and plasticity, sensory processing, multisensory integration, traumatic brain injury, and decision making. Surprisingly, there is no convention of what defines adulthood in the ferret. Studies have considered ferret adulthood as early as P90 and as late as 2 years. Adolescence is a period of development characterized by physical maturation, risk-taking behavior, and impulsivity. Although physical maturation, including puberty, co-occurs with adolescence, they do not indicate when adulthood is reached. For instance, although puberty in humans is completed by 16–17 years of age, the human brain continues to mature until approximately 23–25 years of age with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) maturing latest. Therefore, the functional maturation of the PFC is proposed to act as a marker of the conversion between adolescence and adulthood. We conducted whole-cell patch clamp of pyramidal neurons (PNs) in Layer 5 from acute slices from the prelimbic cortex portion of ferret medial PFC at three different ages after puberty (P120, P180, and P220). Injected current-firing curves indicate that the amount of current needed to elicit the same number of action potentials (APs) increases between P120 and P220. In addition, we observed an increase in sag amplitude that was accompanied by a reduction in rheobase. Our findings show that excitability of PNs in this region changes between the ages investigated, which suggests that ferret PFC does not mature before P220.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Naturally occurring autoantibodies are commonly considered to be causative of autoimmune diseases or epiphenomena with no known biological impact. Although clinically beneficial autoantibodies have been described, there have been no naturally occurring anti-neuronal antibodies that have been found to be neuroprotective. Here, we identify a recombinant human antibody (TGM-010) derived from a patient with multiple sclerosis (MS) that binds human and mouse neurons, leading to beneficial effects.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>TGM-010 was examined for its ability to be internalized by human and mouse neurons and protect neurons from death in vitro following a stress event. TGM-010 was also injected systemically into a relapsing–remitting model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to examine its ability to impact disease score, extent of demyelination, and neuron frequency.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>TGM-010 demonstrates many novel characteristics including crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and internalizing into neurons. TGM-010 also protects primary mouse neurons from death in vitro. In a mouse model of MS, TGM-010 ameliorates disease severity and is associated with improved neuronal survival.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identified a patient-derived neuron-binding autoantibody that crosses the BBB in mice and reduces neuron loss in a mouse model of MS. These data suggest that the human derived anti-neuronal antibody, TGM-010, may potentially be used to ameliorate neurodegeneration that underlies disability in neurodegenerative conditions.

                Background One billion people worldwide have preventable vision impairment. Ocular morbidities are a significant problem in the public health sector, especially among medical students. The study objectives were to identify the prevailing ocular morbidities and evaluate the risk factors and their impact on students’ lifestyles and academics. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among (Study sample 312) undergraduate medical students over 6 months. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire and analysed to identify the prevalence, associated risk factors, and consequences of ocular morbidities. Results 64.7% were suffering from ocular morbidities. Headache was a predominant symptom in students with (51.7%) and without (39.1%) ocular morbidities. The most common ocular morbidity was myopia (84.3%). 18.7% of students perceived that ocular morbidity had restricted them from participating in activities or applying for specific job posts. The evaluation of various risk factors inferred that ocular morbidity was associated with family history, early age onset of the condition, lighting, inappropriate posture while reading, screen time, and a vitamin A-rich diet. Conclusion The study concluded that the most prevalent ocular morbidity was refractive error, with myopia being the highest among medical students, and it has adversely impacted the students’ lifestyle and academics, underscoring the need for early detection, preventive strategies, and health education interventions.

                Background This article explored the chemical constituents of water and ethanol extracts from the whole body of A. m. jemenitica honeybee drones and workers, investigating their effects on glucose tolerance test (GTT) curves through feeding experiments conducted on Oryctolagus cuniculus male rabbits. Methods Chemical analysis of the extracts was performed using infrared (IR) spectroscopy alongside the spectral database of organic compounds. Results The water extract revealed a richer diversity of natural products (38 compounds) compared to the ethanol extract (12 compounds). Notably, the water extract comprised various bioactive molecules, including sugars and their derivatives, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, quinones, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, and organometallic compounds. In contrast, the ethanol extract primarily contained sugar derivatives, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, and pesticides. The water extract decreased the blood glucose level and transformed the GTT curve from a convex to a concave shape. Conclusion The blood glucose-lowering effect of the water extract may be attributed to the anti-diabetic properties of its dipeptides, phenolic compounds and alkaloid contents.

                The development of smart cities through the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) has accelerated the growth of Southeast Asia’s capital and important cities. However, a growing concern has been how much the intentions of Southeast Asian cities to achieve ‘smart city status’ consider the basic elements of human rights and the provision of essential public services. The first policy recommendation is to acknowledge the vulnerability of the underprivileged, personal security, and social inclusion in governing smart cities to counter the possible derailment of democratic progress in the region. The second recommendation is to have fellow ASEAN member states assist in providing essential public services to avoid a ‘development’ model imposed by external funding stakeholders. The policy brief uses secondary data from 2018 to 2024 on the ASEAN Smart Cities Network projects and identifies civic and social concerns that arose during this period.

                Background Deleterious rhizobacteria (DRB) constitute an emerging category of bioherbicides with the capacity to inhibit weed germination through phytotoxic metabolites. Aim This study aimed to isolate and screen rhizobacteria for deleterious potentials. Bacterial isolation was carried out using the standard pour plating method. Methods Five agricultural crops (cucumber, soybean, sorghum, cowpea and maize) were assayed for phytotoxic screening against the DRB. In addition, antimicrobial potential of the DRB against test pathogens and indole acetic acid (IAA) were also investigated. Polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing of the isolates revealed three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one each of P. fluorescens and E. hormaechei. Results The antimicrobial outcomes of the test DRB revealed broad-spectrum inhibition against the test pathogens. In terms of culture age, younger cultures (≤48 h) mostly stimulated or matched control germination and vigor indices with toxicity increasing progressively with age beyond 120 h for most of the seeds. In the case of steeping duration, short steeping durations (1–2 h) typically maintained germination and vigor near control levels. Progressive extension of steeping time increased inhibition across all isolates. At different inoculum concentrations, higher inoculum concentrations produced stronger inhibitory effects than diluted suspensions. Full-strength inoculum (100%) suppressed vigor drastically, whereas 20–40% dilutions produced diminished or reversible effects. Also, all isolates produced measurable IAA in tryptophan-supplemented media with output increasing with incubation age, correlating with suppression of vigor at later time points. Conclusion The indigenous origin of the DRB evaluated in this study enhances environmental compatibility and reduces ecological disturbance risks.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1148/v2?src=rss">Assessing the diagnostic accuracy of routine hematoxylin and eosin, Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid-Schiff, and Giemsa stains in the detection of Helicobacter pylori in gastric biopsies [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid-Schiff (AB/PAS), and Giemsa stains are routinely used in the histopathological evaluation of gastric biopsies. However, comparative data on their diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness in detecting Helicobacter pylori are limited. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using H&E and AB/PAS as alternatives to Giemsa. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 816 gastric biopsy cases collected between 2019 and 2021. Three slides (H&E, Giemsa, and AB/PAS) were previously prepared from each paraffin-embedded tissue sample and blindly evaluated by three independent examiners. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall diagnostic accuracy were calculated using 2×2 contingency tables. Results >H&E yielded a sensitivity of 51.6%, specificity of 74.4%, and diagnostic accuracy of 66.4% when compared to Giemsa as the reference standard. In comparison, AB/PAS exhibited a sensitivity of 45.9%, specificity of 73.2%, and an accuracy of 63.7%. When evaluating operational factors, H&E emerged as the most cost-effective and fastest method, while AB/PAS was associated with higher costs and longer processing times. Overall, Giemsa consistently demonstrated superior diagnostic performance across the assessed metrics, positioning it as the more reliable choice for H. pylori detection within this comparative framework. Conclusions H&E shows potential for initial screening but its limited sensitivity prevents definitive diagnosis. AB/PAS proved less effective and economical. Giemsa maintained superior diagnostic performance. This study provides a comparative methodological assessment, suggesting H&E and Giemsa combinations could enhance detection efficiency and accuracy. Further prospective validation is needed before clinical implementation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-682/v2?src=rss">Evaluating the Efficiency of Areke Distillation Process Using the Traditional Method of Distillation and Double Pipe Distillation: A Traditional Ethiopian Beverage [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Areke is a popular traditional distilled beverage in semi-urban and rural areas in Ethiopia. Traditional areke distillation uses an open-fire system that consumes a lot of firewood and produces a large amount of indoor air pollution. Methods The areke distiller apparatus (heat exchanger, condenser, energy-efficient stoves, storage tanks, and local areke extraction apparatus) was manufactured by technicians (welders). Different types of grains (wheat, millet, lupine, barley, and maize) were purchased from a neighborhood market. The traditional method of areke fermentation was prepared by an experienced woman brewer using a combination of ingredients and appropriate steps and procedures. The efficacy of a traditional stove, modified stove, and a combination of modified stove and double-pipe were evaluated. The amount of ethanol was estimated by measuring its refractive index and specific gravity. The sensory evaluation of areke samples was conducted by 10 consumer sensory panelists. Result The highest ethanol concentration in areke (53.75 ± 0.01 (% v/v)) was obtained from millet E (dagusa E) in double-pipe distillation (E). The maize E (bekolo E) of overall acceptance had the greatest score (4.5 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. The alcoholic strength of lupine E ( gibeto E) was scored as excellent (5.0 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. All judges agreed that traditional and double-pipe areke consumption was acceptable. The combination of double-pipe distillation and modified stove resulted in a 50% ± 0.15 reduction in the average amount of firewood used. The traditional open fire stove consumed more firewood (5.1 kg ± 0.1) than the combination of double-pipe distillation and modified stove (2.5 kg ± 0.01). Conclusion These results indicate that the combination of double-pipe distillation with a modified stove had better performance than traditional areke distillation.

">Mitochondrial hitch-hiking of Mapt mRNA maintains Tau levels in axons</a></h4>

              
                Hitch-hiking of transcripts on organelles, including mitochondria, has emerged as a common pathway to transport mRNAs into the axon to enable their local translation. However, the extent of mitochondrial mRNA association in vivo has not been established. Here we report the landscape of mitochondrial mRNA association in two nerve tissues, the retinal ganglion cell derived optic nerve and the motor neuron derived part of the sciatic nerve. This revealed astonishing tissue diversity between mitochondria associated mRNAs that can partly be explained by the lack of expression of the mitochondrially anchored RNA-binding protein SYNJ2a in motor neurons. This diversity led us to discover that also MAPT mRNA, encoding the axon-enriched microtubule associated protein Tau, is transported via the mitochondrial RNA anchoring complex SYNJ2a/SYNJ2BP into axons of glutamatergic neurons. Loss of SYNJ2BP prevents axonal localization of MAPT and miss-sorting of Tau, consequently stunting axonal growth in cultured hippocampal neurons. This connects mitochondrial transport to the maintenance of the local cytoskeleton and axonal growth in glutamatergic neurons.

">Episodic memory consolidation by reactivation of human concept neurons during sleep reflects contents, not sequence of events</a></h4>

              
                How do our brains manage to store our everyday experiences into memory? Neurons in the human temporal lobe that respond to the concept of an individual person or object have been shown to provide the semantic building blocks for episodic memory. Recording from 1433 neurons in neurosurgical patients who learned a story involving specific concepts, we found reactivation of neurons representing these concepts during slow-wave sleep after learning. Concept neurons were conjointly reactivated, particularly during sharp-wave ripples, with time lags suitable for synaptic modification. However, the temporal sequence of reactivation did not reflect the sequence of concepts in the learned story. Unlike rodent place cells, which can acquire preferred firing locations during exploration of new environments according to their pre-existing preferred sequence of activation, human concept neurons are tuned to specific semantic contents before learning starts. Consequently, pre-existing firing sequences correlate with consecutive place fields in rodents, but not with sequences of events in human experience. Thus, in contrast to reactivation of rodent place cells, reactivation of human concept cells does not reflect sequences of events in human experience.

">Simultaneous EEG-fMRI investigation of sound sequence processing in human neonates</a></h4>

              
                The ability to detect sensory regularities and their violations (i.e. deviance) is fundamental for learning and the orientation of attention across the lifespan. This starts from the prenatal period, where the environment is rich in regular patterns and deviations of auditory stimulation which likely provides the basis for the emergence of early learning capacities. Following birth, EEG recordings of brain activity have demonstrated that neonates detect violations of regularity and show a robust mismatch response to deviant auditory stimuli. However, it is unknown how this processing is integrated across wider regions within emergent brain networks. To gain comprehensive insight into both the temporal and spatial properties of the processing underlying sensory deviance detection in the neonatal brain, we acquired simultaneous EEG and fMRI data in sleeping neonates during an auditory oddball paradigm. A mismatch response was identified with EEG when a deviant sound appeared after a sequence of identical sounds but not when a sound was omitted, suggesting encoding of deviances that violated local sequence regularity, but not global sequence structure. Simultaneous fMRI demonstrated engagement of distributed cortical networks during sound sequence processing, encompassing temporal, sensori-motor, and inferior frontal cortices, as well as subcortical regions including the thalamus and hippocampus. Deviance detection was associated with activity in the superior and ventromedial (hippocampus and parahippocampus) parts of the temporal lobe, and the precentral gyrus. Together, these findings suggest that neonatal brain detects deviance in sound sequences through the encoding of local regularities, supported by distinct processing pathways within sensory and limbic systems. These insights help advance our understanding of early auditory learning mechanisms, with implications for understanding how atypical developmental trajectories may emerge in these substrates.

">A normative account of human temporal structure learning</a></h4>

              
                People rapidly recalibrate their expectations about the world in the face of surprising observations. This recalibration should depend on the temporal structure of the environment, however how people should and do learn temporal structures remains unknown. To examine this gap, we developed a Bayesian model that infers temporal structure of the environment directly from observations and makes accurate predictions across qualitatively different environments. We tested predictions of our model in an online behavioral study in which participants predicted outcomes generated according to various temporal structures, and demonstrated that people learned to exploit these structures in a qualitatively similar manner to that of our structure learning model. Furthermore, we show that normative structure learning accounts for puzzling asymmetries previously observed in sequential effects of temporal structures on human learning. Taken together our model and empirical data provide the first general account of how people use temporal structures to interpret unexpected observations in the service of learning.

">The Caudate Nucleus Exhibits Distinct Pathology and Cell Type-Specific Responses Across Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid-beta presence in the caudate nucleus (Ca) partially defines Thal stage III in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about AD's cellular impact on the region. Leveraging a public basal ganglia taxonomy of cellular populations, we generated a cellular-resolution atlas of AD-associated pathological changes in Ca. Unlike cortex, we found that Ca AD pathology is dominated by two key features: phosphorylated tau (pTau)-containing neuropil threads enriched near oligodendrocytes in white matter tracts and amyloid-beta diffuse plaques enriched in gray matter. Although AD pathology in affected cortical regions results in neuronal loss, we find no AD-driven reductions in neuron proportions in Ca. However, there were observable changes in multiple cellular populations. Protoplasmic astrocytes and FLT1+/IL1B+ microglia increased in abundance with global pTau levels. We also observe gene expression changes in fast-spiking PTHLH-PVALB interneurons indicative of disrupted signaling pathways and altered intrinsic physiological properties. This work provides a cellular-resolution framework for understanding AD pathology in Ca.

">Abnormal neuronal and synaptic morphology in Down syndrome brains reproduces in 2D and 3D human cellular models</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome (DS) is the most common autosomal aneuploidy compatible with postnatal survival and is caused by full or partial trisomy of chromosome 21. In this study, human isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into 2D neurons and cortico-striatal assembloids (hCSAs). Aberrant neuronal morphology was observed: trisomic (T21) neurons formed aggregates of cell bodies interconnected with thick neurite bundles radiating outwards, connected and overlapped with other neurons in between the bundles while disomic (D21) neurons were evenly distributed across the surface and formed strong neuronal networks. Detailed analysis revealed significantly shorter neurites with larger diameter, fewer branches, and fewer terminal points in T21 neurons compared to D21 neurons in both 2D cultures and hCSAs. We observed similar phenotypes in foetal and postnatal human brain tissue. Furthermore, we observed aberrant mitochondrial morphology with an excess of some mitochondrial proteins (AIF, TOMM20) and significantly lower expression of synaptic markers (SYN-1, PSD95 and GEPH) throughout in vitro differentiation of T21 neurons. Finally, our data showed that T21 spheroids were significantly smaller throughout differentiation compared to D21 spheroids. T21 spheroids also exhibited significantly higher expression of neural stem cells (SOX2), significantly lower expression of proliferating cells (Ki67) and significantly higher expression of apoptotic cells (CCaspase-3). Overall, our study demonstrates that trisomy 21 leads to aberrant neuronal morphology in both 2D neurons and hCSAs, consistent with observations in the human brain.

">Gonadal and sex chromosomal contributions to sex differences in mammalian brain organization</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in brain development may contribute to well-known sex differences in behavior and neuropsychiatric risk - making it important to comprehensively map and mechanistically annotate normative sex differences in brain organization. Most sex differences in mammalian brain organization have previously been attributed to differential effects of gonadal hormones based on outcomes from rodent endocrine manipulations at canonical subcortical foci of male-biased brain volume. However, a systematic quantification of both gonadal and sex chromosome dosage (SCD) contributions across all regions of sex-biased brain volume has been lacking. Here, using structural neuroimaging scans from wild-type (n=670) and transgenic mice that dissociate gonadal, X-, and Y-chromosome effects (n=181), we show that: many more brain regions are volumetrically sex-biased than previously recognized; gonadal effects dominate throughout this expanded map of sex differences; several regions also show prominent SCD contributions to anatomical sex differences, which can both reinforce or counteract gonadal effects in a regionally specific manner. Targeted single nucleus RNA sequencing at a region of female-biased cerebellar volume reveals that combined gonadal and SCD effects also drive sex-biased cellular gene expression. These findings revise our understanding of the spatial distribution and causal basis of sex-differences in the mammalian brain, illuminating a key axis of biological variation in health and disease.

">Repeatable, low-drift recordings in behaving non-human primates using flexible microelectrodes</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiological recordings from non-human primates (NHPs) have traditionally relied on rigid microelectrode arrays made from stainless steel or silicon. While these devices enable high-quality recordings, a fundamental mechanical mismatch between rigid materials and soft brain tissue leads to inflammation, gliosis, and signal instability. In particular, brain micromotion causes continuous drifting of neurons relative to fixed electrodes, compromising single-unit tracking during both chronic and acute recordings. Flexible, penetrating electrodes offer a promising solution, but their adoption in NHPs has been hindered by the technical challenges of delivering ultra-thin polymers through thick dura mater. Here, we demonstrate a comprehensive approach for acute, repeated recordings in awake, behaving NHPs using flexible arrays. We fabricated a microelectrode array that spans cortical layers with 32 cellular-scale recording sites embedded in 7 m-thick parylene-C. We developed a novel "telescopic" insertion method that combines concentric guide tubes with a retractable microwire shuttle. Our technique is compatible with standard chronic recording chambers and allowed for repeated penetration of free-floating arrays through intact dura over weeks without the need for a new craniotomy. Across two awake rhesus macaques, we optimized the electrode geometry and insertion procedure to achieve an 80% single-unit recording success rate. As animals performed an oculomotor delayed response task, we recorded task-responsive neurons from prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex with stable single-unit activity throughout 1-2-hour behavioral sessions. Critically, by comparing our flexible arrays to rigid probes in the same animals and recording chambers, we provide quantitative evidence that flexible electrodes reduce total single-unit drift from hundreds to tens of microns. Our work establishes flexible microelectrode arrays as a practical, dependable technology for NHP neuroscience and paves the way toward long-term, ultra-stable neurophysiology in large animal models.

">Developmental scarcity induces sex differences in social recognition and CA2 perineuronal nets</a></h4>

              
                Early-life adversity has a lasting negative impact on social behavior in both humans and rodents. Sex differences exist in functional outcomes of postnatal stress, but underlying mechanisms remain incompletely explored. Using the limited bedding and nesting paradigm, a mouse model of developmental scarcity, we found sex differences in social behavior with adult males showing impaired social recognition and adult females showing intact social recognition with enhanced social novelty preference. Perineuronal nets, specialized extracellular matrix structures, are known to inhibit developmental plasticity and are concentrated in the CA2 region of the hippocampus in adulthood. We found higher intensity of CA2 perineuronal nets in adult males, but not adult females, after early life adversity. Focal degradation of the extracellular matrix in the CA2 region restored social recognition function in adult males previously subjected to early stress, suggesting that the effects of developmental adversity may be overcome by targeted intervention in adulthood.

">Multimodal Imaging-Based Targeting Approach for Network-Level Brain Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neural network effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are poorly understood. Here, we introduce an empirically informed, multimodal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based framework suited for guiding stimulation target selection and hypothesis-based data analysis in focal tDCS-fMRI studies. Methods: We illustrate our approach using data of 37 healthy individuals (19 females; mean +/- SD age = 25.8 +/- 5.9) recruited from a multicenter tDCS-fMRI study (www.memoslap.de/en/home/). Participants completed resting-state (RS- and task-fMRI (object-location memory, OLM, or associative picture-pseudoword learning, APPL, experiments) with placebo tDCS. Seed-based RS data analysis identified the functional networks originating from project-specific target regions for focal tDCS (right occipito-temporal cortex, rOTC; left ventral IFG, lvIFG) and also established their test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Dice coefficients analyzed the overlap between the seeded RS- and task-evoked networks. This aimed to identify task-active regions potentially affected by downstream neural network effects from the target regions. Results: Seed-based analyses identified two highly reliable ventral visual-limbic (rOTC) and language-related networks (lvIFG), with >72-77% of voxels showing good-to-excellent TRR (ICC >/=; 0.75). Only a subset of voxels identified by the RS analyses overlapped with activity elicited by the experimental paradigms (ranging from 7-55%), with larger correspondence for the OLM task (Dice OLM: 0.249-0.349; APPL 0.112-0.121). Therefore, the degree of potential tDCS network effects varied substantially depending on the target region, the extent of its functional network and task-specific activity patterns. Degree of correspondence was further mediated by the selected contrasts-of-interest in the task-based analyses, with more conservative control conditions resulting in reduced overlap. Conclusion: We established a principled, multimodal fMRI framework bridging a critical gap in neuromodulation research. By integrating reliable intrinsic connectivity maps with task-evoked activity patterns, we provide a method to prospectively identify network-level targets for focal brain stimulation and to generate hypotheses for data analyses in tDCS-fMRI studies. This approach paves the way for investigating modulation of specific functional networks, shifting the rationale from stimulating an isolated brain region to strategically targeting key nodes within a predefined functional pathway.

">Body and brain signalling during naturalistic learning situations</a></h4>

              
                A central challenge in supporting learning and designing learning environments is to understand individual differences in learning experiences. However, despite growing interest in examining learning experiences in naturalistic contexts, studies employing multimethod and hyperscanning approaches remain scarce. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) were combined to measure brain activity, heart rate, and heart rate variability simultaneously during authentic learning situations in aviation and forestry. We investigated how students and instructors cardiac and brain activity varied across different phases of a naturalistic learning situation and tasks with varying levels of difficulty. Results indicate that both students and instructors heart rate, heart rate variability, and brain activity vary systematically across behaviourally and pedagogically meaningful phases of the learning situation. These findings enhance our understanding of how physiological and neural activity vary within and across individuals during learning, providing insight into the nervous system determinants underlying individual differences in learning experiences.

">3D Light Sheet Microscopy Reveals Aging Osteoarthritis-associated Joint-innervated Nerve Remodeling in Mouse Knee Joints</a></h4>

              
                Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent age related joint disease-causing chronic pain. This study investigated how nociceptive and sympathetic nerve innervation in the mouse knee joint changes with age and OA progression, and how these changes relate to pain and disease severity. Methods: Thirty-eight mice were assigned to four groups: young male (My), aged male (Ma), young female (Fy), and aged female (Fa). Pain sensitivity was evaluated via Pressure Application Measurement (PAM), and joint damage was graded using OARSI scoring. CGRP and PIEZO2 expressions in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were also assessed. We employed iDISCO tissue clearing and 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize total (PGP9.5), nociceptive (CGRP), and sympathetic (TH) nerve fibers in anterior regions of mouse knee joints. A MATLAB-based tool quantified nerve architecture. Results: The Ma group displayed the highest OA severity and markedly lower mechanical withdrawal thresholds compared with My, suggesting an age effect on pain-related behavior. This phenotype was accompanied by a higher total PGP9.5; nerve fiber density in the knee joint and increased CGRP nociceptive innervation. In contrast, female mice showed no age-dependent change in PAM withdrawal thresholds, consistent with preserved cartilage integrity and stable OARSI scores, and no detectable age-related differences in PGP9.5; or CGRP; innervation. The TH; sympathetic fiber distribution was comparable across sexes and ages. Consistent with joint-level findings, DRG analyses demonstrated increased CGRP and PIEZO2 expression in the Ma group, whereas females exhibited no significant change. Conclusion: Enhanced nociceptive but not sympathetic nerve remodeling in knee cavities is associated with increased OA severity and knee pain in the Ma group. These findings emphasize the role of peripheral sensory plasticity in OA pain and demonstrate the value of 3D imaging for visualizing neuroanatomical changes in joint disorders.

">Autocrine feedback maintains homeostatic neuropeptide expression in a peptidergichub neuron</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal circuits sustain stable function by self-regulating their gene expression and neurosecretion. Patterns for autocrine feedback by neuropeptides are widespread across nervous systems, but how they contribute to neuronal homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an autocrine homeostatic mechanism in a C. elegans peptidergic hub neuron. FLP-1 neuropeptide release activates the inhibitory receptor DMSR-7 on the AVK hub neurons to self-regulate flp-1 transcription, dense-core vesicle accumulation, and peptide secretion. We show that a parallel PDF-1/PDFR-1 pathway drives flp-1 expression, establishing a "push-and-pull" peptidergic feedback on the AVK neurons. AVK's peptidergic output also depends on the number of FLP-1 peptides encoded in its precursor, revealing a dosage mechanism in behavioral regulation. Moreover, flp-1 expression coordinates transcript levels of additional neuropeptides in AVK. These findings uncover FLP-1 as a self-regulating homeostatic controller within a peptidergic hub neuron and illustrate how precursor-encoded redundancy supports stable yet adaptable circuit states.

">Emergent critical oscillations in motor cortex of Parkinson's patients</a></h4>

              
                The dynamical state of cortical neural activity constrains the complexity of functions it can perform. A marginally stable dynamical state - called criticality - is thought to be beneficial for brain functions that require multiple time scales, broad dynamic range, and large information storage and transmission. A growing body of evidence suggests that criticality is a feature of healthy brain dynamics, but breaks down in certain brain disorders. Here we ask whether Parkinson's disease incurs deviation from criticality compared to healthy controls. We analyze human resting state EEG activity in primary motor cortex. Parkinson's patients exhibit prominent oscillatory brain activity in multiple frequency bands (low delta and high theta) that is not present in controls. Surprisingly, we find that these emergent oscillations are close to criticality, i.e., amplitude fluctuations with approximate temporal scale invariance. We compare traditional signatures of criticality and more principled measurements of proximity to criticality using our new approach based on temporal renormalization group theory and information theory. Our new approach and traditional methods agree, demonstrating that critical dynamics are not always healthy; Parkinson's disease is associated with the emergence of near-critical oscillations in motor cortex.

">Harmonizing the stimulation dose of focal tDCS across target sites</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive brain stimulation is an established tool for modulating neural activity that holds promise for advancing both cognitive neuroscience and clinical interventions. Focal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), using center-surround electrode montages, enables more region-specific targeting. Although computational models can simulate individual electric fields, no existing approach enables the prospective individualization of electrode placement while standardizing the dose across targeted brain regions. In the current preparatory methodological study, we present a modeling-based framework that harmonizes the electric field strength between different target regions at the group level, but preserves inter-individual variability. This enables systematic examination of dose-response relationships and their regional differences. Positioning of the center-surround electrode montages is individualized to ensure focusing of the electric field on the target regions. We started by defining brain targets for eight cognitive and motor functions using MRI data from 43 participants. Using field simulations, we then estimated a group-average field strength in the target regions that had led to behavioral and physiological effects in prior tDCS studies (resulting in 0.2 V/m). The radii of the center-surround montages were optimized for each target region to achieve the intended field strength while maximizing focality. Validation in an independent sample (n=53) confirmed that the intended target field strength is achieved on average for new participants. The described computational tools are made available as open-source software, allowing other researchers to apply our individualization framework with parameters (target regions and target field strengths) tailored to their specific research questions; and are currently being implemented in a multi-center study involving approximately 1,000 datasets.

">When Velocity Becomes Position: Proprioceptive Contributions to State Estimation</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we investigate the relative contributions of positional- and velocity-based proprioceptive feedback to state estimation when visual feedback of the hand is unavailable. We performed a virtual reality experiment in which healthy human participants (N = 22) completed two tasks: a continuous target-tracking task and a sequential reaching task. In both cases, visual feedback of the hand position was withheld, except for a brief moment, during which an offset to the left or right was sometimes applied. By analysing the movement path following the offset visual feedback and comparing it to the non-offset condition, we can infer the extent to which the brain relies on rate-of-change feedback compared to absolute positional feedback for estimating the hand position. We compare and contrast our empirical data with simulated movements from a computational model based on Bayesian sensory integration under varied assumptions of the reliance on positional and velocity-based cues. Our human and simulated data together indicate a heavy reliance on velocity-based proprioceptive feedback, as movement offsets induced by biased visual feedback decay slowly during both target tracking and sequential reaching tasks. The eventual convergence between offset and non-offset trials demonstrates that absolute positional information is incorporated, albeit at a slow rate.

">Low-grade inflammation in obesity causes low-effort food choice</a></h4>

              
                Inflammation relates to decreased effortful behaviour and altered effort-related responses in brain regions, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Inflammation is prevalent in obesity, but its effects on effortful versus more convenient food choices are unknown. We investigated the role of low-grade inflammation in effortful food choice using functional MRI in a cross-sectional study (n=150 women, BMI>27 kg/m2) and a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n=59 women, BMI>30 kg/m2, CRP>3 mg/L; colchicine 0.5 mg/d vs. placebo). Inflammation was related to less high-effort choices (OR=0.27, p=0.004) and higher effort-related dmPFC signal ({beta}=0.23, p=0.025, Rpartial2=0.039), and mediated the association between BMI and dmPFC signal. Colchicine decreased systemic inflammation (i.e. INFLA-score) as expected ({beta}=-0.10 SD, p<0.001, Rpartial2=0.030), increased high-effort choices (OR=1.32, p=0.044), and marginally decreased effort-related dmPFC signal ({beta}=-0.13, p=0.053, Rpartial2=0.037). These findings show a causal role for inflammation in choosing convenience foods in obesity via increased effort aversion and associated dmPFC processing.

                <p>Bimanual coordination, fundamental to human motor control, typically involves the execution of different functions by the two limbs (e.g., opening a jar). Previous research has largely investigated bimanual control through simple coordination tasks in which the limbs perform similar movements (e.g., finger tapping); however, few studies have specifically examined coordination when the two limbs perform different yet complementary functions. In the current study, participants performed point-to-point movements of a rectangular cursor, where one limb controlled cursor trajectory and the other rotated a knob to match a target orientation. Participants (<I>N</I> = 116, 76 female, 1 nonbinary; 92% right-handed) were divided into four groups and completed the task with a visual feedback gain perturbation (an increase or decrease) applied either to the cursor trajectory or orientation. Our results showed rapid adaptation to perturbations of visual feedback of the movement trajectory, affecting both the perturbed limb controlling the trajectory and the unperturbed limb controlling the orientation. Conversely, perturbation to the visual orientation feedback primarily only influenced the perturbed limb controlling orientation, with minimal impact on movement trajectory metrics. Importantly, these results were independent of reaching amplitude, duration, and limb dominance. In addition, we assessed the temporal coordination between the two limbs and found that perturbations in visual trajectory feedback led to significant changes in limb coordination, whereas no notable difference was observed for perturbations of orientation. These findings indicate asymmetries in bimanual motor recalibration dependent on the perturbed aspect of visual feedback (orientation vs trajectory), suggesting differences in underlying neural mechanisms and interhemispheric communication.</p>

                <p>Alpha peak frequency (APF) is defined as a prominent spectral peak within the 8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz frequency range. Typically, an individual's alpha frequency is regarded as a stable neurophysiological marker. A wealth of recent evidence, however, indicates that APF shifts within short timescales in relation to task demands and even spontaneously so. Further, brain stimulation studies often report shifts in APF both within and between experimental sessions, directly contradicting the idea of a stable APF. To characterize the nonstationarities in spectral parameters, we estimated APFs from 1&nbsp;s epochs of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from healthy adults of either sex. To enhance signal-to-noise ratio, without compromising on temporal resolution, we averaged power spectra within parcelled regions. Our findings indicate that variation in APFs exacerbates along the posterior-to-anterior cortical plane, i.e., from the occipital to the frontal cortices. Further, by comparisons with amplitude-matched simulated signals, we demonstrated that the observed gradient is not attributable to measurement noise. Across the cortex, APFs showed poor temporal reliability, raising the question of whether APFs are more like a transient state than a trait. In general, our study elucidates the dynamic characteristics of alpha oscillations and reveals systematic regional differences which are, in part, shaped by underlying signal-to-noise ratio inherent to MEG recordings.</p>

<p>The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has widespread expression in the avian retina. Immuno-electron microscopy reveals its localization to synapses in the inner plexiform layer. In vitro pharmacological inhibition of CFTR increases spontaneous quantal event frequency. Thus, CFTR activity is linked to synaptic transmission in retinal neurons.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Protein function is influenced by multiple factors including cell type and subcellular localization. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is well investigated in epithelial tissues, where life threatening symptoms stem from its dysfunction. A postsynaptic neuronal role was previously established by the Gleason lab where CFTR regulation of cytosolic Cl<sup>–</sup> in retinal amacrine cells was shown. Other work from our lab showed that disruption of the synaptic vesicle cycle reduced action of CFTR, suggesting CFTR associates with synaptic vesicles. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that CFTR localizes to the synapse with possible presynaptic function. To address this, the cellular and subcellular CFTR localization in mature chicken retina was examined using fluorescence light microscopy and immunogold-labeled transmission electron microscopy. CFTR labeling was detected throughout the retina, including photoreceptor outer segments and in the mitochondria rich region of the photoreceptor inner segment termed the ellipsoid. Synaptic labeling was found in both synaptic plexiform layers, pre-and post-synaptically. A subset of amacrine cells were strongly labeled and labeling was also found in Müller cells and in axons of the nerve fiber layer. Addressing whether the activity of CFTR plays a role in presynaptic function, amacrine cells were recorded using the whole cell voltage clamp method. Spontaneous postsynaptic quantal currents were recorded and found to increase in frequency upon pharmacological inhibition of CFTR suggesting that under normal circumstances, CFTR serves to limit the rate of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion. This work provides evidence CFTR might have multiple functions in the retina including synaptic transmission regulation.</p>

     alt="Myelitis-Predominant Aggressive Phenotype: Unveiling Unique Patterns of Late-Onset Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to compare clinical features and prognosis of late-onset neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (LO-NMOSD, onset age ≥60 years) with adult-onset NMOSD (AO-NMOSD, onset age 18–59 years), and to provide insights for individualized management in elderly patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 748 patients with NMOSD (diagnosed according to the 2015 International Panel for NMO Diagnosis criteria) in the China National Registry of Neuro-Inflammatory Diseases (CNRID) were analyzed. Patients were stratified into AO-NMOSD (18–59 years, n = 617) and LO-NMOSD (≥ 60 years, n = 131). Demographics, clinical manifestations, imaging, treatments, and outcomes were compared using appropriate statistical methods including Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>LO-NMOSD showed distinct traits: a lower female predominance (76.34% vs 86.55%), higher transverse myelitis (TM) incidence at onset (57.36% vs 40.17%), elevated annualized relapse rate (ARR; 0.52 ± 0.03 vs 0.38 ± 0.01), and accelerated disability (median Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 4.75 vs 3.0). TM-predominant relapses (39 of 45, 86.67% in LO vs 96 of 148, 64.86% in AO) contributed significantly to disability. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed LO-NMOSD had a higher risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.932, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.427–2.615), disability (HR = 3.192, 95% CI = 1.932–5.274) and reaching visual acuity (VA) ≤20 of 30 (HR = 3.523, 95% CI = 1.585–7.828). Cox regression confirmed that onset age ≥60 years was an independent risk factor for relapse (HR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.60–2.59), disability (HR = 3.16, 95% CI = 2.14–4.62), and reaching VA ≤20 of 30 (HR 3.26, 95% CI = 1.83–5.48).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>LO-NMOSD is characterized by myelitis-predominance with recurrent spinal cord involvement, high risk of relapses, and severe disability. It thus underscores the need for heightened clinical attention, with rigorous monitoring that balance safety and efficacy for elderly patients with NMOSD. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>De novo mutations in the syntaxin-binding protein 1 (STXBP1), encoded by <i>STXBP1</i>, are among the most prevalent causes of variable neurodevelopmental disorders, including epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay, and movement disorders. Although STXBP1 has been proposed as a critical presynaptic protein controlling synaptic vesicle exocytosis, clinical phenotypes also suggest that its biological function could be more diverse.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The expression pattern of STXBP1 was studied using immunostaining <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Synaptosome isolation was performed to investigate the synaptic and non-synaptic localization of STXBP1 in the brain. STXBP1 immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (MS) was conducted to identify protein complexes interacting with STXBP1. Cre-in utero electroporation (IUE) was done on <i>Stxbp1</i>
<sup>F/F</sup> mice to generate an <i>in vivo</i> knockout (KO) cellular model for studying the <i>in vivo</i> function of STXBP1.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that STXBP1 expression in the cerebral cortex was developmentally regulated and was detected in neuronal soma and processes. STXBP1 was in both the synaptic and cytosolic fractions, interacting with neuronal cytoskeleton and membrane periodic structures. Interestingly, sparse <i>Stxbp1</i> KO in the mouse forebrain led to cell-autonomous cell death, which was rescued by either wild-type STXBP1 or pathogenic mutants. However, <i>Stxbp1</i> KO neurons rescued by pathogenic mutants exhibited impaired dendritic growth. Our results also showed that STXBP1 interacted with alpha II Spectrin and ARPC2 and is required for their localization on the neuronal membrane.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest that STXBP1 has diverse functions in the nervous system and regulates the trafficking of membrane cytoskeleton proteins in the brain. ANN NEUROL 2025 ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Evidence linking modifiable risk factors to age-related brain diseases, such as dementia, stroke, and depression (DSD), is robust, yet limited regarding long-term change in modifiable risk factors in association with these conditions, particularly in real-world settings. This study aimed to assess whether longitudinal changes in modifiable brain health risk factors were associated with reduced risk of DSD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed UK Biobank data (2006–2019) from 155,469 participants with general practitioner-linked data. The Brain Care Score (BCS) assesses 12 modifiable risk factors across lifestyle, physical, and social–emotional domains. Longitudinal BCS measurements were derived from repeated general practitioner (GP)-recorded measurements. Changes in the BCS were modeled using linear mixed-effects models, and associations with DSD were evaluated using multivariable Cox models, adjusting for baseline BCS and genetic risk (polygenic risk scores for stroke and depression, and <i>APOE</i> genotype for dementia).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 155,469 participants (median age = 51 years, 54.3% women), the median annual BCS change was 0.14 (Q1–Q3 = 0.008–0.30) points over a median follow-up of 12.3 years (Q1–Q3 = 11.5–13.1 years). Over time, 82.1% improved their BCS, 12.9% remained stable, and 5.0% worsened over time. Each 1-point annual increase in the BCS was associated with 4% lower risk of incident age-related brain diseases (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–0.97).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this large real-world cohort, improvements in modifiable risk factor profiles were associated with lower incidence of DSD, regardless of genetic risk or baseline BCS. Our results provide important information for communicating with patients about the brain health benefits of improving risk factor profiles. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Background Academic integrity is presented as a complex, multidimensional concept that involves all members of an educational institution. However, non-teaching staff members are often excluded from research on academic integrity. I engaged in professional support alongside academic staff to explore how academic integrity is understood within the Mauritius branch of a UK higher education institution. Methods I adopted a qualitative approach to engage those tasked with implementing academic integrity to examine how they understood and practised it. Data were gathered through face-to-face focus-group interviews, which were translated into themes. Results This article identified the factors that make academic integrity challenging and presents recommendations for practitioners and researchers. Conclusions More energy should be invested in the processes that build cultures of integrity rather than focusing on the opposite, such as cheating, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic integrity is ultimately a positive values-driven approach to learning and a skill that can be developed and strengthened.

                Background The study of algebraic structures through graph-theoretic representations provides a powerful visual and combinatorial framework for analyzing ring-theoretic properties. The ideal-based non-zero divisor graph ∅ I ( Z n ) , constructed from the ring of integers modulo n with respect to a proper ideal I . This graph extends the classical zero-divisor graph framework and serves as a visual and structural invariant for analyzing ideal interactions in finite commutative rings. Methods Using combinatorial graph theory and modular arithmetic, we analyze fundamental properties of ∅ I ( Z n ) . Vertex degrees, connectivity, and cut-sets are characterized using divisibility conditions and the Euler totient function ϕ ( n ) . The analysis distinguishes cases based on the parity and primality of n , as well as the generator of I . Topological indices, including the Zagreb and Randić indices, are formulated to quantify structural complexity. Results We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the connectivity of ∅ I ( Z n ) , proving it is connected for all n ≥ 10 and any non-zero proper ideal I . For prime n ∉ { 2 , 3 } , the graph is shown to be complete. General formulas are provided for calculating vertex degrees based on gcd ( x , d ) where I = < d > . Furthermore, the structure and computation cut-sets are characterized for Z p 2 and composite n = xy . Moreover, the domination number γ ( ∅ I ( Z n ) )=1 and girth gr ( ∅ I ( Z n ) )=3 is established for n ≥ 10 . General expressions for Zagreb and Randić indices are derived, directly linking graph invariants to n and d . Conclusions The graph ∅ I ( Z n ) serves as an effective combinatorial invariant for studying the interplay between ideals and zero-divisor structure in Z n . These results establish systematic connections between ring-theoretic properties and graph parameters, enabling both qualitative and quantitative analysis through connectivity, degree distributions, cut-sets, and topological indices.

                Recognizing and appreciating the diversity of people around the world is a necessary step in achieving equality for all. The opening of equitable chances for society as a whole is one of the ways in which libraries contribute to the reduction of the exclusion gap. Despite their expanding relevance, institutions like libraries demonstrate inconsistent patterns of integration and research. This literature analysis aimed to examine the methods employed by public libraries to foster social inclusion across various populations from 2014 to 2024. A comprehensive literature review was performed, identifying n = 69 interventions that fulfilled the inclusion criteria according to PRISMA methodological principles. The findings indicate a necessity for collaboration between libraries and other organizations to enhance their effectiveness in promoting social inclusion. The findings underscore the necessity of adopting a comprehensive perspective on inclusion in libraries, which encompasses an examination of infrastructure and participation in physical spaces, as well as additional aspects and dimensions, integrating both physical and digital inclusion.

                Background Female teachers working in conflict and displacement settings are both crisis survivors and crisis responders, nurturing learning, stability, and hope and experiencing trauma, economic insecurity and systemic neglect. Their lived experiences and coping systems remain under-documented and undervalued. This review is a synthesis of multi-regional findings to shed light on the interaction of gender, precarity, and resilience on the development of professional and psychosocial pathways of women teachers during and after conflict. Methods This narrative systematic review was done using PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Thirty-four primary studies and several secondary sources in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Eastern Europe were reviewed. Results Female teachers were subjected to the greatest instability and trauma, with post-traumatic stress (22-35%), burnout (40-70%), and acute psychological distress (over 70% under active crises) being the most prominent. The chronic attrition and “brain waste” were caused by structural deprivation in the form of salary arrears, invalidation of credential, and exclusion to continuous professional development (CPD). Relational and spiritual resilience were found to be strong buffers despite these limitations. Burnout was reduced by peer networks, faith-based coping and community support and agency was restored. Online and physical CPD programs in Kakuma, Lebanon and Ukraine assisted displaced women to maintain teaching identity and re-credential after displacement. Teacher Stability Index (TSI) showed that there was universal low interdependence resilience (0.50). Conclusion Women educators in conflict and displacement situations represent paradox: they perpetuate the educational process and survive the trauma and structural marginalization. It would take systematic reform to identify them as professionals in humanitarian work, rather than as a fringe volunteer. Some of the priority interventions are listed as the stabilization of salaries, transnational credential recognition, survivor-focused protection against GBV, and the scaling of culturally grounded and peer-based resilience networks.

                Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women is frequent, yet distinguishing benign from malignant causes remains clinically challenging. Endometrial thickness (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is well established in postmenopausal bleeding but less validated in premenopausal women due to cyclical variations. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of ET, supplemented by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, in predicting endometrial malignancy among premenopausal women with AUB. Methods We conducted a retrospective analytical study including premenopausal women presenting with AUB at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia (2016–2024). All underwent TVUS followed by endometrial sampling (hysteroscopy or curettage) and definitive histological confirmation on hysterectomy specimens. Sonographic features were described using International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) criteria. Diagnostic performance of ET was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan-Meir survival analysis was applied to time-to-consultation and time-to-diagnosis, not survival outcomes. Results ROC analysis identified ET as the strongest predictor of endometrial malignancy (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.001). An optimal cutoff of >9 mm achieved 69.2% sensitivity, 87.1% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97.7%, effectively ruling out malignancy in patients with ET ≤9 mm. Although the positive predictive value was modest (26.5%), ET reliably stratified risk for further invasive evaluation. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that ET >9 mm was associated with earlier consultation (mean 27.7 vs. 70.3 months, p < 0.0001) and shorter time-to-diagnosis (median 12 months vs. not reached, p < 0.0001), reflecting a more aggressive clinical course. Conclusions ET >9 mm is a robust, non-invasive potential prognostic marker in premenopausal AUB, identifying high-risk women requiring urgent evaluation while safely excluding malignancy in low-risk patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1192/v5?src=rss">Conceptualizing a model to study university students’ food choices based on the theory of planned behavior [version 5; peer review: 5 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Higher education at the university level is essential for advanced learning, enhancing academic knowledge, and precipitating significant life changes. These include lifestyle adjustments, relocation from one’s primary residence, and the acquisition of autonomy in decision-making. Numerous students opt to reside in dormitories/hostels, resulting in notable alterations in dietary habits. Food habits at campus differ substantially from their previous domestic diets, potentially influencing their overall growth and development during their academic tenure. Method The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize a model and understand university students’ food choices, utilizing qualitative research and a phenomenological approach. Snowball sampling selected 26 undergraduate and postgraduate students from technical and health science programs at a private university in Udupi, who were residing on campus for two to four years. Online interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results Transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to identify themes, which were subsequently conceptualized to develop a model based on the theory of planned behavior. The model illustrated the duration of students’ campus residence, provided insight into their perspectives on food events and consumption at the university dining facility (UDF), influenced by factors such as palatal preferences, cost considerations, temporal constraints (during academic activities), accessibility of nutritious options, academic-related stress, and insufficient nutritional knowledge. Two primary findings emerged: first, recommendation to display nutritional information in the dining facility; second, students exhibited a preference for consuming less healthy food options off-campus due to their lower monetary cost. Conclusion The investigation offers valuable insights into the role of UDF in providing nutritionally balanced meals to students, which may contribute to improved health outcomes and enhanced academic performance. This research elucidates the relationship between students’ dietary choices and their subsequent impact on scholastic achievement.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Morphological features within the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell layer (GCL) have been identified in some cases of sudden unexpected infant death (SUDI), including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein, is critical in neuronal migration and cell positioning. An altered reelin expression is hypothesized as a contributor to altered DG morphology. This study aimed to determine whether the number of reelin-expressing cells within the infant hippocampus is altered in (1) SIDS, and according to the presence of (2) SIDS risk factors (age, cigarette smoke exposure [CSE], sleep position, bed sharing, and upper respiratory tract infection [URTI]), and (3) DG morphology. Immunohistochemical staining of reelin was quantified (measured as the number of positive reelin cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) within the layers of the DG, CA4/Hilus, CA3-CA1, and subiculum in cases of explained SUDI (eSUDI, <i>n</i> = 12), SIDS I (<i>n</i> = 7), and SIDS II (<i>n</i> = 33). Reelin was highly correlated with age. After adjusting for age, SIDS II infants had a lower number of reelin immunopositive cells in the CA1, a finding that was more pronounced in bed sharers. Analysis of risk factors indicated lower reelin in the DG and CA3 of males, and in the DG of infants with URTI (when excluding bed sharers). The presence of the DG morphological feature of cluster ectopic cells was associated with a lower number of reelin cells across several hippocampal layers, whereas gaps were associated with higher numbers, with layers predominantly affected being the DG molecular layer and CA2 stratum radiatum.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-39/v1?src=rss">Global Scientific Discourses on Maternal Nutrition: A Scientometric and Altmetric Exploration into Research Trends and Patterns [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The present study is an endeavor to explore the global focus on maternal malnutrition research across the globe. The study underscores the development of maternal malnutrition research across the globe and may give impetus to researchers, policy makers and entrepreneurs for further research in this domain. Methods The study is descriptive in nature and used a mixed method approach that includes bibliometrics and altmetrics techniques to explore maternal malnutrition research. The study initiated with systematic data extraction from SCOPUS Database with proper data extraction criteria. The bibliometrics techniques include quantitative and qualitative techniques. The initial part of the study explores the quantitative dimension, including authorship studies, growth rate of publications, country-wise productivity and citation impact across the studied period. The second part of the study is dedicated to trend analysis that reveals the focused areas in malnutrition research. The third part of this study delves into the social impact of the concerned set of literature by analyzing the social media attention score through Altmetrics. Results It is found that there is a relatively low rate of growth of publications, with publications published in 2016 being more impactful and a preference for multi-authored publications over single-authored publications. Regional distribution highlights disparities in the research focus. Thematic analysis identified key clusters, such as acute malnutrition and maternal-child health interdependencies, with emerging areas in public health nutrition and epigenetics. Altmetric analysis has shown an active but declining trend in discourse on academic and social media platforms. Conclusions Results underscore the need for holistic interventions addressing both nutritional and psychosocial factors during pregnancy to break the intergenerational cycle of poor health and promote better outcomes for mothers and their children.

                Background Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder frequently associated with male sexual and reproductive dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction (ED), reduced libido, and impaired spermatogenesis. Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) fruit extract has been reported to possess antidiabetic and reproductive benefits, yet its effect on DM-related ED remains underexplored. Objective To evaluate the effects of Piper nigrum fruit extract on erectile function, libido, sperm parameters, and testicular histology in alloxan-induced diabetic male rats. Methods Thirty male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups: normal control, diabetic control, diabetic rats treated with black pepper extract (122.5 or 245 mg/kg BW), and diabetic rats treated with sildenafil citrate. Erectile function was assessed via penile reflexes, libido by mating behavior, sperm quality by concentration, motility, and morphology, and testicular histology by Leydig cell and spermatogonia counts. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with significance at p<0.05. Results Alloxan-induced diabetic rats showed significant impairment in erectile function, libido, sperm quality, and testicular histology (p<0.001 vs control). Black pepper extract at 122.5 mg/kg BW significantly improved total penile reflexes compared with diabetic controls (9.33±1.03 vs 6.00±1.26, p=0.02). Libido parameters including courtship latency (5.50±0.55 vs 21.00±9.47, p=0.013), mount latency (19.00±10.81 vs 37.17±6.31, p=0.009), and mount frequency (18.05±5.99 vs 7.17±1.83, p=0.002) were significantly improved. Sperm analysis revealed increases in sperm concentration (19.2±6.7 vs 12.6±1.3, though not significant, p=0.877), motility (31.8±23 vs 27±30, p=0.697), and normal morphology (40.9±7.8 vs 35±10.8, p=0.04). Testicular histology showed restoration of Leydig cell count (59.33±4.0 vs 30.50±3.86, p=0.035) and spermatogonia number (319.4±64.59 vs 491±37.0, p<0.001). The 245 mg/kg BW dose primarily improved sperm concentration (62.95±29.4 vs 12.6±1.3, p=0.01) and motility (36.6±23 vs 27±30, p=0.436). Sildenafil citrate significantly enhanced most parameters compared with diabetic controls (p<0.05). Conclusion Piper nigrum fruit extract ameliorates sexual dysfunction and reproductive impairment in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, particularly at 122.5 mg/kg BW, with significant improvements in erectile function, libido (p<0.05), sperm quality (p≤0.04), and testicular histology (p=0.035). These findings suggest its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for DM-related male reproductive dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-37/v1?src=rss">Assessing data management and compliance in large research collaborations via knowledge bases:  A semi-structured interview approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Large-scale research collaborations rely not only on robust research strategies but also on structured data management and systematic knowledge exchange. Ensuring compliance with ethical and legal requirements is essential from the beginning. This includes obtaining informed consent and adhering to data protection laws such as the GDPR (for Europe), as well as following Open Science and FAIR principles, particularly when working with personal data. Additionally, the systematic assessment and documentation of project objectives, data characteristics, and other project-specific features are essential for advancing the scientific contribution and long-term development of such collaborations. Methods In this paper, we introduce a methodology designed to identify commonalities across research projects and to enhance data governance within large research consortia. The approach consists of three components: (1) a semi-structured interview that served a dual purpose: first, to raise awareness among researchers regarding ethical obligations, data protection requirements, and open science principles; second, to systematically collect metadata on planned studies, data types, participant groups, and methodological procedures; (2) structured processing and organization of the collected information; and (3) visualization of project interrelations through knowledge graphs. The methodology was piloted within a collaborative research centre in linguistics. Results The collected metadata were systematically structured and used to construct knowledge graphs capturing interrelations among projects, data types, methodologies, and participant groups. These visualizations enable research consortia to make informed decisions about collaboration, infrastructure planning, and data reuse. Conclusions The proposed methodology offers a systematic way to assess data management practices, while also fostering a culture of compliance and transparency from the ground up. Knowledge graph visualizations provide a practical tool for identifying synergies, promoting data reuse, and strengthening transparency across projects. This approach can serve as a foundation for developing sustainable research infrastructures in consortia working with diverse empirical data.

                Background Breast metastasis from lung cancer is an extremely rare clinical event, particularly in men, and therefore remains poorly documented. Case presentation We report the case of a 45-year-old man with primary lung adenocarcinoma who subsequently developed a breast metastasis. He initially presented with spinal pain. Physical examination revealed cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary nodules with mediastinal, supraclavicular, and axillary lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the most accessible axillary lymph node confirmed adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin. Chemotherapy was initiated. Ten months later, the patient developed a painless ipsilateral breast mass. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the diagnosis of breast metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma. Conclusion Distinguishing between primary and metastatic breast carcinoma is essential because their treatment and prognosis differ considerably. Accurate diagnosis is therefore crucial for optimal patient management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-35/v1?src=rss">Understanding the Link Between Toxic Leadership and Employee Well-being: The Interplay of Employee Turnover, Organizational commitment, Shift timing & Industry Sector [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the impact of toxic leadership on employee well-being and turnover across various industry sectors in the United Arab Emirates. Toxic leadership, marked by manipulative and hostile behaviors, has been associated with negative employee outcomes. However, limited research has jointly explored these effects with the moderating roles of organizational commitment and shift timing in this regional context. Grounded in Social Exchange Theory, Psychological Contract Theory, and Conservation of Resources Theory, the study investigates how toxic leadership influences employee well-being and turnover and whether organizational commitment, shift timing, and industry sector moderate these relationships. Methods A quantitative survey design was used, involving responses from 300 employees representing diverse sectors. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling were applied to assess the direct and moderating effects of toxic leadership on well-being and turnover. The analysis examined model significance, variance explained, and moderation through interaction terms while confirming validity and reliability through AVE, HTMT, and VIF metrics. Results Toxic leadership significantly reduced employee well-being (R = 0.445, R2 = 0.198) and increased turnover (R = 0.422, R2 = 0.178). Organizational commitment moderated the toxic leadership–turnover relationship (B = 0.2124, p = .0088) but did not moderate the toxic leadership–well-being relationship. Shift timing and industry sector showed minimal moderation with negligible variance explained. The structural model demonstrated good fit and explanatory power for turnover (R2 = 0.582) and workplace behavior (R2 = 0.373), confirming acceptable reliability and validity indices. Conclusion Toxic leadership detrimentally affects employee well-being and retention across all sectors. Organizational commitment partially buffers these effects on turnover but not on well-being. Findings highlight that reducing toxic leadership behaviors is essential for employee health and organizational stability, as contextual factors like shift timing or sector offer limited protective influence.

                Background The Blue Economy has emerged as the dominant paradigm for ocean governance, promising to reconcile maritime economic expansion with environmental protection through technological innovation and market instruments. However, it rests on theoretically precarious commitments: absolute decoupling of growth from environmental degradation, techno-managerial universalism, and marketisation of marine commons. This article develops a theoretical critique of the Blue Economy by synthesizing degrowth scholarship and political ecology to expose how growth-compatible ocean governance reproduces dispossession, intensification, and unequal exchange in Global South contexts. Methods This literature-based study employs purposive sampling and thematic synthesis to build a conceptual critique. The analysis centers degrowth as the primary theoretical lens and deploys political ecology concepts—enclosure, spatial fix, and ecologically unequal exchange—to trace causal mechanisms through which Blue Economy policies produce unjust distributive outcomes. Literature selection prioritized canonical degrowth texts, foundational political ecology works, and critical Blue Economy scholarship. An illustrative composite vignette from Indonesian coastal contexts grounds the theoretical arguments. Results The synthesis yields six interrelated critiques demonstrating that the Blue Economy’s epistemic framing privileges market valuation over plural values; decoupling assumptions are empirically fragile and undermined by rebound effects and problem-shifting; market instruments commodify commons and enable governance capture; Blue Economy projects function as spatial fixes reproducing accumulation by dispossession; distributional outcomes are regressive; and techno-optimism masks problem-shifting. The article develops Blue Degrowth as a normative alternative, articulating five principles—limits and sufficiency, anti-colonial delinking, commons governance, local value retention, and democratic deliberation—and translates these into policy modalities including legal recognition of customary marine tenure, cooperative processing, precautionary moratoria, and alternative metrics beyond GDP. Conclusions Blue Degrowth offers a framework for just ocean governance that fundamentally breaks from growth-centric paradigms. Future research should test causal mechanisms through comparative studies, develop participatory sufficiency metrics, and explore coalition-building strategies for implementation in diverse Global South settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-33/v1?src=rss">Spotsweeper-py: spatially-aware quality control metrics for spatial omics data in the Python ecosystem [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) generates large and heterogeneous datasets where global (tissue-wide) quality control (QC) metrics often over-aggressively remove biologically meaningful regions or miss localized artifacts. Recently, spatially-aware QC metrics have been introduced in SpotSweeper, but this is limited to the R programming language, which makes it challenging to use these metrics within the Python/scverse ecosystem. Here, we present SpotSweeper-py, a Python equivalent package of SpotSweeper that computes neighborhood-aware z-scores for standard QC metrics such as total counts, log total counts, number of detected genes, and percentage of mitochondrial counts. We demonstrate the performance and usability of SpotSweeper-py on two public datasets from the 10x Genomics Visium and VisiumHD platforms. This implementation of local spatially-aware QC metrics enables direct integration with Python/scverse ecosystem, reduces false positives from global quality control while preserving tissue-specific architecture. Plotting utilities are also included for quick visualizations of flagged outliers. By making robust local QC accessible in Python, SpotSweeper-py strengthens the reliability of pipelines for analyzing SRT data. The open-source software is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/spotsweeper).

                Despite extensive research on hemispheric asymmetries, the mechanisms regulating lateralized brain functions are incompletely understood. Growing evidence suggests that lateralized neural circuits are side-specifically controlled, in part, by neuropeptides acting as neuromodulators, paracrine factors, and neurohormones. This review highlights evidence supporting this concept in the contexts of lateralized pain processing in the amygdala, control of auditory signaling, lateralized interoceptive signaling, and side-specific endocrine regulation. Our focus is primarily on rodent studies, with supporting data from humans and nonmammalian species, including turtles and nematodes. Left–right side-specific control may be rooted in a bipartite, lateralized organization of neuropeptide systems. Neuropeptides with asymmetric actions may act locally within specific brain regions or be coordinated across the neuraxis. These findings converge on a model in which neuropeptides enable lateralized control through interconnected mechanisms spanning gene expression, neural circuits, and behavioral outcomes.

                Joyce et al. demonstrate that the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer binds to open chromatin, including transiently accessible regions formed near double-strand breaks. Chromatin-loaded FANCD2-FANCI promotes DNA repair activities in the vicinity of double-strand breaks.

                Rainwater et al. show that DNA-PKcs plays a role in early T cell activation by regulating signaling through LAT at the immune synapse. By influencing how T cells respond to antigens, DNA-PKcs emerges as a promising therapeutic target, and inhibiting DNA-PKcs may offer a powerful approach to preventing transplant rejection.

The authors additionally identify the E3 ligases HUWE1 and TRIP12 as key factors that target TARG1 for degradation, further establishing their roles as PAR-dependent E3 ligases.

                Templeton and Laimins examine the interplay between the high-risk HPV E6 protein and the RNA helicase senataxin (SETX) in regulating global R-loop and m6A levels during HPV infection. E6 depletes m6A levels, while SETX facilitates m6A modification through controlling m6A MTC expression in a differentiation-dependent manner critical for viral replication.

                Gutman-Wei et al. show that layer 6 corticothalamic neurons preferentially form functional synapses onto parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons over more common excitatory cortical cells during postnatal synaptogenesis, following two periods of intracortical axon development. Thus, selective synaptogenesis, rather than non-selective synapse formation followed by selective pruning, generates these cell-type-biased excitatory connections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93003">The interplay between biomolecular assembly and phase separation</a></h4>

              
                Many biological functions and dysfunctions rely on two fundamental processes, molecular assembly and the formation of condensed phases such as biomolecular condensates. Condensed phases generally form via phase separation, while molecular assemblies are clusters of molecules of various sizes, shapes, and functionality. We developed a theory that relies on thermodynamic principles to understand the interplay between molecular assembly and phase separation. We propose two prototypical classes of protein interactions and characterize their different equilibrium states and relaxation dynamics. We obtain results consistent with recent in vitro experimental observations of reconstituted proteins, including anomalous size distribution of assemblies, the gelation of condensed phases, and the change in condensate volume during ageing. Our theory provides the framework to unravel the mechanisms underlying physiological assemblies essential for cellular function and aberrant assemblies which are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108225">Two classes of amine/glutamate multi-transmitter neurons innervate Drosophila internal male reproductive organs</a></h4>

              
                The essential outcome of a successful mating is the transfer of genetic material from males to females in sexually reproducing animals from insects to mammals. In males, this culminates in ejaculation, a precisely timed sequence of organ contractions driven by the concerted activity of interneurons, sensory neurons, and motor neurons. Although central command circuits that trigger copulation have been mapped, the motor architecture and the chemical logic that couple specific neuronal subclasses to organ-specific contractility, seminal fluid secretion, and sperm emission remain largely uncharted. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to explain how neural circuits adapt to varying contexts and how their failure contributes to infertility. Here, we present an in-depth anatomical and functional analysis of the motor neurons that innervate the internal male reproductive tract of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We identify two classes of multi-transmitter motor neurons based on neurotransmitter usage, namely octopamine and glutamate neurons (OGNs) and serotonin and glutamate neurons (SGNs), each with a biased pattern of innervation: SGNs predominate in the accessory glands, OGNs in the ejaculatory duct, with equal contributions of each to the seminal vesicles. Both classes co-express vesicular transporters for glutamate (vGlut) and amines (vMAT), confirming their dual chemical identity. Their target organs differentially express receptors for glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin, suggesting combinatorial neuromodulation of contractility. Functional manipulations show that SGNs are essential for male fertility but OGNs are dispensable. Glutamatergic transmission from both classes is also dispensable for fertility. These findings provide the first high-resolution map linking multi-transmitter motor neurons to specific reproductive organs, reveal an unexpected division of labor between serotonergic and octopaminergic signaling pathways, and establish a framework for dissecting conserved neural principles that govern ejaculation and male fertility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106096">Affinity-guided labeling reveals P2X7 nanoscale membrane redistribution during BV2 microglial activation</a></h4>

              
                ATP-gated purinergic P2X7 receptors are crucial ion channels involved in inflammation. They sense abnormal ATP release during stress or injury and are considered promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention. However, despite their predominant expression in immune cells such as microglia, there is limited information on P2X7 membrane expression and regulation during inflammation at the single-molecule level, necessitating new labeling approaches to visualize P2X7 in native cells. Here, we present <b>X7-uP</b>, an unbiased, affinity-guided P2X7 chemical labeling reagent that selectively and covalently biotinylates endogenous P2X7 in BV2 cells, a murine microglial cell line, allowing subsequent labeling with streptavidin-Alexa 647 tailored for super-resolution imaging. We uncovered a nanoscale microglial P2X7 redistribution mechanism where evenly spaced individual receptors in quiescent cells undergo upregulation and clustering in response to the pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide and ATP, leading to synergistic interleukin-1β release. Our method thus offers a new approach to revealing endogenous P2X7 expression at the single-molecule level.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105776">Short activation domains control chromatin association of transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                Transcription factors regulate gene expression with DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and activation domains. Despite evidence to the contrary, DBDs are often assumed to be the primary mediators of transcription factor (TF) interactions with DNA and chromatin. Here, we used fast single-molecule tracking of transcription factors in living cells to show that short activation domains can control the fraction of molecules bound to chromatin. Stronger activation domains have higher bound fractions and longer residence times on chromatin. Furthermore, mutations that increase activation domain strength also increase chromatin binding. This trend was consistent in four different activation domains and their mutants. This effect further held for activation domains appended to three different structural classes of DBDs. Stronger activation domains with high chromatin-bound fractions also exhibited increased binding to the p300 coactivator in proximity-assisted photoactivation experiments. Genome-wide measurements indicate these activation domains primarily control the occupancy of binding rather than the genomic location. Taken together, these results demonstrate that very short activation domains play a major role in tethering transcription factors to chromatin.

">Sulcal Widening in Schizophrenia Maps onto Sulcal Hubs and Energy-Synaptic Genes</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SZ) is increasingly framed as a disorder of large-scale brain networks emerging from atypical early neurodevelopment, yet how network architecture relates to cortical folding abnormalities remains unclear. Here, we introduce a sulcal morphological-centred network framework that integrates normative modelling of sulcal width with diffusion-derived structural connectivity and transcriptomic data in a large multisite cohort (n = 5,392; 377 SZ). Individuals with SZ showed widespread sulcal widening, affecting 30 of 40 sulci and most pronounced in frontal, temporal and occipital regions. Critically, sulci with higher degree centrality, reflecting greater embedding within the structural connectome, exhibited disproportionately greater widening in SZ (pspin = 0.02), indicating that network hubs of cortical folding are preferentially affected. Transcriptomic integration using partial least squares regression identified a single component explaining 56.5% of SZ-related sulcal widening variance (pperm = 0.041), implicating genes enriched for synaptic signalling and energy metabolism with adult cortical expression bias and genetic enrichment for cross-disorder psychiatric risk. In contrast, oppositely weighted genes showed prenatal expression bias and enrichment for rare disruptive variants in autism spectrum disorder. Together, these findings link aberrant sulcal morphology in SZ to the brain's network topology and molecular architecture, positioning cortical folding as a network-embedded phenotype in SZ.

">Feasibility of multimodal metabolic analysis for detecting early changes in acute neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Given the prevalence of metabolic perturbations in a variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, understanding and monitoring brain metabolism is a key step in our advancement of therapies. The details of the citric acid cycle were established at the beginning of the last century but only recently have its metabolic intermediates been observed in vivo in the brain. In this study, we employed orthogonal analyses to investigate metabolic alterations in response to acute neuroinflammation in vivo, demonstrating a multi-technique approach that could be used for future studies. Hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate spectroscopy revealed an early decline in pyruvate metabolism via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), leading to reduced 13C-bicarbonate formation. This metabolic disruption occurred despite the absence of structural or perfusion changes on conventional MRI. Further analysis of polar metabolites in the ipsilateral hemisphere confirmed ongoing inflammatory processes. These findings highlight the potential of this dual technique approach to inform upon metabolic changes due to neuroinflammation. Combining methods to probe metabolism in invasive (metabolomics) and non-invasive (hyperpolarized MRI) manners, this represents a promising translational approach for real-time metabolic assessments in an area of the body, the brain, where studying processes such as metabolism has traditionally been challenging. This study has demonstrated the approach to monitor changes in metabolism in response to inflammation in the brain.

">Astrocytes control oxytocin-based maternal behavior via connexin 30</a></h4>

              
                Prosocial and affiliative behaviors rely on complex neuroendocrine neuronal circuits. Dynamic neuroglial interactions play prominent roles in shaping synaptic networks, whose alterations contribute to psychiatric disorders associated with social deficits. However, a role for astrocytes in regulating maternal behavior remains elusive. Here, we show that female mice exhibiting increased oxytocin levels in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus upon social interactions with pups display neuroglial structural plasticity and downregulation of astroglial connexin 30, a protein involved in morphological remodeling. We found that impairing astroglial connexin 30 expression alters the structural properties of astrocytes by decreasing their volume and coverage of oxytocinergic synapses in the supraoptic nucleus of female mice. This functionally sets levels of plasma oxytocin and maternal behavior, exacerbating maternal care in virgin pup-naive female mice deficient for astroglial Cx30. Hypothalamic astrocytes, via connexin 30, are thus key determinants of oxytocin-based maternal behavior, whose alteration is known to impair social skills development in offspring.

">Expectation of aversive outcomes drives multimodal integration of behavioural, physiological and neural activations during human fear retrieval and generalisation</a></h4>

              
                Classical fear conditioning describes how neutral cues acquire a threat value, yet how learned associations are retrieved and generalised across similar stimuli specifically is an ongoing debate. We combined behavioural ratings, physiological measures, and fMRI in a two-day classical fear conditioning paradigm to characterize acquisition, retrieval, and generalisation across modalities. Twenty-five healthy participants completed acquisition trials on Day 1 and retrieval and generalisation trials on Day 2 using conditioned (CS+, CS-) and graded generalisation stimuli (GS). Outcomes included trial-wise US expectancy ratings, pre/post fear and arousal ratings, skin conductance responses (SCR), pupil dilation, and ROI-based fMRI (amygdala, hippocampus, insula, periaqueductal gray (PAG), locus coeruleus). Acquisition yielded robust CS+/CS- discrimination in behavioural ratings and increased BOLD responses in bilateral insula and PAG. During retrieval, US-expectancy ratings indicated early retrieval of CS contingency. The fMRI results showed greater BOLD activity during CS+ presentations than during CS- presentations in bilateral hippocampus, left insula and right PAG. Additionally, hippocampus-insula coupling increased. Critically, parametric modulation during retrieval revealed that trial-wise mean US-expectancy modulated BOLD responses in left insula and right PAG, with a trend in left hippocampus. Across generalisation, US-expectancy and pupil dilation responses followed graded profiles, which could be explained by a Gaussian model, whereas SCR generalised, but was not captured by a Gaussian model. Parametric modulation by US-expectancy correlated with BOLD activity in left PAG, with a trend in right hippocampus. Stimulus identity explained variance in bilateral insula and left PAG. Findings converge on a hippocampus-insula-PAG network that retrieves learned predictions, and scales defensive output according to similarity-based threat probability, linking subjective, physiological, and neural outcomes.

">Neural Signatures of Automatic Auditory Regularity Detection Reflect Individual Differences in Explicit Short-Term Memory</a></h4>

              
                Perception is shaped by the statistical structure of the environment, reflecting the brain's capacity to detect and exploit regularities in sensory input. This process requires the maintenance of contextual information over time, yet the nature of the memory mechanism supporting automatic structure learning remains unclear. Here, we ask whether auditory regularity processing relies on a dedicated sensory buffer or instead draws on domain-general mnemonic resources. We related neural indices of regularity processing measured with EEG during passive listening to behavioural performance on an explicit auditory short-term memory task. Human participants (N=30; both sexes) passively listened to regularly repeating (cycles of 5.5 seconds) or random tone sequences, while sustained and tone-locked neural responses were extracted as complementary markers of predictability tracking and prediction-error signalling. Individual differences in explicit memory performance, quantified using a delayed match to sample task, systematically predicted both neural measures: high performers showed enhanced sustained responses and attenuated tone-evoked responses (most pronounced in the N2 time window; 250-400 ms post-onset) to regular sequences, whereas low performers showed no reliable modulation by sequence structure. These findings demonstrate that the memory processes engaged automatically during auditory pattern analysis are not encapsulated, but instead draw on shared mnemonic resources, providing a link between predictive perception and individual variability in sensory memory capacity.

">Suppressive Genetic Interactions Between Haploinsufficient Mitochondrial Genes Encoded in the 22q11.2 Microdeletion Locus Define Brain and Cardiac Phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Genomic copy number variations, such as the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, cause pleiotropic disorders that affect diverse organ systems and disrupt neurodevelopment. Deletions of the 22q11.2 locus reduce the dosage of up to 46 protein coding genes, raising questions about the identity of haploinsufficient genes and their genetic interactions contributing to 22q11.2 phenotypes. Here, we dissect functional and molecular relationships between two genes encoded within the 22q11.2 locus: the mitochondrial ribosomal protein gene MRPL40 and the mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1. We show that a MRPL40 null mutation disrupts mitochondrial translation, impairs respiration, and affects multiple components of the SLC25A1 interactome including factors required for lipid metabolism, mitochondrial ribosome subunits, and the mitochondrial RNA processing machinery. In silico coessentiality network analysis revealed correlated and anticorrelated fitness interactions linking MRPL40 and SLC25A1 to mitochondrial translation, intermediate carbon metabolism, and interferon signaling. We determined that Mrpl40-null mutations are embryonic lethal in mice, but Mrpl40-/+ mice are viable and displayed embryonic cardiac development and adult behavioral phenotypes. Similarly, Slc25a1+/- animals showed embryonic cardiac developmental defects but lacked the adult behavioral phenotypes observed in Mrpl40-/+ mice. Surprisingly, transheterozygotic Slc25a1+/-;Mrpl40-/+ mice suppressed or mitigated cardiac development, behavioral, and brain transcriptome phenotypes observed in single heterozygotic animals. These results reveal that MRPL40 and SLC25A1 are haploinsufficient genes within the 22q11.2 locus that genetically and biochemically interact to define tissue development and physiology. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the complexity and type of gene dosage interactions within the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome locus.

">Aging Converts Microglial Repopulation into Maladaptive Reprogramming that Exacerbates Cognitive Deficits</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose Aging has been associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Microglial repopulation after pharmacological depletion has been proposed as a strategy to alleviate microglia-driven neuropathology. However, the effects of microglial repopulation on age-related cognitive decline remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we examined how microglial repopulation affects the transcriptomic profiles of cortical microglia and the decline in prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Experimental Approach Young and aged male C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Microglial depletion was induced by treatment with PLX3397, a CSF1R inhibitor, followed by microglial repopulation after drug withdrawal. Microglia isolated from the entire cerebral cortex were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing analysis. The visual discrimination test followed by the response direction test was conducted to assess sensory learning and attentional set shifting abilities, respectively. Key Results Repopulated cortical microglia in aged, but not young, mice exhibited aberrant gene expression patterns, including reduced expression of microglial identity genes, reprogramming of innate and adaptive immune-related gene expression, and derepression of neuronal gene expression. Furthermore, microglial repopulation selectively impaired visual discrimination learning and attentional set shifting in aged mice. Conclusion and Implications These findings demonstrate that aging converts microglial repopulation into maladaptive reprogramming that exacerbates cognitive decline, possibly through aberrant gene expression programs. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of this approach must be carefully evaluated with respect to specific behavioral domains and disease contexts, including aging.

">Ultrafast Frame-Free Imaging of Neural Activity with Event Cameras</a></h4>

              
                Frame-based fluorescence imaging has long defined how neural activity is optically measured. This approach requires acquiring all pixels within an image, regardless of whether they carry meaningful neural dynamics, thereby intrinsically coupling spatial and temporal resolution while increasing data output. Here, we introduce an entirely different, frame-free approach that leverages the sparse nature of neural activity using event-based cameras, which asynchronously report fluorescence changes as spatiotemporal events. Compared with a frame-based camera, our method preserves signal fidelity while eliminating the fixed trade-off between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and data rate, thereby reducing data output by orders of magnitude. Applied to hippocampal preparations we demonstrate that the frame-free approach can resolve both single action potentials and fast network dynamics over large fields of view at kilohertz rates, enabling scalable, ultrafast optical recordings.

">An Ultra-High-Resolution 17.2 T MRI Atlas (HypoAtlas) and Multimodal Pipeline to Study the Mouse Hypothalamus: Sexual Dimorphism and Lateralization Insights</a></h4>

              
                Structural and functional insights into the mouse hypothalamus are hampered by its small size and deep location. Here, we leverage ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI) at 17.2 Tesla to achieve unprecedented spatial resolution in structural, functional and neurochemical imaging of the mouse hypothalamus, including sexual dimorphism in certain nuclei. High-resolution ex vivo anatomical MRI enabled precise hypothalamic parcellation, improving on existing atlases and revealing nuclei previously unresolved by MRI. Diffusion MRI and tractography mapped intra- and extra-hypothalamic pathways, facilitating circuit-level exploration without a priori assumptions. Resting-state fMRI combined with independent component analysis identified novel hypothalamic networks, demonstrating the enhanced capacity of UHF MRI to detect deep-brain activity. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantified neurochemical profiles, revealing sexually dimorphic heterogeneity within the hypothalamus. Our comprehensive multimodal approach uncovers sex differences in hypothalamic anatomy, microstructure, and neurochemistry, emphasizing the importance of sex as a biological variable. This integrated pipeline offers a valuable resource for dissecting hypothalamic circuits and functions, advancing our understanding of neuroendocrine regulation, behavior, and disease mechanisms, with direct translational relevance.

">MEG correlates of empty subjects in Japanese control and raising constructions</a></h4>

              
                Empty categories are unpronounced elements with syntactic properties that play a central role in theories of sentence structure. Although there are several types within these categories, the neural basis for distinguishing among them remains unclear. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigate whether the brain distinguishes between two Japanese sentence structures: Control and raising. Although these constructions appear similar on the surface, they are argued to involve different types of empty categories. In theoretical analyses, the control-type empty category, which is called PRO, is often treated as an anaphoric element, similar to reflexives such as himself and herself, whereas the raising-type empty category is a noun phrase trace.

Twenty-six native Japanese speakers participated in a reading task under three experimental conditions: Control, raising, and baseline. Source estimates were computed, and condition differences were tested using spatiotemporal cluster-based permutation t-tests. We observed late left-hemispheric differences at approximately 700-800 ms after the critical verb. The control condition elicited larger responses than the raising condition, with activity centered in the temporal cortex spanning the middle temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus and extending into the anterior insula and the supramarginal gyrus. In addition, the control condition elicited larger late responses than the baseline condition in a broader left fronto-temporal distribution, including the inferior frontal cortex, anterior temporal cortex, and insula. These results provide source-level evidence that brain activity in the left language network differs between the control and raising conditions in Japanese during online sentence comprehension. Furthermore, they suggest that we can distinguish empty category types in the brain.

">Aging redirects prior expectations from perception to action</a></h4>

              
                Aging profoundly reshapes how the brain integrates sensory evidence with prior expectations during perceptual decision-making. Combining behavioural modelling with high-density EEG, we show that older adults assign greater weight on prior information, resulting in stronger decisional bias and reduced sensory precision under probabilistic cues. Neural dynamics revealed a breakdown of anticipatory tuning in visual alpha rhythms, supporting sensory preparation in youth, alongside enhanced central beta activity, indicating a shift toward pre-emptive motor engagement aligned with expected responses. A data-driven decomposition further showed that, whereas prior-driven behaviour in younger adults emerges from a flexible interplay between sensory and executive oscillatory systems, it becomes dominated in aging by a rigid, response-centred mode. Together, these findings uncover a large-scale reconfiguration of predictive computations with age, marking a transition from adaptive sensory-executive coordination to a more automatized, action-oriented predictive strategy.

">Formation, stability, and competition in dendritic proto-spines</a></h4>

              
                Over 80 % of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain terminate on dendritic spines, which support key functions of memory storage and computation. Despite the neurodevelopmental and computational implications of spine formation, little is known about the interplay of physical and chemical signaling mechanisms that govern spine initiation. We developed a physics-based model for the formation, stability, and placement of membrane protrusions (proto-spines) triggered by membrane-bending proteins such as IRSp53, and activated by neurotransmitter inputs. We identify two distinct proto-spine energy manifolds depending on the concentration of activated IRSp53, causing shallow and sharp geometries respectively. The sharp proto-spines exhibit properties of wave-pinning models, including stimulus-local formation, positional stability, and merging, but unlike the wave-pinning model they also exhibit competition. We linked the physics-based model to a mass-action chemistry model of neurotransmitter-driven signaling pathway activation of IRSp53 to simulate proto-spine formation in response to neurotransmitter stimulus patterns. Multiple proto-spines compete for IRSp53, leading to inter-spine spacing of 1 - 3 m, similar to experiments. Correlated and spatially clustered synaptic input enhances proto-spine lifetime and density compared to non-correlated stimuli. Finally, we tested the effects of autism spectrum disorder-related mutations in spine-formation signaling, leading to altered RhoGEF activity. We found that elevated RhoGEF activity increased proto-spine density and reduced their lifetime, consistent with ASD phenotypes. Overall, our analysis shows that the interplay between membrane bending mechanics and reaction-diffusion chemistry creates rich proto-spine dynamics and concisely captures key features of early spine formation.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. The initial injury initiates a cascade of secondary injury mechanisms, including neuroinflammation and disruption of brain connectivity. In this study, we used the lateral fluid percussion injury model of TBI to investigate the relationship between secondary thalamic inflammation and corticothalamic connectivity disruptions. For this, we followed rats for six months post-injury, during which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted under light sedation, as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and positron emission tomography (PET). PET imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA revealed neuroinflammation in the subacute stage in several ipsilateral thalamic nuclei, including the ventral posterior nucleus and lateral nucleus. In the fMRI analysis, we observed initial corticothalamic hypoconnectivity, which partially resolved by six months post-injury. DTI showed persistent increased mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in the ipsilateral thalamic nuclei from two months post-injury. Histological examination confirmed chronic thalamic neuroinflammation and neuronal loss eight months post-TBI. Correlation analyses showed that subacute thalamic neuroinflammation was associated with long-term structural and functional changes. These findings suggest that secondary thalamic inflammation contributes to enduring corticothalamic connectivity disruptions, which may underlie cognitive and sensorimotor deficits observed after TBI.</span>

                <p>Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) is a major contributor to long-term neurological dysfunction, yet many preclinical models lack precise control and quantification of biomechanical forces across impacts. We developed a reproducible, closed-skull mouse model of rmTBI using a custom-built weight&ndash;drop apparatus featuring a solenoid-based rebound arrest system, integrated high-speed videography, and accelerometry to track head kinematics during impact. Adult male and female mice received either a single impact or nine daily impacts. Linear and angular acceleration data were analyzed alongside behavioral and histological outcomes. Our apparatus delivered consistent impact and velocity forces with minimal intersubject variability. Additionally, the animals experienced consistent linear and angular acceleration as measured using high-speed video capture. These impacts did not cause skull fracture or acute vascular hemorrhage, but impacted animals had increased return of righting reflex time, consistent with mild, concussion-like symptoms. Behavioral testing revealed reduced performance of rmTBI-affected mice in an olfaction-mediated foraging task (buried food task), particularly at later timepoints, consistent with progressive olfactory impairment. Immunohistochemical analysis of Iba1 and CD68 in the brain demonstrated sex-dependent microglial activation, with males showing higher expression levels in both single- and nine-impact models. Among the brain regions investigated, microglial activation was most pronounced in the corpus callosum, neocortex, and olfactory tubercle. These findings underscore the importance of including sex as a biological variable in rmTBI research and support the utility of this model for probing injury thresholds, regional vulnerability, and potential therapeutic interventions in repetitive head trauma.</p>

Common statistical tests like the <I>t</I> test and ANOVA are based on the normality assumption, but quite often these tests are used without checking whether the dependent variable meets the normality assumption which can lead to erroneous interpretations and conclusions about observed associations. There is a significant need for the neuroscience community to utilize nonparametric statistics, particularly for regression analyses. Neuroscientists can greatly enhance the rigor of their analyses by understanding and utilizing nonparametric regression techniques that provide robust estimates of associations when data are skewed. This commentary will discuss and demonstrate analytic techniques that can be used when data do not meet the assumption of normality.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>It has been established that aged rats are worse at learning the spatial version of the Morris watermaze task compared to their younger counterparts. It remains unclear, however, whether this poorer performance by the older rats can be attributed to the use of different behavioral strategies to solve the task. We trained young (6–9 months, <i>n</i> = 37) and old (19–22 months, <i>n</i> = 65) male Fischer 344 rats on the Morris watermaze for four consecutive days with six trials per day. Using Rtrack, an automated discriminant classifier, we analyzed each rat's swimming trajectory to estimate the probability of the rat using one of eight distinct navigation strategies on each given trial. Across acquisition, the behavioral strategy profiles diverged markedly by age. The use of both platform-independent and procedural strategy types declined across learning in young rats in favor of allocentric ones. In contrast, there was no decline in the old rats' use of procedural strategies across learning, although their use of allocentric strategies did increase across days. The allocentric strategies that older animals favored tended to be less accurate than those favored by young rats. To investigate the tendency to switch strategies between trials, the entropy of strategy transition matrices was calculated. Young rats exhibited lower entropy between trials, which reflects the fact that they tended to converge onto a restricted set of allocentric strategies by Day 4. Old rats, on the other hand, had higher entropy, reflecting the fact that they continued to interleave procedural and allocentric strategies throughout training. These results align with human literature that hypothesizes that aging shifts the balance of strategy selection from allocentric hippocampus-dependent circuits to procedural extra-hippocampal circuits.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cervical artery dissection (CeAD) may be limited to the extracranial extradural space or extend to the intradural space. Intradural extension can potentially increase the risk of stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the factors associated with intradural extension and its impact on clinical outcome remain unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a secondary analysis of the STOP-CAD observational, multi-center study. Patients with CeAD and intradural extension (CeADid) were compared with those with pure CeAD extradural dissections (CeADed) using multiple regression analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 4,023 patients with CeAD, 534 (13.3%) had CeADid. In comparison to patients with CeADed, those with CeADid more often had clinical overt stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) at presentation, acute infarcts on imaging, a vertebral artery affected, and severe stenosis of the involved vessel (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for all). In contrast, carotid involvement and complete occlusions were more frequent in patients with CeADed (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for both). CeADid was associated with a shift in the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) toward worse functional outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62–0.92) but the odds for favorable outcomes (mRS = 0–2) did not differ between the groups after appropriate adjustments on multivariate analysis. CeADid was independently associated with higher mortality at 180 days on multivariate analysis (adjusted OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.50–5.38).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CeADid is associated with more severe clinical presentation, a shift toward less favorable outcomes, and higher mortality rates. These findings suggest that CeADid may represent a high-risk type of CeAD. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can drastically impair one's ability to work and interferes with activities of daily living. We recently demonstrated that, in rodents, conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) delivered to the nerve 7 days prior to surgery imparts a conditioning lesion-like effect by accelerating the rate of regeneration along the entire length of the nerve. The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that CES could accelerate nerve regeneration and improve function in patients with moderate or severe CTS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using a double-blind randomized controlled study design, patients received surgery + CES or surgery + sham stimulation. They were evaluated at regular intervals for 12 months following intervention. Primary outcome was motor unit number estimation (MUNE), supplemented with secondary outcomes including motor and sensory nerve conduction studies, Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments, and Moberg Pick-Up Test.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sixty-four participants were randomized to either the treatment or control groups. There was no significant demographic or physiological difference at baseline between the groups. No major adverse event was found with treatment. Following intervention, there was significantly greater increase in MUNE of 62 ± 71 in the treatment group compared to 25 ± 66 in the controls after 12 months. In the treatment group, there was correspondingly better physiological and functional recovery and hand dexterity compared with the controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CES is a safe, feasible, and efficacious treatment to improve nerve reinnervation and functional outcomes in patients with moderate or severe CTS. This may open future possibilities for more effective treatment for other peripheral nerve injuries. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Rural tourism remains underexplored compared to urban and luxury destinations, yet it offers significant potential for sustainable development. Travel influencers, through digital storytelling and endorsements, are increasingly shaping tourist perceptions and reducing uncertainties about homestays. This study examines the impact of influencer endorsements on homestay intentions, utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior as a guiding framework. Data from 216 urban tourists in Northern and Central India were analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings reveal that rural image perception is the strongest predictor of homestay intentions, while subjective norms play a weaker but significant role. Influencer endorsements affect behaviour indirectly by enhancing destination image rather than exerting direct persuasion. The study advances the Theory of Planned Behavior by demonstrating the primacy of cognitive evaluations over normative pressures in the context of rural tourism. Practical implications underscore the need for destination marketers and homestay operators to utilize authentic storytelling and image-building strategies to effectively promote rural tourism.

                Abstract* Background Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) serves as a rescue therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), yet data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain limited. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several new ECMO centers were established to address rising demand. This study reports and analyzes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19–associated ARDS who received ECMO support at a newly established high-volume ECMO center in Indonesia. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study included all adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and severe ARDS who underwent ECMO between July 24, 2020, and August 26, 2021. Outcomes evaluated included mortality, ICU length of stay, ECMO duration, and complications. Statistical analyses were conducted using R Studio version 4.2.1. Results Among 26 patients who received ECMO (25 veno-venous [VV] and 1 veno-arterial [VA]), the in-hospital mortality rate was 65.4%, and the 90-day mortality rate reached 69.2%. Non-survivors were more likely to present with hypoalbuminemia (82.4%) and septic shock (58.8%) at ECMO initiation. Mortality was significantly associated with a longer interval from symptom onset to ECMO cannulation (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.01–1.84; p=0.04), occurrence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) during ECMO (OR 19.20; 95% CI 1.88–>100; p=0.01), and shorter duration from ECMO initiation to death or discharge (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69–0.99; p=0.04). No significant differences were found in pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation duration, ECMO support duration, or ICU length of stay between survivors and non-survivors. Conclusions Survival in COVID-19–associated ARDS patients receiving ECMO is influenced by timing of intervention and the occurrence of complications such as MODS. Delayed initiation of ECMO after symptom onset and sepsis-related complications were associated with increased mortality. Optimizing early identification, infection control, and resource allocation, along with ongoing clinical training, are essential to improving outcomes in ECMO centers within resource-limited settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1271/v2?src=rss">Learning Science Beyond Sight: Conceptual Engagement of Elementary School Students with Visual Impairment through Hands-On Activities [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background A pressing challenge in science education is that visually impaired students continue to lack access to appropriate instructional media, making it difficult for them to engage with abstract concepts and resulting in limited opportunities for equitable education. Responding to this challenge, the present study investigates the design and implementation of hands-on, multisensory instructional strategies aimed at improving conceptual understanding of magnetism among elementary students with visual impairments. Method The research involved four elementary school students with varying degrees of visual acuity. Employing the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) framework, the research was divided into 3 stages: needs analysis (A) using explanatory case study, design and develop (DD) instructional media and validate using Aiken’s V, implement and evaluate (IE) the media into classroom activity using evaluative case study. Result The findings indicate that tactile models, auditory explanations, and adapted activity kits significantly improved students’ engagement and comprehension of key magnetism concepts such as magnetic properties, forces, and polarity. Through an evaluative case study, the research demonstrates that instructional materials tailored to the sensory and cognitive profiles of visually impaired learners not only foster deeper conceptual understanding but also promote greater participation and confidence in science learning. Conclusions Multisensory science kits help students access abstract science material so that it can be felt and helps achieve conceptual understanding. Moreover, the results may inform teachers, curriculum designers, and science education professionals on how to design and adapt science content in ways that are both accessible and pedagogically sound.

                Background Cement-based materials deteriorate significantly when exposed to high temperatures due to extensive microcracking, increased porosity, and dehydration of hydration products, all of which lower the materials’ mechanical performance and post-fire stability. This makes thermally robust mortar essential for protective applications in fire-prone areas as well as structural restoration. Method The goal of this study is to assess how the amount of polypropylene (PP) fiber in cement mortar affects its mechanical behavior, thermal resistance, and residual performance at temperatures as high as 600°C. Prior to and following exposure to increased temperatures of 200, 400, and 600°C, mortar mixes containing 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% PP fibers by volume were made and tested for workability, density, compressive strength, flexural strength, and flexural toughness. Results The results show that increasing PP fiber content decreases workability. PP fibers significantly improved high-temperature performance. At 600°C, the control mix retained only 19% of its compressive strength, while the 0.5% PP mix retained 33%. Flexural strength increased by 26–44% at ambient temperature for 0.5–1.0% PP fiber content, and at 600°C, PP mixes preserved up to 8% more flexural strength than the control. Toughness improved substantially, with the 1.5% PP mix showing nearly 10-time higher residual toughness than the control at 600°C. Conclusions In conclusion, the incorporation of 0.5-1.0% polypropylene fibers provides a balanced enhancement in thermal resistance, residual strength and ductility, confirming its effectiveness in producing mortar with superior structural integrity after exposed to high temperatures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-29/v1?src=rss">Protocol for Conducting a Scoping Review on The Impact of Non-academic Activities on Medical Students' Achievement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Medical education is intellectually demanding and emotionally taxing. Students must maintain academic excellence, acquire professional competence, and manage stress. Traditionally, academic success has been attributed to cognitive ability and classroom performance. However, growing evidence shows that extracurricular or non-academic activities such as research, leadership, athletics, volunteering, and peer teaching positively influence student learning and development. Participation in these activities fosters transferable skills such as time management, teamwork, communication, and resilience, which are vital for both academic success and clinical practice. Moreover, structured extracurricular involvement can protect against burnout, enhance motivation, and strengthen a sense of belonging, all of which are known to support learning outcomes. Despite increasing interest, existing studies remain fragmented and often focus on single activity types or well-being outcomes rather than direct academic achievement. This scoping review aims to map and synthesize the available evidence on how extracurricular participation relates to academic performance among medical students. Findings will clarify the educational value of such activities, identify gaps in the literature, and guide institutional policy and support strategies.
