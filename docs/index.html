                Background Local ecosystems and global agriculture are contingent upon the mutualistic relationship between pollinators and floral plants. In symbiosis, pollinators increase agricultural production by improving plant cross-pollination, genetic variety, crop quality, and yield. The potential impact on plant reproduction is particularly alarming due to the decline of pollinating insects. Habitat loss, diseases, climate change, pesticides, and predation have all contributed to the decline of pollinator species. High-speed wind is a significant factor that impacts the mutualistic relationship between plants and pollinators. Methods Studying the dynamics of interactions between blooming plants and honeybee populations is crucial for addressing honeybee decline and ensuring sustainable ecosystems. This work employs mathematical modeling to analyze the dynamics of a blooming plant, honeybee population, and honey production symbiosis, with a special emphasis on the effect of high-speed wind flow. Results The stability of various ecological equilibria has been investigated using dynamical system theory. Bifurcation phenomena, such as transcritical and Hopf bifurcations, have been discovered using bifurcation theory. Furthermore, the numerical results show that high wind flow can cause the extinction of the honeybee population and honey production. Conclusions Due to the rapid depletion of flowering plants and the high rate of wind speed, the populations of honeybees and blossoming plants are at risk of becoming unsustainable. However, the combination of reduced wind flow and increased symbiotic strengths can bolster the stability and sustainability of blooming plant-honeybee-honey production ecosystems. These findings inform conservation policies targeted toward protecting honeybees and increasing biodiversity.

                Abstract Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune condition characterized by symmetrical and chronic pain and inflammation, initially affecting the small joints of the hands and feet, and later the larger joints. RA also attacks other organs of the body, particularly the skin, eyes, heart, kidneys, and lungs. Aim The purpose of this research is to assess and characterize the hematological and immunological parameters that indicate the presence of inflammation and autoimmune conditions in persons with RA. Methods 90 male participants were recruited from several healthcare facilities, including Fallujah Teaching Hospital and Diagnostic Laboratories. The participants, RA patients (60) and healthy controls (30) were distributed into 2 groups for the comparative analysis of the hematological and immunological parameters. Results Significant elevations (P < 0.0001) in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and immunoglobulins G and M were observed in RA patients across three age groups: young adults (25–40 years), middle-aged (41–65 years), and older adults (66–90 years). Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein showed significant increases (P < 0.0001) across all age categories. Conclusion The results reveal systemic inflammation and autoimmune dysregulation that are independent of patient age. Using immunological and hematological biomarkers in routine practice can improve diagnostic accuracy, guide personalized treatment, and help prevent joint damage while enhancing patients’ quality of life.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1457/v1?src=rss">Quasi-Stationary Promotion Modeling: Measuring the Lifespan and Effectiveness of Marketing Promotions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Promotions in consumer packaged goods (CPG) markets are inherently transient. Each campaign, be it a temporary price reduction (TPR), feature advertisement, in-store display, or combined feature and display, produces an immediate surge in sales followed by an eventual decline once the event ends. Despite this, sales patterns during the active promotional phase often exhibit conditional stability. Methods We introduce a quasi-stationary promotion modeling framework that applies quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) to characterize the conditional behavior of promotional sales prior to termination. By treating the end of a promotion as an absorbing state and the underlying mechanics (TPR, Feature, Display, and Feature + Display) as transient states, we model the system as a finite-state Markov process. The left eigenvector of the transition sub-matrix yields the conditional sales mix m , while the dominant eigenvalue provides the decay rate α governing promotional persistence. Using simulated 104 -week UPC-level data, we estimate transition probabilities, derive QSD parameters, and analyze promotion lifespans. Results The QSD-based framework quantifies both the effective duration of promotions (via α and 1 / α ) and the relative dominance of different promotional tactics during the active phase (via m ). In simulated CPG settings, the approach differentiates between long-lived and fast-decaying promotions and reveals how transitions among TPR, Feature, Display, and Feature + Display shape conditional sales composition while the promotion is still live. Conclusions Quasi-stationary promotion modeling provides a unified stochastic basis for understanding promotion dynamics, forecasting lift persistence, and optimizing campaign duration. By linking QSD theory with applied decision intelligence in CPG analytics, the framework offers interpretable parameters that can be embedded into promotion planning, portfolio management, and real-time decision systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1456/v1?src=rss">Psychosocial experiences of Widows during the cleansing ritual: A scoping review Protocol of Southern African [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The psychosocial experiences of widows during the death cleansing rituals have significant implications for their mental health and well-being. These rituals include medicinal body baths, isolation, deprivation of specific foods or behaviour, wearing dark clothing and shaving hair, among others. Cleansing rituals are an important cultural practice that is believed to purify the widow and help her cope with her loss. However, the rituals may also create psychological stress for widows who may feel stigmatised in their communities. To shed light on this topic, the present scoping review aims to identify and map the literature on the psychosocial experiences of widows during the cleansing ritual in Southern African countries. This review will follow the PRISMA guidelines and involve a comprehensive search of relevant databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO, for peer-reviewed articles that focus on the experiences of widows in Africa during death cleansing rituals. The review’s findings are expected to have significant implications for policy and practice. Governments and support organisations should prioritise the development of culturally sensitive support services, including counselling and economic empowerment programs, to aid widows in Southern Africa. Furthermore, policies should be implemented to protect the rights of widows and prevent gender-based violence and discrimination.

                Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in respiratory infectious diseases. Examining the patterns of pathogens associated with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in children before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic would help to understand the impact of the pandemic on pathogen emergence or re-emergence. Methods We analyzed de-identified data from microbiology assays of nasopharyngeal and blood samples of children ≤15 years old with ARI who visited Vinmec Times City International Hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam from 01/01/2019 to 31/12/2023. The data were aggregated by month, and time-series analysis and visualization were performed. Results A Bacterial Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) panel was performed on 4,125 samples (67% positive), Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) IgM was performed on 5,049 samples (39% positive), bacterial culture was performed on 10,280 samples (43% positive), and viral PCR or rapid test was performed on 42,300 samples (23% positive). After the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-2022, Haemophilus influenzae (HI) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) have re-emerged as epidemic pathogens associated with lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). Influenza type A and type B have re-established regular cycles of peaks in winter-spring months after an early rebound together with an unprecedented new emergence of Human Adenovirus (HAdV) soon after the relief of COVID-19 restriction in mid-2022. Late after the COVID-19 pandemic, from mid-2023, atypical pneumonia pathogen Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) has emerged remarkably and has become epidemic; there was also a small, brief emergence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP) infection. Conclusion Our data characterize the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the patterns of respiratory infection pathogens in children and is useful for disease surveillance and public health interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1455/v1?src=rss">The Role of Lecturer–Student Interaction in Developing Critical Thinking Skills: Insights from a Private University in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background The development of critical thinking remains a challenge in private universities (PTS) in Indonesia. Learning interactions in PTS are often influenced by interpersonal closeness, cultural norms, and communication patterns that do not always support the courage to express opinions. Although previous research has emphasized the roles of lecturer-student interactions and student collaboration, empirical studies explaining how the form and quality of these interactions influence critical thinking are limited. This study aims to describe the forms of interaction, the quality of pedagogical support, and the barriers that influence the development of students’ critical thinking. Methods This qualitative study involved 12 students from a private university in Bogor. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed thematically to identify patterns of lecturer-student interactions, peer collaboration, and cultural factors that influence participation. Results The results indicate that supportive lecturer-student interactions—including constructive feedback, positive emotional responses, and warm communication—increase students’ confidence and engagement in critical thinking activities. Peer collaboration helps broaden perspectives and cultivate higher-order reasoning. However, obstacles persist, including uneven lecturer support, unequal group contributions, and students’ tendency to remain silent due to hierarchy, politeness norms, and fear of judgment. Conclusions Positive and culturally sensitive learning interactions play a crucial role in fostering critical thinking in private universities. Consistent pedagogical support and structured collaboration are necessary to foster an inclusive learning environment for critical thinking.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-964/v2?src=rss">Cytoplasmic changes in bone marrow cells as indicators of postmortem interval. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Accurate estimation of the postmortem interval (PMI) remains one of the central challenges in forensic medicine. Traditional external markers are limited by environmental and individual variability. Bone marrow, owing to its protected anatomical location and slower decomposition rate, offers a potential histological substrate for PMI estimation. Aim This study aimed to evaluate cytoplasmic changes in sternal bone marrow cells and assess their correlation with Postmortem interval (PMI). Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study of 43 medico-legal autopsies with documented time of death. Sternal bone marrow aspirates were stained with Leishman stain and examined microscopically. Cytoplasmic changes were scored from 0 to 4 (intact morphology to complete dissolution) using a system adapted from Biradar G et al. Data were analyzed using ANOVA (p < 0.05). Results Mild cytoplasmic alterations (S1) were most frequent (51.1%), followed by moderate changes (S2, 25.6%) and severe dissolution (S4, 14%). Only 9.3% of cases showed no observable changes (S0). Mean PMI increased with the severity of cytoplasmic changes (S0: 8.5 h; S1: 14.1 h; S2: 10.5 h; S4: 15.0 h), although some overlap was seen, especially at S2, likely reflecting biological and environmental variability. The overall correlation was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion Cytoplasmic autolysis in bone marrow appears to follow a progressive pattern, from early vacuolation to complete dissolution with increasing PMI. Although not statistically significant, observed trends suggest cytoplasmic scoring may aid early PMI estimation when combined with other markers.

                Abstract* This paper presents a Neutrosophic extension of the New odd Weibull inverse Weibull (NNOWIW) distribution, aiming to develop a statistical model capable of handling ambiguous or imprecise data. The mathematical formulation of the proposed distribution was derived by combining Neutrosophic logic with the T-X method, specifying the NCDF, the NPDF and the survival and hazard functions. The statistical probability of the distribution was analyzed. To achieve optimal estimation of the distribution parameters, the maximum likelihood (MLE), least square (LSE), and weighted least squares (WLSE) methods were used, and their performance was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. The models efficiency was also tested using real battery life data and compared to competing distributions. The results show that the proposed distribution shows competitive and flexible performance in terms of information criteria (AIC, CAIC, BIC, HQIC) and goodness-of-fit tests suggesting its potential usefulness for modeling complex data. However, further validation on larger and more diverse datasets is required to generalize these findings.

                Introduction The rapidly evolving nature of technology and globalization in recent times makes it imperative to remain at the forefront of innovation and creativity in order to effectuate changes in health practices. Objective To assess and compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) reforms among various academic ranks and grades of healthcare professionals in North India. Methods A self-designed validated questionnaire comprising 24 close-ended questions was administered to healthcare professionals working in various settings through online links. This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2023 to September 2023. Prior to this study, a pilot study of 20 healthcare professionals was conducted with a sample size of 747. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach’s α (0.84), and validity was assessed using the content validity ratio (0.76). The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 28.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Results The average age of the participants was 36.31 ± 9.95 years, and their average experience was about 8.53 ± 5.70. The mean overall knowledge score for healthcare professionals was 9.65 ± 1.26 (faculty), and 7.73 ± 1.84 (Residents). The majority of participants 289 (38.7%) agreed that obtaining a patent was tedious process. Conclusion Healthcare professionals have scarce awareness of intellectual property rights and their reforms in research. The Ayurveda specialty participants and government institution participants were better aware of IPR reforms, but implementation was challenging for them. Hence, enforcing a robust IPR regime and its appropriate implementation is of utmost importance for an hour.

                Objective To analyze worldwide otorhinolaryngology publications from 2015–2024 and identify the top-performing countries, journals, funding agencies, organizations, and individual researchers. Methods A cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of the Web of Science Core Collection was conducted using Clarivate’s InCites, restricting results to the “Otorhinolaryngology” research area from 2015–2024 (data updated March 28, 2025). Primary metrics included publication counts, total citations, and category-normalized citation impact (CNCI). Secondary measures included the percentage of publications in the top 1% and 10% by citations, in first-quartile (Q1) journals, and with international co-authorship. Results A total of 95,435 otolaryngology publications were identified. The United States led in output (31,654 publications) and citations (342,724), with 1.57% in the top 1% by citations. Germany (7,036 publications) and China (6,447) were next largest. Italy achieved the highest citation impact among major countries (CNCI 1.77). The Laryngoscope was the most prolific journal (6,757 articles), whereas JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery had the highest citation impact (CNCI 1.91). The US National Institutes of Health and the National Natural Science Foundation of China were the top funders, supporting 5,063 and 1,761 publications, respectively. Harvard University (including affiliates) produced over 7,000 publications, and Jerome R. Lechien was the most prolific author (387 publications, CNCI 3.64). International collaborations accounted for 13.5% of all publications. Conclusion Global otolaryngology research over the past decade has been dominated by a few countries and institutions, particularly in the United States. These findings highlight disparities in research output and can inform strategies to broaden international collaboration and strengthen emerging research centers.

">The sense of agency in near and far space: where do we stand?</a></h4>

              
                Modern technology frequently places the consequences of our actions at a distance (e.g., remote surgery, smart-home control, virtual reality). Does spatial distance between an action and its outcome weaken the sense of agency (SoA) - the feeling of control over one's actions and consequences? Two recent studies answered "yes", reporting stronger temporal binding (TB) in near than far space and interpreting this as greater implicit agency (Jenkins & Obhi, 2021; Mariano et al., 2024). A third study - our own work with a similar paradigm - found no distance effect (Kong et al., 2024). Here we (i) provide a rigorous side-by-side methodological comparison of the three studies, (ii) argue why a direct test to establish a distance modulation of TB (the Near - Far difference of the Active - Passive delta) should be performed in order to reach meaningful conclusions, and (iii) report new re-analyses of our data and direct tests on the two target studies. Overall, current evidence does not support a distance effect on SoA. Our reassessment provides alternative explanations that converge with available evidence suggesting that distance may influence temporal interval perception, but that effect is independent of action intention and therefore of agency.

">Hierarchical Semi-Markov Smooth Models of Latent Neural States</a></h4>

              
                Hidden (semi-) Markov Models (HsMMs) are increasingly being used to segment neurophysiological signals into sequences of latent cognitive processes. The idea: different processes will leave distinct traces in trial-level recordings of (multivariate) neuro-physiological signals. Markov models, equipped with an emission model of these traces and a latent process model describing the progression through the different latent processes involved in a task, can then be used to infer the most likely process for any time-point and trial. However, the currently used HsMMs remain limited in two important ways. First, they cannot account for subject-level heterogeneity in the latent and emission process. Instead, a single group-level model is assumed to explain the entire data. Second, they cannot account for the potentially nonlinear effects of experimental covariates on the latent and emission process. To address these problems, we present a modeling framework in which the HsMM parameters of the emission and latent process are replaced with mixed additive models, including smooth functions of experimental covariates and random effects. We derive all necessary quantities for empirical Bayes and fully Bayesian inference for all parameters and provide a Python implementation of all estimation algorithms. To demonstrate the advantages offered by this framework, we apply such a multi-level model to an existing lexical decision dataset. We show that, even in such a simple task, not all subjects rely on the same processes equally and that at least two semi-Markov states, previously believed to reflect distinct processes, might actually relate to the same cognitive process.

">Kv1.3 inhibition alleviates neuropathology via neuroinflammatory and resilience pathways in a mouse model of Aβ pathology</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition of voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 is a therapeutic strategy to curb microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration, although the cellular and signaling mechanisms of disease-modification by Kv1.3 blockers are unclear. In this study, we delineate protective mechanisms of Kv1.3 blockade in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology using comprehensive transcriptomics and proteomics profiling of brain, corresponding with neuropathological effects of two translationally relevant Kv1.3 blockers, namely small molecule PAP-1 and peptide ShK-223. Following 3 months of treatment, both molecules reduced Ab plaque burden. Single nuclear RNA seq (snRNA seq) of brain nuclei showed that PAP-1 disproportionately impacted oligodendrocytes and microglia and increased crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes with endothelial cells. In contrast, ShK-223 had pronounced effects on glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes. Both blockers increased expression of myelination genes in oligodendrocytes and synaptic genes in neurons. Neuroprotective effects of PAP-1 were further confirmed by bulk brain transcriptomics and proteomics whereby PAP-1 increased levels of synaptic, cognitive resilience and mitochondrial proteins, while decreasing glial and immune pathways including STAT1/3 phosphorylation. Using proximity labeling and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that Kv1.3 interacts with STAT1/3 in microglia. Using microglial cell lines and primary microglia, we discovered a preferential functional coupling between Kv1.3 and type 2 but not type 1 IFN signaling. Brain-level disease modification by Kv1.3 blockade was reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via reduced levels of neurofilament-light (NEFL) and resilience protein RPH3A, both of which are increased in human AD CSF. Together, this study demonstrates functional links between Kv1.3 channels and type 2 IFN signaling and reveals distinct cellular effects of Kv1.3 blockers in AD pathology that correspond with reduced neuropathology and neuroinflammation, augmentation of resilience and neuro-vascular pathways, along with biomarkers of therapeutic effect.

">Stimulus sensitivity in noisy neural systems</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neural populations encode sensory information requires a precise definition of neuronal sensitivity to stimuli. While tuning curves and firing rates offer intuitive insights, theoretical frameworks based on signal-to-noise ratio and decoding efficiency identify Fisher information as the canonical measure of sensitivity, due to its relation with decoding performance. However, this relation holds only under restrictive conditions--when many neurons encode the same stimulus feature or when neural noise is weak. In realistic settings, such as when complex or high-dimensional stimuli are represented by a small ensemble of neurons, Fisher information becomes ill-defined or misleading. To overcome these limitations, we investigate two complementary information-theoretic quantities--the stimulus-specific information (ISSI) and the local information (Iloc)--and propose them as robust alternatives for quantifying sensitivity. We show that ISSI and Iloc converge with Fisher information when signal to noise is large, yet remain meaningful and interpretable beyond that regime. Importantly, these measures capture distinct aspects of sensitivity: ISSI quantifies how observing a response reduces stimulus uncertainty, whereas Iloc reflects how small stimulus perturbations reshape the systems posterior beliefs. Together, they offer a unifying perspective linking information-theoretic and statistical notions of sensitivity, bridging theoretical analysis and experimental investigation of neural coding.

">Tracking Satb2-positive retinal ganglion cells in zebrafish unveils developmental functional reorganization</a></h4>

              
                Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) relay visual information to the brain, and their functional properties are crucial for visually guided behavior. However, functional maturation of RGCs across development remains elusive. Here, we investigated the developmental maturation of a genetically defined RGC subtype expressing Satb2 in zebrafish, which allowed single-layer-resolved analysis of the tectal neuropil. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we characterized visual response properties of Satb2-positive RGC axon terminals at two developmental stages. At the early stage, responses segregated into seven functional clusters with diverse tuning profiles. By later stage, these responses reorganized into five clusters, indicating developmental restructuring of functional identities. Longitudinal imaging of individual RGC axons revealed that while some response types remain stable across development, others exhibit pronounced plasticity. In particular, certain RGC cluster acquired additional tuning features and converged into motion-sensitive cluster, coinciding with a marked expansion of motion-responsive cluster and reflecting progressive functional specialization. Visual deprivation experiments revealed that core visual tuning is genetically determined, whereas visual experience is crucial for fine-tuning of the particular functional subtype. Together, our findings provide a single-cell-resolved view of retinal circuit maturation and reveal how stable and flexible responses are integrated during the development of vertebrate vision.

">Empathy Accelerates Subjective Time Perception, Independent of Physiology but Not of Visual Attention</a></h4>

              
                Recent work suggests that empathic engagement can influence cognitive and perceptual processes, yet its impact on time perception remains unclear. Whereas internal clock models would predict that empathy-induced physiological arousal lengthen perceived duration, other frameworks offer opposite predictions. Specifically, findings that empathy reduces perceived distance, combined with construal level, and motivational dimensional theory, together predict that empathy accelerate the subjective passage of time. Moreover, although eye-movements are crucial in empathy, it remains unclear how visual attention modulates time perception during empathic experiences. Thus, we employed an empathy-for-pain and duration estimation task, while measuring participants heart rate, skin conductance, and eye-movements, to investigate how empathy and physiological arousal influence time perception. Our findings show that empathy leads to a faster perceived passage of time. Despite increases in physiological arousal during empathy, arousal was not associated with changes in time perception. Instead, greater visual attention to the eyes predicted stronger temporal contraction. Furthermore, trait empathy and autism quotient were related to this effect, whereas alexithymia was not. These results provide the first empirical evidence that empathy alters time perception, elucidate the contribution of physiological and visual mechanisms to this phenomenon and extend current theories of time perception and empathy.

">Thalamocortical coupling and cortical E-I balance generate diverse anesthetic α-spindles for interpretable EEG decoding</a></h4>

              
                Anesthesia is a common clinical procedure, yet its hallmark EEG motifs--spindles oscillating in the broad alpha-range between 4 and 16 Hz--are not enough interpretable from the neuronal circuit perspective and for predictive medicine. To fill this gap, we investigate here the neuronal mechanisms and mathematical principles of brain spindles by recording and modeling large-scale thalamo-cortical neuronal ensembles in mice under anesthesia. We report irregular weakly synchronized firing of thalamic and cortical neurons associated with spindle patterns, indicating an emergent network rather than cellular dynamics. The consecutive loss of balance between the firing of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons and the increased firing fluctuations, together play in favor of larger spindle amplitude. In addition, the continuous range of spindle frequencies observed reflects a tight equilibrium of interactions between the thalamus and cortex. To create a possible numerical twin of this complex dynamics that could be used during clinical anesthesia, we built a computational model that comprises a reciprocally connected excitatory and inhibitory representation of cortical and thalamic networks driven by random fluctuations. The model parsimoniously explains the changes in spindle dynamics when increasing the anesthesia dose. This model thus links in vivo brain sub-network dynamics with EEG for the readout of anesthetized brain states.

">Task-irrelevant stimuli boost phasic pupil-linked arousal but not memory formation</a></h4>

              
                Brainstem arousal systems, especially the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system, respond transiently to behaviorally relevant events, which is reflected in pupil dilations. The strength of these pupil-linked arousal responses during encoding of stimulus material predicts the success of its later retrieval. The pupil also dilates in response to task-irrelevant sounds. Here, we evaluated whether the effect of task-irrelevant white noise sounds on pupil-linked arousal can also be used to manipulate memory formation. Task-irrelevant white-noise sounds played before, during or after the presentation of memoranda (images or spoken words) evoked robust pupil dilations. Trial-to-trial variations in the amplitude of pupil responses during word encoding also predicted memory success. Yet, the task-irrelevant sounds did not increase memory success. These sounds may not trigger the same central arousal processes as endogenous variations of arousal that are relevant for memory formation, such as those occurring in states of increased emotionality.

">Portable quantum-sensor magnetomyography decodes fine hand movements</a></h4>

              
                Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact quantum sensors that can measure the magnetic fields generated by muscle activity (magnetomyography, MMG) without skin contact. This contact-free alternative to surface electromyography (EMG) has remained mostly confined to magnetically shielded rooms and simple tasks, limiting translation. Here, we show that a portable OPM-MMG system operated inside a compact magnetic shield can robustly decode fine finger movements and recover EMG-like muscle activation patterns. Eight participants executed flexion- extension combinations spanning 15 finger actions while we recorded triaxial MMG and bipolar EMG concurrently. MMG supported robust multi-class and finger-specific decoding, recovering a representational geometry that closely matched EMG. Orientation analyses showed that components orthogonal to the muscle axis contributed most significantly to discriminability, providing actionable guidance for OPM array design. Our results show that OPM-MMG in a portable shielded environment preserves task-relevant neuromuscular information and approaches EMG-level structure without skin contact or a magnetically shielded room. Our findings open a path toward hygienic, rapid-setup assessment and human-machine interfacing in clinics and rehabilitation settings.

">Synergistic Effect of Valproate and Constraint Induced Movement Therapy on Functional Recovery Following Ischemic Stroke in Rats: Neuroplasticity and Corticosterone Associated Mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Most rehabilitation paradigms primarily rely on physical stimuli, but biological enhancers may play a complementary role in optimizing adaptive outcomes. The HDACi (Histone deacetylase inhibitor) drug valproate has shown neuroprotective properties following cerebral ischemia, but how it interacts with rehabilitative training is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the synergistic effect of Valproate (VPA) and constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) on functional recovery following stroke. We induced cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. VPA (300 mg/kg, subcutaneously) was administered within 3 hours after reperfusion and continued for 7 days, followed by CIMT for another week (6 hours/day). The study revealed a significant increase in total infarction volume in the stroke rats compared to controls on day 7 post-stroke. The behavioral assessments revealed that combined treatment with VPA and CIMT restored the neurological and motor behavior deficits. VPA treatment reduced plasma corticosterone levels and modulated heart rate variability indices in stroke rats, suggesting involvement of neuroendocrine stress responses in post stroke recovery. The electrophysiological findings reveal improved functional connectivity between the penumbral (left) motor cortex and the uninjured motor cortex following combinational treatment. The present study also examined the effects of chronic CIMT and VPA monotherapies and delayed onset CIMT (one week after stroke) on functional recovery following stroke; however, these approaches showed limited efficacy. Thus, the study concludes that VPA, along with rehabilitative training, may represent a novel strategy to improve stroke induced persistent functional deficits.

">Human trust and emotion in the context of collision avoidance with an autonomous mobile robot: An investigation of predictability and smoothness in virtual reality</a></h4>

              
                The integration of mobile robots into human environments requires that they behave in trustworthy ways. Trust develops through interaction, and erratic movements can easily break it. Previous research examined motion predictability and smoothness separately, but their combined effect remains unclear. We investigated how predictability (consistent versus random) and smoothness (gradual versus abrupt) influence human trust and emotion during collision avoidance in virtual reality. Twenty-six participants encountered a robot across repeated trials. We measured subjective valence, arousal, and trust, along with skin conductance responses. Predictability dominated the results. Consistent robot behavior led to increased trust and positive feelings over time. Conversely, unpredictable behavior kept trust low. Smoothness acted mainly as a moderator for arousal; smooth paths reduced the stress caused by unpredictable moves. We also found that prolonged proximity in gradual movements raised physiological arousal, even if users reported feeling calm. These findings suggest predictability drives social acceptance more than smoothness. In order to promote trust, robot designers should prioritize consistent, learnable behaviors.

">Decision revisions modulated by synaptic inhibition in the olfactory bulb facilitate learning</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral responses are preceded by decisions based on perceived sensory evidence. In real life, sensory inputs are often noisy and change incessantly, raising the question of when and how accurate decisions are made. Cognitive flexibility allows us to revise the choices in case of perceptual conflicts, leading to response revisions. This involves switching between available choices or rapidly stopping misconstrued responses. Here, we quantified these erroneous behavioral actions and studied the underlying neural mechanisms. Mice were trained on an olfactory decision-making task wherein they had to distinguish between a rewarded and an unrewarded stimulus by responding with a lick or withholding it. While the animals respond by licking for both rewarded and unrewarded odor stimuli at the initial stages of learning, the responses almost disappear for the unrewarded ones in the learned stage. However, animals tend to initiate lick responses and stop within a few milliseconds for a few unrewarded trials, even when accuracy levels are high. We describe this phenomenon as decision revisions (DR), and observed it in 5-25% of trials among high-performance blocks. These revisions were mostly observed within a few hundred milliseconds of stimulation. We observed a significantly higher number of revision trials for binary odor mixture discriminations compared to monomolecular ones. Further, by enhancing inhibitory synaptic signaling in the olfactory bulb through photoactivation of ChR2-expressing GAD65-positive GABAergic interneurons, we observed faster odor discrimination and fewer revision trials. Thus, our findings confirm decision revisions that are stimulus complexity-dependent and the pre-cortical control over such a complex cognitive activity.

">Comparative Study of BBB-Targeting AAV Capsids on Central Nervous System Delivery Efficiency</a></h4>

              
                The efficacy of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated systemic gene therapy for central nervous system (CNS) diseases is often limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study systematically evaluated the tissue distribution of three BBB-crossing AAV capsid variants (PHP.eB, CNSRCV300, and BI-hTFR1) following intravenous injection in mice, using either a constitutive promoter (CAG) or a neuron-specific promoter (hSyn) to drive EGFP reporter expression. Compared with AAV9, both PHP.eB and CNSRCV300 demonstrated significantly enhanced BBB penetration and brain transduction efficiency. While the use of the hSyn promoter led to reduced transgene expression in the brain compared with the CAG promoter, and substantially decreased visible reporter expression in peripheral organs, viral deposition in the liver could still be detected via immunohistochemistry. Overall, CNSRCV300 exhibited the most favorable balance between brain-targeting efficiency and biosafety, highlighting its potential as a promising delivery vector. In summary, both the capsid and promoter jointly influence AAV-mediated expression in vivo, and although cell type-specific promoters can reduce off-target expression, residual viral deposition in non-target tissues remains a potential safety concern.

">Distinct mechanisms mediate dopamine-octopamine opponency in an insect model of olfaction</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators play a key role in determining how an organism processes and responds to sensory cues. Often, different neuromodulators act on the same set of neural circuits to produce diverging behavioral outcomes. In this study, we examined how dopamine and octopamine alter odor-driven neural activity in a peripheral olfactory circuit (the antennal lobe) and thereby alter behavioral responses in an opposing manner. Our results indicate that dopamine suppressed GABAergic local neuron activity during odor stimulation. Releasing the antennal lobe network from inhibition increased the principal neural activity for all odorants and led to nonspecific increases in a behavioral appetitive response. Octopamine, on the other hand, did not alter the GABAergic inhibition in the antennal lobe but still reduced the odor-evoked principal neural activity and the behavioral responses elicited by all odorants. Thus, both dopamine and octopamine used distinct mechanisms (altering recurrent inhibition vs intrinsic excitability) to mediate opponent changes in odor-evoked neural activity and behavioral outcomes.

">Sex-specific effects of psychoactive drugs on memory performance in an animal model of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent deficits in working memory (WM) and executive control. Dysregulation of the Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)/p35 signaling pathway has been implicated in ADHD pathophysiology due to its impact on neuronal connectivity and dopamine regulation. Using p35 knockout (p35KO) mice, a validated model exhibiting ADHD-like phenotypes, we investigated sex-specific WM performance, neuronal activation patterns, and responses to acute treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) or fluoxetine (FLX), administered alone or in combination. Under basal conditions, p35KO mice of both sexes exhibited significant WM impairment in the Y-maze test compared with wild type (WT) counterparts, whereas recognition memory remained intact. Analysis of neuronal activation (c-Fos-IR) 90 minutes after testing revealed region- and sex-dependent alterations. p35KO males showed significantly reduced c-Fos-IR expression in prefrontal cortical regions, while both sexes exhibited increased c-Fos-IR in hippocampal regions. Acute MPH or FLX treatment significantly improved WM in p35KO males, but this benefit was lost with the combined treatment (MPH+FLX). In contrast, p35KO females showed no WM improvement with any treatment. Notably, WT females exhibited a pronounced decline in WM after exposure to MPH, FLX, or their combination, indicating sex-specific pharmacological sensitivity in healthy animals. These findings highlight the critical role of Cdk5/p35 signaling in maintaining the functional balance between prefrontal and hippocampal networks. Our results demonstrate that pharmacological responses in this ADHD model are highly sensitive to both sex and neurobiological background, emphasizing the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in preclinical and translational ADHD research.

">A meningeal circadian clock and brain state co-ordinately enhance macromolecular clearance during wake</a></h4>

              
                The removal of brain waste is thought to be regulated by the circadian clock and sleep-wake cycle. A meningeal scavenger cell population, called mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLECs), uptake macromolecules from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and are poised to clear soluble brain waste. Whether CSF clearance is regulated across the 24-hour day is unknown. Using a quantitative, in vivo assay in zebrafish, we show that the capacity of muLECs to remove macromolecules is highest during the waking day. The muLEC protein uptake is regulated by a cell-autonomous circadian oscillator that drives rhythmic protein levels of Mannose Receptor 1a (Mrc1a); in contrast, lipoprotein uptake increases as a function of time spent awake. Thus, circadian and brain state cues independently maximize muLEC function during wake. Consistently, muLECs are required for normal recovery after the heightened metabolic demand of a seizure, suggesting that muLEC clearance contributes to both normal and disrupted brain homeostasis.

">Multi-fiber array-based photometry system for multi-regional functional mapping in the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Mesoscopic functional brain mapping is essential to better understanding of various brain functions and dysfunctions. However, accessing distributed neural circuits in mammalian brain regions remains a significant challenge. While fiber photometry is a versatile optical approach, existing methods often suffer from invasiveness and scalability. Here we present an affordable multi-fiber array (MFA)-based photometry system to monitor neural signals across multiple regions. Our system comprises a custom-designed MFA utilizing 50-m diameter optical fibers and off-the-shelf optical components. To demonstrate the system's versatility, we monitored GABAergic population activity using jGCaMP8s across multiple brain regions in head-fixed, awake mice. By combining with pupillometry, we identified state-dependent, region-specific GABAergic dynamics. Our MFA-based photometry system opens new avenues for investigating state-dependent neural dynamics at the mesoscopic level. To facilitate wider adoption, all codes and resources are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/Sakata-Lab/MFA).

">Temporal boundary gating of auditory sensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Perception unfolds over time, but whether continuous sounds are sampled with uniform sensitivity is unknown. We combine human psychophysics, EEG and rodent neurophysiology to show that local auditory change detection is strongly gated by stimulus boundaries. In humans, brief perturbations inserted at different temporal positions within 0.5-1-s tones revealed an inverted U-shaped sensitivity profile: detection was attenuated near sound onset and offset and maximal mid-epoch, with EEG change responses showing a closely matching dependence on change timing. Electrocorticography in awake rats exhibited homologous temporal weighting, and analogous profiles for amplitude changes and visual motion demonstrated cross-feature and cross-modal generality. To uncover circuit mechanisms, we recorded single units along the inferior colliculus-medial geniculate body-auditory cortex pathway together with laminar local field potentials in A1. Onset-locked suppression of change responses emerged in midbrain and was progressively amplified in thalamus and cortex, whereas the full start-end profile was expressed in granular-layer alpha-gamma power. A simple biophysically grounded model in which onset responses saturate and cortical populations integrate over finite temporal windows recapitulates this pattern, explaining how stimulus boundaries disrupt prospective and retrospective integration and thereby degrade change detection near the beginning and end of sounds.

">Central T3 deprivation disturbs cortical cilia formation, oligodendrocyte lineage and neuronal cell-cell-communication in a MCT8/OATP1C1 deficient Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a rare, X-linked human genetic disorder caused by mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), essential for thyroid hormone (TH) transport across the blood-brain-barrier. The resulting central TH deprivation disrupts brain maturation and function, leading to intellectual disability and movement disorders. Cortical development, highly dependent on TH, is particularly affected and contributes significantly to AHDS pathologies. Methods: To elucidate disrupted cortical processes, we conducted single nucleus RNA sequencing in a mouse model engineered to mimic the central TH deficiency characteristic of human AHDS. This murine AHDS model features the concomitant deletion of both MCT8 and OATP1C1, a T4 transporter largely absent in human brain capillaries that in mice plays a role in TH transport. The phenotype of dKO mice bears striking resemblance to the pathologies observed in human AHDS patients. Results: Single nuclei were isolated from the cortex and attached striatum of 21-day old WT and MCT8/OATP1C1 dKO mice and sequenced using the 10x Genomics workflow. Cell proportion analyses on the resulting 48 clusters suggested elevated numbers of GABAergic striatal D1 and D2 neurons in the dKO mice. Diminished levels of mature oligodendrocytes coincided with a bifurcation within the oligodendrocyte lineage trajectory, leading to distinct subpopulations of WT and dKO oligodendrocytes. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) patterns align poorly with Slc16a2 and Slco1c1 mRNA levels in the respective clusters, but closely with prior published cortical bulk RNAseq data of mice with systemic hypothyroidism or MCT8/OATP1C1 deficiency. These parallels confirm the reliability of our data and provide new insights by pinpointing TH-responsive DEGs to specific cellular clusters. Moreover, inferred cell-cell communication using NeuronChat suggested a disbalance in GABAergic versus glutamatergic signaling. We further uncovered perturbed primary cilia formation in several GABAergic and glutamatergic clusters of the dKO cortex. Discussion: Molecular signatures and perturbations uncovered by our snRNAseq study reveal new molecular characteristics of the AHDS. The imbalance in GABAergic versus glutamatergic cell-cell-communication, perturbed primary cilia formation, and bifurcation of the oligodendrocyte lineage align with pathologies observed in AHDS patients and highlight the role of TH signaling in maintaining neuronal network homeostasis in the cortex.

">Endothelial Arf6 sustains capillary electrical signaling and cerebral blood flow through PIP2 regeneration and activation of Kir2.1 channels.</a></h4>

              
                Brain capillaries sense neural activity and direct blood flow to active regions--a process termed neurovascular coupling that underlies activity-dependent increases in local perfusion (functional hyperemia). A key contributor to functional hyperemic responses is the capillary endothelial cell (cEC) inward rectifier K+ (Kir2.1) channel, which is activated by neuronal activity-derived extracellular K+ and initiates vasodilatory electrical signals that propagate through the vascular network. Kir2.1 channel function requires continual production of its lipid cofactor, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and is compromised in mouse models of cerebral small vessel (cSVD). Although decreased PIP2 availability is a common feature of cSVD, mechanisms underlying PIP2 synthesis remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that Arf6, a small GTPase expressed in cECs that stimulates PIP2 production, is critical for this process. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we demonstrate that inhibiting Arf6 activity progressively decreased cEC Kir2.1 channel activity. This deficit corresponded to loss of capillary-to-arteriole electrical signaling in isolated vessels and diminished functional hyperemia in vivo. Exogenously provided PIP2 restored Kir2.1 currents and functional hyperemia after Arf6 inhibition or genetic knockdown. Collectively, our data indicate that cEC Arf6 sustains Kir2.1 activity by maintaining PIP2 levels and demonstrate that diminished PIP2 synthesis is sufficient to impair functional hyperemia. Furthermore, we identify Arf6 as a mechanistic link between PIP2 production and endothelial electrical signaling, highlighting Arf6 as a potential therapeutic target for restoring functional hyperemia.

                Pupil diameter changes may be a useful signal source for noninvasive studies of motion planning. However, the pupil is also sensitive to luminance changes, making it difficult to study pupillary signals under natural conditions. Here we used pupillary hippus, a luminance-insensitive measure of high-frequency pupil dynamics while human participants planned naturalistic reaches in virtual reality. We found that hippus is significantly increased during planning compared to both rest and movement execution epoch. This finding shows pupillary dynamics change during motion planning reflecting preparatory processes. Most importantly, we demonstrate the potential of a new pupillometric method to study motion planning in natural conditions.

">Cortex-wide circuits for multisensory evidence accumulation and choice formation</a></h4>

              
                Accurate decisions in natural environments require integrating sensory information across modalities. To determine where and when multisensory signals are integrated within the cortical hierarchy, we trained mice in a visuotactile evidence-accumulation task and used widefield and two-photon calcium imaging together with optogenetic perturbations to map cortical circuits. Mice showed enhanced performance in multisensory trials that matched an additive combination of the total unisensory evidence. Cortical imaging also revealed superadditive multisensory responses in parietal and frontal regions, but visual and tactile evidence was accumulated in distinct regions, with the rostrolateral visual area (RL) being more selective for visual and the frontal medial motor cortex (MM) for tactile inputs. This modality-specific segregation persisted beyond stimulus presentation with convergence into a modality-independent choice emerging only late in the trial in the anterolateral motor cortex (ALM). Two-photon imaging confirmed that ALM neurons predominantly encoded modality-independent choices with few neurons responding to specific sensory stimuli. Optogenetic inactivation of RL and frontal cortex during the stimulus or choice period further validated their respective roles in sensory evidence accumulation and choice formation. These findings reveal a hierarchical organization in which modality-specific evidence is maintained until late in the decision process, with frontal cortex turning multisensory signals into unified choices.

">"Remote and partial clocks expand the circadian neuronal network, driving widespread molecular rhythmicity in Drosophila"</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks orchestrate daily physiology and behavioral rhythms, yet the extent to which cells lacking canonical clock components exhibit robust temporal regulation remains unclear. Here we addressed this question using a two-step strategy. First, we systematically mapped core clock gene expression at single-cell resolution across the Drosophila brain and body. Second, leveraging these data and performing targeted experiments, we uncovered cells that lack most or all canonical clock components yet display strong mRNA rhythms. We found that lamina wide-field neurons show high-amplitude tim mRNA cycling even in constant darkness conditions (DD) despite minimal expression of other clock genes, suggesting a partial or noncanonical oscillator. In addition, C2 and C3 optic lobe neurons, which do not express core clock components, exhibit hundreds of circadian and daily cycling transcripts. Notably, circadian rhythms in C3 neurons coincide with oscillations of activity-regulated genes (ARGs), whereas C2 neurons cycle independently of ARGs, indicating distinct non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. These findings reveal a spectrum of circadian regulation, from autonomous to remote, input-driven rhythms and expand the circadian landscape to include strategies for generating and distributing temporal information across neuronal and non-neuronal cell types.

                Synaptic architecture underlies neuronal computation, with autophagy serving as a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, function and local metabolism. Yet, autophagy dynamics and regulation within intact neuronal circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a pH sensitive fluorescence lifetime-based imaging method which allows to monitor autophagy dynamics at the synaptic level with a second-scale temporal resolution in the living mouse brain. This approach allowed us to uncover compartmentalized autophagic activity across soma, dendrites, and axons of layer 2/3 cortical neurons. Notably, we observe experience-dependent modulation of autophagy dynamics with pronounced mobility of autophagic vesicles in apical distal dendrites compared to basal proximal dendritic branches. We identified cell-type specific basal autophagy levels in excitatory, inhibitory, and astrocytic cells in the mouse cortex. Finally, combining this approach with disease associated genetic perturbation uncovers novel in vivo autophagy related phenotypes. Altogether, this approach highlights the spatial and functional complexity of autophagy in the intact mammalian brain and establishes a framework for investigating its role in synaptic regulation during development, plasticity, and aging.

">Deep learning to overcome human error and bias in electrode position extraction in tDCS-fMRI studies</a></h4>

              
                Combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with fMRI enables investigation of stimulation effects, while structural MRI verifies electrode positioning, critical for focal montages where minor misplacements reduce target current dose. Currently, no fully automated methods exist for precise electrode extraction from MRI. We developed an Attention U-Net-based deep learning approach to automate electrode detection in focal tDCS-fMRI studies, using structural pointwise-encoding time reduction with radial acquisition (PETRA) MRI scans from a multicenter trial (N = 392 images; 1,568 electrodes, https://www.memoslap.de/en/home/). Performance was compared to manual and semi-automated methods for a 3x1 montage (three cathodes around a central anode). The network achieved robust segmentation (Dice Score = 0.76, Hausdorff distance = 36.76 mm), identifying all electrodes in 95% of cases (323/340). These metrics compared network-segmented electrodes to highly accurate, manually segmented electrodes, which are also called "ground truth". Linear mixed-effects models on 52 ground truth images showed deep learning outperformed manual and semi-automated methods, aligning best with ground truth. Fully/semi-automated methods comparison of 290 images showed highest agreement (ICC = 0.990, bias = 1.3 mm), while manual extraction exhibited larger biases (-5.77 to -7.06 mm) and systematic errors. The automated approach overcomes manual limitations by improving precision, eliminating human variability and bias, and enabling scalability for large studies. It sets a new standard for electrode verification in focal tDCS, particularly for studies requiring precise localization. The model is open-source, with future refinements discussed

">Cryo-EM structure of alpha-Synuclein Fibrils Harboring the Dementia with Lewy Bodies - Associated E83Q Mutation</a></h4>

              
                Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) into amyloid fibrils underlies the pathology of synucleinopathies. Rare familial mutations can modulate a-Syn aggregation and may give rise to distinct fibril conformations linked to disease heterogeneity. The E83Q mutation, identified in a Dementia with Lewy Body disease (DLB) patient with atypical Lewy body distribution, has been shown to accelerate a-Syn aggregation and enhance neuronal seeding, yet its structural basis remains unclear. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure at 3.4 Angstrom resolution of recombinant full-length human a-Syn fibrils harboring the E83Q mutation. The fibrils adopt a double-protofilament architecture with a conserved Greek-key-like core spanning residues 36-99, stabilized by intra- and inter-filament salt bridges. Despite this conserved fold, the E83Q mutation induces a distinct local rearrangement within the hydrophobic region: substitution of Glu83 with Gln reorients residue 83 inward, abolishing solvent exposure and altering interactions with the N-terminal region. This structural shift brings the hydrophobic region closer to the N-terminus, shielding residues implicated in post-translational modification and ligand binding. Our findings reveal how a single charge-neutralizing mutation reshapes a-Syn fibril architecture, providing a structural framework to understand the enhanced aggregation and pathogenic properties associated with the E83Q variant.

">Timing matters: exon skipping therapy is most effective when initiated early in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy</a></h4>

              
                Exon skipping is a leading therapeutic approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a progressive muscle wasting disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene that typically disrupt the translation reading frame. This approach aims to modulate DMD pre-mRNA splicing to re-frame the transcript and generate an internally deleted but partially functional quasi-dystrophin protein. Four exon skipping drugs have received FDA accelerated approval, although their clinical efficacy is very limited. To investigate how treatment timing influences exon skipping outcomes, dystrophin-deficient mdx mice were injected with peptide-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PPMO) exon skipping conjugates beginning at either the adult (12-week) or aged (75-week) stages, and tibialis anterior muscles harvested for biochemical and transcriptomic analyses. Mean Dmd exon 23 skipping was 79% in adults and 44% in aged PPMO-treated mdx mice, whereas dystrophin protein restoration was 35% and 8%, respectively. Histopathological improvements were only evident in the adult-treated mice. PPMO-treatment in adult mdx mice induced a broad transcriptomic shift towards a wild-type signature, whereas treatment in aged mice resulted in negligible gene expression changes, indicating that late intervention is ineffective at reversing disease-associated pathologies despite low-level dystrophin restoration. Dystrophin transcript imbalance was corrected only in adult-treated mdx mice. Increased expression of the dystrophin-repressing microRNA miR-31-5p, which was more strongly upregulated in aged mdx muscle, provides a potential mechanistic explanation. In conclusion, PPMO-mediated exon skipping is substantially more effective when initiated in adult rather than aged dystrophic muscle, supporting early therapeutic intervention in DMD-affected individuals.

">Rapid fluorescence lifetime sensor development of LifeCamp enables transient and baseline absolute calcium measurements</a></h4>

              
                Genetically encoded calcium sensors (GECIs) have been instrumental for studying neuronal activity and intracellular signaling. GECIs are typically fluorescence-intensity sensors that change brightness upon calcium binding. Iterative improvements in GECIs have yielded indicators that report action potential-evoked calcium entry with high sensitivity and temporal resolution, enabling measurement of network activity across thousands of neurons. However, fluorescence intensity-based measurements generally cannot report baseline or absolute calcium levels and may confound neuromodulatory regulation of calcium handling with changes in action potential firing. Fluorescence lifetime sensors are insensitive to many artifacts that plague intensity-based measures and report absolute substrate levels, including those at rest. However, relatively few lifetime sensors for neuronal signals exist, and developing new sensors is typically difficult and low-yield. Here, we introduce a new rapid lifetime sensor development (RALISED) platform, which we use to build a new GCaMP8m-based high-speed lifetime calcium sensor, termed LifeCamp. We show that LifeCamp enables comparison of baseline calcium signals in cell culture, brain slices, and mice. In addition, we show that LifeCamp enables the detection of fast action potential-evoked calcium transients in single neurons from brain slices and in behaving mice. Using LifeCamp, we discovered calcium baseline changes associated with neuronal activity in brain slices and behaving mice, as well as slow average calcium changes in neuronal populations of freely moving mice. Altogether, this study highlights the utility of the RALISED method to rapidly develop new lifetime sensors and the application of the LifeCamp calcium lifetime sensor to study fast and slow calcium signaling.

">Introducing a translationally relevant mouse model of radiosurgery-induced unilateral hearing loss</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is widely used to treat vestibular schwannomas but may cause irreversible hearing loss due to cochlear toxicity. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and no effective otoprotective therapies exist. We aimed to establish a mouse model that replicates the clinical pattern of radiation-induced hearing loss. Methods: C57BL/6J mice (n=31) received 8Gy (n=3), 16Gy (n=5), 24Gy (n=8), or 32Gy (n=15) using the Leksell Gamma Knife ICON system. Targeting was based on the built-in cone-beam CT, co-registered with MRI and CT-based mouse atlases, to guide unilateral cochlea targeting. A single isocenter was placed lateral to the right cochlea, with the 80% isodose line traversing its medial edge. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 weeks post-SRS. A 32Gy subgroup (n=7) was evaluated at 16 weeks. Histological analysis of cochleae was performed at 4 weeks in all groups and at 16 weeks in the long-term 32Gy group. Results: SRS was well tolerated, and the contralateral cochlea received a very low radiation dose. No ABR shifts were observed at 8 or 16Gy, with only minimal histological changes. At 32Gy, ABR threshold shifts at 22.6 and 32kHz were evident by week1 and worsened by week4. Similar but milder effects occurred at 24Gy. In the 32Gy long-term subgroup, hearing loss progressed across all frequencies, most severely at high frequencies, alongside a sustained wave I amplitude decline. At 32 Gy, outer hair cells were reduced by 14% and 44% at 32 and 45.2 kHz, respectively, at 4 weeks, and by 38% and 80% at 16 weeks. Ribbon synapses were mildly reduced at 4 weeks and more markedly at 16 weeks in corresponding high-frequency regions. Spiral ganglion neuron density was mildly reduced at the basal and middle turns. All reported changes were statistically significant when compared to the contralateral ear. Conclusions: This new model reproduces key features of SRS-induced cochlear toxicity, including unilateral, dose-dependent, and progressive hearing loss. It thus provides a valuable platform for investigating mechanisms and testing otoprotective strategies.

">Distinct depressive-like behavioural phenotypes in mice exhibit unique patterns of transcriptional perturbations across habenular cell subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Major depressive disorder arises from diverse neurobiological mechanisms, yet how specific habenular cell types contribute to distinct depressive-like behaviours remains unclear. Using chronic social defeat stress, behavioural phenotyping, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we mapped stress-induced transcriptional changes across habenular cell types and lateral habenula (LHb) subregions. Our findings reveal that each behavioural phenotype is marked by its own transcriptional profile. These subregion-specific patterns across the LHb suggest that different cellular circuits contribute uniquely to depressive-like states.

                Background A severe sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea is typified by recurrent bouts of upper airway obstruction while you’re asleep. It is associated with a variety of complications such as cardiovascular problems, poor sleep quality, and daytime fatigue. Objectives This study aimed to assess knowledge of obstructive sleep apnea and the prevalence of healthy sleep habits among nursing students at the University of Basrah. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among nursing students at the College of Nursing, University of Basrah. A non-probability (purposive sampling) method was employed to collect data from 150 students via self-reported questionnaires. The research period was prolonged from November 1, 2024, to April 1, 2025. The constructed self-administered questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographic characteristics, knowledge about obstructive sleep apnea, and sleep-related habits. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with results presented in frequencies and percentages. Results The results showed that 64% of participants had good knowledge about obstructive sleep apnea, 28% had moderate knowledge, and only 8% demonstrated poor knowledge. In terms of sleep habits, most of the students have good, healthy habits. Conclusion Most students have poor knowledge. These findings suggest a need for enhanced educational programs focusing on healthy habits and knowledge of obstructive sleep apnea among nursing students.

                Introduction Access to maternity care services from qualified health care professionals during pregnancy, labor, and the postnatal period is crucial for the survival and health of the mother and baby. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with maternal continuum of care completion in Myanmar. Methods This study used secondary data from the 2015-2016 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey. The study included 1455 women aged < 2 years. Bivariate analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA and chi-square test of independence to explore the unadjusted association between the dependent variable and each independent variable. Multivariable analysis was conducted with ordinal logistic regression to explore the factors associated with the maternity continuum of care completion. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results The prevalence of complete maternity continuum of care was 55.2% (n = 803), partial maternity continuum of care was 31.9% (n = 464), and no maternity continuum of care was 12.9% (n = 188) respectively. After adjusting for covariates, maternal education, region, place of residence, total parity, husband’s education, husband’s occupation, money needed for treatment, timing of first antenatal check, tetanus injection, blood pressure, urine sample taken, blood sample taken, given or bought iron tablets/syrup, and drugs for intestinal parasites during pregnancy were significantly associated with maternal continuum of care. Conclusion The prevalence of a complete maternity continuum of care in Myanmar was suboptimal. Important factors include maternal education, urban residency, region, total parity, husbands’ education, and occupation. Improving outcomes in the area requires addressing obstacles such as financial limitations, access to quality health services, and distance. Improving access to maternal healthcare services should be the main goal of policy initiatives, especially for rural areas, lower education levels, and low-income families.

                Background This study examined biomarker signatures in men with alcohol use disorder (AUD) in Uzbekistan, with and without viral infections. Methods A cross-sectional study included 292 males with stage II AUD (virus-negative: n = 251; virus-positive: n = 41) and 49 alcohol-free controls. Clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters were measured, and ROC analysis evaluated diagnostic performance. Results Virus-negative patients showed the clearest biomarker profile of alcohol dependence, with reduced glucose, creatinine, and urea, and elevated total protein, α-amylase, De Ritis ratio, and direct bilirubin. ROC analysis confirmed strong diagnostic value for AST (AUC = 0.951), FIB-4 (0.877), MAP (0.817), and creatinine (0.711). Leukocytes (AUC = 0.790) and lymphocytes (0.735) best differentiated viral status. Fibrosis risk in virus-positive patients was 1.5-fold higher, with splenomegaly in 7.3%. Mild thrombocytopenia, absence of granulocytopenia, and rare delirium (<5.5%) distinguished this cohort from European groups, resembling East Asian patterns. Conclusions Liver enzymes, α-amylase, bilirubin, MCV, FIB-4, and MAP provide strong diagnostic value for AUD. Multimarker panels including leukocyte, lymphocyte, and creatinine levels support viral status differentiation. Findings emphasize population-specific biomarker signatures in Central Asians and the utility of multimarker strategies for personalized AUD management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1448/v1?src=rss">The Theory of Observational Relativity Serial Report 3: Einstein's Prediction of Gravitational Waves is an Error [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The theory of Observational Relativity (OR), a new theory, has generalized and unified Newtonian mechanics and Einstein relativity theory. The OR Serial Reports intend to interpret the theory of OR. The logical consistency and theoretical validity of OR, as well as, the empirical basis and experimental evidence of OR, have been clarified in OR Serial Report 1. The theory of OR has had significant discoveries: as reported in OR Serial Report 1, the speed of light is not really invariant and spacetime is not really curved; as reported in OR Serial Report 2, the rest mass of photons is not really zero. Now, OR Serial Report 3 reports to readers: Einstein mistakenly predicted gravitational waves; LIGO mistakenly detected gravitational waves. In 1916, Einstein derived a wave equation from his gravitational-field equation of general relativity, which has two characteristic physical quantities: the Newtonian gravitational potential χ; the light speed c. Accordingly, Einstein decided that his wave equation must represent gravitational waves and the speed of gravitational waves must be the speed of light. Methods From the GOR gravitational-field equation of the general observation agent OA(η) (0<η<∞; η→∞), the Gravitational theory of OR (GOR) has also derived a wave equation with two characteristic physical quantities: the Newtonian gravitational potential χ; the information-wave speed η of OA(η). Results The GOR wave equation suggests that the GOR wave must be the information wave of OA(η), and that the Newtonian gravitational potential χ must be the information about gravitational spacetime loaded or carried by the information wave of OA(η). Conclusions It is thus clear that Einstein’s wave equation does not represent gravitational waves, but the information wave of the optical observation agent OA(c) (η=c), that is, light or an electromagnetic wave transmitting observed information at the speed of light. So, what did LIGO detect?

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1447/v1?src=rss">Team-Based Analysis for Critical Thinking in Clinical Cases (TACTIC): Development of a new innovative method for teaching clinical reasoning [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Clinical reasoning is a core competency in undergraduate medical education, yet many instructional approaches do not fully address its cognitive complexity in a structured or scalable way. Team-Based Analysis for Critical Thinking in Clinical Cases (TACTIC) is a stepwise novel method that mirrors real-world diagnostic reasoning through iterative, team-based engagement with authentic clinical scenarios. This study describes the development of TACTIC using formal consensus methods. Methods We employed a modified Delphi followed by a nominal group technique to reach consensus on the concrete steps for implementing TACTIC. Eight faculty implementers participated in three rounds. Participants rated the importance of proposed steps on a 5-point scale. We summarized central tendency and dispersion (mean, SD; median, IQR) and calculated item-level content validity indices (I-CVI) and the scale-level average (S-CVI/Ave) using a ≥4 (agree) threshold. Results Consensus produced five clearly defined steps for TACTIC. Agreement was high across raters, reflected by high means and medians with low SDs and IQRs. Content validity was excellent: I-CVI for all steps was 1.00 and S-CVI/Ave was 1.00, indicating unanimous endorsement of the finalized steps. Conclusion TACTIC offers a structured, consensus-derived approach to teaching clinical reasoning that is feasible and initially well-received. While resource-intensive, its fidelity and scalability can be enhanced through facilitator training, hybrid/digital delivery (e.g., breakout rooms, simulated-patient substitutes), and selective use of AI for feedback and case branching. TACTIC has the potential to bridge the gap between traditional instruction and the intricate cognitive demands of diagnostic reasoning.

                Generative artificial intelligence (AI) can augment educators’ capacity to design high-quality Key Feature Problems (KFPs) for valid assessment of clinical reasoning and decision-making. This practice-oriented guide presents ten evidence-informed tips for using AI to develop KFPs that are aligned with learning outcomes, cognitively demanding, and contextually authentic. Drawing on the KFP literature and contemporary validity frameworks (content, cognitive and response processes, internal structure, and consequences), we synthesize practical strategies for translating outcomes into key features, constructing realistic vignettes, creating parallel case variants, targeting higher-order thinking, ensuring curricular alignment and learner-level appropriateness, diversifying complementary item formats, validating AI-assisted items through a stepwise workflow, delivering decision-specific feedback, iterating from learner performance data, and safeguarding equity, ethics, and governance. We illustrate these recommendations with concise examples and an adapted validation workflow that supports both formative and summative applications. Although AI can accelerate scenario construction and feedback drafting, human expertise remains essential to verify clinical accuracy, prevent bias and hallucinations, calibrate difficulty, and preserve assessment security. With transparent processes and expert review, AI can serve as a collaborative assistant rather than a replacement, helping medical educators build rigorous KFPs that enhance the assessment of clinical decision-making.

                The ghost bat (Macroderma gigas) is a large carnivorous bat inhabiting monsoonal tropics and arid habitat across northern Australia and is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. We sequenced long-reads of DNA using PacBio HiFi to generate a 2.00 Gb genome consisting of 313 scaffolds, and accompany this with short-read transcriptomes from five tissues to aid in genome annotation using Fgenesh++. The generation of a reference genome will assist in conservation of the species, particularly in relation to understanding the genomic basis of arid adaptation and ongoing development of non-invasive genetic monitoring techniques.

                Background In this paper, we focus on deriving an efficient method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of sixth order, and then, we modify the proposed method for solving fractional differential equations (FDEs). Methods The methodology of this paper used the approach of derivation of implicit numerical method. However, the purpose of this study is to derive a direct implicit block and multi-step strategy for solving sixth-order ODEs. Results The main novelty of this work lies in the investigation of constructing a novel method for solving FDEs. This paper presents a general block two-point approach, known as GIBM2P, for solving sixth-order initial-value problems (IVPs) using Hermite-interpolating polynomials. Consequently, the FDE problem has been transformed into ODE using the α-fractional-derivative transform, and then, the sixth-order IVP is solved using the proposed GIBM2P method. Conclusions In this paper, we offered a method for solving sixth-order FDEs. The proposed method has been shown to be an accurate and efficient method; also, one can obtain the approximate efficient solutions of FDEs problems. The numerical implementations are used to show the high accuracy and efficacy of the proposed GIBM2P approach. However, the GIBM2P method is effective in terms of accuracy, processing time, and the number of function calls.

                Background Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition characterized by the dilation and dysfunction of the left ventricle, leading to heart failure. This study investigates the relationship between dilated cardiomyopathy and factors such as lipid levels, interleukin-12 (IL-12) levels, troponin levels, and coxsackievirus antibodies. Methods This study involved 60 patients diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and 30 healthy controls. We used a BioSystems kit to measure lipid profiles and a fully automated c111 analyzer (Germany) to quantify troponin levels. We used ELISA to evaluate IL-12 levels and antibodies (IgG and IgM) to Coxsackievirus. We used SPSS for data analysis, with statistically significant defined as p≤0.05. Results Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy showed a significant difference in lipid levels compared to the control group, while HDL levels showed no statistically significant difference. In addition, troponin levels were significantly elevated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. IL-12 levels were elevated by 1.27-fold in individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy suggests a reasonable diagnostic accuracy. Antibody levels for Coxsackievirus (IgG and IgM) were markedly elevated in dilated cardiomyopathy, with a positive test in both IgG t and IgM, while no positive controls were observed for either antibody.in addition This study evaluated the associations between IL-12, IgM, and IgG. The results showing nonsignificant correlation between IL-12 and IgM and IL-12 and IgG. Conclusion Elevated IL-12 levels and coxsackievirus-positive antibodies in dilated cardiomyopathy patients suggest a possible immune link. However, no statistically significant relationship has been found between IL-12 and coxsackie virus antibodies.

                Over the last decade, there has been an increased range of probability distributions in statistical and reliability literature aimed at enhancing standard models. This trend reflects a greater understanding of empirical integrity, flexibility, and adaptability in modeling income distributions, reliability, and lifetime statistics. To provide greater flexibility and general distributions, this study employs a technique that generates the T−R{Y} family distributions. It might be employed to agree with particular forms of data distributions, including the significantly left, right, thin, or heavy-tailed distributions, or for creating new distributions that are very flexible and adaptive. These results in an individual belonging to a new sub-family called the IDNAII distribution, which is also referred to as the Lomax–Weibull {Exponential} distribution. The main statistical and mathematical aspects of the new family distribution are examined. A variety of estimation approaches, including the maximum likelihood method (MLE), method of moments (MOM), least squares method (LS), and shrinkage method (SH), will be introduced to estimate the parameters of the new class distribution. Simulation tools have been created to evaluate the effectiveness of estimation approaches. The study’s findings indicate that the shrinkage estimation approach exceeded the others regarding bias and mean squared error criterion. On the contrary, a real-world dataset application has been demonstrated and the examination of the real dataset showed that the new class distribution fit the data better than the particular classical and moderate distributions, as indicated by several types of information criteria.

                Background The fourth industrial revolution has introduced new forms of inequality, particularly affecting women through gender-based digital divides. These divides manifest in unequal access, usage, and quality of interaction with information and communication technologies (ICTs). Understanding these disparities is essential for shaping equitable digital policies. Methods This study employed a qualitative and documentary approach based on a systematic literature review following the PRISMA protocol. Four academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Sage Journals) were searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2010 and 2024. A total of 479 documents were initially identified, with 14 studies meeting all eligibility criteria. Three analytical categories guided the synthesis: manifestations of gender digital divides; their causes and consequences; and mitigation strategies. Results The reviewed literature reveals that women face multiple barriers to digital inclusion, including cultural constraints, economic inequality, lack of digital skills, and time poverty. The gender digital divide is particularly pronounced in developing countries, where gaps in access to the Internet and ICTs correlate with broader social and structural inequalities. Studies also highlight significant regional variation and intersectional challenges related to age, migration status, and educational background. While access has improved in some contexts, disparities in digital competencies and outcomes persist. Gender-based digital divides are rooted in both structural inequalities and cultural norms that restrict women’s digital participation. Conclusions Efforts to mitigate these divides must address the multilayered causes through inclusive policies, gender-sensitive infrastructure planning, and education programs that enhance women’s digital literacy and agency. Integrating a gender perspective into digital policy is essential for achieving equity in the digital age.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Our everyday experiences share many overlapping features, as we often engage in repeated activities and routines. This leads to interference across our experiences, making it difficult to remember specific, unique events. Hippocampal pattern separation enables the discrimination of highly similar experiences to be stored orthogonally, especially in the face of interference. Mnemonic discrimination tasks have been designed to tax hippocampal pattern separation by including perceptually similar “lure” stimuli during memory retrieval. However, we experience vast interference beyond a single instance of overlap. Thus, a key feature of our memory system is to overcome this high interference. Furthermore, some experiences tend to be better remembered by most people than others, a feature known as memorability. However, it is unclear how memorability may impact the effect of interference on memory. To this end, we designed a mnemonic discrimination task with multiple forms of interference, such that target (repeated) and lure (similar) images of a baseline image were shown to participants during a memory test designed to increase interference during memory retrieval. We additionally varied image memorability by including memorable and forgettable images to examine interactions with interference conditions. We found that greater interference during retrieval enhanced lure discrimination for memorable images, but impaired lure discrimination for forgettable images. This suggests that interference does not uniformly impact memory, with greater interference in memory leading to exaggerated memorable and forgettable experiences.</p>

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                Background Previous research has shown that popular names have become less popular over time. Simultaneously, accumulated evidence has indicated that names have become more diverse. However, the association between these two phenomena was unclear. This association should be revealed for a better understanding of names and naming practices. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between the popularity and diversity of names. Methods I analyzed the data provided in a previous study in the U.K., which included complete records of all live births between 1996 and 2016 (N = 12,985,140). Results I found that the correlations between diversity and popularity indicators were highly negative, showing that they are conceptually strongly related. This means that when diversity is high, popularity is low. Conclusions Based on this study, we can predict one indicator from the other indicator. Because raw data on names are generally difficult to collect, this prediction is useful for understanding names and naming practices.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1127/v2?src=rss">Parents’ roles in young learners’ motivation and task engagement in Indonesian primary schools: Questionnaire development and validation [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Parental involvement in a child’s second language learning is important because it affects the process and outcomes. Limited research has been conducted in the Indonesian context on what roles parents play in their children’s motivation and task engagement. Therefore, the study aims to develop, pilot, and validate a questionnaire on the roles of parents in motivating and engaging young learners with English tasks assigned by teachers. Methods This study was quantitative in nature. Participants were 270 parents of fifth graders learning English at nine public and private schools in Padang. The instrument was developed by analysing the literature and existing tools and creating new items. After getting expert feedback and piloting the survey, we assessed its validity and reliability. Research questions examined factors affecting its effectiveness. Results The questionnaire was analysed through EFA and CFA via Jamovi. EFA identified five dimensions: (1) parental involvement, (2) expectations, (3) access to resources, (4) enrichment and (5) extracurricular activities. The CFA fit indices (CFI = .945, TLI = .934, SRMR = .045, RMSEA = .059) confirmed the model’s suitability. The questionnaire showed strong validity and reliability, with measures exceeding.70, making it effective for gathering data on parental roles in Indonesian children’s learning of English. Conclusions This validation study offers an effective diagnostic tool for teachers, administrators, and policymakers to pinpoint the particular dimensions of parental involvement that affect children’s motivation and task engagement as they learn English. The findings highlight the critical roles of recognising parents as active collaborators along the language learning journey. The study adds to the theoretical understanding of the impact of parental behaviour in educational psychology and motivation studies. The findings are consistent with self-determination theory, providing a more nuanced perspective to explore how different forms of parental participation influence student motivation and task engagement in learning English.

                Background Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in South Africa continues to threaten TB control, with loss to follow-up (LTFU) at both pretreatment (diagnosed but not initiated) and on-treatment stages undermining program success. Psychosocial determinants such as stigma, depression and anxiety, alcohol and substance use, and social and family support are frequently implicated, yet evidence is scattered across disciplines, uses heterogeneous definitions and tools, and is seldom synthesized for policy and implementation. Materials and Method This scoping review aims to systematically map psychosocial determinants associated with pretreatment and on-treatment LTFU among people with DR-TB in South Africa, describe how these determinants and LTFU are defined and measured, identify contextual modifiers (e.g., HIV status, sex/age, province, urban–rural setting, decentralization, regimen era), and highlight evidence gaps and practical leverage points for intervention. The review will follow established scoping-review methodology and report per PRISMA-ScR following five steps: (1) defining the research question, (2) search strategy, (3) setting inclusion criteria, (4) extracting data, (5) assessing, summarizing, presenting findings and (6) Consultation. A comprehensive peer-reviewed literature search, including PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, will be conducted by two independent reviewers. The review will span over eight weeks, focusing on studies in South Africa published in English language between 2010 and 2025. Article eligibility will be determined using a two-stage screening process with disagreements resolved through consensus and consultation of a third reviewer. The results of this review will be presented as tables, including a narrative synthesis of the findings. No meta-analysis is planned. Conclusion The review will deliver a policy-ready map of psychosocial risks and promising support for DR-TB retention in South Africa, informing the design and targeting of patient-support packages and outlining priorities for future evaluation and standardization of LTFU definitions and psychosocial measures.

                Background Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but serious condition caused by compression of the lower spinal cord. Early recognition and prompt intervention are essential to prevent irreversible neurological damage. Delays in diagnosis or treatment can lead to permanent disability and may result in significant medicolegal consequences. Aim The aim of this quality improvement project (QIP) was to identify areas for improvement in the diagnosis of CES and update local guidelines in line with the Get It Right First Time (GIRFT) recommendations. Methods and Results This retrospective study, conducted according to GIRFT guidelines, examined patients admitted to the District General Hospital Emergency Department with suspected CES. A total of 37 patients—8 males (21.6%) and 29 females (78.4%)—were assessed over a six-month period from January to June 2023. Patients without CES listed as a differential diagnosis were excluded. Data collected included documentation of neurological examinations, post-void residual scans, perianal sensation assessments, MRI request and completion times, and length of stay. Findings were presented at the Trauma and Orthopedics mortality and morbidity meeting. Overall, 89.19% of MRI scans were completed within 24 hours of request, while 10.81% exceeded this timeframe. Notably, 57% of patients did not undergo a comprehensive neurological examination on admission. Following these findings, a CES proforma was introduced to standardize the assessment process. In the subsequent cycle, documentation improved significantly, demonstrating the effectiveness of the intervention. Conclusion This QIP highlighted key areas requiring improvement, particularly the inconsistent completion of neurological examinations and delays in MRI access for suspected CES cases. Collaboration with the Emergency Department and radiology services led to the implementation of a CES assessment proforma, ensuring timely and consistent evaluation of patients. This structured approach supports earlier diagnosis, aligns with GIRFT standards, and enhances the quality and safety of CES management within our hospital.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00853-0?rss=yes">Neurons undergo IFNγ-driven persistent epigenetic shifts and synaptopathy in encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                Shammas et al. show a neuronal epigenetic remodeling during CNS encephalitis. This program involves IFNγ-driven persistent reduction in TF-binding site accessibility, linked to long-lasting reduction of synaptic gene expression and associated synaptopathy. Parallel findings in Rasmussen encephalitis patient neurons point toward a conserved cross-species mechanism.

These include a lack of appreciation of the history of the field and what has already been accomplished, and a lack of understanding of the pharmacology of psychedelics and 5-HT2A receptors. These gaps must be recognized, acknowledged and addressed in order for the field to advance responsibly.

                The majority of vertebrate promoters have a distinct DNA composition, known as a CpG island. Cytosine methylation in promoter CpG islands is associated with a substantial reduction of transcription initiation. We hypothesise that both atypical sequence composition and epigenetic base modifications may affect the mechanical properties of DNA in CpG islands, influencing the ability of proteins to bind and initiate transcription. In this work, we model two scalar measures of the sequence-dependent propensity of DNA to wrap into nucleosomes: the energy of DNA required to assume a particular nucleosomal configuration and a measure related to the probability of linear DNA spontaneously reaching the nucleosomal configuration. We find that CpG density and modification state can alter DNA mechanics by creating states more or less compatible with nucleosome formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104359">Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) regulates interferon-lambda receptor 1 (IFN-λR1) and IFN-λ signaling in influenza A virus (IAV) infection</a></h4>

              
                Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that has several known anti-influenza functions. However, the mechanisms in relation to its expression compartment and enzymatic activity have not been completely explored. Moreover, only limited animal models have been studied to delineate its role at the tissue level in influenza infections. Our results showed that influenza A virus (IAV)-infected <i>Plscr1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice exhibited exacerbated body weight loss, decreased survival rates, heightened viral replication, and increased lung damage. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that Plscr1 was required for the expression of type 3 interferon receptor (Ifn-λr1) upon IAV infection by binding to its promoter. In addition, PLSCR1 interacted with IFN-λR1 on the cell surface of pulmonary epithelial cells following IAV infection, suggesting it also modulated IFN-λ signaling via protein-protein interactions. The lipid scramblase activity of PLSCR1 was found to be dispensable for its anti-flu activity. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing data indicated that <i>Plscr1</i> expression was significantly upregulated in ciliated airway epithelial cells in mice following IAV infection. Consistently, <i>Plscr1<sup>floxStop</sup>;Foxj1-Cre<sup>+</sup></i>mice with ciliated epithelial cell-specific Plscr1 overexpression showed reduced susceptibility to IAV infection, less inflammation, and enhanced Ifn-λr1 expression, suggesting that Plscr1 primarily regulates type 3 IFN signaling as a cell-intrinsic defense factor against IAV in ciliated airway epithelial cells. Our research will elucidate virus-host interactions and pave the way for the development of novel anti-influenza drugs that target human elements like PLSCR1, thereby mitigating the emergence of drug-resistant IAV strains.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92443">Projection-specific integration of convergent thalamic and retrosplenial signals in the presubicular head direction cortex</a></h4>

              
                Head direction (HD) signals function as the brain’s internal compass. They are organized as an attractor and anchor to the environment via visual landmarks. Here, we examine how thalamic HD signals and visual information from the retrosplenial cortex combine in the presubiculum. We find that monosynaptic excitatory connections from anterior thalamic nucleus and from retrosplenial cortex converge on single layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal portion of mouse presubiculum. Independent dual-wavelength photostimulation of these inputs in slices leads to action potential generation preferentially for near-coincident inputs, indicating that layer 3 neurons can transmit a visually matched HD signal to medial entorhinal cortex. Layer 4 neurons, which innervate the lateral mammillary nucleus, form a second step in the association of HD and landmark signals. They receive little direct input from thalamic and retrosplenial axons. We show that layer 4 cells are excited di-synaptically, transforming regular spiking activity into bursts of action potentials, and that their firing is enhanced by cholinergic agonists. Thus, a coherent sense of orientation involves projection-specific translaminar processing in the presubiculum, where neuromodulation facilitates landmark updating of HD signals in the lateral mammillary nucleus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52513">Structural characterisation of chromatin remodelling intermediates supports linker DNA dependent product inhibition as a mechanism for nucleosome spacing</a></h4>

              
                Previously we showed that <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Chd1 chromatin remodelling enzyme associates with nucleosomes oriented towards the longer linker (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018) (1). Here we report a series of structures of Chd1 bound to nucleosomes during ongoing ATP-dependent repositioning. Combining these with biochemical experiments and existing literature we propose a model in which Chd1 first associates oriented to sample putative entry DNA. In an ATP-dependent reaction, the enzyme then redistributes to the opposite side of the nucleosome, where it subsequently adopts a conformation productive for DNA translocation. Once this active complex extends nascent exit linker to approximately 15bp, it is sensed by the Chd1 DNA binding domain resulting in conversion to a product inhibited state. These observations provide a mechanistic basis for the action of a molecular ruler element in nucleosome spacing.

                Aldosterone is a potent cholesterol-derived steroid hormone that plays a major role in controlling blood pressure via regulation of blood volume. The release of aldosterone is typically controlled by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, situated in the adrenal glands, kidneys, and lungs. Here, we reveal that the class A scavenger receptor MARCO, expressed on alveolar macrophages, negatively regulates aldosterone production and suppresses angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace) expression in the lungs of male mice. Collectively, our findings suggest alveolar macrophages as additional players in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and introduce a novel example of interplay between the immune and endocrine systems.

                What lies beneath is the “silent genocide” of deliberately using starvation to kill, its incidence so dire as it has become an emergency issue in contemporary international criminal law. This paper seeks to define starvation as a method of genocide, explore the various problems which arise from demonstrating the requisite criminal intent under the 1948 Genocide Convention. In many wars, hunger is used as a weapon to destroy targeted groups by depriving them of essential resources. Faced both with pivotal legal challenges which arise from the governing frameworks, from the evidentiary dilemma of establishing intent, and the liability limitations of the international courts, the study sets out key questions that we will address. The paper thus demonstrates major flaws in current mechanisms through a comparative analysis of court proceedings, from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the International Criminal Court’s involvement in crises in Darfur, Gaza, and Yemen. This research calls for immediate legal changes and better-armed judges, allowing for the identification and prosecution of starvation as a form of genocide.

                Background Fractional calculus has gained significant attention due to its applications in modeling complex systems. This paper introduces several fundamental fractional operators, including the Riemann–Liouville, Caputo, and Hadamard operators. From these, a novel α-generalized fractional operator is derived, which plays a crucial role in solving fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs). Methods The α-generalized operator is analytically constructed and its properties are rigorously proven. It is then integrated with the Daftardar–Jafari iterative method (DJM) to solve both linear and nonlinear FPDEs. The convergence of the proposed method is established using the Lipschitz condition. Two benchmark equations—the linear fractional Burger’s equation and the nonlinear fractional Heat-type equation—are used to demonstrate the method’s applicability. MATLAB is employed to implement the numerical schemes and visualize the results. Results The DJM combined with the α-generalized operator yields superior numerical results compared to the Adomian decomposition method. This superiority is evident in both accuracy and convergence, especially for the nonlinear fractional Heat-type equation. Tabulated results and graphical comparisons confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach across different values of α. Conclusions The integration of the α-generalized operator with the Daftardar–Jafari method provides a powerful tool for solving FPDEs. Its numerical advantages make it a promising alternative to existing methods. The study recommends extending this framework to other fractional operators, iterative schemes, and potential transformation techniques, with applications in quantum physics, fluid dynamics, and beyond.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1436/v1?src=rss">Assessing the Role of lncRNA GAS5 in Thyroid Function Regulation and Their Potential Use as Biomarkers for Hyperthyroidism Management [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important regulators of cellular processes, including those implicated in autoimmune and endocrine disorders. However, their role in thyroid function, particularly hyperthyroidism, remains insufficiently defined. Growth Arrest-Specific 5 (GAS5) is a lncRNA with established functions in tumor suppression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, and may therefore influence thyroid cell regulation and hormone production. This study aimed to assess the expression of GAS5 in patients with hyperthyroidism and evaluate its potential utility as a biomarker. Thirty whole-blood samples from hyperthyroid patients and 20 samples from healthy controls were analyzed. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol, and complementary DNA (CDNA) was synthesized with oligo(dT) primers. GAS5 expression was quantified by qRT-PCR, and statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA, correlation testing, and visualization in R. GAS5 expression was significantly decreased in hyperthyroid patients compared with controls (mean 0.429 vs. 1.004, p < 0.0001), with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Approximately 77% of patient samples showed expression levels below one. Pairwise comparisons confirmed highly significant differences between groups (p = 0.0001). Spearman correlation revealed an inverse relationship between GAS5 and T3 (r = –0.454, p = 0.001) as well as T4 (r = –0.438, p = 0.001).These findings indicate that GAS5 downregulation is associated with increased thyroid hormone production, suggesting a potential regulatory role in hyperthyroidism. GAS5 expression could therefore represent a promising early biomarker for individuals at risk of thyroid dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1435/v1?src=rss">Employing Fixed-Point Theory for Fuzzy Regression Analysis: Methodology and Empirical Application [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Traditional fuzzy regression approaches, such as Tanaka’s fuzzy minimum method and fuzzy least squares, often lack theoretical guarantees of existence, uniqueness, and numerical stability. These limitations are of paramount importance in engineering applications involving uncertainty, such as predicting the compressive strength of concrete. This study addresses these issues by presenting a mathematically rigorous fuzzy regression model, based on fixed-point theory, formulated within the full metric space of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers using the metric scale d ∞ . Methodology We define a shrinkage coefficient on the trapezoidal fuzzy coefficient vector space and prove, using Banach’s fixed-point theory, the existence and uniqueness of the regression solution. An iterative algorithm is constructed to estimate the coefficients, using alpha computation and Lipschitz continuity to ensure convergence. The University of California, Irvine concrete compressive strength dataset was amplified using ASTM and ACI-based uncertainty coefficients, and the proposed fixed-point model was evaluated against the Tanaka method and least-squares fuzzy regression. Performance was assessed by mean squared error (MSE), coefficient ambiguity, convergence behavior, and toughness under ±5% noise. Results The proposed method demonstrated consistent geometric convergence with an average of 12.3 iterations and zero divergence across all experiments. It also reduced the overall mean squared error by an average of 12.5%, and by up to 25.1% at best, compared to the comparator methods. Coefficient ambiguity—measured by ambiguity width—was reduced by 18.3% compared to the Tanaka method and by 13.3% compared to ambiguity squares. Under noise perturbation, the model exhibits a significantly smaller increase in the mean error (+6.2%) compared to the Tanaka approach (+24.7%) and the LS-based approach (+18.3%), indicating a substantial improvement in robustness. Conclusions Incorporating fuzzy regression within a fixed-point theoretical framework helps resolve the stability, existence, and singularity challenges that have long plagued classical fuzzy regression models. The proposed approach offers a mathematically consistent, computationally stable, uncertainty-aware regression tool suitable for engineering applications involving imprecise measurements. Future work includes extending the model to nonlinear fuzzy structures, Gaussian/LR fuzzy representations, and broader applications in data-driven prediction under uncertainty.

                Background This cross-sectional study assessed the impact of long-term use of skin-whitening products containing corticosteroids on the function of the adrenal glands. Objectives To assess the impact of extended use of corticosteroid-based whitening creams on serum cortisol levels and to examine the prevalence of adrenal suppression among habitual users. Methods This research, executed at the Hawija Technical Institute from January to April 2025, included 57 participants aged 20 to 40. Before enrolling, all participants gave their written consent. Individuals with chronic endocrine disorders or those receiving systemic corticosteroids were excluded. They were split into two groups: 38 regular (14 male and 24 female) users of skin-whitening creams (≥3 months) as the experimental group and 19 (7 male and 12 female) non-users as the control group. The Mindray CL-900i, a fully automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer, was used to measure the levels of cortisol in the serum. Results In comparison to controls (7.85 ± 3.54 μg/dL; p = 0.0004), users had a significantly lower mean cortisol level (4.25 ± 2.23 μg/dL), with 42% of users exhibiting cortisol <5 μg/dL, indicating adrenal suppression. There were no discernible variations in BMI between the groups or between male and female users. These results show that extended exposure to corticosteroids suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Conclusions Using skin-whitening creams that contain corticosteroids too often can make the adrenal glands work less well. It is suggested that public health measures be used to inform users about endocrine risks and to control these products.

                Abstract* Background Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) represents the most prevalent form of thyroid malignancy worldwide, with increasing incidence rates observed across various populations. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in numerous malignancies, with its encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) playing a crucial role in modulating host gene expression, particularly microRNAs. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) has emerged as a significant oncogenic regulator in various cancers. Objectives This study was designed to investigate the involvement of EBNA1 in the regulation of miRNA-155 in PTC and to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of miR-155 in Iraqi patients. Materials and Methods A case-control study was conducted involving 100 histologically confirmed PTC patients and 100 nodular goiter controls recruited from Baghdad, Iraq, between March 2024 and August 2024. Expression levels of EBNA1 and miR-155 were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Statistical analyses included correlation assessment, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results EBNA1 positivity was higher in PTC cases (82%) compared to controls (41%) (p < 0.001), Both miR-155 and EBNA1 expression levels were significantly elevated in PTC cases, with mean values of 5.38 ± 2.50 and 24.3 ± 11.96, respectively, compared to controls (1.51 ± 1.25 and 15.9 ± 19.20, p < 0.0001). However, correlation analysis revealed a weak negative relationship between miR-155 and EBNA1 expression (r = -0.031, p = 0.758). ROC analysis demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance of miR-155 with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.927, sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 87%. Conclusion EBNA1 appears to play a regulatory role in miR-155 expression in PTC, despite the absence of a direct linear correlation. MiR-155 demonstrates strong potential as a diagnostic biomarker for PTC in Iraqi patients, warranting further investigation into its therapeutic implications.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>After fear conditioning, repeated presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS) alone produces a context-dependent extinction of learned fear. The hippocampus has a critical role in this process, but the mechanism by which contextual information encoded by the hippocampus leads to fear suppression is unknown. We hypothesize that contextual information encoded by the dorsal hippocampus supports the recall of extinction memory by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the oscillatory coherence and directional coupling of the hippocampus and mPFC during context-dependent extinction retrieval in a previously published experiment. In this experiment, male and female rats were subjected to auditory fear conditioning followed by fear extinction and extinction retrieval procedures. Previous analyses focused on oscillatory coupling during the CS; here, we performed new analyses to assess hippocampal-prefrontal coupling in the context in which extinction occurred. We found that, after extinction, re-exposing the animals to the extinction context produces a marked increase in dorsal hippocampal theta (6–8 Hz) oscillations. This increase was associated with enhanced coherence between the dHPC and the prelimbic (PL), but not the infralimbic (IL), division of the mPFC. Moreover, Granger causality analyses revealed that hippocampal theta oscillations preceded theta in the PL throughout the extinction retrieval session. This effect emerged during exposure to the extinction context and persisted during the presentation of the CSs and the expression of freezing behavior. Interestingly, this pattern of coherence was not observed between the dHPC and the IL. These results suggest that oscillatory coupling between the dorsal hippocampus and PL facilitates the context-dependent retrieval of the extinguished fear memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-822/v2?src=rss">Women Entrepreneurs and Innovation Strategies: Driving Inclusive Fintech Business Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This review examines how women entrepreneurs can drive financial technology (fintech) business growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. While fintech is expanding rapidly across the region, the unique role of women-led ventures in promoting innovation and inclusive growth has been underexplored. A narrative literature review of studies from 2015 to 2025 was conducted, with qualitative findings analyzed thematically. Results show that women entrepreneurs leverage mobile technology, AI, blockchain, digital payments, and innovation hub collaborations to enhance market access, financial inclusion, and capacity building. Nonetheless, persistent challenges such as limited digital literacy, regulatory barriers, gender biases, and a lack of gender-disaggregated data constrain sustainable growth and adoption of women-led fintech ventures. These findings highlight the need for targeted policy measures to improve women’s access to finance, technology, and networks, strengthening inclusive fintech ecosystems across Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, empowering women entrepreneurs is critical for fostering equitable and sustainable fintech innovation in the region.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103324">DendroTweaks, an interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Neurons rely on the interplay between two critical components, dendritic morphology and ion channels, to transform synaptic inputs into a sequence of somatic spikes. Detailed biophysical models with active dendrites have been instrumental in exploring this interaction. However, such models can be challenging to understand and validate due to the large number of parameters involved. In this work, we introduce <i>DendroTweaks</i>, a toolbox designed to make detailed biophysical models with active dendrites more intuitive and more interactive. <i>DendroTweaks</i> features a web-based graphical interface, where users can explore single-cell neuronal models and adjust their morphological and biophysical parameters with real-time visual feedback. In particular, <i>DendroTweaks</i> focuses on subcellular properties, such as kinetics and distribution of ion channels, as well as the dynamics and placement of synaptic inputs. The toolbox supports various experimental protocols designed to illuminate how morpho-electric properties map to dendritic events and how these dendritic events shape neuronal output, thereby enhancing model validation. It helps users build high-level, modular model representations and includes a rich set of tools for parsing, generating, and standardizing commonly used neuronal data formats. Finally, it enables model simplification through a built-in morphology reduction algorithm, allowing users to export models for further use in faster, more interpretable networks. By combining extensive visualization capabilities and comprehensive data management functionality, <i>DendroTweaks</i> introduces a novel interactive approach for unraveling dendritic dynamics. This approach will accelerate research on dendritic computations, their underlying mechanisms, and their fundamental role in brain function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106415">Regional heterogeneities of oligodendrocytes underlie biased Ranvier node spacing along single axons in sound localization circuit</a></h4>

              
                Spacing of Ranvier nodes along myelinated axons is a critical determinant of conduction velocity, influencing spike arrival timing and hence neural circuit function. In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization. Using this model, we investigated the potential factors underlying the biased nodal spacing pattern. 3D morphometry revealed that these axons were almost fully myelinated by oligodendrocytes exhibiting distinct morphologies and cell densities across regions after hearing onset. The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density. Our findings highlight the importance of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in fine-tuning neural circuit function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99426">Functional genomics reveals strain-specific genetic requirements conferring hypoxic growth in Mycobacterium intracellulare</a></h4>

              
                <i>Mycobacterium intracellulare</i> is a major etiological agent of the recently expanding <i>Mycobacterium avium–intracellulare</i> complex pulmonary disease (MAC-PD). Therapeutic regimens that include a combination of macrolides and antituberculous drugs have been implemented with limited success. To identify novel targets for drug development that accommodate the genomic diversity of <i>M. avium–intracellulare</i>, we subjected eight clinical MAC-PD isolates and the type strain ATCC13950 to genome-wide profiling to comprehensively identify universally essential functions by transposon sequencing (TnSeq). Among these strains, we identified 131 shared essential or growth-defect-associated genes by TnSeq. Unlike the type strain, the clinical strains showed increased requirements for genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the type VII secretion system under standard growth conditions, the same genes required for hypoxic pellicle-type biofilm formation in ATCC13950. Consistent with the central role of hypoxia in the evolution of <i>M. intracellulare</i>, the clinical MAC-PD strains showed more rapid adaptation to hypoxic growth than the type strain. Importantly, the increased requirements of hypoxic fitness genes were confirmed in a mouse lung infection model. These findings confirm the concordant genetic requirements under hypoxic conditions in vitro and hypoxia-related conditions in vivo and highlight the importance of using clinical strains and host-relevant growth conditions to identify high-value targets for drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106184">Mac-/Lactosylceramide regulates intestinal homeostasis and secretory cell fate commitment by facilitating Notch signaling</a></h4>

              
                Cell-to-cell communication via Delta-Notch signaling is widely used in various tissues and organs to regulate development and patterning; however, the mechanisms regulating Notch signaling for precise cell fate decisions remain poorly understood. Similar to mammals, the intestinal stem cells in the adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut generate both absorptive and secretory cell progeny, guided by differential levels of Notch activation. Here we performed a forward genetic screen in <i>Drosophila</i> and identified glucosylceramide synthase (GlcT), a rate-limiting enzyme for glycosphingolipid (GSL) production, whose mutation causes the development of secretory cell tumors. Genetic analysis of the GSL synthesis pathway, combined with metabolite rescue experiments, revealed that the tumor formation is linked to a deficiency in Mactosylceramide/Lactosylceramide. This deficiency impaired the endocytic recycling of the Delta, subsequently reducing Notch signaling activation. Conditional knockout of <i>Ugcg</i>, the mammalian ortholog of <i>GlcT</i>, in mouse small intestine caused an excessive differentiation of goblet cells, phenotypes similar to these caused by Notch inhibition. Our study suggests an evolutionarily conserved role for a specific GSL metabolite in modulating Notch signaling during stem cell fate decisions and provides a molecular connection between ceramide metabolism and Notch signaling in regulating tissue homeostasis and tumor formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107021">Cryptovaranoides is not a squamate</a></h4>

              
                Accurate reconstruction of the timescale of organismal evolution requires placement of extinct representatives among living branches. In this way, the fossil record has the capacity to revise hypotheses of organismal evolution by producing representatives of clades that far pre-date the age of the clade inferred using phylogenies built from molecular data and previous fossil calibrations. Recently, one fossil with the potential to drastically change current understanding surrounding the timescale of reptile diversification was described from Triassic fissure-fill deposits in the United Kingdom. This taxon, †<i>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</i>, was originally placed deep within the squamate crown clade, suggesting that many lineages of living lizards and snakes must have appeared by the Triassic and implying long ghost lineages that paleontologists and molecular phylogeneticists have failed to detect using all other available data. Our team challenged this identification and instead suggested †<i>Cryptovaranoides</i> had unclear affinities to living reptiles, but a crown-squamate interpretation was later re-iterated by the team that originally described this species. Here, we again challenge the morphological character codings used to support a crown squamate affinity for †<i>Cryptovaranoides microlanius</i> and illustrate several empirical problems with analyses that find this taxon is a crown squamate. Our analyses emphasize the importance of stringency in constructing hypodigms of fossils, particularly when they may be key for proper time calibration of the Tree of Life.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107018">Vascular endothelial-specific loss of TGF-beta signaling as a model for choroidal neovascularization and central nervous system vascular inflammation</a></h4>

              
                In mice, postnatal endothelial cell (EC)-specific knockout of the genes coding for transforming growth factor-beta receptor (TGFBR)1 and/or TGFBR2 eliminates TGF-beta signaling in vascular ECs and leads to distinctive central nervous system (CNS) vascular phenotypes. Knockout mice exhibit (1) reduced intraretinal vascularization, (2) choroidal neovascularization with occasional anastomoses connecting choroidal and intraretinal vasculatures, (3) infiltration of diverse immune cells into the retina, including macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells, (4) a close physical association between immune cells and retinal vasculature, (5) a pro-inflammatory transcriptional state in CNS ECs, with increased ICAM1 immunoreactivity, and (6) increased smooth muscle actin immunostaining in CNS pericytes. Comparisons of the retinal phenotype with two other genetic models of retinal hypovascularization – loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling and loss of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling – show that the immune cell infiltrate is greatest with loss of TGF-beta signaling, more modest with loss of Norrin/Fzd4 signaling, and undetectable with loss of VEGF signaling. The phenotypes caused by loss of TGF-beta signaling in ECs recapitulate some of the cardinal features of retinal and neurologic diseases associated with vascular inflammation. These observations suggest that therapies that promote TGF-beta-dependent anti-inflammatory responses in ECs could represent a promising strategy for disease modulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105782">Predictive modeling of hematoma expansion from non-contrast computed tomography in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage patients</a></h4>

              
                Hematoma expansion is a consistent predictor of poor neurological outcome and mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An incomplete understanding of its biophysiology has limited early preventative intervention. Transport-based morphometry (TBM) is a mathematical modeling technique that uses a physically meaningful metric to quantify and visualize discriminating image features that are not readily perceptible to the human eye. We hypothesized that TBM could discover relationships between hematoma morphology on initial Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and hematoma expansion. 170 spontaneous ICH patients enrolled in the multi-center international Virtual International Trials of Stroke Archive (VISTA-ICH) with time-series NCCT data were used for model derivation. Its performance was assessed on a test dataset of 170 patients from the Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study. A unique transport-based representation was produced from each presentation NCCT hematoma image to identify morphological features of expansion. The principal hematoma features identified by TBM were larger size, density heterogeneity, shape irregularity, and peripheral density distribution. These were consistent with clinician-identified features of hematoma expansion, corroborating the hypothesis that morphological characteristics of the hematoma promote future growth. Incorporating these traits into a multivariable model comprising morphological, spatial, and clinical information achieved an AUROC of 0.71 for quantifying 24 hr hematoma expansion risk in the test dataset. This outperformed existing clinician protocols and alternate machine learning methods, suggesting that TBM detected features with improved precision than by visual inspection alone. This pre-clinical study presents a quantitative and interpretable method for discovery and visualization of NCCT biomarkers of hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Because TBM has a direct physical meaning, its modeling of NCCT hematoma features can inform hypotheses for hematoma expansion mechanisms. It has potential future application as a clinical risk stratification tool.

                Trained Immunity is the nonspecific (pathogen agnostic) memory of innate immune cells, characterized by altered responses upon secondary stimulation. This review provides a RoadMap for the discovery and development of therapeutics targeting Trained Immunity, aimed at researchers with strong scientific backgrounds but limited drug development experience. The article outlines five drug development domains – epigenetic, metabolic, differentiation, inflammatory, and memory changes – that guide the identification of molecular targets, model selection, and biomarker development for the discovery and development of Trained Immunity-based therapeutics. It emphasizes the application of preclinical models and artificial intelligence in target discovery and compound screening. Additionally, the review addresses challenges in translating preclinical Trained Immunity findings to clinical trials and highlights relevant disease indications and ongoing clinical trials. This review integrates scientific findings with development strategy and thereby aims to bridge the gap between discovery and clinical application, advancing the field of Trained Immunity-based therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108748">Are peer reviewers influenced by their work being cited?</a></h4>

              
                Peer reviewers sometimes comment that their own journal articles should be cited by the journal article under review. Comments concerning relevant articles can be justified, but comments can also be unrelated coercive citations. Here, we used a matched observational study design to explore how citations influence the peer review process. We used a sample of more than 37,000 peer reviews from four journals that use open peer review and make all article versions available. We find that reviewers who were cited in versions after version 1 were more likely to make a favourable recommendation (odds ratio = 1.61; adjusted 99.4% CI: 1.16–2.23), whereas being cited in the first version did not improve their recommendation (odds ratio = 0.84; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.69–1.03). For all versions of the articles, the reviewers who commented that their own articles should be cited were less likely to recommend approval compared to the reviewers who did not, with the strongest association after the first version (odds ratio = 0.15; adjusted 99.4% CI: 0.08–0.30). Reviewers who included a citation to their own articles were much more likely to approve a revised article that cited their articles compared to a revised article that did not (odds ratio = 3.5; 95% CI: 2.0–6.1). Some reviewers’ recommendations depend on whether they are cited or want to be cited. Reviewer citation requests can turn peer review into a transaction rather than an objective critique of the article.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104375">Computer prediction and genetic analysis identifies retinoic acid modulation as a driver of conserved longevity pathways in genetically diverse Caenorhabditis nematodes</a></h4>

              
                Discovery of new compounds that ameliorate the negative health impacts of aging promises to be of tremendous benefit across a number of age-based comorbidities. One method to prioritize a testable subset of the nearly infinite universe of potential compounds is to use computational prediction of their likely anti-aging capacity. Here, we present a survey of longevity effects for 16 compounds suggested by a previously published computational prediction set, capitalizing upon the comprehensive, multi-species approach utilized by the <i>Caenorhabditis</i> Intervention Testing Program. While 11 compounds (aldosterone, arecoline, bortezomib, dasatinib, decitabine, dexamethasone, erlotinib, everolimus, gefitinib, temsirolimus, and thalidomide) either had no effect on median lifespan or were toxic, 5 compounds (all-trans retinoic acid, berberine, fisetin, propranolol, and ritonavir) extended lifespan in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. These computer predictions yield a remarkable positive hit rate of 30%. Deeper genetic characterization of the longevity effects of one of the most efficacious compounds, the endogenous signaling ligand all-trans retinoic acid (atRA, designated tretinoin in medical products), demonstrated a requirement for the regulatory kinases AKT-1 and AKT-2. While the canonical Akt-target FOXO/DAF-16 was largely dispensable, other conserved Akt-targets (Nrf2/SKN-1 and HSF1/HSF-1), as well as the conserved catalytic subunit of AMPK AAK-2, were all necessary for longevity extension by atRA. Our results highlight the potential of combining computational prediction of longevity interventions with the power of nematode functional genetics and underscore that the manipulation of a conserved metabolic regulatory circuit by co-opting endogenous signaling molecules is a powerful approach for discovering aging interventions.

                Declining rates of male fertility pose a significant clinical challenge, while the mechanisms underlying testicular interstitial function remain incompletely understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of the murine testicular interstitium across the postnatal lifespan. The investigation unveiled a previously unrecognized population of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells nestled within the interstitium, hinting at their potential as Leydig cell progenitors. With the aging process of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells, we observed a decline in glutathione levels within the testicular interstitium. Remarkably, these Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells exhibited clonogenic self-renewal capacity and a robust propensity to differentiate into Leydig cells. Intriguingly, when transplanted into Leydig cell-disrupted or failure models, Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> cells efficiently colonized the testicular interstitium, resulting in a notable increase in testosterone production. Exploring the epigenetic landscape, we identified critical transcription factors, most notably Sox4, governing the stem cell fate of Cd34<sup>+</sup>/Sox4<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal cells. Overall, this comprehensive lifespan-resolved single-cell atlas of testicular interstitial cells provides fundamental insights into Leydig cell progenitor biology and regenerative capacity during aging.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102874">GPR30 in spinal cholecystokinin-positive neurons modulates neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain, a major health problem affecting 7–10% of the global population, lacks effective treatment due to its elusive mechanisms. Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal neurons was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Moreover, GPR30 was expressed in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons that received direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons and S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78118?af=R">Senescent Cell Clearance Ameliorates Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Associated Spatial Memory Deficits in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The pharmacological treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a disorder characterized by recurrent seizures and cognitive dysfunction, is limited to symptomatic control. Identifying novel targets to modify disease progression is of great clinical and translational interest. Cellular senescence has been recently implicated in the development and progression of other neurodegenerative diseases, but its role in TLE is unstudied.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We first investigated cellular senescence markers in resected hippocampi from patients with medically intractable TLE through multiplexed immunofluorescence. We next used a mouse model of TLE (pilocarpine induced status epilepticus [SE]) for a combination of immunohistochemistry, behavioral testing, and electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. We implemented 2 strategies for removal of senescent cells (SCs), a genetic mouse model allowing for targeted senolysis, and a pharmacological approach using dasatinib and quercetin.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found a 5-fold elevation of senescent glia in human TLE cases as compared with controls. In mice, we found increases in senescence markers at both the transcript and protein level and predominantly expressed in microglia, which developed within 2 weeks following SE.

                <p>Mice offer a wealth of opportunities for investigating brain circuits regulating multiple behaviors, largely due to their genetic tractability. Social behaviors are translationally relevant, considering both mice and humans are highly social mammals, and human social behavior disruptions are key symptoms of myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. Stresses related to social experiences are particularly influential in the severity and maintenance of neuropsychiatric disorders like anxiety disorders and trauma and stressor-related disorders. Yet, induction and study of social stress in mice has disproportionately focused on males, influenced heavily by their inherent territorial nature. Social target-instigated stress (i.e., defeat), while ethologically relevant, is quite variable and predominantly specific to males, making rigorous and sex-inclusive studies challenging. In pursuit of a controllable, consistent, high-throughput, and sex-inclusive method for social stress elicitation, we modified a paradigm to train male and female F1 129S1/SvlmJ <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> C57BL/6J mice to associate (via classical conditioning) same or different sex C57BL/6J targets with a mild, aversive stimulus. While further paradigm optimization is required, social interaction testing 24&nbsp;h after conditioning indicates males socially conditioned better to male targets by exhibiting reduced social interaction, whereas females appeared not to form social stimulus associations. Serum corticosterone levels inversely corresponded to social avoidance after different sex, but not same sex, conditioning, suggesting corticosterone-mediated arousal influences cross-sex interactions. These rigorously controlled null outcomes align with past pursuits&rsquo; limited success in creating a sex-inclusive social stress paradigm.</p>

                Background Lipid deposits on rigid corneal lenses pose significant challenges, impacting visual clarity, lens comfort, and ocular health. Despite advancements in lens materials and cleaning systems, lipid deposition remains a persistent issue, influenced by individual physiological factors and external conditions. This case report explores the composition, influencing factors, and management strategies for lipid deposits through two distinct presentations. Methods Case 1 involved a jelly-like, white, deposits coating the lens surface, whereas, case 2 described localized, irregular, peripheral lipid clusters. Both cases underwent thorough evaluation, including slit-lamp microscopy and spectroscopic analysis, to characterize the deposits’ morphology and composition. These assessments, combined with detailed patient histories, revealed the multifactorial nature of lipid deposition. Results Management strategies were customized for each case, with both approaches successfully reduced lipid deposition, improved lens performance, and enhanced patient satisfaction. This report underscores the importance of a personalized, multifaceted approach to managing lipid deposits on rigid corneal lenses. Conclusions Identifying contributing factors such as tear film abnormalities, material properties, and patient behaviours is critical for effective management. The findings highlight the need for continued innovation in lens material technology and cleaning systems to address this common issue.

                The fixed-point iteration method is a powerful tool in analysis and its extensions in other branches. It provides a unified structure for proving existence and uniqueness results for various nonlinear problems. This study, conducted within the scope of a real Banach space enriched by uniform convexity, presents an accelerated four-step iterative scheme designed to approximate elements of the fixed-point set corresponding to a mapping called a total asymptotically nonexpansive (briefly, TAN) mapping. The results of weak and strong convergence for the proposed method are established. The results relating to weak convergence require Opial’s condition of the normed space, while the results relating to strong convergence require the addition of the semi-compactness assumption of the mapping under consideration to the previous assumptions. Additionally, numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the algorithm’s effectiveness and compare it with previously established approaches. These findings extend and refine several recent contributions available in the literature. Lastly, the work includes an application to 2- dimensional equations.

                Background Class III malocclusion presents unique challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Bone-anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP) and facemask (FM) therapy are common approaches. Finite element analysis (FEA) helps evaluate their biomechanical effects. The study aims to evaluate and compare the stress distribution and displacement during maxillary protraction on the craniofacial complex using bone-anchored maxillary protraction and a facemask using finite element analysis. Methods A finite element model of the maxillofacial complex was developed using CT scans of a young human skull and analyzed using ANSYS (v18.1). The material properties for facemask therapy and miniplates used in bone-anchored maxillary protraction (BAMP), were gathered to create a 3D finite element analysis (FEA) model. Displacement and stress patterns were assessed in the maxilla, maxillary teeth, mandible, and surrounding structures for both BAMP and facemask therapy, applying a bilateral force of 300 grams. Results Displacement was mainly observed in the maxillary complex for both protocols, with BAMP showing more anterior displacement than the facemask. In contrast, the mandible experienced greater downward and backward displacement with the facemask protocol. Both methods revealed distinct displacement patterns in the dentoalveolar area. The facemask treatment resulted in more forward displacement of the maxillary anterior teeth, while BAMP primarily caused forward displacement in the first and second molar regions. Additionally, BAMP showed higher stress levels in the craniofacial area, particularly at the miniplate attachment site, whereas the Facemask approach had a more even distribution of stress across the craniofacial region. Conclusion This finite element analysis indicates that maxillary protraction can be achieved through both FM and BAMP methods. However, BAMP method showed greater skeletal displacement with fewer dental effects. This implies that skeletal anchorage might provide a better result for treating class III malocclusion.

                Background This socio-economic analysis studies the influence of jasmine production on the economic well-being of farmers in Huvina Hadagali, a region known for its high-quality jasmine flowers. The Vijaya Nagara district’s Havina Hadagali area is well known throughout the country for its jasmine flower farming. In addition to being referred to as Mallige Nadu, this location is also known as Malligeya Tavaru. The cultivation of the jasmine flower is protected by the Geographical Indication (GI) Tag, and this flower has been popular in this region for a substantial amount of time. Methods Data was collected from a sample of 364 jasmine growers using a structured questionnaire in Huvina Hadagali, Vijayanagar district. The data focused on different socio-economic factors such as income levels, employment, market access, and agricultural techniques. The study is analysed using IBM SPSS through frequency analysis and 2-step clustering. Result The results demonstrate that the cultivation of jasmine makes a substantial contribution to the local economy, serving as a main or additional source of income for numerous households. Jasmine farming often contributes 40% of the whole household income, and during peak seasons, it provides significant economic advantages. Nevertheless, the highlighted obstacles were volatile market pricing, pest infestations, and limited access to contemporary farming practices. Due to their decades of experience, it is felt by the farmers. Hadagali Jasmine comes under the GI Tag, hence they are authorised farmers. The study emphasises the crucial significance of cooperative societies and local marketplaces in stabilising income and offering essential resources and training to farmers. Conclusion The research highlights the necessity of governmental interventions focused on developing market infrastructure, offering financial assistance, and improving access to agricultural innovations to maintain and augment the economic advantages of jasmine cultivation in Huvina Hadagali which also lead to an overall development of floriculture in India.

                Background Continuous exposure to sunlight and pollution without adequate protection can damage skin, making it prone to premature aging. One of the natural ingredients for anti-aging is antioxidant. Malang green apple (Malus sylvestris Mill) contains bioactive compounds that can act as antioxidants, but its use is still limited to only as food ingredient. Furthermore, some studies show the potency of fruit fermentation to increase these bioactive compounds. Thus, this study is a preliminary study to examine the anti-aging potency of fermented Malang green apples. Methods Human foreskin fibroblasts were treated with fermented Malang green apple juice extract (FAJ) by Lactobacillus plantarum DAD-13 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fermipan and its unfermented (AJ) for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay and collagen deposition was measured using the Sirius red staining method. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) and collagen type 1 alpha 1 chain (COL1A1) was measured in fibroblasts after treatment with extracts. Results Cell viability and collagen deposition of fibroblasts tended to be higher after 48 h of extract exposure. Fibroblasts that received FAJ 62.5 μg/mL showed higher cell viability than negative control (p <0.05) and FAJ 31.25 μg/mL showed higher collagen deposition than negative control (p <0.05) at 48 hours of extract exposure. AJ and FAJ also decreased MMP-1 gene expression. They showed a significant decrease in MMP-1 levels (p <0.01) compared to the untreated group, whereas they showed increased expression of COL1A1 at low concentrations. There was no significant difference in the gene expression between FAJ and AJ. Conclusions Our results indicated that Malang green apple juice extract affected fibroblast cell viability, collagen deposition, MMP-1, and COL1A1 gene expression. Exposure of lower concentrations of FAJ to skin fibroblasts for 48 hours showed better results.

                <p>by Marika Constant, Elisa Filevich, Pascal Mamassian</p>

According to the Bayesian framework, both our perceptual decisions and confidence about those decisions are based on the precision-weighted integration of prior expectations and incoming sensory information. While it is generally assumed that priors influence both decisions and confidence in the same way, previous work has found priors to have a stronger impact at the confidence level, challenging this assumption. However, these patterns were found for high-level probabilistic expectations that are flexibly induced in the task context. It remains unclear whether this generalizes to low-level perceptual priors that are naturally formed through long term exposure. Here we investigated human participants’ confidence in decisions made under the influence of a long-term perceptual prior: the slow-motion prior. Participants viewed tilted moving-line stimuli for which the slow-motion prior biases the perceived motion direction. On each trial, they made two consecutive motion direction decisions followed by a confidence decision. We contrasted two conditions – one in which the prior impacted discrimination performance, and one in which it did not. We found a confidence bias favoring the condition in which the prior influenced discrimination decisions, even after accounting for performance differences. Computational modeling revealed this effect to be best explained by confidence using the prior-congruent evidence as an additional cue, beyond the posterior evidence used in the perceptual decision. This is in agreement with a confirmatory confidence bias favoring evidence congruent with low-level perceptual priors, revealing that, in line with high-level expectations, even long-term priors have a greater influence on the metacognitive level than on perceptual decisions.

                <p>by Nishant Joshi, Sven van Der Burg, Tansu Celikel, Fleur Zeldenrust</p>

Neuronal classification based on morphology, electrophysiology, and molecular markers is often considered static. Here, we challenge this view, showing that functional classification depends on input patterns. Using single-cell recordings from layer 2/3 barrel cortex neurons in mice, we compared responses to step-and-hold versus dynamic frozen noise inputs that mimic presynaptic activity. Action potential and waveform-based classifications varied significantly, highlighting the dynamic nature of neuronal identity. To assess the contribution of input versus neuronal attributes toward classification, we analyzed four attribute sets, namely action potential, passive biophysical, adaptation currents, and linear input filters derived via spike-triggered averages (STA). Our findings revealed that the STA, which captures a neuron’s selective responsiveness to presynaptic activity, explained the most variance within the population. This highlights input-driven dynamics as key to functional identity, emphasizing the need for physiologically relevant inputs in defining neuronal classes and shifting the focus from static properties to dynamic functional diversity.

                <p>by Romain Enjalbert, Jakub Köry, Timm Krüger, Miguel O. Bernabeu</p>

The tumour microvasculature is abnormal, and as a consequence oxygen and drug transport to the tumour tissue is impaired. The abnormal microvasculature contributes to tumour tissue hypoxia, as well as to varying drug penetration depth in the tumour. Many anti-cancer treatments require the presence of oxygen to be fully efficacious, however the question of how well oxygen concentration overlaps with drug concentration is not elucidated, which could compromise the therapeutic effect of these drugs. In this work we use a computational model of blood flow and oxygen transport, and develop a model for an oxygen-dependent drug, T-DM1, to study the overlap of oxygen and drug concentration in tumour tissue, where we model both compressed and uncompressed vessels in the tumour. Our results show that, due to the compressed vessels present in tumours, areas of sufficient oxygen concentration for a drug to function overlap poorly with areas of sufficient drug concentration, covering 28% of the tumour tissue, compared to 82% in healthy tissue. The reduction in drug and oxygen overlap is due to the altered red blood cell dynamics through the abnormal microvasculature, and indicates that drug transport to tumours should not be considered independently of oxygen transport in cases where the drug requires oxygen to function.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1133/v2?src=rss">A comparative analysis of the amount of fluoride release, recharge and re-release after uptake in three light-cure orthodontic bonding adhesives – An in-vitro study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Fluoride-releasing adhesives in orthodontics help protect enamel. The study compared the fluoride release, recharge, and re-release properties of three light-cure orthodontic bonding adhesives: Group A: TransbondTM Plus Color Change, Group B: Waldent Orthobond LC, and Group C: Koden EZ Bond. Methods The study conducted an in-vitro investigation using 24 maxillary first premolar teeth bonded with one of three fluoride-releasing adhesives after etching. Each sample was placed in artificial saliva, and fluoride release was measured over 60 days using a fluoride electrode. After initial release measurement, specimens were soaked in 1000 ppm fluoride solution for 5 minutes, rinsed, and placed in new containers with distilled water before re-release measurements. Statistical Analysis: One-way ANOVA and Repeated Measures ANOVA tests were used to determine significance, with the Bonferroni posthoc test for further analysis. Results The fluoride release rate decreased gradually over time for all three groups. The highest fluoride release occurred on Day 1 for all three bonding agents, with a significantly reduced fluoride release by Day 2. Group A exhibited consistent and highest overall fluoride release throughout the 60 days. Group B gradually declined to release fluoride until Day 7, releasing the least fluoride throughout the study. Group C had a higher fluoride release on Day 1 and Day 2 but slowly declined until Day 14. Group B and Group C sharply declined fluoride release by Day 30 and almost negligible amounts on Day 60. All three agents noted enhanced fluoride release post-recharge, with continuous release until day 14. Greater release on days 7 and 14 compared to the initial release in all three groups. Conclusion Transbond Plus Color Change: Consistent high fluoride was released initially and post-recharge. Waldent Orthobond LC: Lower release throughout the study. Koden EZ Bond: High initial release and post-recharge but continuing to decrease until Day 14.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.70056?af=R">Examining the Three‐Dimensional Spatial Architecture of Mouse Amygdala Engram Ensembles</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Memories are stored in a sparse population of neurons active at the time of an event, an engram ensemble, and reactivation of the engram ensemble drives memory recall. Although the amygdala is essential for fear memory encoding and recall, the precise spatial organization of engram neurons within amygdala nuclei remains an outstanding question. We hypothesized that the geometric architecture of an engram ensemble reflects its underlying function, thereby revealing novel organizational principles of memory coding. Using tissue clearing and light-sheet imaging, we mapped Arc-expressing neurons across the entire mouse amygdala in 3D to examine the spatial architecture of engram ensembles for aversive (shock) and valence-neutral (no shock) contextual memories during encoding and recall. At the meso-scale level, we identified distinct spatial “hotspots” of engram neuron density during that were differentially engaged during fear conditioning and fear memory retrieval across multiple amygdala nuclei. Notably, we also found shared spatial features during the retrieval of aversive and non-aversive contextual memories. At the micro-scale level, unsupervised clustering analyses showed that aversive learning and recall was associated with increased clustering of active neurons in the lateral (LA) and basal (BA) nuclei, and selectively in the central capsular nucleus (CeC) during aversive encoding. Network graphs derived from the spatial organization of active neurons revealed highly clustered and assortative local graph structures across conditions. Assortativity increased in the CeC during aversive learning, and hub nodes increased in the LA during aversive learning and recall, and in the CeC during aversive learning. Together, these results suggest that both meso- and micro-scale spatial signatures of neuronal activity differ across amygdala subregions and vary with memory valence and stage. Such structure may shape information flow through amygdala circuits, enhancing signal-to-noise and improving the fidelity of memory encoding and retrieval.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1428/v1?src=rss">Immersive Metaverse Learning Environment (IMLE) to Improve Social-Cognitive Skills in STEAM Learning in Elementary Schools [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The development of social-cognitive skills is increasingly important in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) learning at the elementary school level. Immersive Metaverse Learning Environments (IMLEs) offer students the opportunity to learn in interactive virtual spaces, but research on their integration into STEAM learning remains limited, particularly in enhancing cognitive, social, and collaborative aspects. Purpose This study aims to test the effectiveness of using IMLE technology in improving social-cognitive skills in STEAM learning in elementary schools. Design/Methodology/Approach This study employed a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative data were used to assess the effectiveness of IMLE in improving social-cognitive skills, while qualitative data explored student and teacher experiences through observations, interviews, and analysis of classroom learning activities. The study subjects included 50 elementary school students in Surabaya, Indonesia. Results The study findings showed significant improvements in students’ social-cognitive skills, including collaboration, problem-solving, empathy, communication, and learning motivation. Furthermore, the use of IMLE contributed to improved STEAM learning outcomes and enriched learning interactions. Originality/Value Research on the integration of IMLE into STEAM learning in elementary schools is still rare, both in Indonesia and globally. This study demonstrates that IMLE effectively supports the development of social-cognitive skills while encouraging innovation in immersive technology-based learning practices. These findings provide valuable contributions to teachers in adopting interactive, student-centered learning media.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1427/v1?src=rss">Clinical Risk Factors and Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns of Multidrug Resistant Enterobacter cloacae Isolates from Hospitalized Patients. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Enterobacter cloacae is considered an important hospital-acquired pathogen associated with bloodstream, respiratory, and wound infections. Its increasing ability to acquire multidrug-resistant (MDR) traits poses a serious challenge for both infection control and therapeutic management. This study aimed to determine the antimicrobial resistance profiles, prevalence of MDR, and associated clinical risk factors of E. cloacae isolated from hospitalized patients. Methods Four hundred clinical specimens such as blood, pus, and sputum were collected between July 2024 and July 2025 from hospitalized patients suspected to have a bacterial infection. Risk-factor data were obtained through medical record review. Manual and automated identification with antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using the BD Phoenix™ automated microbiology system. Results Most infected patients with E. cloacae were male (64%) and aged 60 years or older (56%). Significant risk factors associated with MDR E. cloacae infections included prior antibiotic exposure (p = 0.008), hospitalization longer than 10 days (p = 0.021), and ICU admission (p = 0.034). All isolates (100%) were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin–clavulanate, cefazolin, and cefuroxime. Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime 70%, cefepime 70%, ceftriaxone 64%), along with ciprofloxacin (44%), levofloxacin (44%), and tigecycline (50%), showed high resistance rates, indicating reduced activity of major antibiotic classes. Imipenem resistance was detected in 34% of isolates, while amikacin (10%), meropenem (10%), and ertapenem (10%) retained good activity. Ceftolozane–tazobactam remained fully effective (100% susceptibility). The overall prevalence of MDR was 86%. Conclusion A high prevalence of MDR E. cloacae was identified among hospitalized patients, with strong associations to ICU stay, prolonged hospitalization, and prior antibiotic use. Despite widespread resistance to β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, ceftolozane–tazobactam, amikacin, meropenem, and ertapenem remain effective therapeutic options. The findings emphasize the importance of strengthening local antimicrobial stewardship programs and establishing region-specific surveillance data to guide empirical treatment and support infection-prevention strategies.

                Background One of the disadvantages of the multilayer perception (MLP), which is a machine learning (ML) algorithm used in various fields, includes the uncontrollable growth of the number of total parameters, which may make MLP redundant in such high dimensions, and the uncontrollable growing stack of layers that ignores spatial information. Optimization algorithms were developed to determine the optimum number of parameters for MLP. Methods In this paper, the performances of the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are compared. The study also sought to determine the impact of sample size variations on these optimization algorithms. A dataset on the direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with a sample size of 4 521 was used. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to balance the binary dependent variables for the training data across various sample sizes. Results Based on the classification accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, F-score, and execution time, the MLP based on CMA-ES (CMA-ES-MLP) was identified as the best classifier overall, as it maintained high rates of these classification metrics and was the second fastest to train. CMA-ES-MLP with a training sample of 5 114 was our ideal classifier, and it competes well with the classifiers that have been built by previous studies that used the same dataset. Conclusions The study found no consistent increase or decrease in the classification performance of the algorithms as the sample size increased, and the metrics fluctuated rapidly across sample sizes. It is recommended that future studies be conducted to compare the best-performing classifiers identified in previous studies with the CMA-ES-MLP in this study under the same experimental conditions.

                Background The diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) relies on clinical manifestations, as no definitive gold standard exists. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is emerging as a potential biomarker for diagnosing severe ITP. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of LDH and its correlation with clinical severity in ITP patients. Methods This prospective observational study included 62 patients diagnosed with primary or secondary ITP. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected, and serum LDH along with platelets were analyzed at recruitment. The diagnostic utility of serum LDH in distinguishing severe from non-severe ITP was evaluated. Results A total of 62 patients with ITP were studied, 64.5% had severe thrombocytopenia and 35.4% had non-severe thrombocytopenia. The median serum LDH level was significantly higher in severe ITP (276 [216–307]) compared to non-severe ITP (209 [184–275]), p=0.03. LDH showed a negative correlation with platelet count (ρ = -0.817, p = 0.01) and plateletcrit (p = -0.26, p = 0.03), while no correlation was observed with MPV. The cut-off value of LDH was 234U/L, with a specificity of 62.5% and sensitivity of 63.6%, respectively for diagnosing severe thrombocytopenia. Conclusion There was a significant elevation of serum LDH levels in patients with severe ITP compared to non-severe ITP.

                Background The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) provides a secure cloud-based environment where research and education communities can analyze genomic and biomedical data. The platform supports a wide range of data analysis as well as the ability to safely store and access data in compliance with NIH policies. The purpose of this study is to better understand the current user base of the AnVIL platform. Methods We conducted the AnVIL Community Poll to collect baseline information, identify development opportunities, guide the prioritization of user support strategies, and succinctly but comprehensively describe the current AnVIL Community. The poll was shared through social media and relevant mailing lists. Respondents were categorized as potential or returning users depending on their usage description. Results Our sample of the AnVIL community found opportunities for platform adoption beyond the current user base and identified areas where training should be enhanced, training preferences, and user computational needs. Specifically, while most respondents were involved in human genomics research, there may be potential for growth in adoption of the platform by prioritizing materials to support clinical researchers. All respondents felt availability of specific tools or datasets was a key feature of the platform. The broader community may also benefit from further development or showcasing of resources to facilitate cost management, finding and incorporating analysis tools, and data import. Our sample greatly preferred virtual training opportunities and returning users of the platform foresaw needing large amounts of storage. Conclusion This poll provided an insightful snapshot of the current state of the AnVIL and demonstrated areas where the AnVIL Team can take specific steps to address barriers related to platform adoption and further support the existing and varied AnVIL Community. This work can be built upon through user interviews, community discussion, and coordinating a recurring poll.

                Background A standby system is defined as a system consisting of several components, where only one component operates at a time while the others remain in standby mode. The system fails when the applied stress exceeds the strength of the active component, at which point one of the standby components is activated. It is assumed that the inactive components do not undergo any change in their properties while in standby mode, and the system is considered to have failed when all its components have failed. Methods In this study, a mathematical formula of the standby system was derived for more than one component. Y is subject to independent random variable Ψ with Distribution of stress, which is considered a combination of two exponentials and the stress. It follows the following distributions: one-parameter exponential, two-parameter exponential, one parameter Lindley, and two-parameter generalized exponential. Hence, the dependent functions of the standby system are found { R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) , R ( 4 ) , R 4 } depending on the mathematical formulas derived for each of the four distributions mentioned above. Results In this section, we will obtain the stress-strength of standby Reliability system R 4 , based on four different distributions the above mentioned, the standby Reliability functions R ( 2 ) for distributions are given by adding Marginal Reliability R ( 1 ) and R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) given by adding R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) and R ( 3 ) . Also R 4 given by adding R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) and R ( 4 ) , and parameters estimator by maximum likelihood. Conclusions a simulation study will be conducted to see the behavior of { R ( 1 ) , R ( 2 ) , R ( 3 ) , R ( 4 ) , R 4 } of a standby system for four different distributions, in this simulation study will be conducted to see the estimator for all distributions and compare the results by using one important statistical criteria mean square error (MSE). Then results will be discussed to see which one of the estimators is the best for each one of the distributions separately.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78117?af=R">The Phenotypic Spectrum of Sporadic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob Disease Cortical Subtype</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of the rare sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cortical subtype (sCJDMM/MV2C) in a large multicentric autopsy cohort.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated clinical histories, biofluid markers, brain diffusion-weighted (DW)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG) findings in 56 patients. The histomolecular assessment included misfolded prion protein (PrP) typing by immunoblotting, histopathology, and PrP immunohistochemistry in several brain areas.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Misfolded PrP typing showed a dominant 19 kDa unglycosylated PrP fragment (type 2) in all brains, focally associated with a 21 kDa (type 1) fragment in 53% of participants (MM/MV2C + 1). Immunohistochemistry revealed coarse/perivacuolar PrP deposits in the neocortices and a patchy/coarse pattern in the cerebellar molecular layer. The mean disease duration was 16.0 months. At onset and early stages, most patients manifested only progressive cognitive decline, consistent with the predominant distribution and relative severity of spongiform change in the cerebral cortex. Brain DW-MRI showed cortical hyperintensities in 94% of cases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay was positive in 70% of cases. Compared with pure MM/MV2C, the mixed MM/MV2C + 1 phenotype showed a shorter disease duration (14 vs 19 months), and a higher frequency of striatal DW-MRI hyperintensity (56% vs 19%), EEG periodic sharp-waves complexes (41% vs 6%), and CSF RT-QuIC positivity (86% vs 53%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The clinicopathologic phenotype of sCJDMM/MV2C diverges from that of typical sCJDMM/MV1. Moreover, the histomolecular heterogeneity within MM/MV2C influences clinical features and results of diagnostic investigations, challenging its identification in vivo. Nonetheless, results suggest that DW-MRI and CSF RT-QuIC allow an accurate clinical diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in most patients. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1422/v1?src=rss">Strengthening bioinformatics education: e-learning initiatives across ELIXIR Nodes and Communities [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The rapid evolution of bioinformatics and data-driven life sciences necessitates widespread, effective training solutions capable of transcending geographical and institutional boundaries. ELIXIR, as a pan-European bioinformatics research infrastructure, has strategically embraced e-learning methodologies to meet this challenge. This white paper systematically reviews the current landscape of e-learning initiatives across various ELIXIR Nodes and Communities, detailing both historical developments and contemporary practices. It identifies core attributes and desirable features of effective e-learning, presenting an analysis of diverse educational platforms and the deployment of Learning Management Systems (LMS) within ELIXIR’s framework. Emphasis is placed on the interactive, open-access, and sustainable nature of these resources, exemplified by platforms such as the Training e-Support System (TeSS) and the ELIXIR-SI eLearning Platform (EeLP). The paper highlights critical advancements toward standardization and interoperability through initiatives such as the adoption of SCORM protocols, facilitating resource reuse across Nodes. Additionally, the integration of e-learning into broader educational strategies—such as hybrid learning environments and structured learning paths—is examined. Finally, future directions are discussed, including strategies for integrating e-learning with traditional training methods, enhancing trainer expertise, and further expanding the availability and FAIRification of bioinformatics training resources.

                Abstract* Background Fresh produce is a vital vehicle for the transmission of foodborne pathogens, yet data from low- and middle-income countries on contamination levels and associated health risks remain scarce. Methods This study provided an analysis of Listeria species contamination in 208 fruit and vegetable samples from major geopolitical regions in Nigeria. Conventional microbiological techniques and molecular methods were used for the analysis. Results We reported a high prevalence (38.5%) and substantial bacterial loads (up to 8.33×102 CFU/25g) among the organically grown crops, with produce from Northern states exhibiting the highest contamination. Genetic characterisation revealed significant diversity, including novel strains and others closely related to global clones, confirming a resilient environmental presence. Importantly, antibiotic susceptibility testing uncovered alarming resistance rates to vancomycin (83.1%) and oxacillin (88.1%), with hierarchical clustering identifying distinct multidrug-resistant clusters. The presence of resistance genes (vanA, vanB, tetL, tetM) and the virulence gene hly was confirmed. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA), incorporating this empirical data, estimated the annual probability of illness, highlighting high-risk produce-region combinations. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that fresh produce in Nigeria is a significant reservoir of pathogenic, antimicrobial-resistant L. monocytogenes, posing a serious public health threat. This study highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions, including enhanced agricultural water safety and strengthened surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, to mitigate risks and support evidence-based food safety policies in Nigeria and similar regions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1420/v1?src=rss">Effect of Corruption, Inequality, and Unemployment on Poverty in South African Perspective: Evidence from Quantile Regression Model. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background introduction Corruption has emerged to the point where it is underreported but in reality, it haunts many people daily, especially in public offices. In South Africa the corruption take place in most government institutions, government administration at top level, middle and lower level of government. Corruption benefits the few and harm the majority of people living as lower income households. The economic literature has little evidence of the connection between corruption and poverty. Many studies have concentrated on the causal effect of poverty on corruption, not vice versa. Method This study extends the literature on corruption to investigate the impact of corruption on poverty from a South African perspective. Other control variables such as the Gini coefficient and unemployment were considered equally. Secondary data stretching from 2000 to 2021 were selected based on data availability it was then converted to quarterly data (poverty and corruption). The study used the quantile regression model, descriptive statistics table and data trends of the selected variables. Results The results of the quantile regression model indicate that corruption has a positive and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles (25th, 50th, and 75th). Moreover, income inequality has a positive, dominant, and significant effect on poverty at all quantiles, and unemployment equally causes poverty at all quantiles. This imply that socio-economic issues are a threat that exacerbate poverty in South Africa. Conclusion The study argues that policymakers should invest in youth development programs concerning entrepreneurship, education and support women cooperatives and small businesses to reduce the high dependency ratio of people on state services and to reduce high inequality and unemployment rates. The study was limited to investigate the causal effect that run from corruption to poverty only and not on the other way around.

                Background High-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) has gained interest as an adjunctive therapy in cancer care due to its pro-oxidative antioxidative and cytotoxic effects. Despite growing research, a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence on the efficacy and safety of HDIVC in advanced solid tumors remains limited. Materials and Methods This review will follow the six steps of the Arksey and O’Malley framework, as adapted by Levac et al, namely: identifying the research question, identifying relevant studies, study selection eligibility, charting the data, collating, summarizing and reporting the results, and consultation. PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases will be used for the search of articles from 2000 – 2025. Grey literature will also be conducted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and the Meta-Analysis for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) will be used as a guide for this scoping review protocol. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine the eligibility of articles with two independent reviewers. Discrepancies will be handled by consensus or by consulting an expert in cancer care. The selection of studies for the review is anticipated to be completed within 12 weeks, from 01 October to 31 December 2025. The extracted data will be analyzed and presented in a report. Conclusion This scoping review will consolidate evidence on HDIVC for advanced solid tumors, identifying efficacy outcomes, safety profiles, and patient experiences limited to African adult populations and other global studies applicable to African settings in African populations that will inform clinical practice and guide policy making. Ethics and Dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. However, the results of this search will be disseminated through academic presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1324/v2?src=rss">Systematic review  of ethnomedicinal knowledge: Documentation, evaluation, and conservation of medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Ethnomedicine and ethnobotany constitute key fields for understanding how different cultures document, use, and transmit knowledge related to medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications. In recent decades, growing scientific interest has highlighted their potential contributions to healthcare systems, biodiversity conservation, and the preservation of cultural heritage. However, the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into modern medicine faces persistent challenges, particularly the lack of standardized documentation protocols and rigorous scientific validation. In this context, the present systematic review aims to assess the documentation, evaluation, and conservation of medicinal plants and their therapeutic applications across diverse cultural settings. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, using Scopus, EBSCO, and Web of Science databases to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2007 and 2024. Seventy studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed thematically to identify trends, methodological approaches, and research gaps. The findings reveal a wide diversity of medicinal plants and ethnomedicinal practices, with a strong emphasis on the documentation and conservation of traditional knowledge. Nevertheless, significant gaps persist in terms of phytochemical, pharmacological, and clinical validation, as well as in the integration of ethnomedicinal knowledge into conservation and public health policies. The thematic analysis underscores the need for standardized methodological frameworks and multidisciplinary approaches to strengthen the scientific validation, conservation, and intergenerational transmission of ethnomedicinal knowledge, ensuring its relevance for modern medicine and sustainable development.

                Background The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among scuba divers in Saudi Arabia towards equipment infection control measures, protective guidelines measures and potential post COVID-19 infection complications. Methods A cross-sectional study using a pre-validated questionnaire was conducted. The questionnaire consisted of 35 close-ended questions, which covered the scuba divers’ profile and experience, the KAP of COVID-19 precautionary measures during diving activities as well as the demographic data and background of the scuba divers. KAP scores were subjected to non-parametric tests of statistical significance (Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis test). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Most of the 461 participants’ answers were in agreeance on the proper KAP of infection control during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a statistically significant difference in attitude between all the demographic and professional variables (p<0.05) except for gender and region of residence (p>0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant practice difference among age groups, education levels, and employee status in the diving center (p<0.05). Conclusions Our findings showed that scuba divers presented a good level of KAP of infection control measures against the spread of the coronavirus disease. Local officials and diving organizations need to continue their efforts in combating and control the spread of this pandemic.

<p>(A) Macroscopic connectome gradients were constructed for AD patients. (B) Gradient metrics, including gradient eccentricity and network median distance, were computed. The association between gradient values and rich-club organization was also investigated. Ultimately, we observed that the compression of cortical hierarchies in AD patients impacts cognitive function, potentially serving as a neuroimaging biomarker.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This investigation centered on Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive decline. Functional connectome gradient analysis was utilized to investigate alterations in the hierarchical architecture of brain networks in AD. The study cohort consisted of 222 subjects, encompassing 111 AD patients and 111 normal controls (NC). Connectome gradients were computed via a dimensionality reduction technique based on diffusion map embedding and analyzed at both the region of interest (ROI) and network levels. Additional connectome gradient metrics, including network median distance and gradient eccentricity, were calculated, and the relationship between connectome gradients and rich-club organization was assessed. These connectome gradient values were subsequently correlated with clinical cognitive scores. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the principal gradient range in AD patients. At the network level, gradient values exhibited an increase in the somatomotor (SMN) and visual networks (VIS), while decreasing in the default mode (DMN) and frontoparietal networks (FPN) relative to controls. Analyzes of network mean distance and gradient eccentricity further revealed compression of the brain cortical hierarchy in AD patients. Furthermore, rich-club analyzes indicated a reduction in the gradient value difference between hub and peripheral nodes in AD patients. Finally, clinical correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the degree of cognitive impairment and the degree of compression of the brain cortical hierarchy. These findings provide a novel perspective on the study of brain network organization in AD patients, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                The Alzheimer’s risk genes at the MS4A locus have poorly described function. Rosner et al. show that MS4A4A and MS4A6A cooperate to negatively regulate the TREM2 and TYROBP risk genes and microglia activity. MS4A4A antibodies increase TREM2 and beneficial microglia functions, suggesting therapeutic potential for this axis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109183">Cerebellar climbing fibers impact experience-dependent plasticity in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the cerebellum, climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals for supervised learning at parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses. It has not been tested so far whether CF signaling may also influence plasticity in other brain areas. Here, we show that optogenetic CF activation suppresses potentiation of whisker responses in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex of awake mice that is observed after repeated whisker stimulation. Using two-photon imaging and chemogenetics, we find that CFs control plasticity by modulating SST- and VIP-positive interneurons in S1 cortex. Transsynaptic labeling identifies zona incerta (ZI) to thalamic posterior medial nucleus projections as a pathway for cerebellar output reaching S1 cortex. Chemogenetic inhibition of PV-positive neurons in the ZI prevents CF co-activation effects, identifying the ZI as a critical relay. Our findings demonstrate that CFs impact sensory signal processing and plasticity in S1 cortex and thus may convey instructive signals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98117">Human EEG and artificial neural networks reveal disentangled representations and processing timelines of object real-world size and depth in natural images</a></h4>

              
                Remarkably, human brains have the ability to accurately perceive and process the real-world size of objects, despite vast differences in distance and perspective. While previous studies have delved into this phenomenon, distinguishing the processing of real-world size from other visual properties, like depth, has been challenging. Using the THINGS EEG2 dataset with human EEG recordings and more ecologically valid naturalistic stimuli, our study combines human EEG and representational similarity analysis to disentangle neural representations of object real-world size from retinal size and perceived depth, leveraging recent datasets and modeling approaches to address challenges not fully resolved in previous work. We report a representational timeline of visual object processing: object real-world depth processed first, then retinal size, and finally, real-world size. Additionally, we input both these naturalistic images and object-only images without natural background into artificial neural networks. Consistent with the human EEG findings, we also successfully disentangled representation of object real-world size from retinal size and real-world depth in all three types of artificial neural networks (visual-only ResNet, visual-language CLIP, and language-only Word2Vec). Moreover, our multi-modal representational comparison framework across human EEG and artificial neural networks reveals real-world size as a stable and higher-level dimension in object space incorporating both visual and semantic information. Our research provides a temporally resolved characterization of how certain key object properties – such as object real-world size, depth, and retinal size – are represented in the brain, which offers further advances and insights into our understanding of object space and the construction of more brain-like visual models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105627">Afadin-deficient mouse retinas exhibit severe neuronal lamination defects but preserve visual functions</a></h4>

              
                Neural lamination is a common feature of the CNS, with several subcellular structures, such as adherens junctions (AJs), playing a role in this process. The retina is also heavily laminated, but it remains unclear how laminar formation impacts retinal cell morphology, synapse integrity, and overall retinal function. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of afadin, a key component of AJs, in mice leads to significant pathological changes. These include the disruption of outer retinal lamination and a notable decrease as well as mislocalization of photoreceptors, their outer segments, and photoreceptor synapses. Interestingly, despite these severe impairments, we recorded small local field potentials, including the a- and b-waves. We also classified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) into ON, ON-OFF, and OFF types based on their firing patterns in response to light stimuli. Additionally, we successfully characterized the receptive fields of certain RGCs. Overall, these findings provide evidence that retinal circuit function can be partially preserved even when there are significant disruptions in both retinal lamination and photoreceptor synapses. Our results indicate that retinas with severely altered morphology still retain some capacity to process light stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105539">Structural basis for collagen recognition by the Streptococcus pyogenes M3 protein and its involvement in biofilm</a></h4>

              
                The M protein is an essential virulence factor of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, or group A streptococcus (GAS), one of the most common and dangerous human pathogens. Molecular and functional characterization of M protein variants and their interactions with host components is crucial for understanding streptococcal pathogenesis and vaccine development. The M3 protein is produced by the prevalent <i>emm</i>3 GAS serotype, which is frequently associated with severe invasive diseases. Here, we structurally and biochemically characterize the interaction of M3 with human collagens. High-resolution structures of the N-terminal M3 domain in the free state as well as bound to a collagen peptide derived from the Collagen Ligands Collection reveal a novel T-shaped protein fold that presents binding sites complementing the characteristic topology of collagen triple helices. The structure of the M3/collagen peptide complex explains how <i>emm</i>3 GAS and related streptococci, such as <i>Streptococcus dysgalactiae</i> subsp. <i>equisimilis</i>, can target collagens to enable colonization of various tissues. In line with this, we demonstrate that the M3/collagen interaction promotes enhanced biofilm formation of <i>emm</i>3 GAS in an <i>emm</i> type-specific manner, which can be inhibited with the recombinant N-terminal M3 domain. Further, <i>emm</i>3 GAS are shown to colocalize with collagen in tissue biopsies from patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections, where GAS biofilms are common. This observation is reproduced in infected organotypic skin models. Together, these data provide detailed molecular insights into an important streptococcal virulence mechanism with implications for the understanding of invasive infections, strategies for treating biofilm and M-protein-based vaccine design.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98817">Cone bipolar cell synapses generate transient versus sustained signals in parallel ON pathways of the mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Parallel processing is a fundamental organizing principle in the nervous system and understanding how parallel neural circuits generate distinct outputs from common inputs is a key goal of neuroscience. In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feedforward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and two-photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha retinal ganglion cells (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (types 5i, 6, and 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate that feedforward bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Modern robots face a challenge shared by biological systems: how to learn and adaptively express multiple sensorimotor skills. A key aspect of this is developing an internal model of expected sensorimotor experiences to detect and react to unexpected events, guiding self-preserving behaviors. Associative skill memories (ASMs) address this by linking movement primitives to sensory feedback, but existing implementations rely on hard-coded libraries of individual skills. A key unresolved problem is how a single neural network can learn a repertoire of skills while enabling integrated fault detection and context-aware execution. Here we introduce neural associative skill memories (neural ASMs), a framework that uses self-supervised temporal predictive coding to integrate skill learning and expression using biologically plausible local learning rules. Unlike traditional ASMs, which require explicit skill selection, neural ASMs implicitly recognize and express skills through contextual inference, enabling fault detection using “predictive surprise” across the entire learned repertoire. Compared to recurrent neural networks trained using backpropagation through time, our model achieves comparable qualitative performance in skill memory expression while using local learning rules and predicts a biologically relevant speed-versus-accuracy trade-off. By integrating fault detection, reactive control, and skill expression into a single energy-based architecture, neural ASMs contribute to safer, self-preserving robotics and provide a computational lens to study biological sensorimotor learning.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This paper offers a road map for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests on enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents’ world models, a problem that falls under structure learning (also known as causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry, and model reduction in structure learning and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. We then outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov’s laws of robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing, or design new, aligned structure learning systems.</span>

Given the high level of generality, our findings formally support the idea that the gradient is a fundamental object underlying all learning processes.

Detailed analysis indicates that a temporal hierarchy develops in the stacked RNN module under these optimal conditions. We argue that the model’s capacity for generalization across novel task configurations is supported by the structured interplay between working memory and the generation of self-directed language outputs during task execution. This interplay promotes internal representations that reflect task structure, which in turn support generalization by enabling a functional separation between content encoding and control dynamics within the memory architecture.</span>

                <p>by Veronika Petrova, Muqing Niu, Thomas S. Vierbuchen, Emily S. Wong</p>

Single-cell RNA-seq data from F1 hybrids provides a unique framework for dissecting complex regulatory phenomena, but allelic measurements are limited by technical noise due to low counts. Here, we present ASPEN, a statistical method for modeling allelic mean and variance in single-cell transcriptomic data from F1 hybrids. ASPEN combines a sensitive mapping pipeline and adaptive shrinkage to distinguish allelic imbalance and allelic variance in single cells. In both simulated and empirical datasets, ASPEN achieves a 30% increase in sensitivity over existing approaches for single cell allelic imbalance detection. Applied to mouse brain organoids and T cells, ASPEN identifies genes with incomplete X inactivation, stochastic monoallelic expression, and significant deviations in allelic variance. These results reveal reduced variance in essential pathways and increased variance at neurodevelopmental and immune genes.

                <p>by Fen Yan, ZhiHua Du, Yu-An Huang</p>

Developing computational methods for single-cell drug response prediction deepens our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and uncovers resistance mechanisms critical to improving cancer therapy. However, current approaches struggle to fully capture intratumoral heterogeneity, as bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) obscures heterogeneity across individual cells, while single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) remains constrained by limited throughput and high cost. Current approaches integrating bulk and scRNA-seq data frequently encounter batch effects, impairing robust knowledge transfer. Moreover, most existing methods overlook the role of intercellular interactions, treating cells as isolated entities. To overcome these limitations, we propose DAGFormer, a Graph-based Domain Adaptation framework that integrates bulk and scRNA-seq data for predicting single-cell drug responses. DAGFormer constructs cellular neighbor graphs using diverse topological strategies and employs Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) to bridge graph-level distribution gaps between bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. A dual-domain decoder further disentangles shared and modality-specific representations, preserving both general and unique biological signals. Benchmarking DAGFormer on ten independent scRNA-seq datasets demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in cancer drug response prediction.

                <p>by Jacob Bradford, Divya Joy, Mattias Winsen, Nicholas Meurant, Mackenzie Wilkins, Laurence O.W. Wilson, Denis C. Bauer, Dimitri Perrin</p>

Organisations are challenged when meeting the computational requirements of large-scale bioinformatics analyses using their own resources. Cloud computing has democratised large-scale resources, and to reduce the barriers of working with large-scale compute, leading cloud vendors offer serverless computing, a low-maintenance and low-cost model that provides ample resources for highly scalable software applications. While serverless computing has broad use, its adoption in bioinformatics remains poor. Here, we demonstrate the most extensive use of high-performance serverless computing for bioinformatics by applying the available technologies to CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) design. Our adaptation of the established gRNA design tool, named Crackling, implements a novel, cloud-native and serverless-based, high-performance computing environment using technologies made available by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The architecture, compatible with technologies from all leading cloud vendors, and the AWS implementation, contributes to an effort of reducing the barrier to large computational capacity in bioinformatics and for CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA design. Crackling Cloud can be deployed to any AWS account, and is freely available on GitHub under the BSD 3-clause license: https://github.com/bmds-lab/Crackling-AWS

                <p>by Lan Yang, Jiayu Lu, Xinran Wu, Xi Zhang, Ting Li, Ruiyun Chang, Songjun Peng, Dandan Li, Jie Zhang, Bin Wang</p>

Accurate simulation of the brain’s intrinsic dynamic activity is essential for understanding human cognition and behavior and developing personalized brain disease therapies. Traditional neurodynamics models depend on structural connectivity to explain the emergence of functional connectivity (FC). However, achieving high-fidelity simulations at the individual level remains challenging, as the models fail to fully capture the brain information. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stable Individualized Brain Computing Model (SI-BCM), a data-driven reverse engineering framework designed to infer spatiotemporal co-activity patterns from fMRI data for simulating whole-brain activity. This model captures the dynamic interactions between brain regions by integrating spatiotemporal dimensional information to extract a stable and shared connectivity pattern, representing the intrinsic functional collaboration pattern of the brain. This connectivity pattern is then used as the core connection weight in the dynamical system. Additionally, the model has a new cost function based on the Phase-Space Association matrix (PSA), enhancing its ability to capture brain activity dynamics. This combination enables the SI-BCM to improve simulation accuracy at the individual level compared to existing models, achieving a correlation coefficient between simulated and empirical FC of 0.87. The SI-BCM also showed enhanced robustness and reliability, and effectively captured brain properties. We found the model sensitively reflected changes in cognitive function, thereby providing valuable insights into the underlying neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the application of SI-BCM in the brain modeling of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients substantiated the hypothesis that AD pathogenesis may be due to excessive neuronal excitation. This work establishes a new paradigm for brain network modeling by prioritizing the inference of stable dynamics features from activity data, providing a powerful tool for understanding brain function and pathophysiology.
