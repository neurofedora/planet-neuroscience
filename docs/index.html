	<p>Acoustic noise is known to perturb reading for good readers, including children and adults. This external acoustic noise interfering at the multimodal areas in the brain causes difficulties reducing reading and writing performances. Moreover, it is known that people with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and dyslexia have reading deficits even in the absence of acoustic noise. The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of additional acoustic noise on an adult with DCD and dyslexia. Indeed, as vision is the main source of information for the brain during reading, a noisy internal visual crowding has been observed in many cases of readers with dyslexia, as additional mirror or duplicated images of words are perceived by these observers, simultaneously with the primary images. Here, we show that when the noisy internal visual crowding and an increasing external acoustic noise are superimposed, a reading disruptive threshold at about 50 to 60 dBa of noise is reached, depending on the type of acoustic noise for a young adult with DCD and dyslexia but not for a control. More interestingly, we report that this disruptive noise threshold can be controlled by Hebbian mechanisms linked to a pulse-modulated lighting that erases the confusing internal crowding images. An improvement of 12 dBa in the disruptive threshold is then observed with two types of acoustic noises, showing the potential utility of Hebbian optocontrol in managing reading difficulties in adults with DCD and dyslexia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1442/v1?src=rss">Impact of chlorine dioxide and chlorhexidine mouthwashes on friction and surface roughness of orthodontic stainless steel wires: an in-vitro comparative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives Good oral hygiene measures are important for successful orthodontic treatment. They involve various types of mouthwashes which have been reported to cause alteration of mechanical properties of archwires. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a new kind of chlorine-dioxide-containing mouthwash on the mechanical properties and surface morphology of stainless steel orthodontic archwires against the already prevalent chlorhexidine mouthwash in the market. Method Group A – Chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% (study), Group B – Chlorine Dioxide mouthwash (study), and Group C – Artificial Saliva (control). 42 specimens of 5 cm long 19x25 inch SS archwires were immersed in each group equally. Post immersion, the frictional force was analyzed in the universal testing machine for each group using custom-made acrylic jigs for 10 specimens. The remaining 4 specimens from each group were sent for surface morphology evaluation using an atomic force microscope. Results Friction resistance evaluation for the archwires revealed a mean friction of 0.011 ± 0.0056 in Group A, 0.015 ± 0.0052 in Group B, and 0.010 ± 0.0067 in Group C. Results suggested that the static friction of Group C (control group) was found to be the least when compared with the experimental groups, although not producing statistically significant values. Surface roughness of archwires compared at a 10μm range revealed a mean roughness of 19.38 ± 0.82 in Group A, 25.39 ± 7.01 in Group B, and 16.65 ± 3.07 in Group C which shows there wasn’t any statistically significant difference in the mean roughness midst the three sets. Conclusion Chlorine dioxide and Chlorhexidine mouthwashes caused an increase in the frictional resistance of the archwires when compared to the control group. This increase was statistically insignificant. When measured at a range of 10μm the mean surface roughness did not statistically differ across the control and the experimental groups.

                Hamamoto et al. report that disrupting the VPS37A ubiquitin E2 variant-like domain impairs autophagosome closure, resulting in milder autophagy-defective phenotypes in mice compared to those lacking upstream autophagy-related genes. They found that LC3-conjugated phagophores facilitate TBK1-dependent p62 phosphorylation, potentially alleviating proteotoxicity by sequestering protein aggregates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100764">Chromatin endogenous cleavage provides a global view of yeast RNA polymerase II transcription kinetics</a></h4>

              
                Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) is the most common approach to observe global binding of proteins to DNA in vivo. The occupancy of transcription factors (TFs) from ChIP-seq agrees well with an alternative method, chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC-seq2). However, ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq2 reveal strikingly different patterns of enrichment of yeast RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We hypothesized that this reflects distinct populations of RNAPII, some of which are captured by ChIP-seq and some of which are captured by ChEC-seq2. RNAPII association with enhancers and promoters - predicted from biochemical studies - is detected well by ChEC-seq2 but not by ChIP-seq. Enhancer/promoter-bound RNAPII correlates with transcription levels and matches predicted occupancy based on published rates of enhancer recruitment, preinitiation assembly, initiation, elongation, and termination. The occupancy from ChEC-seq2 allowed us to develop a stochastic model for global kinetics of RNAPII transcription which captured both the ChEC-seq2 data and changes upon chemical-genetic perturbations to transcription. Finally, RNAPII ChEC-seq2 and kinetic modeling suggests that a mutation in the Gcn4 transcription factor that blocks interaction with the NPC destabilizes promoter-associated RNAPII without altering its recruitment to the enhancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97827">CPT1A mediates radiation sensitivity in colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) are increasing worldwide. Radiation resistance hinders radiotherapy, a standard treatment for advanced CRC, leading to local recurrence and metastasis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying radioresistance in CRC is critical to enhance therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Bioinformatic analysis and tumour tissue examination were conducted to investigate the <i>CPT1A</i> mRNA and protein levels in CRC and their correlation with radiotherapy efficacy. Furthermore, lentiviral overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors, along with in vitro and in vivo radiation experiments, were used to explore the effect of CPT1A on radiosensitivity. Additionally, transcriptomic sequencing, molecular biology experiments, and bioinformatic analyses were employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CPT1A regulates radiosensitivity. CPT1A was significantly downregulated in CRC and negatively correlated with responsiveness to neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Functional studies suggested that CPT1A mediates radiosensitivity, influencing reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and DNA damage response. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses highlighted the involvement of the peroxisomal pathway. Mechanistic exploration revealed that CPT1A downregulates the FOXM1-SOD1/SOD2/CAT axis, moderating cellular ROS levels after irradiation and enhancing radiosensitivity. CPT1A downregulation contributes to radioresistance in CRC by augmenting the FOXM1-mediated antioxidant response. Thus, CPT1A is a potential biomarker of radiosensitivity and a novel target for overcoming radioresistance, offering a future direction to enhance CRC radiotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95172">Spinal V1 inhibitory interneuron clades differ in birthdate, projections to motoneurons, and heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord interneurons play critical roles shaping motor output, but their precise identity and connectivity remain unclear. Focusing on the V1 interneuron cardinal class we defined four major V1 subsets in the mouse according to neurogenesis, genetic lineage-tracing, synaptic output to motoneurons, and synaptic inputs from muscle afferents. Sequential neurogenesis delineates different V1 subsets: two early born (Renshaw and Pou6f2) and two late born (Foxp2 and Sp8). Early born Renshaw cells and late born Foxp2-V1 interneurons are tightly coupled to motoneurons, while early born Pou6f2-V1 and late born Sp8-V1 interneurons are not, indicating that timing of neurogenesis does not correlate with motoneuron targeting. V1 clades also differ in cell numbers and diversity. Lineage labeling shows that the Foxp2-V1 clade contains over half of all V1 interneurons, provides the largest inhibitory input to motoneuron cell bodies, and includes subgroups that differ in birthdate, location, and proprioceptive input. Notably, one Foxp2-V1 subgroup, defined by postnatal Otp expression, is positioned near the LMC and receives substantial input from proprioceptors, consistent with an involvement in reciprocal inhibitory pathways. Combined tracing of ankle flexor sensory afferents and interneurons monosynaptically connected to ankle extensors confirmed placement of Foxp2-V1 interneurons in reciprocal inhibitory pathways. Our results validate previously proposed V1 clades as unique functional subtypes that differ in circuit placement, with Foxp2-V1 cells forming the most heterogeneous subgroup. We discuss how V1 organizational diversity enables understanding of their roles in motor control, with implications for their diverse ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92380">Whole-brain in situ mapping of neuronal activation in Drosophila during social behaviors and optogenetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring neuronal activity at single-cell resolution in freely moving <i>Drosophila</i> engaged in social behaviors is challenging because of their small size and lack of transparency. Extant methods, such as Flyception, are highly invasive. Whole-brain calcium imaging in head-fixed, walking flies is feasible but the animals cannot perform the consummatory phases of social behaviors like aggression or mating under these conditions. This has left open the fundamental question of whether neurons identified as functionally important for such behaviors using loss- or gain-of-function screens are actually active during the natural performance of such behaviors, and if so during which phase(s). Here, we perform brain-wide mapping of active cells expressing the Immediate Early Gene <i>hr38</i> using a high-sensitivity/low background fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplification method called HCR-3.0. Using double-labeling for hr38 mRNA and for GFP, we describe the activity of several classes of aggression-promoting neurons during courtship and aggression, including P1<sup>a</sup> cells, an intensively studied population of male-specific interneurons. Using HI-FISH in combination with optogenetic activation of aggression-promoting neurons (opto-HI-FISH), we identify candidate downstream functional targets of these cells in a brain-wide, unbiased manner. Finally, we compare the activity of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons during sequential performance of courtship and aggression, using intronic vs. exonic <i>hr38</i> probes to differentiate newly synthesized nuclear transcripts from cytoplasmic transcripts synthesized at an earlier time. These data provide evidence suggesting that different subsets of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons may be active during courtship vs. aggression. HI-FISH and associated methods may help to fill an important lacuna in the armamentarium of tools for neural circuit analysis in <i>Drosophila</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96017">A deep learning approach for automated scoring of the Rey–Osterrieth complex figure</a></h4>

              
                Memory deficits are a hallmark of many different neurological and psychiatric conditions. The Rey–Osterrieth complex figure (ROCF) is the state-of-the-art assessment tool for neuropsychologists across the globe to assess the degree of non-verbal visual memory deterioration. To obtain a score, a trained clinician inspects a patient’s ROCF drawing and quantifies deviations from the original figure. This manual procedure is time-consuming, slow and scores vary depending on the clinician’s experience, motivation, and tiredness. Here, we leverage novel deep learning architectures to automatize the rating of memory deficits. For this, we collected more than 20k hand-drawn ROCF drawings from patients with various neurological and psychiatric disorders as well as healthy participants. Unbiased ground truth ROCF scores were obtained from crowdsourced human intelligence. This dataset was used to train and evaluate a multihead convolutional neural network. The model performs highly unbiased as it yielded predictions very close to the ground truth and the error was similarly distributed around zero. The neural network outperforms both online raters and clinicians. The scoring system can reliably identify and accurately score individual figure elements in previously unseen ROCF drawings, which facilitates explainability of the AI-scoring system. To ensure generalizability and clinical utility, the model performance was successfully replicated in a large independent prospective validation study that was pre-registered prior to data collection. Our AI-powered scoring system provides healthcare institutions worldwide with a digital tool to assess objectively, reliably, and time-efficiently the performance in the ROCF test from hand-drawn images.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100433">Telomerase RNA component knockout exacerbates Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia by extensive inflammation and dysfunction of T cells</a></h4>

              
                The telomerase RNA component (Terc) constitutes a non-coding RNA critical for telomerase function, commonly associated with aging and pivotal in immunomodulation during inflammation. Our study unveils heightened susceptibility to pneumonia caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus</i>) in <i>Terc</i> knockout (<i>Terc</i><sup>ko/ko</sup>) mice compared to both young and old infected counterparts. The exacerbated infection in <i>Terc</i><sup>ko/ko</sup> mice correlates with heightened inflammation, manifested by elevated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels and activation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome within the lung. Employing mRNA sequencing methods alongside in vitro analysis of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and T cells, our study elucidates a compelling correlation between <i>Terc</i><sup>ko/ko</sup>, inflammation, and impaired T cell functionality. <i>Terc</i> deletion results in compromised T cell function, characterized by dysregulation of the T cell receptor and absence of CD247, potentially compromising the host’s capacity to mount an effective immune response against <i>S. aureus</i>. This investigation provides insights into the intricate mechanisms governing increased vulnerability to severe pneumonia in the context of Terc deficiency, which might also contribute to aging-related pathologies, while also highlighting the influence of Terc on T cell function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90875">Modeling corticotroph deficiency with pituitary organoids supports the functional role of NFKB2 in human pituitary differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Deficient Anterior pituitary with common Variable Immune Deficiency (DAVID) syndrome results from <i>NFKB2</i> heterozygous mutations, causing adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (ACTHD) and primary hypogammaglobulinemia. While NFKB signaling plays a crucial role in the immune system, its connection to endocrine symptoms is unclear. We established a human disease model to investigate the role of <i>NFKB2</i> in pituitary development by creating pituitary organoids from CRISPR/Cas9-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Introducing homozygous <i>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></i> missense pathogenic variant in hiPSC, an allele found in congenital isolated ACTHD, led to a strong reduction of corticotrophs number in pituitary organoids. Then, we characterized the development of organoids harboring <i>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></i> mutations found in DAVID patients. <i>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></i> mutation acted at different levels of development with mutant organoids displaying changes in the expression of genes involved on pituitary progenitor generation (<i>HESX1</i>, <i>PITX1</i>, <i>LHX3</i>), hypothalamic secreted factors (<i>BMP4, FGF8, FGF10</i>), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, lineage precursors development (<i>TBX19</i>, <i>POU1F1</i>) and corticotrophs terminal differentiation (<i>PCSK1, POMC</i>), and showed drastic reduction in the number of corticotrophs. Our results provide strong evidence for the direct role of <i>NFKB2</i> mutations in the endocrine phenotype observed in patients leading to a new classification of a <i>NFKB2</i> variant of previously unknown clinical significance as pathogenic in pituitary development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85635">Evaluating hippocampal replay without a ground truth</a></h4>

              
                During rest and sleep, memory traces replay in the brain. The dialogue between brain regions during replay is thought to stabilize labile memory traces for long-term storage. However, because replay is an internally-driven, spontaneous phenomenon, it does not have a ground truth - an external reference that can validate whether a memory has truly been replayed. Instead, replay detection is based on the similarity between the sequential neural activity comprising the replay event and the corresponding template of neural activity generated during active locomotion. If the statistical likelihood of observing such a match by chance is sufficiently low, the candidate replay event is inferred to be replaying that specific memory. However, without the ability to evaluate whether replay detection methods are successfully detecting true events and correctly rejecting non-events, the evaluation and comparison of different replay methods is challenging. To circumvent this problem, we present a new framework for evaluating replay, tested using hippocampal neural recordings from rats exploring two novel linear tracks. Using this two-track paradigm, our framework selects replay events based on their temporal fidelity (sequence-based detection), and evaluates the detection performance using each event's track discriminability, where sequenceless decoding across both tracks is used to quantify whether the track replaying is also the most likely track being reactivated.

">Resting-state functional connectivity and fast spindle temporal organization contribute to episodic memory consolidation in healthy aging</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory consolidation relies on the functional specialization of brain networks and sleep quality, both of which are affected by aging. Functional connectivity during wakefulness is crucial to support the integration of newly acquired information into memory networks. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of sleep spindles facilitates overnight memory consolidation by promoting hippocampal replay and integration of memories within neocortical structures. This study aimed at exploring how resting-state functional connectivity during wakefulness contributes to sleep-dependent memory consolidation in aging, and whether spindles clustered in trains modulates this relationship. Forty-two healthy older adults (mean = 68.82, sd = 3.03 years), enrolled in the Age-Well clinical trial, were included. Sleep-dependent memory consolidation was assessed using a visuo-spatial memory task performed before and after a polysomnography night. Resting-state functional connectivity data were analyzed using graph theory applied to the whole brain, specific brain networks and the hippocampus. Lower limbic network integration and higher centrality of the anterior hippocampus were associated with better memory consolidation. Spindle trains modulated these effects, such that older participants with longer spindle trains exhibited a stronger negative association between limbic network integration and memory consolidation. These results indicate that lower functional specialization at rest is associated with weaker memory consolidation during sleep. This aligns with the dedifferentiation hypothesis, which posits that aging is associated with reduced brain specificity, leading to less efficient cognitive functioning. These findings reveal a novel mechanism linking daytime brain network organization and sleep-dependent memory consolidation, and suggest that targeting spindle dynamics could help preserve cognitive functioning in aging.

">st-DenseViT: A Weakly Supervised Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer for Dense Prediction of Dynamic Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Modeling dynamic neuronal activity within brain networks enables the precise tracking of rapid temporal fluctuations across different brain regions. However, current approaches in computational neuroscience fall short of capturing and representing the spatiotemporal dynamics within each brain network. We developed a novel weakly supervised spatiotemporal dense prediction model capable of generating personalized 4D dynamic brain networks from fMRI data, providing a more granular representation of brain activity over time. Methods: We developed a model that leverages the vision transformer (ViT) as its backbone, jointly encoding spatial and temporal information from fMRI inputs using two different configurations: space-time and sequential encoders. The model generates 4D brain network maps that evolve over time, capturing dynamic changes in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In the absence of ground-truth data, we used spatially constrained windowed independent component analysis (ICA) components derived from fMRI data as weak supervision to guide the training process. The model was evaluated using large-scale resting-state fMRI datasets, and statistical analyses were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the generated dynamic maps using various metrics. Results: Our model effectively produced 4D brain maps that captured both inter-subject and temporal variations, offering a dynamic representation of evolving brain networks. Notably, the model demonstrated the ability to produce smooth maps from noisy priors, effectively denoising the resulting brain dynamics. Additionally, statistically significant differences were observed in the temporally averaged brain maps, as well as in the summation of absolute temporal gradient maps, between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. For example, within the Default Mode Network (DMN), significant differences emerged in the temporally averaged space-time configurations, particularly in the thalamus, where healthy controls exhibited higher activity levels compared to subjects with schizophrenia. These findings highlight the model's potential for differentiating between clinical populations. Conclusion: The proposed spatiotemporal dense prediction model offers an effective approach for generating dynamic brain maps by capturing significant spatiotemporal variations in brain activity. Leveraging weak supervision through ICA components enables the model to learn dynamic patterns without direct ground-truth data, making it a robust and efficient tool for brain mapping. Significance: This work presents an important new approach for dynamic brain mapping, potentially opening up new opportunities for studying brain dynamics within specific networks. By framing the problem as a spatiotemporal dense prediction task in computer vision, we leverage the spatiotemporal ViT architecture combined with weakly supervised learning techniques to efficiently and effectively estimate these maps.

                Introduction Tau hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play important roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Isoliquiritigenin, a natural flavonoid isolated from the root of liquorice, has been shown to exert inhibitory effects on oxidative stress. Here, we assessed the neuroprotective effects of isoliquiritigenin on a streptozotocin-injected mouse model. Method Molecular docking analysis performed for isoliquiritigenin with mTOR and ERK2. The mice (n = 27, male) were intracerebroventricularly injected with streptozotocin, treated with isoliquiritigenin (intraperitoneal, 2 days) and assessed using the Morris water maze. Oxidative stress, tau phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic impairment were evaluated in the cortex and hippocampal tissues of the mice by using biochemical assays and immunofluorescence staining. Results Isoliquiritigenin treatment mitigated the spatial memory capacity of streptozotocin-injected mice and alleviated tau phosphorylation at Ser396; the production of reactive oxygen species; the mitochondrial fission proteins Mfn1 and Mfn2; neuronal loss; and synaptic impairment (PSD95, SNAP25). Isoliquiritigenin treatment reduced the levels of mTOR Ser2448 and ERK1/2 T202/Y204 and upregulated the level of GSK-3{beta}Ser9 in the cortex and hippocampus of streptozotocin-injected mice. Conclusion In conclusion, our findings suggest that isoliquiritigenin ameliorates streptozotocin-induced cognitive impairment, hyperphosphorylated tau, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic impairment by decreasing mTOR and ERK activity and increasing GSK-3{beta} activity.

                Seizure duration, a characteristic of epilepsy that is understudied in relation to its relationship with rhythmic cycles, provides critical insights into the severity and temporal dynamics of seizures. This study investigates the rhythmic patterns of seizure duration in the Tetanus Toxin (TT) rat model of epilepsy. Our analysis shows significant cyclical patterns in seizure durations, with periods ranging from 4 to 8 days across rats. The synchronization index and circular-linear correlations revealed phase-locked relationships between seizure durations and cycles, suggesting non-random, predictable temporal dynamics. Further analyses examined the relationship between seizure durations, inter-seizure intervals, and dominant EEG power. The findings highlight that seizure durations exhibit predictable rhythms, which could transform seizure prediction and enable time-based intervention strategies, ultimately improving epilepsy management and patient outcomes. These insights lay the groundwork for personalized, rhythm-aware therapeutic approaches.

">How the layer-dependent ratio of excitatory to inhibitory cells shapes cortical coding in balanced networks</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex exhibits a sophisticated neural architecture across its six layers. Recently, it was found that these layers exhibit different ratios of excitatory to inhibitory (EI) neurons, ranging from 4 to 9. This ratio is a key factor for achieving the often reported balance of excitation and inhibition, a hallmark of cortical computation. However, neither previous theoretical nor simulation studies have addressed how these differences in EI ratio will affect layer-specific dynamics and computational properties. We investigate this question using a sparsely connected network model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. To keep the network in a physiological range of firing rates, we varied the inhibitory firing threshold or the synaptic strength between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We find that decreasing the EI ratio allows the network to explore a higher-dimensional space and enhance its capacity to represent complex input. By comparing the empirical EI ratios of layer 2/3 and layer 4 in the rodent barrel cortex, we predict that layer 2/3 has a higher dimensionality and coding capacity than layer 4. Furthermore, our analysis of primary visual cortex data from the Allen Brain Institute corroborates these modelling results, also demonstrating increased dimensionality and coding capabilities of layer 2/3

">Hippocampal CA2 neurons disproportionately express AAV-delivered genetic cargo</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal area CA2 is unique in many ways, largely based on the complement of genes expressed there. We, and other, have observed that CA2 neurons exhibit a uniquely robust tropism for adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) of multiple serotypes and variants. In this study, we aimed to systematically investigate the propensity for AAV tropism toward CA2 across a wide range of AAV serotypes and variants, injected either intrahippocampally or systemically, including AAV1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, DJ, PHP.B, PHP.eB, and CAP-B10. We found that most serotypes and variants produced disproportionally high expression of AAV-delivered genetic material in CA2, although two serotypes (AAV6 and DJ) did not. In an effort to understand the mechanism behind this observation, we considered perineuronal nets (PNNs) that ensheathe CA2 pyramidal cells and, among other functions, buffer diffusion of ions and molecules. We hypothesized that PNNs might attract AAV particles and maintain them in close proximity to CA2 neurons, thereby increasing exposure to AAV particles. However, genetic deletion of PNNs from CA2 did not decrease AAV transduction. Next, we next considered the AAV binding factors and receptors known to contribute to AAV transduction. We found that the AAV receptor (AAVR), which is critical to transduction, is abundantly expressed in CA2, and knockout of AAVR nearly abolished expression of AAV-delivered material by all serotypes tested. Additionally, we found CA2 enrichment of several cell-surface glycan receptors that AAV particles attach to before interacting with AAVR, including heparan sulfate proteoglycans, N-linked sialic acid and N-linked galactose. Indeed, CA2 showed the highest expression of AAVR and the investigated glycan receptors within the hippocampus. We conclude that CA2 neurons are endowed with multiple factors that make it highly susceptible to AAV transduction, particularly to the systemically available PHP variants, including CAP-B10. Given the curved structure of hippocampus and the relatively small size of CA2, systemic delivery of engineered PHP or CAP variants could all but eliminate the need for intrahippocampal AAV injections, particularly when injecting recombinase-dependent AAVs into animals expressing recombinases in CA2.

">More or less latent variables in the high-dimensional data space? That is the question</a></h4>

              
                Dimensionality reduction is widely used in modern Neuroscience to process massive neural recordings data. Despite the development of complex non-linear techniques, linear algorithms, in particular Principal Component Analysis (PCA), are still the gold standard. However, there is no consensus on how to estimate the optimal number of latent variables to retain. In this study, we addressed this issue by testing different criteria on simulated data. Parallel analysis and cross validation proved to be the best methods, being largely unaffected by the number of units and the amount of noise. Parallel analysis was quite conservative and tended to underestimate the number of dimensions especially in low-noise regimes, whereas in these conditions cross validation provided slightly better estimates. Both criteria consistently estimate the ground truth when 100+ units were available. As an exemplary application to real data, we estimated the dimensionality of the spiking activity in two macaque parietal areas during different phases of a delayed reaching task. We show that different criteria can lead to different trends in the estimated dimensionality. These apparently contrasting results are reconciled when the implicit definition of dimensionality underlying the different criteria is considered. Our findings suggest that the term "dimensionality" needs to be defined carefully and, more importantly, that the most robust criteria for choosing the number of dimensions should be adopted in future works. To help other researchers with the implementation of such an approach on their data, we provide a simple software package, and we present the results of our simulations through a simple Web based app to guide the choice of latent variables in a variety of new studies.

">Decoupling of GABA and Glutamine-Glutamate Dynamics and their role in tactile perception: An fMRS Study</a></h4>

              
                Tactile processing is fundamental for our daily lives. In particular, adaptation, the mechanism by which neural (and behavioural) responses change due to repeated stimulation, is key in adjusting our responses to the environment and is often affected in neurodevelopmental conditions such as autism and ADHD. While GABA and glutamate, the main inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, are known to be fundamental for encoding sensory input, we know little regarding the dynamic responses of the GABA and glutamatergic systems during tactile processing. Here, we examine how GABA and glutamine+glutamate (Glx) in vivo dynamics change during repetitive tactile stimulation and how these changes relate to tactile perception in a healthy population, using functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS). Our study showed that repetitive tactile stimulation induced a decoupling between GABA and Glx during the first stimulation blocks as suggested by a negative correlation between GABA and Glx, which changed from a positive correlation at baseline. Subsequently, a multivariate time series analysis showed a predictive temporal relationship between Glx and GABA, showing that changes in these metabolites are temporally linked with an estimated lag of 6 seconds informing on a complex metabolite response function. The absence of gross metabolite change suggests that Glx and GABA adjust in relation to each other in response to repeated tactile stimulation. Furthermore, individual differences in the changed GABA and Glx levels correlated with perceptual measures of touch. Together, our study highlights the complex relationship between GABA and glutamate in tactile processing and demonstrates that experience-dependence plasticity induces a decoupling between these key metabolites. Further study into their dynamic interplay may be key to understanding adaptation as meso-levels in the brain and how these mechanisms differ in neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions.

">Sex differences in the rates and association of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in normative ageing.</a></h4>

              
                Although dysfunction in cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism is linked to neurodegeneration, it is currently unclear if there are sex and age differences in their rates and association. Seventeen younger males (mean age 27.5 years), 20 younger females (28.4), 22 older males (76.6) and 20 older females (75.3) completed a MR/PET scan and cognitive battery. Females had higher CBF and CMRGLC than males, regardless of age. CBF was lower in ageing. As CMRGLC increased, the positive effect of higher CBF on working memory, cognitive flexibility, and processing speed also increased. Individuals with the highest CBF had the highest CMRGLC. However, this association was moderated by sex and age, with significant negative associations across older females, possibly reflecting a compensatory response to a loss of blood flow and metabolism. We conclude that there are sex differences in the rates and association of cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism in normative ageing and that high rates of blood flow and metabolism combine to support cognition.

">Bidirectionally responsive thermoreceptors encode cool and warm</a></h4>

              
                Thermal sensation is a fundamental sense initiated by the activity of primary afferent thermoreceptors. While considerable attention has been paid to the encoding of noxious temperatures by thermoreceptors, it is far less clear how they encode innocuous cool and warm which are more commonly encountered in the environment. To address this, we sampled the entire thermoreceptor population using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of awake and anesthetized mice. We found that the vast majority of thermoreceptors respond bidirectionally, with an enhanced response to cool and a suppressed response to warm. Using in vivo pharmacology and computational modelling, we demonstrate that conductance changes in the cool-sensitive TRPM8 channel are sufficient to explain this bidirectional response type. Our comprehensive dataset reveals the fundamental principles of the peripheral encoding of innocuous temperatures and suggests that the same population of thermoreceptors underlie the distinct sensations of cool and warm.

">The role of cholinergic signaling in multi-sensory gamma stimulation induced perivascular clearance of amyloid</a></h4>

              
                Modulatory neurotransmitters exert powerful control over neurons and the brain vasculature. Gamma Entrainment Using Sensory Stimuli (GENUS) promotes amyloid clearance via increased perivascular cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) flux in mouse models of Alzheimer's Disease. Here we use whole-brain activity mapping to identify the cholinergic basal forebrain as a key region responding to GENUS. In line with this, GENUS promoted cortical acetylcholine release, vascular dilation, vasomotion and perivascular clearance. Inhibiting cholinergic signaling abolished the effects of GENUS, including the promotion of arterial pulsatility, periarterial CSF influx, and the reduction of cortical amyloid levels. Our findings establish cholinergic signaling as an essential component of the brain's ability to promote perivascular amyloid clearance via non-invasive sensory stimulation.

">Synergistic Behavioral and Neuroplastic Effects of Psilocybin-NMDAR Modulator Administration.</a></h4>

              
                The full therapeutic potential of serotonergic psychedelics (SP) in treating neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia, is limited by possible adverse effects, including perceptual disturbances and psychosis, which require administration in controlled clinical environments. This study investigates the synergistic benefits of combining psilocybin (PSIL) with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulators D-serine (DSER) and D-cycloserine (DCS) to enhance both efficacy and safety. Using ICR male mice, we examined head twitch response (HTR), MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion, and neuroplasticity related synaptic protein levels in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum. Our results indicate that PSIL significantly increased HTR - a surrogate measure for hallucinogenic effects - which was reduced by the co-administration of DSER or DCS in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, combining PSIL with DSER or DCS significantly decreased MK-801-induced hyperactivity, modeling antipsychotic effects. Neuroplasticity-related synaptic protein assays demonstrated that the PSIL-DSER combination enhanced GAP43 expression over all 4 brain examined and overall expression of the 4 assayed synaptic proteins in the hippocampus, while PSIL-DCS elevated PSD95 levels across all 4 brain regions, suggesting a synaptogenic synergy. These findings support the hypothesis that combinations of SP with NMDAR modulators could optimize the therapeutic potential of SP by mitigating adverse effects and enhancing neuroplasticity. Future studies should focus on refining administration protocols and evaluating translational applicability for broader clinical use.

">Functional maturation and experience-dependent plasticity in adult-born olfactory bulb dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Continued integration of new neurons persists in only a few areas of the adult mouse brain. In the olfactory bulb (OB), immature adult-born neurons respond differently to olfactory stimuli compared to their more mature counterparts, and have heightened levels of activity-dependent plasticity. These distinct functional features are thought to bestow unique properties onto existing circuitry. OB interneurons, including those generated through adult neurogenesis, consist of a set of highly distinct subtypes. However, we do not currently know the different cell-type-specific mechanisms underlying their functional development and plastic potential. Here, we specifically characterised electrophysiological maturation and experience-dependent plasticity in a single, defined subtype of adult-born OB neuron: dopaminergic cells. We selectively live-labelled both adult-born and resident dopaminergic cells, and targeted them for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute mouse OB slices. Surprisingly, we found that from the time - at ~1 month of cell age - that live adult-born dopaminergic neurons could first be reliably identified, they already possessed almost fully mature intrinsic firing properties. We saw significant maturation only in increased spontaneous activity and decreased medium afterhyperpolarisation amplitude. Nor were adult-born dopaminergic cells especially plastic. In response to brief sensory deprivation via unilateral naris occlusion we observed no maturation-specific plastic alterations in intrinsic properties, although we did see deprivation-associated increases in spike speed and amplitude across all adult-born and resident neurons. Our results not only show that adult-born OB dopaminergic cells rapidly functionally resemble their pre-existing counterparts, but also underscore the importance of subtype identity when describing neuronal maturation and plasticity.

">Gustatory sensitivity to amino acids in bumblebees</a></h4>

              
                Bees rely on amino acids obtained from nectar and pollen for essential physiological functions, including maintenance, sexual maturation, and larval development. While amino acid concentrations in nectar are typically low (<1 mM), pollen contains higher levels (10-200 mM), with the exact concentrations varying by plant species. Behavioural studies suggest bumblebees have preferences for specific amino acids, yet whether such preferences are mediated pre-ingestively via gustatory mechanisms remains unclear. This study explores bumblebees' (Bombus terrestris) gustatory sensitivity to two essential amino acids (EAAs), valine and lysine, using electrophysiological recordings from gustatory sensilla on their mouthparts. Valine elicited a concentration-dependent response, with spikes produced from 0.1 mM and reaching an asymptote at 5 mM, indicating that bumblebees could perceive valine at the concentrations found naturally in nectar and pollen. In contrast, lysine failed to evoke spiking responses across tested concentrations (0.1-500 mM). The absence of lysine detection raises questions about the specificity and diversity of amino acid-sensitive receptors in bumblebees. Bees responded to valine at lower concentrations than sucrose, suggesting comparatively higher sensitivity to amino acids (EC50: 0.7 mM vs. 3.91 mM for sucrose). Our findings indicate that bumblebees are able to rapidly evaluate the amino acid content of pollen and nectar while foraging from flowers using pre-ingestive cues, rather than relying on post-ingestive cues or feedback from their nestmates. Such sensory capabilities likely impact foraging strategies, with implications for plant-bee interactions and pollination. Future research should explore bumblebees' response to other amino acids in isolation and combination, and mechanisms for detecting pollen-bound nutrients.

">Assessing the feasibility of a new approach to measure the full spectrum of CSF dynamics within the human brain using MRI: insights from a simulation study</a></h4>

              
                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics are essential in waste clearance of the brain. Disruptions in CSF flow are linked to various neurological conditions, highlighting the need for accurate measurement of its dynamics. Current methods typically capture limited aspects of CSF movement or focus on a single anatomical region, presenting challenges for comprehensive analysis. This study proposes a novel approach using Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echoes (DENSE) MRI to assess the full spectrum of CSF motion within the brain. Through simulations, we evaluated the feasibility of disentangling distinct CSF motion components, including heartbeat- and respiration-driven flows, as well as a net velocity component due to continuous CSF turnover, and tested the performance of our method under incorrect assumptions about the underlying model of CSF motion. Results demonstrate that DENSE MRI can accurately separate these components, and reliably estimated a net velocity, even when periodic physiological motions vary over time. The method proved to be robust for including low frequency components (LFO), incorrect assumption on the nature of the net velocity component and missing CSF components in the model. This approach offers a comprehensive measurement technique for quantifying CSF dynamics, advancing our understanding of the relative role of various drivers of CSF dynamics in brain clearance.

">Hunger alters approach-avoidance behaviours differently in male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: The decision about whether to approach or avoid a reward while under threat requires balancing competing demands. Sex-specific prioritisations (e.g. mating, maternal care), or generalised prioritisations (e.g. feeding, drinking, sleeping) may differently influence approach-avoidance behaviours based on the level of risk and homeostatic need state of the organism. However, given known sex differences in key aspects that may influence this behaviour, direct comparison of how male and female mice make decisions to approach or avoid a dangerous area while in a fasted state have yet to be conducted. Methods: We conducted several approach-avoidance tasks with varied levels of risk and reward in male and female mice that were either fasted or sated (fed). Mice underwent a light-dark box, elevated plus maze, baited large open field and runway task to assess their approach and avoidance behaviour. Results: In the light-dark box and elevated plus maze, when no reward was available, fasted female mice showed greater approach behaviours than male counterparts. In the baited large open field, when reward was available, both sexes showed increased approach behaviours when fasted. However, when sated, male mice conversely showed greater approach behaviours compared to sated female mice. In the runway task, while sated mice failed to learn, fasted male mice inhibited their reward consumption in response to increased shock intensity; however, fasted female mice were resistant to increased shock intensity. Conclusions: Our study identifies sex differences in decision making behaviour in mice based on satiety state across a number of approach-avoidance tasks. We highlight several nuances of these differences based on reward availability and punishment intensity. These results shine a lens on fundamental differences between the sexes in innate, survival driven behaviours that should be taken into account for future studies.

">An automatic domain-general error signal is shared across tasks and predicts confidence in different sensory modalities</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the ability to self-evaluate decisions is an active area of research. This research has primarily focused on the neural correlates of self-evaluation during visual-tasks, and whether pre- or post-decisional neural correlates capture subjective confidence in that decision. This focus has been useful, yet also precludes an investigation of key every-day features of metacognitive self-evaluation: that decisions are rapid, must be evaluated without explicit feedback, and unfold in a multisensory world. These considerations lead us to hypothesise that an automatic domain-general metacognitive signal may be shared between sensory modalities, which we tested in the present study with multivariate decoding of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Participants (N=21, 12 female) first performed a visual task with no request for self-evaluations of performance, prior to an auditory task that included rating decision confidence on each trial. A multivariate classifier trained to predict errors in the speeded visual-task generalised to predict errors in the subsequent non-speeded auditory discrimination. This generalisation was unique to classifiers trained on the visual response-locked data, and further predicted subjective confidence on the subsequent auditory task. This evidence of overlapping neural activity across the two tasks provides evidence for automatic encoding of confidence independent of any explicit request for metacognitive reports, and a shared basis for metacognitive evaluations across sensory modalities.

">Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex drives strategic aborting by optimizing long-run policy extraction</a></h4>

              
                Real world choices often involve balancing decisions that are optimized for the short- vs. long-term. Here, we reason that apparently sub-optimal single trial decisions in macaques may in fact reflect long-term, strategic planning. We demonstrate that macaques freely navigating in VR for sequentially presented targets will strategically abort offers, forgoing more immediate rewards on individual trials to maximize session-long returns. This behavior is highly specific to the individual, demonstrating that macaques reason about their own long-run performance. Reinforcement-learning (RL) models suggest this behavior is algorithmically supported by modular actor-critic networks with a policy module not only optimizing long-term value functions, but also informed of specific state-action values allowing for rapid policy optimization. The behavior of artificial networks suggests that changes in policy for a matched offer ought to be evident as soon as offers are made, even if the aborting behavior occurs much later. We confirm this prediction by demonstrating that single units and population dynamics in macaque dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), but not parietal area 7a or dorsomedial superior temporal area (MSTd), reflect the upcoming reward-maximizing aborting behavior upon offer presentation. These results cast dlPFC as a specialized policy module, and stand in contrast to recent work demonstrating the distributed and recurrent nature of belief-networks.

">Covert muscle activity reveals dynamic freezing states and prepares the animal for action</a></h4>

              
                When an animal detects a threat it must make a split-second choice between fight, flight or freezing. During freezing, skeletal muscles sustain tension to maintain rigid, sometimes atypical postures, for many minutes at a time. Meanwhile the animal must dynamically assess its surroundings to plan future actions and ready its body for movement. The interplay between the neural and somatic systems during freezing remains poorly understood. Here we show that freezing Drosophila melanogaster display a striking novel pattern of leg muscle activation unique to immobility, a rhythmic pulsing in the distal tibia. The muscle, which we show to be a previously undescribed leg accessory heart, displays multiple activity modes and ramps up to movement onset, implying a preparation for movement. The frequency of pulsing is dynamically modulated as the fly integrates external threat or safety cues, and artificially increasing pulse frequency leads to freezing breaks, indicating a causal role in the decision to move. Through the identification of a new Drosophila cardiac organ, this study provides a window into the multiple states which can underlie freezing behaviour, and the physiological changes which the body undergoes to ready the animal to move.

">Circuit mechanisms underlying sexually dimorphic outcomes of early life stress</a></h4>

              
                Stress during early life influences brain development and can affect social, motor, and emotional processes. We describe a striking sex difference in the effects of early life stress (ELS), which produces anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviors in female adolescent mice, as reported previously, but repetitive behavioral pathology and social deficits in male adolescent mice. Notably, this parallels sex differences seen in the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms: depression and anxiety disorders are more common in girls and women, whereas neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder and Tourette syndrome are markedly more common in boys and men. We characterized the effects of ELS on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and on its projections to the dorsal striatum (dStr) and lateral septum (LS). ELS males, but not females, developed hyperactivity in the cortico-striatal circuit and hypoactivity in the cortico-septal circuit. Chemogenetic manipulation of cortico-striatal projection neurons modulates repetitive behavioral pathology and social behaviors in stressed males, and anhedonia in stressed females. Activation of cortico-septal projection neurons rescues social deficits in stressed males. We conclude that early life stress produces sexually dimorphic behavioral effects, with potential relevance to human psychiatric symptoms, through its differential effects on cortico-striatal and cortico-septal circuits.

">The effect of prolonged elbow pain and rTMS on cortical inhibition: A TMS-EEG study</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Recent studies using combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) have shown that pain leads to an increase in the N45 peak of the TMS-evoked potential (TEP), which is mediated by GABAergic inhibition. Conversely, 10Hz repetitive TMS (10Hz-rTMS), which provides pain relief, reduces the N45 peak. However, these studies used brief pain stimuli (lasting minutes), limiting their clinical relevance. The present study determined the effect of pain and 10Hz-rTMS on the N45 peak in a prolonged pain model (lasting several days) induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) injection to the elbow muscle. Materials and Methods: Experiment 1: TEPs were measured in 22 healthy participants on Day 0 (pre-NGF), Day 2 (peak pain), and Day 7 (pain resolution). Experiment 2: We examined the effect of 5 days of active (n=16) or sham (n=16) rTMS to the left primary motor cortex (M1) on the N45 peak during prolonged NGF-induced pain, with TEPs measured on Day 0 and Day 4 (post-rTMS). Results: Experiment 1: While no overall change in the N45 peak was seen, a correlation emerged between higher pain severity on Day 2 and a larger increase in the N45 peak. Experiment 2: Active rTMS reduced the N45 peak on Day 4 vs. Day 0, with no effect in the sham group. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that (i) higher pain severity correlates with an increase in the N45 peak, and (ii) rTMS decreases cortical inhibition in a model of prolonged experimental pain. This study extends previous research by demonstrating a link between pain perception and cortical inhibition within a prolonged pain context.

	<p>Background: Patients with Complex Trauma (CT) may have an impaired ability to trust others and build intimate relationships due to non-integrated representations of self and others. This sometimes leads to an oscillation between needing and fearing intimacy in their adult relationships. This dynamic can occur in the therapeutic relationship, undermining the effectiveness of therapy and affecting the mental health of both the patient and the therapist. To date, no study has analyzed interpersonal patient&amp;amp;ndash;therapist dynamics in cases of CT. The present case aims to fill this gap by exploring relational cycles between the therapist and the patient during the therapeutic process in terms of goals and self&amp;amp;ndash;other beliefs. Methods: The methodology consisted of a shared and integrated reconstruction by the patient and therapist, both with clinical expertise in psychology, of the impasse in their therapeutic relationship. The reading was done through the lens of the cognitive model of Pathological Affective Dependence, a theory of traumatic relationships, by describing the primary interpersonal cycles occurring in the therapeutic relationship (altruistic, deontological, and vulnerable). Results: The condition of CT leads to several alliance breakdowns and specific interpersonal cycles, leading to new healing meanings for the patient and the relationship itself. Limitations: The study&amp;amp;rsquo;s main limitation is that it consists of a qualitative analysis of the therapeutic relationship without data that can quantify the clinically observed changes. Conclusions: This case report demonstrates how CT, PAD and the fear of intimacy can be risk factors for the therapeutic alliance and how the therapeutic relationship constitutes a fundamental tool for intervention effectiveness in patients who experience unmet primary needs.</p>

	<p>Action video games foster competitive environments that demand rapid spatial navigation and decision-making. Action video gamers often exhibit faster response times and slightly improved accuracy in vision-based sensorimotor tasks. Background/Objectives: However, the underlying functional and structural changes in the two visual streams of the brain that may be contributing to these cognitive improvements have been unclear. Methods: Using functional and diffusion MRI data, this study investigated the differences in connectivity between gamers who play action video games and nongamers in the dorsal and ventral visual streams. Results: We found that action video gamers have enhanced functional and structural connectivity, especially in the dorsal visual stream. Specifically, there is heightened functional connectivity&amp;amp;mdash;both undirected and directed&amp;amp;mdash;between the left superior occipital gyrus and the left superior parietal lobule during a moving-dot discrimination decision-making task. This increased connectivity correlates with response time in gamers. The structural connectivity in the dorsal stream, as quantified by diffusion fractional anisotropy and quantitative anisotropy measures of the axonal fiber pathways, was also enhanced for gamers compared to nongamers. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights into how action video gaming can induce targeted improvements in structural and functional connectivity between specific brain regions in the visual processing pathways. These connectivity changes in the dorsal visual stream underpin the superior performance of action video gamers compared to nongamers in tasks requiring rapid and accurate vision-based decision-making.</p>

	<p>Binocular vision may serve as a good model for research on awareness. Binocular summation (BS) can be defined as the superiority of binocular over monocular visual performance. Early studies of BS found an improvement of a factor of about 1.4 (empirically), leading to models suggesting a quadratic summation of the two monocular inputs (&amp;amp;radic;2). Neural interaction modulates a target&amp;amp;rsquo;s visibility within the same eye or between eyes (facilitation or suppression). Recent results indicated that at a closely flanked stimulus, BS is characterized by instability; it relies on the specific order in which the stimulus condition is displayed. Otherwise, BS is stable. These results were revealed in experiments where the tested eye was open, whereas the other eye was occluded (mono-optic glasses, blocked presentation); thus, the participants were aware of the tested eye. Therefore, in this study, we repeated the same experiments but utilized stereoscopic glasses (intermixed at random presentation) to control the monocular and binocular vision, thus potentially eliminating awareness of the tested condition. The stimuli consisted of a central vertically oriented Gabor target and high-contrast Gabor flankers positioned in two configurations (orthogonal or collinear) with target&amp;amp;ndash;flanker separations of either two or three wavelengths (&amp;amp;lambda;), presented at four different presentation times (40, 80, 120, and 200 ms). The results indicate that when utilizing stereoscopic glasses and mixing the testing conditions, the BS is normal, raising the possibility that awareness may be involved.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Normative perceptual segmentation facilitates event perception, comprehension, and memory. Given that native English listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; normative perceptual segmentation of English speech streams coexists with a highly selective attention pattern at segmentation boundaries, it is significant to test whether Chinese learners of English have a different attention pattern at boundaries, thereby checking whether they perform a normative segmentation. Methods: Thirty Chinese learners of English with relatively higher language proficiency (CLH) and 26 with relatively lower language proficiency (CLL) listened to a series of English audio sentences. Meanwhile, they were asked to press the key whenever a phonetic probe &amp;amp;ldquo;ba&amp;amp;rdquo; occurred. Response time to &amp;amp;ldquo;ba&amp;amp;rdquo; reflects the attention where &amp;amp;ldquo;ba&amp;amp;rdquo; is located at segmentation boundaries. Results: The results revealed that, (1) relative to native English listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; highly selective attention pattern, the CLH group showed a relatively selective attention pattern, while the CLL group displayed a non-selective attention pattern. (2) Both the CLH group and natives had better recognition memory than the CLL group. (3) Both the CLH group and natives&amp;amp;rsquo; attention at segmentation boundaries was not correlated with their memory for sentences, while the CLL group&amp;amp;rsquo;s attention at boundaries was correlated with memory. Conclusions: These findings suggest that (1) Chinese learners of English did not perform a normative segmentation, which shows the effect of English proficiency on perceptual segmentation; (2) English proficiency has a superior effect on memory for sentences, while perceptual segmentation would come next to support memory by providing structure for memory construction if English proficiency is not high; (3) a comparison of attention patterns between Chinese learners and natives can provide a reference for potential intervention to rectify non-natives, thereby improving their perception of English speech streams.</p>

	<p>Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for approximately 70&amp;amp;ndash;75% of all bladder cancer cases. The standard treatment for high-risk NMIBC involves transurethral tumour resection followed by intravesical Bacillus Calmette&amp;amp;ndash;Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy. While BCG immunotherapy is both safe and effective, it frequently leads to the development of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria, and pelvic discomfort. These symptoms can significantly diminish patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life and may result in the discontinuation of BCG treatment, adversely affecting oncological outcomes. Despite the considerable clinical impact of BCG-induced LUTS, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, hindering the implementation or development of effective treatments. This review provides novel insights into the potential mechanisms underlying BCG-induced LUTS, focusing on the integrated roles of afferent and efferent nerves in both normal and pathological bladder sensation and function. Specifically, this review examines how the body&amp;amp;rsquo;s response to BCG&amp;amp;mdash;through the development of inflammation, increased urothelial permeability, and altered urothelial signalling&amp;amp;mdash;might contribute to LUTS development. Drawing from known mechanisms in other common urological disorders and data from successful clinical trials involving NMIBC patients, this review summarises evidence supporting the likely changes in both sensory nerve signalling and bladder muscle function in the development of BCG-induced LUTS. However, further research is required to understand the intricate mechanisms underlying the development of BCG-induced LUTS and identify why some patients are more likely to experience BCG intolerance. Addressing these knowledge gaps could have profound implications for patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life, treatment adherence, and overall outcomes in NMIBC care.</p>

	<p>The association between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and gender dysphoria (GD) has attracted a great deal of interest among child and adolescent psychiatrists in Japan. In clinical settings, it is common to hear complaints or concerns related to GD from adolescents with ASD. In the past few years, several review articles have been published on ASD and GD. The Initial Clinical Guidelines for co-occurring ASD and GD in adolescents were published in 2018, suggesting the increasing need of intervention for these conditions worldwide. Although a large amount of evidence has been accumulated regarding the co-occurrence of ASD and GD, all review articles were based solely on case reports and articles published in English. In this article, we performed a bilingual literature review using English- and Japanese-language literature databases. We found 13 case reports in English and 11 case reports in Japanese. The Japanese literature included articles on gender-related symptoms in ASD, but not limited to ASD with comorbid GD. Wattel and her colleagues proposed 15 theories on the link between ASD and GD. We classified the reported cases into one or more of the fifteen theories proposed by Wattel. These theories seemed useful in understanding the co-occurrence of ASD and GD, especially in AMAB cases. Wattel&amp;amp;rsquo;s 15 theories are categorized into biological, psychological, and social factors, respectively. With regard to the social factors, we discussed Japanese school culture and psychological burden among gender-dysphoric students. Further studies are awaited.</p>

	<p>Background: Manually labeling sleep stages is time-consuming and labor-intensive, making automatic sleep staging methods crucial for practical sleep monitoring. While both single- and multi-channel data are commonly used in automatic sleep staging, limited research has adequately investigated the differences in their effectiveness. Methods: In this study, four public data sets&amp;amp;mdash;Sleep-SC, APPLES, SHHS1, and MrOS1&amp;amp;mdash;are utilized, and an advanced hybrid attention neural network composed of a multi-branch convolutional neural network and the multi-head attention mechanism is employed for automatic sleep staging. Results: The experimental results show that, for sleep staging using 2&amp;amp;ndash;5 classes, a combination of single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and dual-channel electrooculography (EOG) consistently outperforms single-channel EEG with single-channel EOG, which in turn outperforms single-channel EEG or single-channel EOG alone. For instance, for five-class sleep staging using the MrOS1 data set, the combination of single-channel EEG and dual-channel EOG resulted in an accuracy of 87.18%, whereas the combination of single-channel EEG and single-channel EOG yielded an accuracy of 85.77%. In comparison, single-channel EEG alone achieved an accuracy of 85.25% and single-channel EOG alone achieved an accuracy of 83.66%. Conclusions: This study highlights the significance of combining EEG and EOG signals in automatic sleep staging, while also providing valuable insights for the channel design of portable sleep monitoring devices.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent studies reveal an &amp;amp;ldquo;obesity paradox&amp;amp;rdquo;, suggesting better clinical outcomes after intracranial hemorrhage for obese patients compared to patients with a healthy BMI. While this paradox indicates improved survival rates for obese individuals in stroke cases, it is unknown whether this trend remains true across all forms of intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, the objective of our study was to investigate the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized obese patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Methods: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was queried for data from 2015 to 2019 to identify adult patients aged 18 years and older with a primary diagnosis of non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Using International Classification of Disease 10th Edition codes, patients were stratified by BMI categories: healthy weight, overweight, class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obesity, and class III obesity. The cohorts were examined for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, stroke severity, inpatient complications, interventions, and clinical outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, and inpatient mortality. Results: Of 41,960 intracranial hemorrhage patients identified, 13,380 (33.0%) also had an obese BMI. Class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obese intracranial hemorrhage patients were more likely to be of white race (OR: 1.101, 95% CI: 1.052, 1.152, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), less likely to be female (OR: 0.773, 95% CI: 0.740, 0.808, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and more likely to have diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.545, 95% CI: 1.477, 1.616, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and hypertension (OR: 1.828, 95% CI: 1.721, 1.943, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) in comparison to healthy-weight patients. In a matched cohort analysis adjusting for demographics and severity, intracranial hemorrhage patients with class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obesity had a shorter length of stay (LOS) (OR 0.402, 95% CI: 0.118, 0.705, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), reduced inpatient mortality (OR 0.847, 95% CI: 0.798, 0.898, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and more favorable discharge disposition (OR 1.395, 95% CI: 1.321, 1.474, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) compared to their healthy-weight counterparts. Furthermore, these patients were less likely to require decompressive hemicraniectomy (OR 0.697, 95% CI: 0.593, 0.820, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Following an analysis of individual ICH subtypes, obese subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients demonstrated reduced mortality (OR: 0.692, 95% CI: 0.577&amp;amp;ndash;0.831, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and LOS (OR: 0.070, 95% CI: 0.466&amp;amp;ndash;0.660, p = 0.039), with no differences in discharge disposition. Similarly, intracerebral hemorrhage patients demonstrated reduced mortality (OR: 0.891, 95% CI: 0.827&amp;amp;ndash;0.959, p = 0.002) and LOS (OR: 0.480, 95% CI: 0.216&amp;amp;ndash;0.743, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Other ICH subtypes showed improved discharge outcomes (OR: 1.504, 95% CI: 1.368&amp;amp;ndash;1.654, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), along with decreased mortality (OR: 0.805, 95% CI: 0.715&amp;amp;ndash;0.907, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and LOS (OR: &amp;amp;minus;10.313, 95% CI: &amp;amp;minus;3.599 to &amp;amp;minus;2.449, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Intracranial hemorrhage patients with class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obesity exhibited more favorable clinical outcomes than those who were of a healthy weight or overweight. Despite its association with risk factors contributing to intracranial hemorrhage, class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obesity was associated with improved outcomes, lending support to the existence of the obesity paradox in stroke.</p>

	<p>Mitochondria are organelles involved in different cellular functions, especially energy production. A relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder (BD), has been reported in the scientific literature, which suggests altered energy production and higher levels of oxidative stress compared to healthy controls. Specifically, in BD, the hypothesis of a biphasic pattern of energy availability has been postulated according to mood states. Current evidence highlights the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction in BD and variations between the manic, depressive, and euthymic phases. These findings need to be confirmed in future studies to identify biomarkers that may lead to individualized management of patients with BD and also to identify profiles with a higher risk of presenting an unfavorable course of illness, which would enable the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies in determined subpopulations of patients with BD. The limitations of this review include the non-systematic methodology, variety of mitochondrial-related functions associated with BD, heterogeneous study designs, preliminary evidence for specific findings, and limited recommendations regarding the use of mitochondrial modulators in BD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Bradykinesia is considered one of the most disabling motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Speed-based interventions are promising for reducing bradykinesia in this population. This systematic review aims to describe speed-based interventions that have been employed for reducing bradykinesia in individuals with PD and verify their effects. Methods: This systematic review protocol was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro, LILACS and SciELO databases and gray literature sources. Experimental studies that investigated the effects of speed-based interventions on bradykinesia in individuals with PD will be considered. Two independent reviewers will screen the studies, extract data and assess risk of bias using Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and ROBINS-I (&amp;amp;ldquo;Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies&amp;amp;mdash;of Interventions&amp;amp;rdquo;). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) will be used to assed the quality of evidence. Conclusions: This systematic review will offer information regarding which types of speed-based interventions have been investigated for reducing bradykinesia in individuals with PD. This information may be important for clinical decision making and will help identify gaps in the literature that may be useful for the definition of future research objectives and the planning of new trials. Ethical permission is not required for this study. Systematic review registration: this systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42024543673).</p>

	<p>Purpose: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience changes in balance, such as poor and reactive stepping, as well as altered fall-related psychological factors, such as increased concern about falling and feared consequences about falling. Such concerns and fear may relate to and influence mobility. However, these relations are poorly understood in people with MS. This study aimed to investigate the relation between reactive stepping performance and fall-related psychological factors, as well as to assess how these relations differ between individuals who have and have not fallen. Methods: In a single session, participants completed measures regarding fall-related psychological factors (balance confidence, concern about falling, and feared consequences of falling) and completed reactive stepping tasks. Following the visit, participants completed weekly surveys for 3 months to report their falls. Spearman rho correlations were computed to examine associations between participants&amp;amp;rsquo; reactive stepping performance and their fall-related concerns, confidence, and consequences, with a stratified analysis to compare these associations between fallers and non-fallers. Results: 44 individuals with MS participated in our study, with 27 individuals experiencing 0 falls (non-fallers) and 17 individuals experiencing at least 1 fall (fallers) in the 3-month follow-up period. Better reactive stepping performance was correlated with fewer concerns, greater confidence, and lower feared consequences related to falling. The stratified analysis revealed a greater number of significant associations for non-fallers than fallers, although the small sample of fallers reduced our ability to detect a relationship in this group. Conclusions: Reactive stepping was associated with fall-related psychological factors. Interventions targeting reactive stepping may be beneficial in enhancing fall-related psychological well-being in the MS community.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/48/e0374242024?rss=1">The Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Bottom-Up and Top-Down Processing during At-a-Glance Reading</a></h4>

              
                <p>Like all domains of cognition, language processing is affected by top&ndash;down knowledge. Classic evidence for this is missing blatant errors in the signal. In sentence comprehension, one instance is failing to notice word order errors, such as transposed words in the middle of a sentence: "you that read wrong" (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B25">Mirault et al., 2018</cross-ref>). Our brains seem to fix such errors, since they are incompatible with our grammatical knowledge, but how do our brains do this? Following behavioral work on inner transpositions, we flashed four-word sentences for 300&nbsp;ms using rapid parallel visual presentation (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B37">Snell and Grainger, 2017</cross-ref>). We compared magnetoencephalography responses to fully grammatical and reversed sentences (24 human participants: 21 females, 4 males). The left lateral language cortex robustly distinguished grammatical and reversed sentences starting at 213&nbsp;ms. Thus, the influence of grammatical knowledge begun rapidly after visual word form recognition (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B40">Tarkiainen et al., 1999</cross-ref>). At the earliest stage of this neural "sentence superiority effect," inner transpositions patterned between grammatical and reversed sentences, showing evidence that the brain initially "noticed" the error. However, 100&nbsp;ms later, inner transpositions became indistinguishable from grammatical sentences, suggesting at this point, the brain had "fixed" the error. These results show that after a single glance at a sentence, syntax impacts our neural activity almost as quickly as higher-level object recognition is assumed to take place (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Cichy et al., 2014</cross-ref>). The earliest stage involves detailed comparisons between the bottom&ndash;up input and grammatical knowledge, while shortly afterward, top&ndash;down knowledge can override an error in the stimulus.</p>

                <p>Crowding, the phenomenon of impaired visual discrimination due to nearby objects, has been extensively studied and linked to cortical mechanisms. Traditionally, crowding has been studied extrafoveally; its underlying mechanisms in the central fovea, where acuity is highest, remain debated. While low-level oculomotor factors are not thought to play a role in crowding, this study shows that they are key factors in defining foveal crowding. Here, we investigate the influence of fixational behavior on foveal crowding and provide a comprehensive assessment of the magnitude and extent of this phenomenon (<I>N</I> = 13 human participants, four males). Leveraging on a unique blend of tools for high-precision eyetracking and retinal stabilization, we show that removing the retinal motion introduced by oculomotor behavior with retinal stabilization, diminishes the negative effects of crowding. Ultimately, these results indicate that ocular drift contributes to foveal crowding resulting in the same pooling region being stimulated both by the target and nearby objects over the course of time, not just in space. The temporal aspect of this phenomenon is peculiar to crowding at this scale and indicates that the mechanisms contributing to foveal and extrafoveal crowding differ.</p>

                <p>Healthy and successful living involves carefully navigating rewarding and threatening situations by balancing approach and avoidance behaviors. Excessive avoidance to evade potential threats often leads to forfeiting potential rewards. However, little is known about how reward and threat information is integrated neurally to inform approach or avoidance. In this preregistered study, participants (<I>N</I><SUB>behavior </SUB>= 31, 17F; <I>N</I><SUB>MRI </SUB>= 28, 15F) made approach&ndash;avoidance decisions under varying reward (monetary gains) and threat (electrical stimulations) prospects during functional MRI scanning. In contrast to theorized parallel subcortical processing of reward and threat information before cortical integration, Bayesian multivariate multilevel analyses revealed subcortical reward and threat integration prior to indicating approach&ndash;avoidance decisions. This integration occurred in the ventral striatum, thalamus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). When reward was low, risk-diminishing avoidance decisions dominated, which was linked to more positive tracking of threat magnitude prior to indicating avoidance than approach decisions. In contrast, the amygdala exhibited dual sensitivity to reward and threat. While anticipating outcomes of risky approach decisions, we observed positive tracking of threat magnitude within the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, periaqueductal gray, BNST). Conversely, after risk-diminishing avoidance, characterized by reduced reward prospects, we observed more negative tracking of reward magnitude in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. These findings shed light on the temporal dynamics of approach&ndash;avoidance decision-making. Importantly, they demonstrate the role of subcortical integration of reward and threat information in balancing approach and avoidance, challenging theories positing predominantly separate subcortical processing prior to cortical integration.</p>

                <p>Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a learning rule important for synaptic refinement and for learning and memory during development. While different forms of presynaptic t-LTD have been deeply investigated, little is known about the mechanisms of somatosensory cortex postsynaptic t-LTD. In the present work, we investigated the requirements and mechanisms for induction of developmental spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) at L2/3-L2/3 synapses in the juvenile mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that postnatal day (P) 13&ndash;21 mice of either sex show t-LTD at L2/3-L2/3 synapses induced by pairing single presynaptic activity with single postsynaptic action potentials at low stimulation frequency (0.2&nbsp;Hz) that is expressed postsynaptically and requires the activation of ionotropic postsynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors containing GluN2B subunits. In addition, it requires postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores, calcineurin, postsynaptic endocannabinoid synthesis, activation of CB<SUB>1</SUB> receptors, and astrocytic signaling to release the gliotransmitter <scp>d</scp>-serine to activate postsynaptic NMDARs to induce t-LTD. These results show direct evidence of the mechanism involved in developmental postsynaptic t-LTD at L2/3-L2/3 synapses, revealing a central role of astrocytes and their release of <scp>d</scp>-serine in its induction.</p>

                <p>"Trying too hard" can interfere with skilled movement, such as sports and music playing. Postural control can similarly suffer when conscious attention is directed toward it ("conscious movement processing"; CMP). However, the neural mechanisms through which CMP influences balance remain poorly understood. We explored the effects of CMP on electroencephalographic (EEG) perturbation-evoked cortical responses and subsequent balance performance. Twenty healthy young adults (age&nbsp;=&nbsp;25.1 &plusmn; 5&nbsp;years; 10 males and 10 females) stood on a force plate-embedded moveable platform while mobile EEG was recorded. Participants completed two blocks of 50 discrete perturbations, containing an even mix of slower (186&nbsp;mm/s peak velocity) and faster (225&nbsp;mm/s peak velocity) perturbations. One block was performed under conditions of CMP (i.e., instructions to consciously control balance), while the other was performed under "Control" conditions with no additional instructions. For both slow and fast perturbations, CMP resulted in significantly smaller cortical N1 signals (a perturbation-evoked potential localized to the supplementary motor area) and lower sensorimotor beta EEG activity 200&ndash;400&nbsp;ms postperturbation. Significantly greater peak velocities of the center of pressure (i.e., greater postural instability) were also observed during the CMP condition. Our findings provide the first evidence that disruptions to postural control during CMP may be a consequence of insufficient cortical activation relevant for balance (i.e., insufficient cortical N1 responses followed by enhanced beta suppression). We propose that conscious attempts to minimize postural instability through CMP acts as a cognitive dual-task that dampens the sensitivity of the sensorimotor system for future losses of balance.</p>

                <p>The transmission of tau pathology has been proposed as one of the major mechanisms for the spatiotemporal spreading of tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases. Over the last decade, studies have demonstrated that targeting total or pathological tau using tau antibodies can mitigate the development of tau pathology in tauopathy or Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models, and multiple tau immunotherapy agents have progressed to clinical trials. Tau antibodies are believed to inhibit the internalization of pathologic seeds and/or block seed elongation after seed internalization. To further address the mechanism of tau antibody inhibition of pathological spread, we conducted immunotherapy studies in mouse primary neurons and wild-type mice (females) seeded with AD patient-derived tau to induce the formation and spreading of tau pathology. Notably, we evaluated the effect of a mouse tau-specific antibody (mTau8) which does not interact with AD&ndash;tau seeds in these models. Our results show that mTau8 crosses the blood&ndash;brain barrier at levels similar to other antibodies and effectively decreases AD&ndash;tau-seeded tau pathology in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, our data suggest that mTau8 binds to endogenous intraneuronal mouse tau, thereby inhibiting the elongation of internalized tau seeds. These findings provide valuable insights into the possible mechanism underlying antibody-based therapies for treating tauopathies.</p>

                <p>Visual information is initially represented in retinotopic coordinates and later in craniotopic coordinates. Psychophysical evidence suggests that visual information is further represented in more general coordinates related to the external world; however, the neural basis of nonegocentric coordinates remains elusive. This study investigates the automatic transformation from egocentric to nonegocentric coordinates in the macaque precuneus (two males, one female), identified by a functional imaging study as a key area for nonegocentric representation. We found that 6.2% of neurons in the precuneus have receptive fields (RFs) anchored to the background rather than to the retina or the head, while 16% had traditional retinotopic RFs. Notably, these two types were not exclusive: many background-centric neurons initially encode a stimulus' position in retinotopic coordinates (up to ~90&nbsp;ms from the stimulus onset) but later shift to background coordinates, peaking at ~150&nbsp;ms. Regarding retinotopic information, the stimulus dominated the initial period, whereas the background dominated the later period. In the absence of a background, there is a dramatic surge in retinotopic information about the stimulus during the later phase, clearly delineating two distinct periods of retinotopic encoding: one focusing on the figure to be attended and another on the background. These findings suggest that the initial retinotopic information of the stimulus is combined with the background retinotopic information in a subsequent stage, yielding a more stable representation of the stimulus relative to the background through time-division multiplexing.</p>

                <p>The sexual receptivity of female mice, shown as lordosis response, is mainly regulated by estradiol action on estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) and beta (ER&beta;), depending on the day of the estrous cycle. Previous studies revealed that ER&alpha; in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) plays an essential role in the induction of lordosis on the day of estrus (Day 1). However, the mechanisms of the transition to nonreceptive states on the day after estrus (Day 2) are not completely understood. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of ER&beta;, which is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), in lordosis expression. We found that ER&beta;-Cre female mice, which were ovariectomized and primed with estradiol and progesterone to mimic the estrous cycle, showed high levels of lordosis on Day 2 when ER&beta;-expressing DRN (DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup>) neuronal activity was chemogenetically suppressed. This finding suggests that excitation of DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neurons is necessary for the decline of lordosis on Day 2. Fiber photometry recordings during female&ndash;male behavioral interactions revealed that DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neuronal activation in response to male intromission was significantly more prolonged on Day 2 compared with Day 1. Chemogenetic overstimulation of DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neurons induced c-Fos expression in brain areas known to be inhibitory for lordosis expression, even though they did not express anterogradely labeled fibers of DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> cells. These findings collectively suggest that DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neuronal excitation serves as an inhibitory modulator and is responsible for the decline in receptivity during nonestrus phases.</p>

                <p><I>SYNGAP1</I> is a high-confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk gene, and mutations in <I>SYNGAP1</I> lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) that presents with epilepsy, ASD, motor developmental delay, and intellectual disability. <I>SYNGAP1</I> codes for Ras/Rap GTP-ase activating protein SynGAP (SynGAP). SynGAP is located in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses and regulates glutamate receptor trafficking in an activity-dependent manner. In addition to forebrain glutamatergic neurons, <I>Syngap1</I> is highly expressed in the striatum, although the functions of SynGAP in the striatum have not been extensively studied. Here we show that <I>Syngap1</I> is expressed in both direct and indirect pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs) in mice of both sexes. In a mouse model of <I>Syngap1</I> haploinsufficiency, dendritic spine density, morphology, and intrinsic excitability are altered primarily in iSPNs, but not dSPNs. At the behavioral level, SynGAP reduction alters striatal-dependent motor learning and goal-directed behavior. Several behavioral phenotypes are reproduced by iSPN-specific <I>Syngap1</I> reduction and, in turn, prevented by iSPN-specific <I>Syngap1</I> rescue. These results establish the importance of SynGAP to striatal neuron function and pinpoint the indirect pathway as a key circuit in the neurobiology of <I>SYNGAP1</I>-related NDD.</p>

                <p>The nervous system contains complex circuits comprising thousands of cell types and trillions of connections. Here, we discuss how the field of "developmental systems neuroscience" combines the molecular and genetic perspectives of developmental neuroscience with the (typically adult-focused) functional perspective of systems neuroscience. This combination of approaches is critical to understanding how a handful of cells eventually produce the wide range of behaviors necessary for survival. Functional circuit development typically lags behind neural connectivity, leading to intermediate stages of neural activity that are either not seen in adults or, if present, are considered pathophysiological. Developmental systems neuroscience examines these intermediate stages of neural activity, mapping out the critical phases and inflection points of neural circuit function to understand how neural activity and behavior emerge across development. Beyond understanding typical development, this approach provides invaluable insight into the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders by identifying when and how functional development diverges between health and disease. We argue that developmental systems neuroscience will identify important periods of neural development, reveal novel therapeutic windows for treatment, and set the stage to answer fundamental questions about the brain in health and disease.</p>

                <p>CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) was identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, it is unclear how CD2AP contributes to LOAD synaptic dysfunction underlying AD memory deficits. We have shown that loss of CD2AP function increases &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) endocytic production, but it is unknown whether it contributes to synapse dysfunction. As CD2AP is an actin-binding protein, it may also function in F-actin-rich dendritic spines, which are the excitatory postsynaptic compartments. Here, we demonstrate that CD2AP colocalizes with F-actin in dendritic spines of primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Cell-autonomous depletion of CD2AP specifically reduces spine density and volume, resulting in a functional decrease in synapse formation and neuronal network activity. Postsynaptic reexpression of CD2AP, but not blocking A&beta; production, is sufficient to rescue spine density. CD2AP overexpression increases spine density, volume, and synapse formation, while a rare LOAD CD2AP mutation induces aberrant F-actin spine-like protrusions without functional synapses. CD2AP controls postsynaptic actin turnover, with the LOAD mutation in CD2AP decreasing F-actin dynamicity. Our data support that CD2AP risk variants could contribute to LOAD synapse dysfunction by disrupting spine formation and growth by deregulating actin dynamics.</p>

                Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a serious and life-threatening complication defined by excessive immune activation. While it’s commonly associated with rheumatic diseases, infections can also trigger MAS, with tuberculosis being a rare but significant cause. This case report discusses a rare occurrence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) caused by multifocal tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient with Crohn’s disease receiving immunosuppressive treatment. The patient is a 26-year-old woman with Crohn’s disease who is being treated with azathioprine. She arrived at the hospital battling persistent abdominal pain, overwhelming fatigue, and fever. Upon examination, splenomegaly and ascites were noted. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion consistent with tuberculosis. A CT scan confirmed the presence of pleural, pericardial, and intraperitoneal fluid. Blood tests indicated pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. The analysis of ascitic fluid suggested an exudate. The PCR test of the bone marrow aspirate was positive for tuberculosis without rifampicin resistance, and the smear showed hemophagocytosis images. The patient was diagnosed with Macrophage Activation Syndrome secondary to multifocal tuberculosis. This report delves into the complex relationship between MAS and tuberculosis, emphasizing the challenges in diagnosing MAS in such cases and the potential link to tuberculosis. The complex diagnostic landscape of multifocal tuberculosis, which can often mimic malignancies, underscores the importance of promptly detecting and starting anti-tuberculosis interventions for improved clinical outcomes and the prevention of associated complications.

                This case report presents a complex case of a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension and a family history of polycystic kidney disease and Fabry disease presented with acute pancreatitis and subsequent renal insufficiency. Despite initial corticosteroid therapy for immuno-allergic nephropathy, the patient’s condition deteriorated with the development of a skin rash, uremic syndrome, and neurological symptoms. A renal biopsy revealed cellular crescents and cytoplasmic vacuolization in podocytes and tubular cells. Genetic testing confirmed a GLA gene mutation, consistent with Fabry disease. While undergoing treatment with cyclophosphamide, the patient experienced severe allergic reactions, ultimately leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and fatal outcome. Despite the Fabry disease variant being primarily associated with cardiac involvement, renal involvement was evident. This case highlights the rarity of this co-occurrence, the diagnostic challenges, the importance of genetic factors in autoimmune kidney diseases, and the impact of drug allergies on patient management.

                Electrocardiograms (ECGs) can be affected by various factors and technical problems. It is rare for an artefact to be the cause of ST-segment elevation, especially in asymptomatic patients. An important distinction between true ST segment elevation caused by myocardial infarction and an artefact is that the baseline elevation in an artefact may begin before or after the appearance of the QRS complex. When confronted with an abnormal ECG with suspicious waveform contours and possibly only one completely normal limb leads, the diagnosis of arterial pulse artefact should be considered. It is important to exclude subjective assessments unless they are clearly labelled as such.

                Background At the international level, the survival of exporting companies represents a critical issue in a context of heightened uncertainty and intensified competition within the framework of the country’s commercial opening. This is a context in which different companies are born and die as a result of the interaction between the market and other factors. The objective of this research was to analysis of the survival of exporting agricultural companies in Peru, 2009-2019. To this end, data from the Commission for the Promotion of Peru for Exports and Tourism (Promperu) was utilised. Methods The methodological contribution of the research is based on the quantitative approach, of basic type with a descriptive elk; being the population that involves a total of data of the agricultural exporting companies of Peru in the period 2009-2019 and the sample is census and the non-parametric statistical technique used was the Kaplan Meier estimate for the estimation of the survival rate. Results Exports of Peru’s non-traditional agricultural sector in FOB value have had an average annual growth of 12% in terms of FOB value and 9% in terms of volume exported; the entry rate of new agro-exporting agricultural companies reached an average growth of 2.3% and the exit rate reached an average of 2.2% in the period 2009-2019. Conclusions The survival of exporting companies in the non-traditional agricultural sector is critical, where 89% of them survive only one year, while in the second year only 75% survive and in the sixth year only 33% survive.

                Background Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disorder that can affect motor skills and psychophysiological well-being. Virtual Reality Exercise (VRE) improves cognitive and physical outcomes in patients with CP. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of VRE on attention, vigor, and decision-making abilities in adolescents with CP. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted. The intervention consisted of a single 40-minute session of VRE compared to TE conducted in a controlled laboratory environment. Results Fourteen participants (42.9 % female) were included in this analysis. The results indicated that VRE had a statistically significant positive effect on attention and vigor compared to TE. While participants in the VRE group exhibited enhanced attention levels and reported elevated levels of vigor subsequent to the exercise sessions, the memory results did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions The findings suggest that VRE is an effective intervention for improving attention and vigor in adolescents with CP. Registration Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR202308598603482; 31/08/2023). The trial was reported in accordance with the CONSORT reporting guidelines.

                Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death worldwide with over 90% of reported cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pre-treatment loss to follow-up (PTLFU) is a key contributor to TB mortality and infection transmission. Objectives We performed a scoping review to map available evidence on interventions to reduce PTLFU in adults with pulmonary TB, identify gaps in existing knowledge, and develop a conceptual framework to guide intervention implementation. Methods We searched eight electronic databases up to February 6 2024, medRxiv for pre-prints, and reference lists of included studies. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data using a predesigned form. We analysed data descriptively, presented findings in a narrative summary and developed a conceptual framework based on the Practical, Robust Implementation, and Sustainability Model to map the factors for effective intervention implementation. Results We reviewed 1262 records and included 17 studies. Most studies were randomized controlled trials (8/17, 47%). Intervention barriers included stigma and inadequate resources; enablers included mobile phones and TB testing and results on the same day. We identified eight interventions that reduced PTLFU: treatment support groups; mobile notifications; community health workers; integrated HIV/TB services; Xpert MTB/RIF as the initial diagnostic test; computer-aided detection with chest radiography screening; active linkage to care; and multi-component strategies. Conclusion Given the variation of healthcare settings, TB programs should consider contextual factors such as user acceptability, political commitment, resources, and infrastructure before adopting an intervention. Future research should utilize qualitative study designs, be people-centred, and include social and economic factors affecting PTLFU.

                This work is an application of experimental temperature data previously collected in a residential building in Douala, Cameroon, in order to analyze thermal discomfort. The data was collected according to three occupancy scenarios over 12 month period using thermohygrometer sensors. The temperature data are analysed in comparison with the comfortable temperature range from 24°C to 28°C. The degree hour (DH) method was used to assess the severity of thermal discomfort in a hot and humid climate. The results reveal that the open C1, closed C2 and inhabited C3 rooms corresponding to scenarios C1, C2 and C3 respectively, have 7270.6°H, 9063.9°H and 10023°H. The inhabited room C3 has the largest DH and although the room C1 has the smallest DH, the latter largely exceeded the tolerable limit value of 1250°H set by the RE2020 Environmental Regulations. Results from this work can serve in building modelling for researchers and architects to act for the alleviation of thermal discomfort in regions with hot and humid climate.

A study to evaluate the practicality of using plants in reducing formaldehyde levels [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Formaldehyde a commonly used embalming fluid for the preservation of cadavers, produces numerous short and long-term side effects on the students and staff working with it. Indoor plants have been shown to reduce atmospheric formaldehyde levels. The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air to levels deemed safe by WHO standards Methods The study was conducted in the storage room of the Anatomical dissection hall. 7 potted plants of one variety were kept in the storage room for 14 days and the Formaldehyde reading was measured using a VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) monitor. Then the same was done with no plant. This cycle was repeated 2 more times, with two different plant species. The three spieces of plants used for this study were as follows: Dracaena trifasciata, Epipremnum aureum, Spathiphyllum. Results The results were analysed and compared and it was determined that the effect of having a plant present versus having no plant present on the Formaldehyde concentration in the air was inconclusive as Dracaena trifasciata failed to reject the null hypothesis altogether (p-value>0.05), while Epipremnum aureum and Spathiphyllum rejected the null hypothesis (p-value<0.05), however they both had a weak positive correlation with formaldehyde concentration. Conclusion The efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air needs to be further explored and validated since all the prior studies conducted were in controlled environment and should be done in a real time scenario for its practical and beneficial uses.

The prevalent itching condition associated with aging, historically referred to as senile pruritus, diminishes quality of life. Despite its impact, effective treatments remain elusive, largely due to an incomplete understanding of its pathological cause. In this study, we reveal a subset of dorsal root ganglion neurons enriched with Zn<sup>2+</sup> that express the vesicular Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporter TMEM163. These neurons form direct synapses with and modulate the activity of spinal NPY<sup>+</sup> inhibitory interneurons. In aged mice, both the expression of TMEM163 and the concentration of vesicular Zn<sup>2+</sup> within the central terminals of TMEM163<sup>+</sup> primary afferents show marked elevation. Importantly, the excessive release of vesicular Zn<sup>2+</sup> significantly dampens the activity of NPY<sup>+</sup> neurons, triggering the disinhibition of itch-transmitting neural circuits and resulting in chronic itch. Intriguingly, chelating Zn<sup>2+</sup> within the spinal dorsal horn effectively relieves itch in aged mice. Our study thus unveils a novel molecular mechanism underlying senile pruritus.

                Introduction Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR) is an innovative surgical procedure initially designed for upper-limb amputations, which has shown growing potential for improving functional outcomes in below-knee amputees. TMR involves redirecting severed nerves from the amputated limb to nearby residual muscles, allowing these muscles to act as amplifiers for nerve signals, thereby improving prosthetic control. Recent advancements in TMR for below-knee amputations have highlighted its ability to reduce post-amputation complications, such as neuroma pain and phantom limb pain, while offering enhanced control over prosthetic limbs, thus improving mobility and quality of life. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted, sourcing studies up to May 2024 from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Springer, and Epistemonikos. The analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical trials. A meta-analysis was performed to assess phantom limb pain reduction, while study quality was evaluated using RoB 2.0, ROBINS-I, and ROBINS-E. Meta-regression examined the influence of variables such as age and sex on pain outcomes. Results Seven studies, including 363 patients, were analyzed. The meta-analysis showed that TMR significantly reduced phantom limb pain (MD: -1.74; 95% CI: -2.46 to -1.02; P<0.00001; I2=0%). However, the pooled risk ratio for phantom pain incidence (RR: 1.58; 95% CI: 0.61 to 4.11; P=0.35; I2=93%) indicated variable outcomes. Conclusion TMR significantly reduces phantom limb pain and improves prosthetic control, particularly for patients with SCC of the foot, ultimately enhancing their quality of life.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To analyze long-term clinical and biomarker features of anti-contactin-1 (CNTN1) autoimmune nodopathy (AN).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with anti-CNTN1<sup>+</sup> autoimmune nodopathy detected in our laboratory from which clinical information was available were included. Clinical features and treatment response were retrospectively collected. Autoantibody, serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), and serum CNTN1 levels (sCNTN1) were analyzed at baseline and follow up.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 31 patients were included. Patients presented with progressive sensory motor neuropathy (76.7%) with proximal (74.2%) and distal involvement (87.1%), ataxia (71.4%), and severe disability (median INCAT at nadir of 8). A total of 11 patients (35%) showed kidney involvement. Most patients (97%) received intravenous immunoglobulin, but only 1 achieved remission with intravenous immunoglobulin. A total of 22 patients (71%) received corticosteroids, and 3 of them (14%) did not need further treatments. Rituximab was effective in 21 of 22 patients (95.5%), with most of them (72%) receiving a single course. Four patients (12.9%) relapsed after a median follow up of 25 months after effective treatment (12–48 months). Anti-CNTN1 titers correlated with clinical scales at sampling and were negative after treatment in all patients, but 1 (20/21). sNfL levels were significantly higher and sCNTN1 significantly lower in anti-CNTN1<sup>+</sup> patients than in healthy controls (sNfL: 135.9 pg/ml vs 7.48 pg/ml, sCNTN1: 25.03 pg/ml vs 22,186 pg/ml, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Both sNfL and sCNTN1 returned to normal levels after successful treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with anti-CNTN1<sup>+</sup> autoimmune nodopathy have a characteristic clinical profile. Clinical and immunological relapses are infrequent after successful treatment, suggesting that continuous treatment is unnecessary. Anti-CNTN1 antibodies, sNfL, and sCNTN1 levels are useful to monitor disease status in these patients. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                A recent study by Kaneko and colleagues provides evidence that developing cranial motor neurons in larval zebrafish refine their input specificity over time, using an activity-dependent mechanism that may depend, in part, on adaptive dendrite extension. These findings illuminate the mechanism by which spatially overlapping motor pools are recruited into distinct motor circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96357">Circadian regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium response in cultured mouse astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system orchestrates 24 hr rhythms in physiology and behavior by regulating rhythmic transcription in cells. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells, play crucial roles in CNS functions, but the impact of the circadian clock on astrocyte functions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified 412 circadian rhythmic transcripts in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes through RNA sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that genes involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis are under circadian control. Notably, <i>Herpud1</i> (<i>Herp</i>) exhibited robust circadian rhythmicity at both mRNA and protein levels, a rhythm disrupted in astrocytes lacking the circadian transcription factor, BMAL1. HERP regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by modulating the degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (ITPRs). ATP-stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release varied with the circadian phase, being more pronounced at subjective night phase, likely due to the rhythmic expression of ITPR2. Correspondingly, ATP-stimulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases were heightened at the subjective night phase. This rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response led to circadian phase-dependent variations in the phosphorylation of Connexin 43 (Ser368) and gap junctional communication. Given the role of gap junction channel (GJC) in propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we suggest that this circadian regulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses could affect astrocytic modulation of synaptic activity according to the time of day. Overall, our study enhances the understanding of how the circadian clock influences astrocyte function in the CNS, shedding light on their potential role in daily variations of brain activity and health.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96665">Implicit motor adaptation patterns in a redundant motor task manipulating a stick with both hands</a></h4>

              
                The remarkable ability of the motor system to adapt to novel environments has traditionally been investigated using kinematically non-redundant tasks, such as planar reaching movements. This limitation prevents the study of how the motor system achieves adaptation by altering the movement patterns of our redundant body. To address this issue, we developed a redundant motor task in which participants reached for targets with the tip of a virtual stick held with both hands. Despite the redundancy of the task, participants consistently employed a stereotypical strategy of flexibly changing the tilt angle of the stick depending on the direction of tip movement. Thus, this baseline relationship between tip-movement direction and stick-tilt angle constrained both the physical and visual movement patterns of the redundant system. Our task allowed us to systematically investigate how the motor system implicitly changed both the tip-movement direction and the stick-tilt angle in response to imposed visual perturbations. Both types of perturbations, whether directly affecting the task (tip-movement direction) or not (stick-tilt angle around the tip), drove adaptation, and the patterns of implicit adaptation were guided by the baseline relationship. Consequently, tip-movement adaptation was associated with changes in stick-tilt angle, and intriguingly, even seemingly ignorable stick-tilt perturbations significantly influenced tip-movement adaptation, leading to tip-movement direction errors. These findings provide a new understanding that the baseline relationship plays a crucial role not only in how the motor system controls movement of the redundant system, but also in how it implicitly adapts to modify movement patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93060">Aligned and oblique dynamics in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The relation between neural activity and behaviorally relevant variables is at the heart of neuroscience research. When strong, this relation is termed a neural representation. There is increasing evidence, however, for partial dissociations between activity in an area and relevant external variables. While many explanations have been proposed, a theoretical framework for the relationship between external and internal variables is lacking. Here, we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to explore the question of when and how neural dynamics and the network’s output are related from a geometrical point of view. We find that training RNNs can lead to two dynamical regimes: dynamics can either be aligned with the directions that generate output variables, or oblique to them. We show that the choice of readout weight magnitude before training can serve as a control knob between the regimes, similar to recent findings in feedforward networks. These regimes are functionally distinct. Oblique networks are more heterogeneous and suppress noise in their output directions. They are furthermore more robust to perturbations along the output directions. Crucially, the oblique regime is specific to recurrent (but not feedforward) networks, arising from dynamical stability considerations. Finally, we show that tendencies toward the aligned or the oblique regime can be dissociated in neural recordings. Altogether, our results open a new perspective for interpreting neural activity by relating network dynamics and their output.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97188">Attentional modulation of secondary somatosensory and visual thalamus of mice</a></h4>

              
                Each sensory modality has its own primary and secondary thalamic nuclei. While the primary thalamic nuclei are well understood to relay sensory information from the periphery to the cortex, the role of secondary sensory nuclei is elusive. We trained head-fixed mice to attend to one sensory modality while ignoring a second modality, namely to attend to touch and ignore vision, or vice versa. Arrays were used to record simultaneously from the secondary somatosensory thalamus (POm) and secondary visual thalamus (LP). In mice trained to respond to tactile stimuli and ignore visual stimuli, POm was robustly activated by touch and largely unresponsive to visual stimuli. A different pattern was observed when mice were trained to respond to visual stimuli and ignore touch, with POm now more robustly activated during visual trials. This POm activity was not explained by differences in movements (i.e. whisking, licking, pupil dilation) resulting from the two tasks. Post hoc histological reconstruction of array tracks through POm revealed that subregions varied in their degree of plasticity. LP exhibited similar phenomena. We conclude that behavioral training reshapes activity in secondary thalamic nuclei. Secondary nuclei respond to the same behaviorally relevant, reward-predicting stimuli regardless of stimulus modality.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94000">The BRAIN Initiative data-sharing ecosystem: Characteristics, challenges, benefits, and opportunities</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we provide an overview and analysis of the BRAIN Initiative data-sharing ecosystem. First, we compare and contrast the characteristics of the seven BRAIN Initiative data archives germane to data sharing and reuse, namely data submission and access procedures and aspects of interoperability. Second, we discuss challenges, benefits, and future opportunities, focusing on issues largely specific to sharing human data and drawing on <i>N</i> = 34 interviews with diverse stakeholders. The BRAIN Initiative-funded archive ecosystem faces interoperability and data stewardship challenges, such as achieving and maintaining interoperability of data and archives and harmonizing research participants’ informed consents for tiers of access for human data across multiple archives. Yet, a benefit of this distributed archive ecosystem is the ability of more specialized archives to adapt to the needs of particular research communities. Finally, the multiple archives offer ample raw material for network evolution in response to the needs of neuroscientists over time. Our first objective in this paper is to provide a guide to the BRAIN Initiative data-sharing ecosystem for readers interested in sharing and reusing neuroscience data. Second, our analysis supports the development of empirically informed policy and practice aimed at making neuroscience data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

">Disordered Hippocampal Reactivations Predict Spatial Memory Deficits in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by progressive memory decline associated with hippocampal degeneration. However, the specific physiological mechanisms underlying hippocampal dysfunction in AD remain poorly understood and improved knowledge may aid both diagnosis and help identify new avenues for therapeutic intervention. We investigated how disruptions in hippocampal reactivations relate to place cell stability and spatial memory deficits in an AD mouse model. Using the APP knock-in mouse model 'NL-G-F', we conducted simultaneous behavioural and electrophysiological recordings in a radial arm maze. NL-G-F mice exhibited significant impairments in memory performance, demonstrated by an increased propensity to revisit arms, compared to wild-type controls. These memory deficits were associated with a reduction in the stability of hippocampal place cells, which occurred over short timescales and was accentuated across rest. While the rate of hippocampal reactivation events during rest was unchanged, the structure of these events was significantly degraded in NL-G-F mice. The decreased structure of reactivations was predictive of decreased stability in place cell firing. These findings suggest that disrupted reactivation sequences may act as a mechanism of memory disorder in AD.

">Distinguishing the activity of adjacent somatosensory nuclei within the brainstem using 3T fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Experimental evidence in animal models indicates that the brainstem plays a major role in sensory modulation. However, mapping functional activity within the human brainstem presents many methodological challenges. These constraints have deterred essential research into human sensory brainstem processing. Here, using a 3T fMRI sequence optimised for the brainstem, combined with uni- and multivariate analysis approaches, we investigated the extent to which functional activity of neighbouring somatosensory nuclei can be delineated in the brainstem, thalamus and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Whilst traditional univariate approaches offered limited differentiation between adjacent hand and face activation in the brainstem, multivariate classification enabled above-chance decoding of these activity patterns across S1, the thalamus, and the brainstem. Our findings establish a robust methodological approach to explore signal processing within the brainstem and across the entire somatosensory stream. This is a fundamental step towards broadening our understanding of somatosensory processing within humans and determining what changes in sensory integration may occur in clinical populations following sensory deprivation.

">Ciliopathy interacts with neonatal anesthesia to cause non-apoptotic caspase-mediated motor deficits</a></h4>

              
                Increasing evidence suggests that anesthesia may induce developmental neurotoxicity, yet the influence of genetic predispositions associated with congenital anomalies on this toxicity remains largely unknown. Children with congenital heart disease often exhibit mutations in cilia-related genes and ciliary dysfunction, requiring sedation for their catheter or surgical interventions during the neonatal period. Here we demonstrate that briefly exposing ciliopathic neonatal mice to ketamine causes motor skill impairments, which are associated with a baseline deficit in neocortical layer V neuron apical spine density and their altered dynamics during motor learning.. These neuromorphological changes were linked to augmented non-apoptotic neuronal caspase activation. Neonatal caspase suppression rescued the spine density and motor deficits, confirming the requirement for sublethal caspase signaling in appropriate spine formation and motor learning. Our findings suggest that ciliopathy interacts with ketamine to induce motor impairments, which is reversible through caspase inhibition. Furthermore, they underscore the potential for ketamine-induced sublethal caspase responses in shaping neurodevelopmental outcomes.

">Pubertal hormones and the early adolescent female brain: a multimodality brain MRI study</a></h4>

              
                Puberty is a critical developmental process that is associated with changes in steroid hormone levels, which are believed to influence adolescent behaviour via their effects on the developing brain. So far, there are limited and inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between steroid hormones and brain structure and function in adolescent females, with many existing studies employing small sample sizes. Thus, in this study, we explored the association between oestradiol (E2), testosterone (Tes) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and brain structure (gray matter volume, sulcal depth, cortical thickness and white matter microstructure) and function (resting-state connectivity, emotional n-back task-related function) in 3024 adolescent females (age 8.92 - 13.33 years, mean age (SD) = 10.37 (0.94) years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We used elastic-net regression with cross-validation to investigate associations between hormones and brain phenotypes derived from multiple imaging modalities. We found that structural brain features, including cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and white matter microstructure, were among the most important features associated with hormones. E2 was most strongly associated with prefrontal and premotor regions involved in working memory and emotion processing, while Tes and DHEA were most strongly associated with parietal and occipital regions involved in visuospatial functioning. All three hormones were also associated with prefrontal, temporoparietal junction and insula cortices. Thus, using an advanced methodological approach, this study suggests both unique and overlapping neural correlates of pubertal hormones in adolescent females and sheds light on the mechanisms by which puberty influences adolescent development and behaviour.

">Visuo-Vestibular Integration for Self-Motion: Human Cortical Area V6 Prefers Forward and Congruent Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: The integration of visual and vestibular input is crucial for self-motion. Information from both sensory systems merges early in the central nervous system. Among the numerous cortical areas involved in processing this information, some (V6 and VIP) respond specifically to vestibular anteroposterior information. OBJECTIVE: To further understand the involvement of these and other areas in self-motion processing when vestibular and visual information are combined with varying congruence and direction parameters. METHODS: Fifteen subjects underwent an MRI session while receiving visual (optic flow patterns) and galvanic vestibular stimuli mimicking six conditions: (1) visual forward, (2) visual backward, visual forward with (3) congruent or (4) incongruent vestibular information, visual backward with (5) congruent or (6) incongruent vestibular information. RESULTS: The combination of concurrent vestibular stimulation and fully consistant optic flow patterns activated several bilateral cortical areas found predominantly in the insula. Among these vestibular areas and those previously defined in our initial study, the large majority do not show any specifity for the forward/backward direction or for the visuo-vestibular congruency. A notable exception was the parieto-occipital area V6, which showed a marked preference for congruent visuo-vestibular signals and for cues signaling forward motion. CONCLUSIONS: By showing that V6 is more active when visuo-vestibular signals are more ecological (i.e. when both signals specify the most common self-motion direction), our results support the view that this area plays a crucial role in visuo-vestibular integration during self-motion.

">Systemic exposure to COVID-19 virus-like particles modulates firing patterns of cortical neurons in the living mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic infection that affects the central nervous system. We used virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice that express the wild-type human tau protein (htau mice). VLP exposure elicited dose-dependent changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings of primary somatosensory and motor cortex neurons that express the jGCaMP7s calcium sensor tracked modifications of neuronal activity patterns following exposure to VLPs. There was a substantial short-term increase in stimulus-evoked activity metrics in both WT and htau VLP-injected mice, while htau mice showed also increased spontaneous activity metrics and increase activity in the vehicle-injected group. Over the following weeks, activity metrics in WT mice subsided, but remained above baseline levels. For htau mice, activity metrics either remain elevated or decreased to lower levels than baseline. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. The htau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background, exhibited more severe pathobiology that may lead to more adverse outcomes.

">UniSPAC: A Unified Segmentation Framework for Proofreading and Annotation in Connectomics</a></h4>

              
                Reconstructing dense neuronal connections from volume electron microscopy (vEM) images is a critical challenge in neuroscience, driving the development of various automatic neuron segmentation methods. Although current state-of-the-art automated segmentation methods can achieve high segmentation accuracy, they still require substantial manual proofreading and rely heavily on labeled datasets, which are often scarce, particularly for non-model organisms. Here, we introduce a Unified Segmentation framework for Proofreading and Annotation in Connectomics (UniSPAC) by providing the interactive segmentation model in 2D-level and the neuron tracing model in 3D-level. UniSPAC-2D allows users to correct its segmentation errors through point-based prompts, combining segmentation and proofreading in a single framework. UniSPAC-3D automatically traces neurons segmented by UniSPAC-2D across image slices, significantly reducing human involvement. Furthermore, UniSPAC-2D and UniSPAC-3D models can facilitate the semi-automatic generation of labeled data for new species, eliminating the need for external annotation tools. The fresh annotated data generated during proofreading in turn optimizes the interactive model through an online learning strategy, reducing the labeling effort for novel species over time. UniSPAC outperforms the start-of-the-art Segment Anything Model (SAM) in Drosophila segmentation, achieving 47x higher efficiency, and surpasses ACRLSD in cross-species segmentation on zebra finch data.

">Physioxia-modulated mesenchymal stem cells secretome has higher capacity to preserve neuronal network and translation processes in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in vitro model</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the leading causes of child death worldwide. Most of the survivors develop various neurological diseases, such as cerebral palsy, seizures, and/or motor and behavioral problems. HIE is caused by an episode of perinatal asphyxia, which interrupts the blood supply to the brain. Due to its high energy demands, this interruption initiates glutamate excitotoxic pathways, leading to cell death. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC MSCs) are gaining attention as a promising complement to the current clinical approach, based on therapeutic hypothermia, which has shown limited efficacy. Previous data have shown that priming MSCs under physiological culture conditions, namely soft platforms (3kPa), mechanomodulated, or physiological oxygen levels (5% O2), physioxia, leads to changes in the cellular proteome and their secretome. To evaluate how exposing MSCs to these culture conditions could impact their therapeutic potential, physiologically primed UC MSCs or their secretome were added to an in vitro HIE model using cortical neurons primary cultures subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) insult. By comparing the neuronal proteome of sham, OGD insulted, and OGD-treated neurons, it was possible to identify proteins whose levels were restored in the presence of UC-MSCs or their secretome. Despite the different approaches that differentially altered UC-MSCs proteome and secretome, the effects converged on the re-establishment of the levels of proteins involved in translation mechanisms (such as the 40S and 60s ribosomal subunits), possibly stabilizing proteostasis, which is known to be essential for neuronal recovery. Interestingly, treatment with the secretome of UC-MSC modulated under physioxic conditions sustained part of the neuronal network integrity and modulated several mitochondrial proteins, including those proteins involved in ATP production. This suggests that the unique composition of the physioxia-modulated secretome may offer a therapeutical advantage in restoring essential cellular processes that help neurons maintain their function, compared to traditionally expanded UC-MSCs. These findings suggest that both the presence of UC-MSCs and their secretome alone can influence multiple targets and signaling pathways, collectively promoting neuronal survival following an OGD insult.

">Insulin resistance, cognition, and functional brain network topology in older adults with obesity</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Cross-sectional data from a sample of older adults with obesity was used to determine how peripheral and neuronal insulin resistance (IR) relate to executive function and functional brain network topology. Methods: Older adults (n=71) with obesity but without type 2 diabetes were included in analyses. Peripheral IR was quantified by HOMA2-IR. Neuronal IR was quantified according to a proposed neuron-derived exosome-based method (NDE-IR). An executive function composite score, summed scores to the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) trials 1-5, and functional brain networks generated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were outcomes in analyses. We used general linear models and a novel regression framework for brain network analysis to identify relationships between IR measures and brain-related outcomes. Results: HOMA2-IR, but not NDE-IR, was negatively associated with executive function. Neither IR measure was associated with AVLT score. Peripheral IR was also related to hippocampal network topology in participants who had undergone functional neuroimaging. Neither peripheral nor neuronal IR were significantly related to network topology of the central executive network. Conclusions: Cognitive and functional imaging effects were observed from HOMA2-IR, but not NDE-IR. The hippocampus may be particularly vulnerable to effects of peripheral IR.

This study recruited 48 amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients, assigning them to intermittent theta burst stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and sham groups (5 times/wk for 4 wk). Neuropsychological assessments and functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected pre- and post-treatment. Regarding efficacy, both angular gyrus intermittent theta burst stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation significantly improved general cognitive function and memory compared to the sham group, with no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups. Mechanistically, significant changes in brain activity within the temporoparietal network were observed in both the intermittent theta burst stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation groups, and these changes correlated with improvements in general cognitive and memory functions. Additionally, intermittent theta burst stimulation showed stronger modulation of functional connectivity between the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal regions compared to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The intermittent theta burst stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can improve cognitive function in amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients, but intermittent theta burst stimulation may offer higher efficiency. Intermittent theta burst stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation likely enhance cognitive function, especially memory function, by modulating the temporoparietal network.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Language production in bilinguals relies on the collaborative interaction between two neural systems: the language control system (e.g. the right inferior frontal gyrus) and the language processing system (e.g. the left superior temporal gyrus).

To investigate this, our study applied online transcranial magnetic stimulation to the right inferior frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus in Chinese–English bilinguals performing a language-switching task. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was administered within seven 100 ms time windows (TW1 to TW7) following the picture onset. We observed time window–specific enhancements of language control, as shown by a significant reduction in switching costs upon the stimulations on both sites relative to the sham stimulation: specifically, the right inferior frontal gyrus at TW1, TW2, TW4, and TW5 and the left superior temporal gyrus at TW2 and TW5. These findings indicate a double-strike top–down control mechanism underpinned by the pathway from the right inferior frontal gyrus to the right inferior frontal gyrus, potentially during both stages during production: the language task schema and the lemma selection.

	<p>Schizophrenia, a highly complex psychiatric disorder, presents significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to its multifaceted neurobiological underpinnings. Recent advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the understanding and management of this condition. This manuscript explores how the integration of these technologies has unveiled key insights into schizophrenia&amp;amp;rsquo;s structural and functional neural anomalies. fMRI research highlights disruptions in crucial brain regions like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, alongside impaired connectivity within networks such as the default mode network (DMN). These alterations correlate with the cognitive deficits and emotional dysregulation characteristic of schizophrenia. AI techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have enhanced the detection and analysis of these complex patterns, surpassing traditional methods in precision. Algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have proven particularly effective in identifying biomarkers and aiding early diagnosis. Despite these advancements, challenges such as variability in methodologies and the disorder&amp;amp;rsquo;s heterogeneity persist, necessitating large-scale, collaborative studies for clinical translation. Moreover, ethical considerations surrounding data integrity, algorithmic transparency, and patient individuality must guide AI&amp;amp;rsquo;s integration into psychiatry. Looking ahead, AI-augmented fMRI holds promise for tailoring personalized interventions, addressing unique neural dysfunctions, and improving therapeutic outcomes for individuals with schizophrenia. This convergence of neuroimaging and computational innovation heralds a transformative era in precision psychiatry.</p>

	<p>Background: The aim of this study is to use an eye tracker to compare the understanding of three forms of implicitness (i.e., presupposition, conversational implicatures, and irony) in 139 pupils from the first to the fifth year of elementary school. Methods: The child was invited to read short texts composed of a context about some characters and a target sentence conveying one of the three kinds of implicitness. After that, there was a comprehension yes/no question to check whether the child had understood the implicit content of the target sentence. At the same time eye, movements were recorded by a remote system (Pro Fusion by Tobii). The number of correct answers, the duration, and the number of fixations on the texts were measured. Results: We showed that children&amp;amp;rsquo;s reading time is positively correlated with the accurate comprehension of implicitness, and that children similarly understand the three types of implicitness. Furthermore, the number and the duration of fixations depend both on the age of the children and on their good or poor understanding of the implicit contents. This fact is particularly noticeable for children in the first-grade class, for whom fixations are significantly longer and more frequent when they correctly understand sentences containing implicitness. Conclusion: These results argue in favor of the possibility of teaching the comprehension of some types of implicitness (presupposition, implicature, and irony) from an early age.</p>

	<p>Background: Electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers with adequate sensitivity and specificity to reflect the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s health status can become indispensable for health monitoring during prolonged missions in space. The objective of our study was to assess whether the basic features of the posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) change under microgravity conditions compared to earth-based scalp EEG recordings. Methods: Three crew members during the 16-day AXIOM-1 mission to the International Space Station (ISS), underwent scalp EEG recordings before, during, and after the mission by means of a dry-electrode self-donning headgear designed to support long-term EEG recordings in space. Resting-state recordings were performed with eyes open and closed during relaxed wakefulness. The electrodes representative of EEG activity in each occipital lobe were used, and consecutive PDR oscillations were identified during periods of eye closure. In turn, cursor-based markers were placed at the negative peak of each sinusoidal wave of the PDR. Waveform averaging and time-frequency analysis were performed for all PDR samples for the respective pre-mission, mission, and post-mission EEGs. Results: No significant differences were found in the mean frequency of the PDR in any of the crew subjects between their EEG on the ISS and their pre- or post-mission EEG on ground level. The PDR oscillations varied over a &amp;amp;plusmn;1Hz standard deviation range. Similarly, no significant differences were found in PDR&amp;amp;rsquo;s power spectral density. Conclusions: Our study shows that the spectral features of the PDR remain within normal limits in a short exposure to the microgravity environment, with its frequency manifesting within an acceptable &amp;amp;plusmn;1 Hz variation from the pre-mission mean. Further investigations for EEG features and markers reflecting the human brain neurophysiology during space missions are required.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine if performing ultrasound-guided, bilateral, two-level cervical sympathetic chain blocks (2LCSBs) (performed on subsequent days) improves symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) that do not overlap with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted between August 2022 and February 2023. We identified twenty patients who received bilateral 2LCSBs for PTSD and anxiety symptoms and who also had a history of TBI. Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) scores were collected at baseline, one week, and one month post treatment in 13 males and 7 females. A sub-analysis of the first ten questions of the NSI, which we identified as not overlapping with PTSD or anxiety symptoms, generated an NSI sub-score. Results: Out of 20 patients, all showed improvement in their NSI scores and NSI sub-scores. The NSI sub-scores had a baseline average of 15.45 (on a 40-point scale); the average score at one week post treatment was 8.30; and that at one month post treatment was 7.80. This represents a 49.51% improvement in TBI symptoms which did not overlap with PTSD or anxiety symptoms between baseline and one month. Conclusions: The use of bilateral 2LCSBs may be helpful in treating patients with TBI, regardless of the presence of comorbid PTSD symptoms.</p>

                <p>The growing field of social neuroscience is reliant on the development of robust, ecologically valid paradigms for simulating social interaction and measuring social cognition in highly controlled laboratory settings. Perspective taking is a key component of social cognition, and accordingly several paradigms aimed at measuring perspective taking exist. A relatively novel paradigm is the ball detection task, in which participants and a virtual agent form independent beliefs about the presence of a target stimulus behind an occluder. Previous studies have shown that incongruent trials (in which the participant's and the agent's beliefs differ) affect participant reaction times and elicit increased neural activity in the so-called mentalizing network. This paradigm has important advantages over previous ones, in that experimental conditions can be fully randomized, and ceiling effects are not found even for adult populations. Here, we combined this paradigm with a stress induction and a nonstressful control task. In an online study, we found no evidence of perspective taking at the behavioral level. Combining the task with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found no evidence of perspective taking at the behavioral or neural level, even for the control condition. While this paradigm is reliable on its own, implementing it in the context of a task-switching paradigm appears to reduce participants&rsquo; focus on task-irrelevant perspective taking elements. Our findings highlight the fragility of existing social cognition paradigms and the need for reliable, simple, and ecologically valid measures of perspective taking.</p>

                <p>Fear generalization is a hallmark of anxiety disorders. Experimentally, fear generalization can be difficult to dissociate from its counterpart, fear discrimination. Here, we use minimal threat learning procedures to reveal such a dissociation. We show that in Long&ndash;Evans rats, an auditory threat cue predicting footshock on 10% of trials produces a discriminated fear response that does not generalize to a neutral auditory cue. In contrast, even slightly higher footshock probabilities (30 and 20%) produce fear generalization. AAV-mediated, caspase-3 deletion of ventral pallidum neurons abolishes fear generalization and reduces threat cue responding during extinction. The ventral pallidum's contribution to fear generalization and extinction threat responding does not depend on inputs from the nucleus accumbens. The results demonstrate a minimal threat learning approach to dissociate fear discrimination from fear generalization and a novel role for the ventral pallidum in generalizing and expressing fear.</p>

                <p>The cortico-basal ganglia loop has traditionally been conceptualized as consisting of three distinct information networks: motor, limbic, and associative. However, this three-loop concept is insufficient to comprehensively explain the diverse functions of the cortico-basal ganglia system, as emerging evidence suggests its involvement in sensory processing, including the auditory systems. In the present study, we demonstrate the auditory cortico-basal ganglia loop by using transgenic mice and viral-assisted labelings. The caudal part of the external globus pallidus (GPe) emerged as a major output nucleus of the auditory cortico-basal ganglia loop with the cortico-striato-pallidal projections as its input pathway and pallido-cortical and pallido&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical projections as its output pathway. GABAergic neurons in the caudal GPe dominantly innervated the nonlemniscal auditory pathway. They also projected to various regions, including the substantia nigra pars lateralis, cuneiform nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. Considering the functions associated with these GPe-projecting regions, auditory cortico-basal ganglia circuits may play a pivotal role in eliciting defensive behaviors against acoustic stimuli.</p>

                <p>Aggression and mating of male mice are strongly associated with Esr1-expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTpr) and hypothalamus in the vomeronasal pathway. By projecting to the downstream hypothalamus, the upstream BNSTpr<sup>Esr1</sup> gates mating and aggression of male mice and maternal behavior of female mice. The medial preoptic area (MPOA) and ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) are two subdivisions of the hypothalamus downstream. In addition to receiving projections from upstream BNSTpr, there is also a mutual projection between MPOA and VMHvl. In the process of transforming sex information into mating and aggression, Esr1-expressing neurons in BNSTpr, MPOA, and VMHvl act as messengers of information, finally producing inhibitory or excitatory projection. These projections are different in direction, but they all work together to control the behavior selection that is most conducive to defense and reproduction when male mice encounter female or male mice. Here, we summarized the property and the function of connections between these Esr1-expressing neurons in BNSTpr, MPOA, and VMHvl that encode mating and aggression and highlight the importance and benefits of inhibitory projection of Esr1-expressing cells in mating and aggression.</p>

                <p>Brain-derived estrogen (17&beta;-estradiol, E2) is a neuromodulator that plays important roles in neural plasticity and network excitability. Chronic inhibition of estrogen synthesis is used in adjuvant breast cancer therapy for estrogen receptor-positive tumors and may have been associated with cognitive and affective side effects. Here, we have developed a model of adjuvant therapy in female ovariectomized mice in which the E2 biosynthetic enzyme aromatase is inhibited by letrozole (1&nbsp;mg/kg/day, i.p., for up to 3&nbsp;weeks), Using two-photon longitudinal in vivo imaging in Thy1-GFP-M mice, we found that spine density in the apical dendrites of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal cells was unaffected by letrozole treatment but spine turnover was reduced. LTP in layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapses in the somatosensory cortex was also reduced in slices from letrozole-treated mice, showing deficits in structural and functional plasticity resulting from aromatase inhibition. Ovariectomized mice performed worse than intact control mice in the novel object recognition test but, surprisingly, letrozole treatment rescued this deficit.</p>

                <p>Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is marked by enlarged cerebral ventricles with normal intracranial pressure, plus three stereotypical symptoms: gait impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary frequency with urge incontinence. The neural circuit dysfunction responsible for each of these symptoms remains unknown, and an adult mouse model would expand opportunities to explore these mechanisms in preclinical experiments. Here, we describe the first mouse model of chronic, communicating hydrocephalus with normal intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalic male and female mice had unsteady gait and reduced maximum velocity. Despite performing well on a variety of behavioral tests, they exhibited subtle learning impairments. Hydrocephalic mice also developed urinary frequency, and many became incontinent. This mouse model, with symptoms resembling human NPH, can be combined with molecular-genetic tools in any mouse strain to explore the neural circuit mechanisms of these symptoms. Preclinical work using this hydrocephalus model will lead to the development of new treatments for NPH symptoms.</p>

                <p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation method that modulates brain activity by inducing electric fields in the brain. Real-time, state-dependent stimulation with TMS has shown that neural oscillation phase modulates corticospinal excitability. However, such motor evoked potentials (MEPs) only indirectly reflect motor cortex activation and are unavailable at other brain regions of interest. The direct and secondary cortical effects of phase-dependent brain stimulation remain an open question. In this study, we recorded the cortical responses during single-pulse TMS using electroencephalography (EEG) concurrently with the MEP measurements in 20 healthy human volunteers (11 female). TMS was delivered at peak, rising, trough, and falling phases of mu (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) and beta (14&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) oscillations in the motor cortex. The cortical responses were quantified through TMS evoked potential components N15, P50, and N100 as peak-to-peak amplitudes (P50-N15 and P50-N100). We further analyzed whether the prestimulus frequency band power was predictive of the cortical responses. We demonstrated that phase-specific targeting modulates cortical responses. The phase relationship between cortical responses was different for early and late responses. In addition, pre-TMS mu oscillatory power and phase significantly predicted both early and late cortical EEG responses in mu-specific targeting, indicating the independent causal effects of phase and power. However, only pre-TMS beta power significantly predicted the early and late TEP components during beta-specific targeting. Further analyses indicated distinct roles of mu and beta power on cortical responses. These findings provide insight to mechanistic understanding of neural oscillation states in cortical and corticospinal activation in humans.</p>

                Abstract Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant global health challenge particularly in developing countries and regions. Gezira State, Sudan where prevalence and disease burden are high is an example of such regions. This study aimed to quantify HBV viral load among patients in Gezira State and assess the distribution of viral loads across demographic groups, including gender and age. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2022 and January 2023. Randomly selected 100 chronic HBV patients were enrolled from major healthcare facilities in Wad Medani, Gezira’s capital. Viral loads were measured using real-time PCR, and statistical analyses were performed to identify predictors of high viral load. Results The results revealed that the mean HBV viral load was 886,363 IU/ml (SD± 421,295), with a significantly higher mean in males (1,122,899 IU/ml) compared to females (531,559 IU/ml) (p< 0.0001). Viral loads ranged from 15 IU/ml to 35,474,488 IU/ml, with 37% of patients exceeding the WHO-recommended treatment threshold of 2,000 IU/ml. However, no significant association was found between viral load and age (p=0.939). Conclusion The study highlighted the need for gender-specific management strategies and the importance of HBV viral load quantification for effective public health intervention in Gezira State. Further research is recommended to explore HBV epidemiology in Sudan more comprehensively.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-302/v4?src=rss">Efficacy of Lycium barbarum (Goji berry) mouthwash for managing periodontitis: a randomized clinical trial [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Removal of the microbial deposits (plaque and calculus) by performing effective scaling and root planing (SRP) is the fundamental step for managing periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). Various adjuncts in the form of mouthwash, gels, and toothpaste are also being used as adjuncts to SRP for managing periodontitis. Recently, Lycium barbarum (L. barbarum), commonly known as goji berry or wolfberry, has gained popularity for managing chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, its efficacy in managing periodontitis has never been explored. Hence the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of goji berry mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash for managing periodontitis. Methods 60 adult participants were divided randomly using computer-generated random sequences into two groups (case group: L. barbarum mouthwash (Males: 16; Female: 14); control group: 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (Males: 14; Females: 16)). The changes in the gingival index (Gi), plaque index (Pi), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), microbial load, and antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were noted at the baseline, at 15 days and one month. Results A significant reduction in the mean PPD, Pi, BOP, and Gi was seen from baseline to one month in both the control (P-value=0.006, 0.027, 0.000, and 0.036 respectively) and test groups (P-value=0.035, 0.000, 0.034, and 0.000 respectively). However, the antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were significantly increased only in the test group. Conclusion Goji berry mouthwash along with SRP reduced the Gi, Pi, BOP, and PPD in patients with periodontitis. However, no statistically significant difference was noted between the use of goji berry and chlorhexidine mouthwash. Goji berry mouthwash was more effective than chlorhexidine in increasing the antioxidant levels in saliva.

                Background The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the prevalence of heavy metal contamination in fish, fruits, and vegetables in Southwest Nigeria. The review focused on studies published over a ten-year period, between 2014 and 2024. Methods Articles used for the study were obtained by conducting a comprehensive literature search using several databases, including ResearchGate, Scopus, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PubMed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). To identify relevant studies, a plethora of keywords were utilized to search for articles in the selected databases, including. Articles reporting heavy metal contamination in specified food products within the last decade were included. Results Of the 10,212 initially identified articles, 64 met the inclusion criteria after thorough screening. The selected studies were predominantly conducted in Lagos (30), Ondo (8), and Ogun (7) states, with few studies in Oyo, Ekiti, and Osun states. The majority of the research focused on fish (40 studies), followed by vegetables (20) and fruits (4). The commonly studied fish species were observed to be Tilapia zilli, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, Clarias gariepinus, and Oreochromis niloticus, with heavy metal concentrations frequently exceeded WHO limits. Conclusions Therefore, this review highlights the significant risks posed by the presence of heavy metals in food products and underscores the importance of stringent environmental monitoring and the adoption of appropriate regulatory mechanisms for health and environmental risk mitigation. This could help in the formulation of appropriate policy implementation strategies geared towards mitigating heavy metal contamination in the region’s food supply.

                The term Research Software Engineer, or RSE, emerged a little over 10 years ago as a way to represent individuals working in the research community but focusing on software development. The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging. In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of foundational competencies as well as values that outline the general profile of an RSE. Further research and training can build upon this foundation of skills and focus on various aspects in greater detail. We expect that graduates and practitioners will have a larger and more diverse set of skills than outlined here. On this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different dimensions. We look at specific types of RSE roles, propose recommendations for organisations, give examples of future specialisations, and detail how existing curricula fit into this framework.

                This study aims to evaluate the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on the performance of healthcare supply chain management (HCSCMP) by examining both overall efficiency improvements and identifying critical success factors for effective implementation. Through a systematic literature review, the research investigates how BDA enhances real-time decision-making within healthcare supply chains (HCSCs) and identifies the key enablers required for successful BDA adoption. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to analyze 65 papers, resulting in the inclusion of 39 studies published between 2016 and 2023. The review revealed a preference for literature reviews and questionnaires as the primary research methods. The findings indicate that BDA significantly improves HCSCs’ efficiency, particularly in real-time decision-making and operational management. However, successful BDA implementation depends on addressing critical enablers and overcoming associated challenges.

                Abstract Introduction Preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL), part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, involves giving carbohydrate-rich liquids before surgery instead of traditional fasting. It improves glucose control, reduces insulin resistance, and enhances patient comfort. Methods A comprehensive scoping review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies from 2017 to 2024. Primary, English-language clinical trial involving pediatric patients were included without restrictions on surgical procedure, or outcomes. Data extraction was focused on sample sizes, PCL types, and perioperative outcomes. Results The scoping review examined 10 studies on PCL in pediatric surgery, covering various procedures with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 1200 participants. Most studies indicated metabolic benefits, with 7 out of 11 showing stabilized blood glucose and reduced hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, 5 studies associated PCL with reduced preoperative anxiety, agitation, and discomfort, including thirst and hunger. For stomach content, 5 studies showed PCL reduced gastric residual volume and improved pH. Postoperative findings were mixed: 4 studies found no significant difference in nausea and vomiting, while 2 suggested benefits. Length of hospital stay from 3 studies showed no clinical difference results. Conclusions PCL in pediatric surgery shows potential to stabilize blood glucose, reduce metabolic risks, and improve recovery. However, the evidence regarding outcomes such as length of hospital stay and postoperative complications remains inconsistent, indicating the need for further investigation.

                Background Algeria has made significant progress in addressing childhood undernutrition. Despite improvements, nearly 12% of Algerian children under five years of age suffered from stunting in 2022. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of three indicators of undernutrition (stunting, wasting, and underweight) and their associated variables in children aged 0–23 months in Algeria between 2013 and 2019. Methods Pooled data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) (2012-13 and 2018-19) covering 14,498 children were used. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to test the associations. Results Stunting decreased significantly, but wasting and being underweight showed no significant reductions from 2013 to 2019. Stunting, wasting, and underweight decreased by 2.2%, 1.3%, and 0.3%, respectively, with an overall prevalence of 10.1%, 5.4%, and 3.6%, respectively. Factors associated with undernutrition included child age and small size at birth, whereas stunting was linked to the poorest households, male children, higher maternal body mass index (BMI), and low antenatal care (ANC) visits. Wasting was associated with younger age and paternal age, fewer maternal ANC visits, underweight male sex, low maternal education, high maternal BMI, and delayed breastfeeding initiation. Conclusion Public health experts and stakeholders must adopt a comprehensive community-centered approach to achieve long-term improvements in child nutrition in Algeria. This strategy should focus on key factors including high maternal BMI, low maternal education, male children, and infrequent ANC visits. This action can help Algeria progress towards achieving the UN’s goal of eradicating malnutrition.

Plant-associated microbiota affect pant growth and development by regulating plant hormones homeostasis. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a well-known plant hormone, can be produced by various plant-associated bacteria. However, the prevalence of bacteria with the capacity to degrade IAA in the rhizosphere has not been systematically studied. In this study, we analyzed the IAA degradation capabilities of bacterial isolates from the roots of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice. Using genomics analysis and in vitro assays, we found that 21 out of 183 taxonomically diverse bacterial isolates possess the ability to degrade IAA. Through comparative genomics and transcriptomic assays, we identified iac-like or iad-like operon in the genomes of these IAA degraders. Additionally, the putative regulator of the operon was found to be highly conserved among these strains through protein structure similarity analysis. Some of the IAA degraders could utilize IAA as their carbon and energy source. In planta, most of the IAA degrading strains mitigated <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice seedling root growth inhibition (RGI) triggered by exogenous IAA. Moreover, RGI caused by complex synthetic bacterial community can be alleviated by introducing IAA degraders. Importantly, we observed increased colonization preference of IAA degraders from soil to root according to the frequency of the biomarker genes in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) collected from different habitats, suggesting that there is a close association between IAA degraders and IAA producers. In summary, our findings further the understanding of the functional diversity and potential biological roles of plant-associated bacteria in host plant root morphogenesis.

                <p>by Alison Philbrook, Michael P. O’Donnell, Laura Grunenkovaite, Piali Sengupta</p>

Sensory neurons contain morphologically diverse primary cilia that are built by intraflagellar transport (IFT) and house sensory signaling molecules. Since both ciliary structural and signaling proteins are trafficked via IFT, it has been challenging to decouple the contributions of IFT and cilia structure to neuronal responses. By acutely inhibiting IFT without altering cilia structure and vice versa, here we describe the differential roles of ciliary trafficking and sensory ending morphology in shaping chemosensory responses in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that a minimum cilium length but not continuous IFT is necessary for a subset of responses in the ASH nociceptive neurons. In contrast, neither cilia nor continuous IFT are necessary for odorant responses in the AWA olfactory neurons. Instead, continuous IFT differentially modulates response dynamics in AWA. Upon acute inhibition of IFT, cilia-destined odorant receptors are shunted to ectopic branches emanating from the AWA cilia base. Spatial segregation of receptors in these branches from a cilia-restricted regulatory kinase results in odorant desensitization defects, highlighting the importance of precise organization of signaling molecules at sensory endings in regulating response dynamics. We also find that adaptation of AWA responses upon repeated exposure to an odorant is mediated by IFT-driven removal of its cognate receptor, whereas adaptation to a second odorant is regulated via IFT-independent mechanisms. Our results reveal unexpected complexity in the contribution of IFT and cilia organization to the regulation of responses even within a single chemosensory neuron type and establish a critical role for these processes in the precise modulation of olfactory behaviors.

Excessive cytokine signaling resulting from dysregulation of a cytokine or its receptor can be a main driver of cancer, autoimmune, or hematopoietic disorders. Here, we leverage protein design to create tailored cytokine receptor blockers with idealized properties. Specifically, we aimed to tackle the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), a mediator of different types of leukemia and autoinflammatory diseases. By modifying designed G-CSFR binders, we engineered hyper-stable proteins that function as nanomolar signaling antagonists. X-ray crystallography showed atomic-level agreement with the experimental structure of an exemplary design. Furthermore, the most potent design blocks G-CSFR in acute myeloid leukemia cells and primary human hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, the resulting designs can be used for inhibiting or homing to G-CSFR-expressing cells. Our results also demonstrate that similarly designed cytokine mimics can be used to derive antagonists to tackle other type I cytokine receptors.

Human language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, however, decomposing events into causally linked agent–patient roles, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent–patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent–patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent–patient relations and attended mostly to background information. These findings raise the possibility that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, has evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined the impact of the rs10191329 genetic risk variant on neuroaxonal damage as measured by serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels, and disability progression in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cohort of pwMS (n = 740), 658 participants were prospectively monitored every 2 years for less than a decade while 82 of 740 pwMS were monitored retrospectively for up to 40 years. We investigated associations between rs10191329 variants and clinical outcome, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), disability accrual (defined by EDSS-increase of at least 1.5 for patients starting at EDSS 0, at least 1.0 EDSS-points for patients with an initial EDSS between 1 and 4.5 and at least 0.5 points for patients starting with an EDSS equal or greater than 5) and progression to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Clinical outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses. Disability accumulation over time was depicted using a generalized mixed-effect model. Single-molecule array was used to assess sNfL levels.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Homozygous, heterozygous, and non-carriers of the rs10191329 risk variant displayed comparable sNfL levels indicating similar neuroaxonal damage at the time of diagnosis. Importantly, in homozygous carriers we found highest sNfL levels in follow-up visits preceding elevated disease progression later in the disease course, a steeper increase in overall disability measures and higher probability of SPMS development.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings highlight how genetic variants may serve as new biomarkers for disease progression and can be used for personalized medicine and risk assessment in MS. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1427/v1?src=rss">The Hidden Toll: Investigating the influence of Corruption on Persistent Suicide in the Americas [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Corruption, a multifaceted governance issue, impacts public well-being globally. The recent trends reveal a rise in suicide rates across the Americas, while all other regions show declines over twenty years of time. This study investigates corruption’s effect on suicide in 26 American countries, considering moderating factors of unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. Methods This study analysed latest two decades of available data, using stepwise panel regression method to investigate the effects of corruption and economic variables on suicide across income levels. Data were sourced from Transparency International, World Bank and the World Health Organization. Initially, unit root tests and CUSUM plots were used to ensure the stability and stationarity of the dataset, and model specification were validated through F test, LM test and Hausman test to select the ideal econometric model - POLS, REM, or FEM for the study. Results A strong suicide rate persistence revealed, particularly in high-income countries, where the lagged suicide variable showed a coefficient of 0.8063 (p < 0.001). Corruption significantly impacted suicide rates in upper-middle-income countries (coefficient = -0.0268, p < 0.05), with higher corruption perceptions scores correlating with lower suicide rates. Additionally, unemployment acted as a significant moderator, intensifying the corruption’s adverse impact on suicide with a coefficient of 0.0022 (p < 0.001) in upper-middle income nations. Economic growth demonstrated a minor protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, with an interaction coefficient of -0.0005 (p < 0.1), suggesting slight suicide reduction linked to economic stability. Conclusion This study found that corruption, unemployment, and economic growth significantly influence suicide rates across the Americas. Corruption exacerbates suicide risks in upper-middle-income countries, while unemployment amplifies this effect. Economic growth offers a slight protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, suggesting that economic stability may help mitigate suicide rates.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1426/v1?src=rss">The effects of teaching strategies on learning to think critically in primary and secondary schools: an overview of systematic reviews [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background We conducted an overview of systematic reviews about the effects of teaching strategies that can be used to teach primary and secondary school students to think critically. Our objective was to inform decisions about what teaching strategies to use in resources that we developed to teach critical thinking about health in secondary schools. Methods We mapped characteristics of systematic reviews of teaching strategies and summarised findings from the most relevant reviews to teaching students to think critically about health. We included reviews that assessed the effects of teaching strategies that could potentially be used in primary or secondary schools to teach students to think critically, had a Methods section with explicit selection criteria, reported at least one outcome measure of the ability to undertake one of four basic types of cognitive tasks (memory, procedural, comprehension, or opinion), and were published after 1999. Results We included 326 systematic reviews. The reviews evaluated a wide range of teaching strategies for a variety of purposes. Important limitations of the reviews included not considering adverse effects (99% of the reviews), not assessing the risk of bias for included studies (93% of the reviews), and not assessing the credibility of subgroup effects (100% of the reviews). We summarised the findings for 37 teaching strategies that we considered most relevant. The certainty of the evidence of the effects varied from very low to moderate. We used 12 of the strategies in resources that we developed to teach secondary students to think critically about health. Conclusions A tremendous amount of work has gone into evaluating the effects of a wide range of teaching strategies. The results of this research can inform decisions about how to teach critical thinking and future research. However, well-designed, up-to-date systematic reviews are still needed for many teaching strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)01370-6?rss=yes">Selective autophagy impedes KSHV entry after recruiting the membrane damage sensor galectin-8 to virus-containing endosomes</a></h4>

              
                Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with endothelial, osteoblastic, and B cell tumors. Schmidt et al. demonstrate that autophagy restricts KSHV during entry. Interaction of the KSHV glycoprotein gH with its entry receptor EphA2 seems to cause endosomal damage that then recruits autophagy via galectin-8 to limit infection.

                Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) navigate through geomagnetic field lines. Wan et al. review recent discoveries, emphasizing the importance of understanding MTB diversity and biomineralization mechanisms for practical applications. They highlight limited knowledge of mechanisms beyond two model strains, suggesting that addressing these gaps could inspire tailored application strategies.

                Bifidobacteriaceae species are important for human health. Pasolli et al. provide an analysis of nearly 10,000 human metagenomes, integrated with over 1,000 isolate genomes, which reveals significant variability in prevalence, functional potential, and subspecies identification across various human host characteristics.

                Liu et al. uncovered that MDSS-1 in neurons enables the detection of probiotics and initiating cell-non-autonomous UPRmt as a defense mechanism against pathogens. This study sheds light on the critical role of neuronal-bacterial communication in safeguarding animals from pathogenic infections.
